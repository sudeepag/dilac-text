                        And spread into a grove, where you may sit

                        You gain no honor, though our ruins lie

            PREFACE.
            POOR La Fontaine! Racine took him one evening during Holy Week to church. "Le bon homme," as his friends called him, was not at all
               learned, nor was religion, in the old sense of the word, one of his prominent
               characteristics; therefore he grew horribly weary with the length of the
               services.
            To occupy him, Racine gave him a Bible which contained the Minor Prophets. La
               Fontaine opened it at the prayer of the Jews in Baruch. Struck with the sublime
               fulness of this grand diapason of supplication, he could not control his surprise and
               delight, and commenced elbowing Racine restlessly.
            "O my friend," he whispered, eagerly, "what a fine genius this Baruch had! But tell
               me, who was he?"
            And for some time after he was so full of Baruch that every friend he met in the
               streets of Paris was greeted with the question, "Avez-vous lu
                  Baruch? Ah, c' était par ma foi un beau génie."
            Poor great La Fontaine!
            I have often thought during my journey in Southern ern Italy of "Avez-vous lu
                  Baruch?" when expressing my sincere enthusiasm. And while relating with
               innocent delight all this which was new to me in "Les Petites
                  Prophètes" (the Minor Prophets) of the grand Bible of Art and History, I
               have been probably like le bon homme La
               Fontaine.
            Many of my readers may have known these Minor Prophets of art their whole lifetime,
               may be familiar with every word of beauty they have uttered through countless
               ages,—words which have served as texts of inspiration for great poets from the time
               of that "golden world" where 
                  
                     "The holy laws of homely pastoral,
                     And flowers, and founts, and nymphs, and semi-gods,
                     And all the Graces, found their old abodes,"
                  
                up through passionate passages of perilous human contests and gorgeous mediæval
               splendors, on to this nineteenth century where men are driving out 
                  "From clouds of steam majestical white horses,"
                making true the prophetic words of Baruch, that wise "old man of noble
               extraction and learned in the law,"—"Bringing down every high mountain, and the
               everlasting rocks, and filling up the valleys to make them even with the ground." But
               the Bible of the Beautiful is ever young and ever new, and the earnest, unaffected
               admiration of those to whom this Bible has been opened for the first time has its own
               peculiar charm; therefore, though my readers may be more learned, they must show as
               much good-natured patience as did the cleverer friends of the great French humorist,
               to my reiterated exclamation, "Avez-vous lu Baruch? Ah, c'
                  était par ma foi un beau génie."
            Then there is a kinder view which can be taken of these pages, for, as Bold Fletcher
               said to his audience,— 
                  
                     "We would fain please ye, and as fain be pleased;
                     'T is but a little liking, both are eased."
                  
               
            
            There are seasons of quiet that come in the midst of great trials, rare and short to
               be sure, but precious. All outside interferences seem to arrange themselves, and
               social tangles unweave their knots most graciously, as if to lend us a short rest and
               peace,—it may be to give strength for future trouble,—fresh discipline,—Mother Nature
               holding the soul back, as it were, with tender solicitude and pensive prevision on
               the edge of a moral winter.
            During such a season were these pages written, and the pleasure of writing them under
               the influence of that sweet lull added greatly to the diversion of sad thoughts.
               Therefore, as they have performed such a gentle office to me, I would not have them
               ungently judged.
            And now as I gather these journal leaves together, and think of that pleasant period,
               I name them, and that part of my life, after the sweet autumn season of the year
               which they resemble,—

               "WE."
               
                  VEVAY, Hotel des Trois Couronnes, 11th January, 185-.
               
               WE never do anything for the last time consciously without sadness, some one has
                  said; and I am feeling a sort of tender mournfulness as I write the above heading
                  in my new journal.
               "Vevay, Hotel des Trois Couronnes," is put here for the last time,—and the first,
                  too, in this fresh book; the last time, at all events, for many years, for
                  to-morrow we commence our journey into Italy, and to accomplish our pleasant plan
                  of delightful travel and leisurely study there will keep us from revisiting Suisse
                  for a long while.
               I talk of "We" as naturally as if this "we" was the same which was meant on the
                  first pages of the large, closely-written volume I packed to-day in the box which
                  is to be sent to America,—that book which contains the sorrowful record of five
                  gloomy years. A lustrum, as those old Romans
                  used to say,—and indeed, it has been a period of purifying and light-giving; so
                  much light and clearness of mental vision, that I sit sometimes and grow weary over the thought that, with such light
                  at the beginning, I might have made straight much that was hopelessly crooked and
                  wilful. What use, however, in such a thought? 
                     
                        "We can but fill the hour with its best deed,
                        The knowledge which the tardy morrow brings
                        Impeaches not the wisdom of the act,
                        It came too late to guide."
                     
                  
               
               And now back again to my starting-point of "We." First, however, let me notice
                  that Rhone valley, and the Lake, the clear starlit sky, and the beautiful terraced
                  garden beneath my window, which looks like some chateau pleasure grounds of the
                  gay French days of Watteau. Yes, they are all very beautiful, and the memory of
                  them will be delightful; but, according to the opinion of the German lad across
                  the street, at the Pharmacie Mayor, the memory will also be sad.
               "Ah, Madame," he said to me this afternoon, as I was buying some cologne of him,
                  "you will long heart-achingly for these Alps. You may think you can leave them as
                  you do other beautiful countries,—but you cannot, Madame. Once live among
                  mountains and they become like kindred,—and when you go away the Heimweh, or home-sickness, is sure to cling to you as
                  well as to the native-born Suisse."
               How strange these Germans are! There is such a deal of dreamy sentimentality about
                  them, which consorts drolly, like some curious marriages, with their sharp, keen
                  eye to the main chance. This young German looked pensive and sighed most
                  touchingly; but he did not forget to charge me outrageously for the cologne,
                  notwithstanding he could talk so tenderly about the Alpine Heimweh. But the Irishman is forgiven for his wit, therefore let the
                  German's droll romance stand him also in good stead.
               Down in the garden I see Janet walking up and down the short slab of stone which
                  forms the landing-place of the broad flight of terrace steps leading to the lake.
                  She is enjoying the loveliness of the night, which is cold, still, and beautiful,
                  and doubtless thinking of the approaching departure—separation to her—a little
                  solemnly. She leans on the stone parapet, gazing clear off into the dim distance.
                  Like Thekla, over that glorious young Max's grave, she may be murmuring, 
                     
                        "There where he lies buried
                        Is now the whole earth to me!"
                     
                  
               
               The eye cannot in this dark night trace around the beautiful indentations of the
                  lake shore, nor could it from this window or that terrace see the enchanting spot
                  where lies Janet's "whole earth."
               Under the shadow of that beautiful old Montreux church is a grave containing two
                  human beings. One, whose life had only a breath, a look, a sigh, and then back
                  again to its native heaven. Another, who lived honorable years, loved, served his
                  kindred nobly, received priceless love in return, lay down to die in the midst of
                  life's best gifts, and is now mourned with a silent unending grief, "too deep for
                  tears."
               It is a lovely resting-place, that old graveyard. The picturesque church hangs
                  suspended, as it were, from the mountain's side; its fine spire, with ogive
                  piercings, draped with clambering ivy, points upward, and at sunset this stone
                  finger of Hope throws down its protecting, assuring shadow directly over the
                  earth-bed in which lie Janet's best memories.
               
               I stood by it alone yesterday at sundown, and wished I could have Janet beside me
                  to show her how peaceful and happy the place looked; and this afternoon, when she
                  walked off there to make, as I knew, her last pilgrimage to that dear spot, I
                  prayed that the same soft shadow might rest just as lovingly as it seemed to my
                  eyes, and bring down into her heart the same quiet, soothing thoughts it had to
                  mine.
               Music fills the air. Venitia is condescending to use the hotel piano. Her own
                  Erard full-grand has been packed up for a day or so, in order to be sent round by
                  Marseilles and down the Mediterranean to our new home in Parthenope,—as she, with
                  pretty poetic pedantry, calls our intended abiding-place Naples, Neapolis,—for to
                  us it will be new.
               She is capricious to-night, and is playing only broken bits and passages, nothing
                  continuous. Like us she is feeling the breaking-up and departure, but not as we,
                  nor for the same cause; for she has no past, has had no awakening, and is at that
                  happy age when she feels only the inconveniences of the present, and is free from
                  those sorrowful memories which might make her dread a future, or any change, no
                  matter how hopeful and bright it might look.
               And yet her trust in this unknown future is a blind, unconscious feeling, not that
                  trust which arises from wisdom; for though Venitia has much knowledge, she has but
                  little wisdom. 
                     "Knowledge is of things we see,"
                   but true wisdom is faith,—a faith more than a believing, for belief is a work
                  of reason, faith a result of love,—a trust in that which we do not see. But, after
                  all, it is only through many losses that this diviner wisdom comes; and it is the
                  possession of this that makes Janet so much calmer than either of us; she has a
                  true tranquillizing faith and trust in the unknown Future of this life.
               "It soon becomes the Present," she says; "and if it be a present of sorrow and
                  suffering, they, being human, after a season, pass away even from the memory; but
                  if it shall be a sweet present of joy and happiness, they, being divine, remain
                  forever. There is a lethean stream, my friend, flowing through our being, which,
                  in time, quiets all murmurs, stills all unrest, and even throws a soft mist over
                  the memory of past joys to prevent the disturbing effect of regret."
               But now back again to "we." Who and what are "we?" For I make it a rule always, in
                  commencing a new journal, to describe my social surroundings, if at all differing
                  from those which were with me at the beginning of the previous one. As my memory
                  sweeps back, endeavoring to contrast this present with that past, it
                  flaps a wearied wing, so wide and broad is the gulf of difference stretching out
                  appallingly into a mare tenebrosum of hopeless
                  separation from that past.!
               Enough of my individual self. My journal does not need that text dwelt on at the
                  beginning. It is a sermon which all these pages are to hold and develop. Let me
                  talk of those social domestic surroundings which, to a woman most especially, make
                  her real "we"—her daily, hourly associates—of Janet and Venitia; for they are
                  mine,—my "we."
               These names did not touch the pages of the other journal during all its first
                  three gloomy years. These two human beings, who are now so much to me,—one, Janet especially,—I did not know even the
                  existence of; and should that other journal be lost during its long voyage "home,"
                  those who love me and who love to read these pages would be in a state of
                  perplexity and wonder, while reading this one, who my new friends could be.
               They are two sisters. A couple of years ago, when I came to this old Europe to
                  seek, if not a grave for my body, one at least for my dead hopes, which lay in
                  most unseemly state unburied, I met these two women under most pleasing social
                  circumstances. Chance threw us much together; our tastes and pursuits we found to
                  be alike. We were all three comparatively alone, not only in Europe, but in life,
                  with only passing acquaintances which are most often to travellers like us but
                  bits of straw hanging to the fringe of a garment, easily caught and as easily
                  shaken off.
               A severe illness of Venitia enabled me to be of service to Janet, and I grew
                  deeply attached to her; we united with each other, made one home together, and
                  without vow, or engagement, or troth-plight, only a loving look of need for each
                  other's presence daily, I think we shall spend our future of this life
                  together.
               Janet is a widow, about my own age, or a little older. She is neither handsome nor
                  homely, but has those nameless charms, those indescribable attractions, which are
                  the only ones that can hold love after beauty of form and feature and intellect
                  have grown familiar to us. She has also— 
                     
                        "A calm unfaltering voice, and the grace
                        That comes with the knowledge of life."
                     
                  
               
               She is a thoroughly educated woman. I do not mean by this her skill in Latin and
                  Greek, nor her cleverness in positive sciences and mathematics, all of which she
                  possesses sesses, but I mean that her soul is so fully developed,—drawn out,—that
                  it seems to my mortal comprehension complete. She has a fine, highly cultured
                  intellect, it is true, but, better than all, a judgment so clear that it is almost
                  inspiration, and a pure, well-balanced character, every fibre firm and strong.
               Janet is an American by birth and feeling, although the most of her life has been
                  spent in Europe. Her father was for many years consul at some southern European
                  port. The effect produced on Americans, particularly on some characters, by living
                  in Europe any length of time, is very unsettling. Artificial habits are acquired,
                  views of society and life, totally at variance with those entertained at home, are
                  insensibly taken up, and this proved to be the case with Mr. Howard, Janet's
                  father. After losing his consulship he never returned to America, but went into a
                  foreign banking-house, and remained the rest of his life abroad. For some reason
                  or other he changed his abode many times, and they seem never to have had a
                  settled or comfortable home. Janet has only visited America once since her
                  childhood, and that was when she first grew up, just before the death of her
                  mother, at which time she spent a few months with her kinsfolk in the United
                  States, but returned to Europe to take charge of her young brothers and sisters,
                  after the news of that saddest of all sad losses, her mother's death, reached
                  her.
               She is strongly attached to, and quickly drawn towards, that which she considers
                  American. Of course, never having lived in her birthplace, she is more governed in
                  her opinions and feelings by the views which she has taken at a distance, of our
                  truly interesting government and its romantic success, than by actual experience.
                     She has known intimately distinguished
                  Europeans who have regarded the United States as the Utopia of their dreams. In
                  her girlhood she often made one in the charming circle which gathered at La Grange
                  around "that hero of two worlds," Lafayette, a delightful atmosphere which
                  developed, if not created, artists and political dreamers.
               After Janet became a woman, she knew De Tocqueville, and, later, Ampère, and
                  certainly can theorize about the American States as patriotically, poetically, and
                  with as much enthusiasm as the best dreaming philosopher of them all.
               Her early life was one of bitter sorrow. Wrong, injustice, disgrace, every biting
                  drop that could be distilled in the alembic of grief, fell on her young heart.
                  After she had passed her early womanhood, without ever thinking of love or its
                  sweet comforts, this great joy of life came to her. Here, on this beautiful lake
                  shore, while striving to eke out a slender income, educate her young sister and
                  some orphan nieces, and nurse a dying, brokenhearted widowed sister, she met with
                  Paul Dale, a prosperous, cultured Englishman. She has told me, by short bits from
                  time to time, her story, for Janet is not one who talks much of that which touches
                  her feelings most: but her short, rapid utterance is very touching, of—
               "How strange it should have seemed, and yet it did not, for Paul and me to love
                  each other. I had no faith in mortal man left, and he came to teach me, by his own
                  truth and excellence, perfect faith."
               Paul Dale must have been a man worthy of love. He gathered up the whole family and
                  his Janet most tenderly to his heart; he took them to his beautiful English home;
                  used his delightful wealth generously, made life pleasant to the dying widowed
                  sister and her children; soothed Janet, and when her heart ached with the sorrow
                  caused by the deaths of the darlings for whom she had labored so courageously for
                  years, he filled the goblet of life to overflowing with his own rich purple love,
                  and pressed it tenderly to her lips. She dared not grieve, even when their only
                  child, the boy for whose birth Paul had wished so earnestly, breathed one short
                  breath and then died.
               "O no," she has said to me, "I never uttered a murmur, for had I not Paul? And so
                  long as death, which seemed then to be my only pursuing sorrow, did not touch him,
                  I could not mourn."
               At last, of her whole large family there were only two left,—Janet and
                  Venitia,—the oldest and youngest! All had died just when prosperity came, and they
                  could so well have enjoyed life together. Paul adopted Venitia, of whom he was
                  very fond, and directed her education with as much care as taste. The girl early
                  showed remarkable musical ability. To give her every advantage in her musical
                  studies, he left England and resided in Germany for a while.
               Then came death again; and this time it took Paul, and with it Janet's best part
                  of life. She brought him here, and laid him down under the shadow of that old
                  church spire, where their baby boy was sleeping his little slumber, and where she
                  also hopes to lie some day, "God willing," she says, with a soft submission most
                  touching in one so self-sufficing and firm.
               And now a few words about Venitia,—then I must clasp my journal and go to bed, as
                  it is past midnight. The beautiful girl has just been in to say good night and
                  give me one of her caresses, which are so different from Janet's, though much more
                  profuse. Janet's touch my heart,
                  Venitia's only my body; and yet we both love each other dearly. Let me describe
                  her as she looked, standing by my window a few moments since, gazing out on the
                  night and the lake, and talking of Italy and our journey with all the keen fresh
                  taste for novelty which youth gives.
               Venitia, whose rather fanciful name was given her from her birthplace, Venice, is
                  really a beautiful woman. Her figure has the majesty of an empress and the grace
                  of a nymph, which give her that double charm of infantile innocence and womanly
                  reserve. Her height is full, her development fine; large, well-formed limbs,
                  statue-like in their mould. She has a well-shaped, well-poised head, with a great
                  wealth of waving hair, a rich brown in its hue. Her fine brow expresses capability
                  of thought as her eyes do of feeling, and these eyes are the glory of her
                  face.
               The arch of the brow is a little prominent, and gives her a stern expression; the
                  setting and shape of the eye and whole facial outline is Greek; but the full face,
                  owing to the firm brow, is not so flat as the Greek form, and therefore not so
                  insipid. Her eyes are large, their expression, and that of the mouth, as imperious
                  as those of a Juno. Indeed, she has often been likened to the Juno in the Villa
                  Ludovisi at Rome, a profile engraving of which I have had framed, and christened
                  it playfully "Venitia." There is the same mouth line, the same liquid reflective
                  eyeball and resolute curve of the brow and lip, the firm, high-arched lines,
                  indicative of strong will, contending with the soft flowing ones of
                  loveliness.
               The color of the eyes is a tender poetic gray, which deepens to an intense black
                  in earnest moments from the enlarging of the pupil, and there is an expression in
                  them sometimes that amounts almost to inspiration; but the fire is too redundant,
                  too intrepid, and at times there is a sombre mysterious look in them which tells
                  of distant thunder and far-off lightning; they need toning down, with some great
                  emotion that shall shake her being to its very centre.
               Her mouth, that feature which tells so much of one's character and culture, is
                  faultless. Some one has well said, that all the features of the human face are
                  made for us but our mouths; these we make for ourselves. Venitia's is full of
                  expression; the rich hued lips are as quivering and trembling as "shadowy water
                  with a sweet south wind breathing over it"; and the curves are those soft,
                  delicate ones, which only culture and the early discipline of refinement can give;
                  but there is that same imperious line triumphant, which hardens her whole face,
                  and which must be the one that makes the striking resemblance to the Juno; for I
                  have seen a simple fragment of a female head on a mutilated gem pronounced to be
                  that of the haughty queen of the gods, simply from this imperious mouth line.
               A pallor which the Italians call morbidezza is
                  the hue of her skin, golden and transparent in its high lights like ivory. Titian
                  knew and felt to the very tingling point of his fingers the rich loveliness of
                  such flesh.
               Does this description sound exaggerated? To me it seems tame; for words can
                  scarcely give the effect produced on me by such beauty as Venitia's. I lie on the
                  lounge sometimes and watch her with half-closed eyes, as I would a picture or
                  statue, her graceful motions, every attitude an unconscious pose of
                  statue-like beauty, and think of luscious fruit, delightful sounds, warm coloring,
                  and great sculptors' creations. Why, to paint Venitia, a Raphael and Titian should unite; for she has the
                  pure beauty of a Madonna, combined with the rich full size and attraction of a
                  Magdalen.
               She has all the organization of an artist, too,—quick perceptions, keen
                  enjoyments, is sympathetic, and to a certain point creative; but, with all this
                  beauty of mind and mould, there is a mysterious, veiled, inexplicable something
                  about her, which keeps her from developing completely; she is by some enchantment
                  locked up from herself and from others.
               Venitia's life melody is not only yet unwritten, but even unprefigured; here is
                  the fine human instrument with its rich assemblage of strings and keys; preluding
                  chords, too, are heard full of promising beauty, but the life-theme is not hinted
                  at. To some women this theme never comes; the whole human existence is but a
                  gentle soft preluding; and others even have preludes full of complicated
                  harmonies, sounding like intricate themes, but the life pieces end as mere
                  voluntaries, nothing more, and so it may be with our Venitia.
               "We are very proud of her. She gives us no cause for uneasiness or discomfort.
                  There is none of the restlessness and caprice about her which might be pardoned in
                  one so gifted and charming. She is pure and sparkling, too, like a first-water
                  diamond,—yes, that is just it,—for she is almost as hard.
            
            
               MIDNIGHT ON MONT CENIS.
               WE left Vevay last Thursday for Geneva. On board the lake steamer Rhone, we met a
                  Milanese whose conversation amused us; she was not young,—about mid-age; not at
                  all pretty, but had an intelligent face. Some chance accident introduced us, a
                  courtesy, I think, such as the offer of a seat or something of the like. She
                  talked rapidly, freely, and well; described Milan, Genoa, and Turin with graphic
                  distinctness; drew a rapid sketch of Italian literature, and touched on Italian
                  politics with a forked tongue.
               We talked of books over Heine's "Lutèce," which I was reading, and a novel of De
                  Balzac she held in her hands. She spoke contemptuously of French authors, was well
                  read in English literature,—as cultivated Italians are apt to be,—and said she
                  "adored the classic writers of England," as she called the poets and dramatists of
                  the Elizabethan day. When we approached Geneva we all leaned over the guards of
                  the boat together.
               "Look!" she cried, "at the ugly place. It is a great phalanstery town; but that is
                  the spirit of the day,—so no wonder. In the last age this community idea was
                  dreamed of by philosophers; in this nineteenth century the people carry it into
                  execution. The philosophers meant it for the improvement of the mind and
                     condition of the poor; the people of
                  this day use it to give to themselves the luxuries of the old noblesse,—the temporal sensual ones,—and ragged
                  half-price business they make of it, with their mammoth hotels and
                  community-cafés, their woven cotton lace, and their thin coatings of silver and
                  gold."
               Her lips curled scornfully, she drew in her sharp pointed chin and threw back her
                  head with a haughty, resentful air, as she added, in low hissing words with
                  half-closed lips, as Italians speak when at white-heat rage,—
               "Ah, the influence of the South is over! No more beauty, no more poesy in life.
                  The reign of the cold, rigid North is supreme, with its chemins de fer (railways), its fils de
                     fer (telegraphs), and all other choses de
                     fer" (iron things).
               Then she muttered from Dante's Inferno this passage: 
                     
                        "Lo 'mperador del doloroso regno
                        Da mezzo 'l petto uscia fuor della ghiaccia."
                     
                     
                        "That Emperor who sways
                        The realm of sorrow, at mid breast from the ice."*
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  *Cary's Dante; Inferno, Canto
                     XXXIV.
               
               I have no doubt she felt full of gall and bitterness as she thought how prone to
                  earth lay her beloved Italy under this detested rule of the Teuton.
               Venitia, with graceful kindness said to her: "Beautiful Italy, seated in your
                  loveliness on the earth, like poor uncrowned Constance! 
                     
                        'Here I in sorrow sit;
                        Here is my throne, bid kings come bow to it.'"
                     
                  
               
               The Italian turned sharply, with tears actually glittering in her keen black eyes,
                  and looked at the lovely girl as if she adored her. The boat touched the pier and
                  knocked all to bits the nice little scene, while in the hurry of landing, porters'
                  bustle, the noise of luggage, and all the other busy attendants of going on shore,
                  we lost sight of our chance acquaintance.
               After securing the coupé in the diligence, and
                  setting a commissionaire, or errand-porter, to work about the passports, we took a
                  farewell look at the "phalanstery town," as our boat friend had called it. We went
                  to the head of the city, to our favorite spot, Place St.
                     Antoine, to give a good-by gaze to the beautiful view on which we had
                  looked so often that it had become a possession of memory.
               The Savoy Alps stretched out snowy fortifications between us and that wondrous
                  ice-bed, above which towers the "monarch of mountains," Mont Blanc. Deut D'Oche,
                  our old Alpine neighbor, seemed to peep familiarly over the Chablais at us, to
                  tell us "God speed." To the northeast there was the Mole, with its solitary peak,
                  and the Voirons, seated like matrons in the midst of their forests; while to the
                  right, Mont Buet, with its snowy dome, and the dark rocky outworks of the Grenier,
                  summoned us onwards.
               At half-past four we returned to the hotel and dined, then went to the Diligence
                  Bureau, received our passport, and were soon snugly packed away in the coupé. The journey from Geneva to Chambèry was the
                  coldest part of the route. We left Geneva at six in the evening, and reached
                  Chambèry at six the next morning, where we staid till midday. At one o'clock in
                  the afternoon we were again on the road. The diligence was lifted upon the rails,
                  and we flew along quite swiftly up to St. Jean, which we reached at nightfall;
                  there we took horses again and commenced the mountain passage.
               
               The passage of Mont Cenis is the least interesting in a picturesque sort of view
                  of all the Alpine entrances into Italy; but it is a superb road, and is as safe
                  and comfortable in mid-winter as an ordinary journey away from the Alps. It is
                  considered a masterpiece of engineering, its ascent and descent are so gradual and
                  secure. Fabbroni, the great engineer, gave seven years' study, thought, and labor,
                  and France over a million of dollars, to accomplish it.
               The first Charlemagne crossed Mont Cenis with his army, when it was a true feat to
                  make the passage, for it had to be done on foot and in litters. The road remained
                  impassable for diligence as late as 1800. Then came the second Charlemagne, who
                  wished to go into Italy over mountains as high as his ambition, but he was not of
                  the race of those 
                     "First men who led black horses by the mane";
                   nor was he of this third race, of which his nephew is a type,—who merits,
                  better than his uncle, Carlyle's title "Hero of Tools,"—who is now driving out
                  over these Alps,— 
                     "From the cloud of steam majestical white horses."
                   He, the second Charlemagne, the great Napoleon, commanded this fine road, and
                  a greater miracle it was then than the tunnel can be now. We talked of the history
                  of this celebrated road, and the great change the tunnelling of the Alps shall
                  make in a few years. The idea sounds more poetical than the journey then shall be,
                  for the tunnel will alter materially this midnight pass which has its own peculiar
                  charm.
               The peal of a bell across the midnight air—the Angelus gelus bell of the
                  Hospice—turned the conversation to the Benedictines who live on Mont Cenis. We
                  went back to the great St. Benedict, whose famous Holy Rule was said to contain
                  the maxims of perfect government; that system which Cosmo di Medici, and all those
                  great rulers of men, studied reverentially. Those Benedictines, his followers,
                  were great people at every period of their history, either as sturdy
                  forest-clearers, tillers of the soil, or scholarly gentlemen copying with clerkly
                  skill, and protecting, with cultured reverence, the treasures of Greek and Latin
                  poesy.
               Guizot says of them, "The monks of St. Benedict were the great land-clearers of
                  Europe"; and Mignet calls them, "Those great republics of agricultural and
                  literary industry of the Order of St. Benedict."
               "Scienter nesciens, et sapienter indoctus,
                  (learnedly ignorant and wisely learned,) St. Gregory, his biographer, called this
                  wonderful man," said Janet; "and these Benedictines on Mont Cenis are living quite
                  in accordance with their holy founder's rule, but that cannot be said of every
                  Benedictine order; they have fallen many times sadly away from his rigid
                  self-denying practice. Why, to become a member of the very community St. Benedict
                  established at Monte Casino, near the frontier or line between the Roman States
                  and Naples, the applicant has to be not only a person of high birth, but also of
                  independent fortune. At one time the Abbot of Monte Casino held the rank of Baron
                  of the kingdom, and drove his coach and six." 
                     
                        "So soft is flesh of mortals, that on earth
                        A good beginning doth no longer last
                        Than while an oak may bring its fruit to birth,"*
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     *Cary's Dante, Paradise, Canto XXII.
                  
                   I quoted. "But you must remember, Janet,
                  even in their days of backsliding the gentlemen of that convent were not idle men.
                  To them you lovers of the classics are indebted for a great deal that you now
                  enjoy. That very monastery of Monte Casino was a sanctuary for Greek and Latin
                  treasures which otherwise would have been lost. You would never have had even
                  those six Fasti of Ovid which you prize so highly,
                  nor the great Englishman Fox, his beloved Idylls of Theocritus, but for these
                  scholarly Benedictines of Monte Casino."
               We dwelt on the life of the great founder of the Order, of whom Montalembert says,
                  "At a season of universal desolation and gloom, when the whole world was steeped
                  in heresy, schism, and divisions, a solitary monk created a centre of supernatural
                  virtue, and illuminated it with a splendor which shone during ten ages over
                  regenerated Europe."*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *

               The beautiful love which existed between St Benedict and his sister St.
                  Scholastica, and the touching story told by St. Gregory of their last interview,
                  interested Venitia deeply. St. Scholastica's convent was five miles distant from
                  Monte Casino, and once a year she always visited her brother. He would not let her
                  visit the monastery, but went out to meet her at a place appointed, and there they
                  passed the day in sweet talk on their mutual faith and great hope.
               When she knew she was dying she made her people carry her to the place of meeting,
                  and her brother came to her. The day seemed short to the dying woman; and as the
                  setting sun sank behind the beautiful hills, she clung with mortal yearning to her
                  dearly loved brother, whose blessed words of comfort during the day had given her
                  so much healing strength. She besought him to stay until morning with her, and
                  talk again to her of the happiness of that other life which lay beyond the dread,
                  dark sea of anguish, called Death,—that sea which she was so soon to cross
                  alone.
               But the rule of his Order, established by himself, forbade a monk to pass the
                  night away from his monastery. He knew it was his beloved sister's last request,
                  but he steadfastly, though sorrowfully, refused.
               Then the poor, expiring woman, seeing her entreaties were in vain, lay her
                  trembling hands on a table, rested her face in them, weeping bitterly, and
                  besought Almighty God to interpose in her behalf. Straightway the heavens seemed
                  opened, and there came pouring down such a flood of rain with fierce thunder and
                  sharp lightning, that no man or beast dare venture out in it.
               "God forgive you, sister!" said St. Benedict. "What have you done?"
               "I asked a favor of you," she replied, with reproachful tenderness, "and you
                  refused me. I asked it of God, and he has granted it to me."
               All night long the holy brother and sister held solemn vigil together, and his
                  strong words became as an armor of might to the feeble woman whose soul and body
                  were having their last great battle. At dawn they parted, not in tears, but with
                  faces that shone like angels; and as St. Benedict kissed his sister, she
                  said,—
               "My brother, the parting will not be long. We shall soon meet again."
               Three days after, she breathed her last breath in great mortal anguish, but in
                  holy peace of spirit; and her sorrowing brother, who was praying at the time in
                  his tower at Monte Casino, believed he saw her pure soul ascend to heaven in the
                  form of a dove.
               
               Only a few weeks passed and it was as St. Scholastica had said; the parting was
                  not long, for the monks of Monte Casino were mourning their great founder's
                  death.
               Brother and sister sleep together under the magnificent high altar, rich in
                  precious marbles, of the superb Church of Monte Casino; and the tender beauty of
                  their love steals gently down through thirteen centuries with a light as pure as
                  their great virtue.
               "Ah yes," said Janet, as I finished this sweet old story; "and St. Gregory, their
                  biographer, gives a beautiful reason for the granting of St. Scholastica's prayer,
                     Justo valde judicio illa plus potuit quœ amplius
                     amavit,—'By a just judgment, indeed, she who was the more loving was
                  the more powerful.'"
               "Was St. Bernard, the stern judge of poor Abelard, a Benedictine?" asked
                  Venitia.
               "The great Abbot of Clairvaux," I answered, "belonged to a reformed Benedictine
                  order, the Cistercians, but his followers were sometimes called Bernardins. He
                  lived six hundred years after St. Benedict. St. Benedict's period was 480 to 543;
                  while the apostle of the ill-fated Second Crusade, St. Bernard, flourished from
                  1091 to 1153."
               "St. Bernard's period," said Janet, "was also famous for many new religious
                  orders. The mendicant friars sprang up then. St. Dominic, and St. Francis of
                  Assissium, the founders of the Dominican and Franciscan brotherhoods, were
                  contemporaries of the all-powerful St. Bernard."
               "Lord Lindsay, in his Christian Art," I remarked, "says that during this period,
                  extending from St. Benedict's death up even so far as 1400, Christianity found its
                  chief expression in architecture; the spirit of Faith, reigning supreme, gave
                  utterance to its grandest voice, its symphonies in stone."*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *Lord Lindsay's Christian Art, Letter I. Vol. II.
               
               We talked all night, and Janet told us of quite an exciting adventure she once had
                  when crossing this same Mont Cenis with Venitia and a young brother, when they
                  were children.
            
            
               
               JANET'S STORY.
               LATE one afternoon in January, about fifteen years ago, said Janet, "I received a
                  letter telling me of my sister Mary's dangerous illness. I was at Geneva and she
                  at Turin. The letter was from her physician; it bade me come immediately; even
                  then I might not find her alive.
               "I had the two youngest children with me,—my poor little brother Ernst, a child of
                  seven, and Venitia, who was not more than five; they could not be left in Geneva,
                  for I knew no one there to trust them with, therefore they had to go with me. I
                  had only just time to hurry down to the Diligence Bureau to see what seats I could
                  get. Of course, I found the coupé engaged; for
                  when one is in a disagreeable position, the difficulties that spring up on all
                  sides can be named Legion. There were only two seats to be had in the whole
                  diligence, and they were in the interior.
               "I could not help hesitating, used as I was to facing disagreeable things; for it
                  is so unpleasant for a woman to travel alone in such a place. But what alternative
                  had I? 'Go,' said Courage, 'and trust to the children for protection.'
               "The diligence was being arranged while I stood in the office talking about the
                  seats with the courteous clerk, who very good naturedly sympathized with my
                  annoyance; in fifteen minutes the coach would start. My hesitation was ended by
                  the arrival of the commissionaire whom I had employed to have my passport visèd by the Sardinian consul. I lost no more time,
                  paid for the seats, lifted the children into the interior, and followed them; it
                  was soon crowded with men. All nations seemed to be represented, and, until
                  midnight, their conversation was very animated,—a perfect Babel of tongues.
               "On entering the diligence I put Ernst in the corner, taking the seat next him,
                  holding Venitia on my lap. My next neighbor was a German, and soon he showed a
                  disposition to be friendly. At the Sardinian frontier he handed out my passport
                  officiously, as if I belonged to him; offered repeatedly to relieve me of my
                  child, and evidently desired to make himself agreeable, but, in such a manner as
                  to cause all the hedgehog in my nature to put out its quills; besides, at that
                  time I had so much trouble that there was, as is apt to be with energetic women
                  under such influences, more harshness about me than anything else,—it was just at
                  'the darkest hour before day' in my life.
               "I was no longer in my first youth, and it would have been quite a figure of
                  speech to have called me pretty; nevertheless I found I was more attractive to my
                  German neighbor than was pleasant. He sat very near, saying once in a while, with
                  vulgar familiarity, in German, 'Nahe zusammen sitzen macht gute Gesellschaft.'*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *"Close sitting makes good company."
               
               "Such a night as I passed! But the interior being crowded was some little
                  protection. Pressing Venitia close to my breast, whilst Ernst slept soundly,
                     leaning against me, I turned a deaf
                  ear to the impertinent remarks of the German. At last he also slept, and had the
                  insolence to rest his head on my shoulder. I had anticipated some such proceeding
                  from his manner, and accordingly had put a few pins there, points outward; he
                  quickly raised his head, muttering angrily, 'Vermaledeites Weib.'*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *"Confound the woman!"
               
               "I was too alarmed to laugh, I assure you; moreover my heart was too full of
                  apprehension for dear Mary; she might at that moment be dead! Memories of our
                  youth swept up before me. Hours of joy and hours of sorrow we had had together;
                  for we were the eldest of that large family, and very near of an age. Then she was
                  my only counsellor and friend in the bringing up of the whole little flock; and
                  though her health had been failing for some time, and she was almost a penniless
                  widow with two little girls of her own, adding to, as she would mournfully say,
                  instead of relieving the family burden; still she was of great value to me in
                  many, many ways,—most of all to a woman in trouble, she was one, near my own age,
                  who could love and be loved. The other children were my charges and
                  responsibilities: she was my only earthly luxury and consolation.
               "Be merciful, O God!" I inwardly groaned, resting my burning, dry, aching eyes on
                  Venitia's soft curls; for she, like my little brother, was sleeping soundly that
                  blessed child-sleep 'that the thunder cannot break.' Looking at them I envied
                  their unconsciousness of danger, their freedom from apprehensions and care, their
                  sweet trust and faith in me as the living present providence of a mother, which is
                  'the heaven that hangs around' a child.
               "Mary and I had once been young and tolerably happy; more cared for in the way of
                  luxury than they, but not more loved. Now what were we? Solitary wrecks on life's
                  sandy shore. If God's angel of death had come then, and shielded us all three with
                  his dark wing, very sweet would have been the sleep to me! But still I ejaculated
                  'Be merciful, O God!' and the prayer for Mary's life went on.
               "Towards morning the diligence rumbled into Chambèry. The first thing that struck
                  my eyes when I looked from the window in the dim morning light was that large
                  monumental fountain you were so struck with to-day, ornamented with huge elephants
                  standing in the middle of the street. Some day we must go over together the
                  history of General de Boigne, his eventful life in India, his romantic but unhappy
                  marriage with Madame Récamier's friend, and his return to his native town far up
                  in the Sardinian Alps, where he sought consolation for his disappointed domestic
                  hopes in charities. After his death his grateful townsmen raised this curious and
                  costly fountain to his memory, and gave his name to the street in the centre of
                  which the fountain stands.
               "We drove through Rue de Boigne to the bureau. When the diligence stopped I roused
                  the sleeping children, pushing aside hastily my offensive German neighbor, who,
                  notwithstanding his experience of pin-points, was ready with disgusting freedom to
                  assist me. Two or three of the men talked with him of me, as I handed out the
                  children to the guard. I took occasion to address the children in English, which
                  we seldom used; for French, as the language of the country we lived in, was
                  easier; but I did so, because the best protection to a lone woman on the European
                  continent is our good, brave Anglo-Saxon
                  tongue; the woman who speaks it as if born to it is supposed to know how to do, to
                  be, and to suffer,—and most especially not to suffer any impertinence. Their
                  conversation was in German.
               "'Engländerin,' said one.
               "'Nein,' replied my meddling neighbor, 'nein, sie sprecht nicht wie eine
                     Engländerin.'*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *"An Englishwoman."—"No, she does not speak like an English-woman."
               
               "Another suggested 'Russian,' for cultivated Russians speak, as Berlioz drolly
                  says, 'all known and unknown tongues' with the greatest facility, almost without
                  accent; they speak English too, in the monotone manner of Americans, quite free
                  from British emphasis.
               "Taking the children by the hand I went into the diligence office to secure the
                     coupé if possible for the rest of the
                  journey, but to my dismay found it engaged all the way through to Turin. The
                  morning sun shot a little bright ray through the office window and seemed to give
                  me fresh courage. One rarely feels timid in broad daylight. After inquiring the
                  time of starting, finding I had seven or eight hours for rest, I went to the
                  hotel.
               "A pleasant chambermaid gave me a nice room and brought us a good breakfast. I
                  undressed the children, bathed them, and put them to bed, where they soon fell
                  into a sound sleep. I did the same for myself, but it was in vain that I tried to
                  sleep. My uneasiness about Mary tortured me; the painful tension of my nerves
                  during the night caused them to throb fiercely. I crept quietly out of bed and
                  dressed myself. Ernst opened his full brown eyes on me, as I stooped down by the
                  bedside to get my walking boots.
               "'Dear child,' I said, as the affectionate little fellow held up his arms to clasp
                  around my neck, 'Jennie is feverish and needs air. Ernst will take good care of
                  his little sister, will he not, while Jennie is out?'
               "The self-sacrificing child assented with a bright smile, and whispered good by. I
                  hurried out of the hotel. I wished to see something of this town in which De
                  Maistre was born, to ramble through its streets, and up the mountain roads where
                  he had roamed in his youth, and dreamed visions, strange to say, more than
                  realized in his eventful life. Military renown, successful authorship, a long
                  married love, were his; he was a soldier, a philosopher,—'studied all things and
                  yet knew nothing,' as he said in the light, graceful epitaph which he wrote for
                  himself a few years before his death. Do you remember it? No? I will try to repeat
                  it, it is so well turned.

                  *
                  
                     Here lies under this gray stone,
                     Xavier, who, quite astonished,
                     Asked whence came the north wind,
                     And why Jupiter thundered?
                     He studied many a gramarye,
                     He read from morning until night,
                     And drank at last the black wave,
                     Quite surprised at knowing nothing.
                  
               
               "I went out of the Faubourg de Montmeillan, and followed the left bank of the
                  Leysse for some distance. First I came to a village; then seeing the ruins of a castle on the other side of the stream, I
                  crossed it, and soon after entered a beautiful mountain gorge, completely shut in.
                  High steep rocks swept up, seeming like the pedestal of the serrated mountain in
                  the distance. A peasant woman guided me around a paper-mill to see a cascade,
                  which came tumbling down the cliffs, and spouted out in jets through fissures in
                  the rock, while all around hung brilliant icicles glittering and sparkling in the
                  sunlight superbly.
               "'C'est bien "Le Bout du Monde"'*
                   said the peasant woman naively, and I afterwards found it was the actual
                   name of the place.
               
                  
                  *It is indeed "The End of the World."
               
               "I gave her some money and dismissed her. My watch told me I had only been a
                  little over an hour and a half walking there, thus leaving me at least two hours
                  more for my ramble; so I gave myself up freely to the luxury of a silent revery in
                  this beautiful spot.
               "I returned to the gorge, where I paced rapidly up and down the snow-covered path.
                  The shadows of the fir-trees rested on the ground as firm and still as if inlaid;
                  the glittering snow flashed in the morning sunlight a million of facets,—a sheet
                  of diamonds; and the sharp peaks of the mountain lay white and icy against the
                  blue sky. My fancy, morbid from the influence of sorrow, drew a sad contrast
                  between those cutting ice-peaks, the soft clouds of the heavens, and my own broken
                  life; I thought of Mary's lot and mine with something like bitterness.
               "I could not feel disheartened with that strong fresh mountain air, washing like
                  waves over my hot brow and cheeks. Nor could I, when I thought
                     
                        'o'er loss of days no more to be,
                        Of actions dropped to dreams, and dreams to Death,
                        And then Eternity,'*
                           
                        
                     
                   feel what is called resignation. Like you, Ottilie, I have no such grace
                  given me. I think I am more submissive than you,—certainly not more enduring, my
                  friend,—but not one whit more resigned. I may meet with a hundred rebuffs and
                  disappointments and be desperate; but still I stand with armor buckled on ready
                  for fresh action.
               
                  
                  *Read's "Doomed and Forgotten."
               
               "I planted my feet strongly and firmly on that rocky, icy road, as I paced rapidly
                  to and fro, looking up at the cliffs and the shut-in gorge, which doubtless was
                  'the end of the world' to the innocent inhabitants of the place. It was a solemn,
                  sublime spot, where fancy might readily weave woof and web of sombre but grand
                  contrasts, filling memory's storehouse with material for the use of the
                  imagination at more healthy seasons. I seemed surrounded with 
                     
                        'Fragments of a crystal world
                        Long shattered from its skyey course.'
                     
                  
               
               "Does it seem strange to you, Ottilie, that I should be able to recall the very
                  detail of emotions felt so many years ago? It was just at the turning-point of my
                  life, when the load of trouble had grown so heavy as to be near that perilous
                  toppling over which is apt to carry the sufferer with it in its fall. Thus my
                  memory retains the impression of the keen cutting left by those sad
                  experiences.
               "Poverty, 'that sorrowful human poison,' as some one has called it, had added
                  itself to our other trials, giving to my soul little nervous tremblings,
                  exaggerated apprehensions and timidities, quite foreign to my character, paralyzing every power and desire of
                  happiness. O, it is a terrible poison of pride, that same poverty, for it distorts
                  and chills the heart, making one believe in the existence of a sea of ice between
                  ourselves and others. I felt like shutting the book of life forever, so hopeless
                  seemed our future, without even the memory of a happy past to relieve it,—and yet
                  so soon life was to open up to me, for the first time in my existence, a real,
                  true, unalloyed joy! That very spring it was I first met Paul."
               Janet stopped. The night was too dark for me to see her face; but there was an
                  agitation in the rich tones of her voice, which showed she was deeply moved. After
                  a few moments, she continued,—
               "Noonday approaching, warned me of the necessity of returning towards the town,
                  and I retraced the road on the border of the Leysse, which had led me to this
                  beautiful spot in the morning. I found the children up, dressed, and the maid
                  spreading a nice dinner for us in the anteroom of our apartment.
               "'How fresh and rosy you look, dear Jennie,' they cried, leaping into my arms, and
                  almost smothering me with kisses.
               "As my walk had sharpened my appetite as well as brightened my cheeks and eyes, I
                  hastened to our dinner. That through, we went to the diligence, in order to be
                  seated before the other passengers arrived. When I stepped in after Ernst, the boy
                  made an outcry, and my foot pressed something hard which had just fallen from his
                  hand.
               "'O, my knife, my knife!' he exclaimed.
               "'Here it is,' I said; and stooping down I picked it up from the straw where he
                  had dropped it. I slipped it into my pocket, intending to put it in the
                  travelling-bag after we should be seated, for it was a heavy, troublesome thing.
                  It had been sent to Ernst a little while before from the United States,—a real
                  Western bowie-knife, which he wished with boy pride to show to our little nieces
                  at Turin. We had just taken our seats when in trooped the other passengers. There
                  were not so many as the night before, and most of them were new comers. An old
                  peasant woman was among them. I made room for her beside Ernst, having taken the
                  corner seat myself. My German neighbor, I observed with great satisfaction, had
                  left also.
               "Toward sunset we reached St. Jean. The children wished to look out of the window,
                  so I stood up with Venitia, while Ernst left his seat to see something on the
                  roadside which had attracted his sister's attention. When the diligence was ready
                  to start, to my surprise and dissatisfaction I found Ernst's seat occupied; I
                  looked at the person and recognized the officious German. He had been travelling
                  from Chambèry in some other part of the diligence. I observed also that every one
                  had left the interior but the old woman, who had settled herself to sleep in the
                  farthest corner.
               "My heart seemed to stand still for an instant. The man said nothing, but as my
                  eye met his I fancied in its expression that he observed my annoyance and exulted
                  in it. I went over to the opposite bench and put one of the children on either
                  side of me. The German taking no other notice of the change than by stretching
                  himself out on the unoccupied seats, I began to think I had been foolishly
                  alarming myself; so gradually dismissing him from my mind, I became absorbed in
                  thinking of Mary and the desolation of life her death would cause me.
               "Night came on very cold and dark. I listened to the heavy breathing of the sleepers. The dull
                  hoarse snoring of the old woman proved how leaden was her slumber. The diligence
                  wheels groaned through the hard, stony snow, grinding it with sharp harsh creaks
                  into powder. The wind blew high, moaning in soughs and gusts around the desolate
                  place. The voice of the driver, the cries of the postillion to his horses, all
                  sounded as if coming from a great distance.
               "While I was observing this, the helplessness and loneliness of my position again
                  presented themselves to me. No cry of mine thrown out from this shut-up box of a
                  place on that surging, roaring wind could possibly be heard, or, if heard,
                  probably no attention would be paid to it; for, according to European notions, I
                  had no business to be travelling in such a place unprotected.
               "Ernst had crept down on the large tin foot-warmer, his head rested on my lap, one
                  dear soft cheek nestled lovingly in the palm of my hand. I listened to the sweet
                  rise and fall of the breath of the sleeping children; so loud did my own heart
                  throb, that I could plainly distinguish its anxious troubled beat from the
                  peaceful measure of their childish slumbers. Suddenly I heard a slight rustling in
                  the corner occupied by the German, and I thought I saw in the dim light a figure
                  moving.
               "My anxiety is making a baby of me," I said to myself, while I strained my eyes
                  forward, watching closely. I was not mistaken,—he was coming stealthily over to my
                  side of the coach.
               "'Wir sind besonders glücklich, so allein zu sein in dünkler Nacht, und um eine
                  solche gute Gelegenheit zu benützen setze beiseite äuserliche Besheidenheit,'*
                     said he, taking his seat beside me, and resting his arm on my neck.
               
                  
                  *"We are very lucky to be all alone this dark night; we ought to use such a
                     good opportunity, and not be too modest."
               
               "I sprang to my feet, snatched the knife out of my pocket, the recollection of
                  which came to me as if by inspiration, touched its spring, and flashed the broad,
                  bright blade in his face; there was just light enough from the dim lantern to show
                  the glimmer of the steel. I am sure if he had touched me I should have killed
                  him.
               "I never saw a human being so alarmed in my life. He was struck dumb, cowered
                  down, and gradually crept off, farther and farther from me, until he had reached
                  the end of the coach. I did not speak a word, nor cease looking at him; I was
                  afraid of breaking the fascination. I sat down with assumed calmness, but
                  continued snapping the blade with leisurely beats to and fro. I do not know how
                  long I sat watching him; the time seemed interminable. About midnight the
                  diligence stopped at one of the relay houses, or houses of refuge. There my German
                  admirer stepped out, and I saw him no more. Just before the diligence started, I
                  heard one of the guards bantering him, evidently urging him to return to the
                  interior.
               "'Verdammit, nein,'he muttered, sullenly, 'da drinnen ist eine Bärin.'*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *"Curse it, no! There is a she-bear in there!"
               
               "'Sie ist eine Americanerin,'†
                     said the guard, laughing.
               
                  
                  †"She's an American woman."
               
               "The German's teeth fairly chattered with fright, as he cried, 'Americanerin! was
                  sie nicht sagen! Mein Gott! lieber ginge ich in die Höhle einer Bärin als einer
                  solchen Americanerin zu nahe zu kommen!'‡
                  
               
               
                  
                  ‡"An American woman! You don't say so! My God, I had rather go into a
                     she-bear's, den than come too near such an American woman."
               
               
               "The other men laughed heartily as he clambered up to some other part of the
                  coach, grumbling angrily, while the diligence rolled on to Susa. My journey after
                  that passed without incident; and when I reached Turin I had the great happiness
                  of finding Mary not only alive, but relieved from immediate danger. In a fortnight
                  she was well enough to enjoy my description of the journey, and laugh with me over
                  the fright caused by my German admirer, as well as the good use I had made of
                  Ernst's bowie-knife."
               This story led Janet and Venitia to recall many old memories, while I fell into a
                  troubled, disturbed sleep of fatigue which caused me the loss of the fine sunrise
                  at Susa. I remember trying to arouse myself to look at the mountain outlines of
                  the Plains of Piedmont as the keen-eyed Janet pointed them out on our approach to
                  Susa, but I was growing so weary with the twelve hours' confinement in the
                     coupé as to feel really ill and long for the
                  sight of Turin.
               At Susa, our diligence was raised upon the railway again, but we did not reach
                  Turin until ten o'clock in the morning. I have a dim recollection of being lifted
                  to a carriage, carried to a room, laid on a bed, and in the midst of much
                  suffering, feeling Janet's dear hand-touches, with once in a while a soft, cool
                  kiss on my hot brow, and a short, eager, loving press of her cheek against mine,
                  which tender nursing at last quieted the mortal pain, soothing me into a heavy
                  sleep, filled with mysterious magnetic dreams. Of course we could not continue our
                  journey; but I am so much better this morning that we shall leave at two o'clock,
                  as we wish to be in Genoa before Carnival closes.
               Janet and Venitia have gone out to refresh old memories. Years ago this was one of
                  the tarrying places of their curious nomadic life. I should have liked to go with
                  them, but I did not think it prudent, as the streets are covered with snow. It
                  disappoints me, too, for I wished to visit the Turin Royal Gallery, which has a
                  fine collection of pictures of the old German school. Viardot says, in his Musées d'Italie, that no museum in Italy is so rich as
                  this in German paintings. There are Albert Durer's, some fine Holbein
                  portraits,—one of my historical heroine, Marguerite de Valois,—Rubens's,
                  Rembrandt's, Van-Dyck's, and, above all, one of the tender pictures of that
                  devoted observer of "the beautiful laws of Catholic symbolism and religious
                  painting, who united the deep symbolism of devotion and holy beauty with a German
                  abundance of feeling and expression";*
                   Henling, whose touching picture of the "Passion," is in this
                   collection.

               But I only tease myself by naming them over. Here come Janet and Venitia, full of
                  eager, earnest, pleasant talk. Venitia has turned over the leaves of my journal,
                  crying out with surprise at the number of pages I have written during their
                  absence. Janet scolded me tenderly. But it would have been greater fatigue to have
                  lain on a sofa with hands folded over the aching heart, feeling the biting tooth
                  of resentful, bitter memory eating in and in!

                  GENOA.
               
               WE arrived last evening at eight o'clock, having left Turin at two in the
                  afternoon. Although there was snow at Turin, the country lost its wintry look very
                  soon, and the air grew soft and balmy.
               Piedmont—Pied de monte, foot of the mountain—lay
                  spread out before us; we almost fancied we could see these vast plains between the
                  Alps and Apennines, stretching from their mountain frontiers far across Lombardy
                  to the Adriatic, their mistress; for though the western and southwestern shores
                  are washed by the Mediterranean, their waters are all sent to the Venetian
                  Sea.
               The journey between Turin and Genoa was very pleasant. The rest which I had taken
                  in Turin refreshed me, and made me strong enough to notice and enjoy this new
                  landscape, which differs very much in all its points from Swiss scenery. The color
                  of the sky first struck me. Its mellow amber hue is so unlike the cold transparent
                  stony blue of the Alpine heavens. Then the buildings are novel. I had grown
                  familiar in Switzerland with the heavy turreted tops of the grim Middle Age
                  chateaux and the gray stone churches, whose massive, four-sided spires, with ogive
                  openings, seemed part and parcel of the mountains from whose sides they jutted
                  out.
               The Italian campaniles, or bell towers, are the first buildings which attract
                  attention on these Plains of Piedmont. The Lombards, in adopting the Basilica of
                  Latin architecture, did not lose sight of this graceful accessory. They seemed to
                  have enjoyed the picturesque effect these campaniles and the baptisteries produced
                  when grouped around their churches; for they displayed so much architectural taste
                  in them. These beautiful towers run gracefully up against the soft sky, several
                  stories in height, each story often bearing a different order of architecture; the
                  rich-hued heavens peep through the many-arched, airy-looking belfry-tops, these
                  sweet warders and gentle guards of the churches, beside which they stand, and they
                  differ widely as well as pleasantly from the frowning towers of old Lombardy
                  castles, which bristle out from many an Alpine crest, whose heavy machicolations
                  and sharp turrets of inverted triangles tell of the fierce times when Guelph and
                  Ghibelline warred hotly against each other.
               "This landscape is very gentle and gracious," remarked Venitia. "It is quite a
                  relief to my eyes, after having looked so long on rugged Alps, with their torrents
                  and glaciers and dense forests."
               "The garden of Europe," I said, half to myself, as I leaned back in the
                  comfortably stuffed seat of the railway carriage.
               "A garden it is truly," answered Janet, "but one that has been nourished with
                  precious human blood. This little kingdom of Piedmont, or Sardinia, has grown on
                  what kills other and larger governments,—politics and war; in this it resembles
                  Prussia. Two great men erected their inheritances into kingdoms through the force
                  of their individual will and courage about the same period. Frederick the Great,
                  of Prussia, that prosaic, wondrous hero,
                  as Heine calls him, and Victor Amadeus II. of Savoy,—both princes, too, struggling
                  against one common enemy,—Austria. This very north of Italy was then the scene of
                  the same struggle which is now going on, Piedmont against Austria, with France for
                  her ally and kinsman; for a royal marriage then sealed the treaty between Louis
                  XIV. and Victor Amadeus, as it is going to do now between the French Emperor and
                  Victor Emanuel. Louis's grandson, the Due de Bourgogne, you know, married a
                  daughter of the aspiring Savoisien Duke-King.
               "France her kinsman!" I repeated. "Yes, you are right. The questionable fidelity
                  and friendly tyranny which France has always shown Savoy and Piedmont is very like
                  that which a strong and powerful kinsman is apt to show a weaker relative. But the
                  first part of your remarks recalls to me a fine expression of De Mazade,—you will
                  remember it. He says, 'this Plain of Piedmont has had the fatal privilege of being
                  the champ-clos
                  *
                  of European duels.'"
               
                  
                  *Champ-clos, field for single combat,—lists.
               
               "That is very true," assented Janet. "Every spot here has been trampled under foot
                  with war-steeds; every clump of grass and every leaf on the trees should be
                  blood-red instead of green. All these towns we have been travelling through during
                  the last two or three days have names which bristle with warlike memories as with
                  spears. Conquered and reconquered Susa, besieged Turin, both tell the same old
                  story of European antagonisms, rival struggles, and Italian yearnings after
                  liberty."
               "Which yearnings," I added, "generally resolve themselves, so far as true national
                  or governmental liberty is concerned, into a sonnet, a written tragedy, or an
                  epic. From Dante to the present day, all their poets have moaned over, 'in
                  deathless verse,' the oppressions and wrongs endured by this 'geographical
                  expression,' as Metternich pertly called Italy."
               "The Italians, it is true," replied Janet, laughing, "have always believed
                  everything could be said in verse, and, as I think of it, I remember that one of
                  the noted Italian poets of the present day, a Piedmontese, too, by the way, has
                  actually written a poem, in which he has celebrated the Piedmontese statutes, the
                  two Chambers of Deputies, and the Constitutional laws,—just fancy the droll air of
                  such an epic!"
               We sat silent for a little while, when suddenly Venitia exclaimed,—
               "O Jennie, do you remember that famous journey we made last year, coming from
                  Paris to Switzerland, when we passed through the vast plains of Franche Comté that
                  golden Burgundy, the rich Côte d'Or, with its sweet flowering vineyards which
                  filled the air with fragrance? for it was in early June, you know. You remind me
                  of that delightful journey, for, just as you have been doing now, you and Ottilie
                  mingled with the subtle odor of the grape-flower your memories of the past. You
                  showered down a flood of names and a stream of historic story as brilliant in its
                  flow as the precious Burgundian wine. But I remember it poured black and dark with
                  that bad Philip, 'the greatest duke in all the world,' the one whom history calls
                  'Good,' notwithstanding the cruel wrong he did to his poor orphan niece,
                  Jacqueline of Holland,— 
                     
                        'She whom they called queen
                        In Brabant once.'"
                     
                  
               
               
               "Yes," answered Janet, smiling, "we went over the whole Burgundian line from
                  Philip the Bold down to Charles the Bold, and his chronicler De Commines; then
                  when we came to that great struggle of ducal pride and state ambition warring with
                  the general power, that never-ending sphinx riddle for countries, Ottilie and I
                  had a grand argument, I remember."
               "But I did not follow you through those political historical disputes," said
                  Venitia. I got no further than poor Jacqueline,—as Owen Meredith sings:— 
                     
                        'Alas, it was a piteous history,
                        The life of that poor countess!—
                        Wrongs, insults, treacheries,
                        Hopes broken down, and memory which sighed
                        In, like a night-wind.'"
                     
                  
               
               "It is very hard," said Janet, laughing, "to make you enthusiastic young persons
                  accept those great facts which history establishes; namely, that there are some
                  rights which are perfectly just in themselves and yet seem politically
                     impossible, and some concessions which are not only humiliating, but
                  cruel, that seem politically necessary."
               "Venitia must accept them," I remarked. "If she does not now, her life experience,
                  I fancy, will teach them to her; for they are proved, not only in the history of
                  nations, but in the history of every woman."
               "It is not so pleasant to learn them from experience," said Janet, pressing my
                  hand tenderly. "There is a sort of aerial perspective hanging around historical
                  wrongs which makes them less painful to regard than personal ones. The distance of
                  time prevents us from seeing and feeling all the detail of suffering caused by
                  these wicked political necessities and impossibilities; it enables us also to
                  distinguish the whole great plan and note the divine balance made in the end, the
                  holy compensation which equalizes all at last. This very Jacqueline of Holland
                  story, for example; we who look at it now may feel like Venitia, indignant for the
                  unfortunate young countess's sake, but our indignation is tempered quickly; the
                  eye has only to run down a few sentences, as it were, on the page of history, to
                  find the injustice meeting its punishment. Forty years after the sad period when
                  poor Jacqueline 
                     
                        'in Holland night and day
                        Watched those long lines of siege, and fought at bay
                        Along her broken army,'
                     
                   the Burgundian line ended in one fair girl, who, like her grandfather's
                  niece, stood alone in life, an orphan, and had her duchy, that beautiful Burgundy
                  for whose advancement Philip had sinned, wrested from her by Louis XI.
                  Jacqueline's wrongs were resented, just where Philip would have felt them most, on
                  his granddaughter, Mary of Burgundy; and yet the innocent young duchess was
                  compensated too, for she was bride to a great emperor, Maximilian of Austria."
               "What a sweet opium for private griefs is contained in this journeying over
                  European lands," I remarked, after a little pause. "These 'majestical
                  steam-horses' carry us swiftly through countries whose history revives pleasant
                  home studies of our youth, the quiet library readings when we pored over books
                  night and day, the printed page setting our young brains to thinking earnestly of
                  great events which seemed to us 
                     "Dust and ashes, dead and done with,"
                   but which here take living form and shape. Memory forgets to dwell on her own
                  little tale of sorrows while making these
                  glorious sweeps over thousands of years filled with great incidents, many of
                  which, too, are draped with the glowing, sparkling tissue of rich old 'poesy and
                  romance.'"
               "Heine says so touchingly," replied Janet, "in his Pictures of Travel, that the
                  study of history led his soul to calmer paths, and he talks of 'those historical
                  consolations enabling him to bear the painful events of his after life.' Then add
                  to this study, Ottilie, the visiting and living in countries which are famous in
                  history, the very 'breathing the spirit of the place,' and we gain from it, not
                  only a consolation and enjoyment, but a refinement of character, a mental culture,
                  which cannot be obtained in any other pursuit or study."
               "But to reap the full benefit of it, Janet," said Venetia, "what years of study
                  and thought are required. And not only these, but vivid memory and quick fancy
                  must be united to the past labor. I wonder if I shall ever arrive at the time when
                  I can be able to allow my mind to lie still and simply drink the rich draught
                  which this European journeying offers me without the everlasting hard study I now
                  have to keep up, like a difficult accompaniment running underneath some divine
                  melody."
               We could not help laughing, though the dear girl was in very sober earnest. She
                  joined in our laugh good-humoredly; but, shaking her head, she added, a little
                  sorrowfully, "I am sure I should do or be something if that time should ever come,
                  for I am taking in all the while Art's very nutriment, not only the spirit of
                  beauty, but knowledge itself from its glorious fountain-heads."
               "Poor child!" said Janet, "and are you troubled with that naughty 
                     'Canker of ambitious thoughts?'
                   You will never find sweet, quiet paths in Europe or anywhere else so long as
                  your spirit travels that hot, dusty, high-road. But here we are at Genoa la
                  Superba. Genoa and a Carnival! Think of that, Ottilie! One would be enough for
                  common mortals, but we must have both glories showered down on us."
               The cars stopped, and then followed the usual bustle. We were soon through the
                  confusion, however, and nicely accommodated in the Hotel Féder, which was formerly
                  the Palace of the Admiralty. It is a grand old building, with noble halls, broad
                  spacious flights of stone stairways, rooms of palatial height, size, and
                  adornments too, for our apartments are beautifully frescoed and luxuriously
                  furnished.
               At last I find myself really in Italy; it seems like living awake a beautiful
                  dream. Snowy Turin discouraged me and I looked longingly, hoping to see what Heine
                  calls "the variegated tangled life of Italy come leaping towards me; real, warm,
                  and humming." Here I have it in its fullest force, for added to the native
                  exuberance of life is the Carnival. Then the weather is delicious. We are just
                  stepping on the flowery lintel of this blessed land 
                     "Where summer sings and never dies,"
                   and are already breathing its divine atmosphere.
               Carnival is near its close, for Ash-Wednesday is at hand, and the people are on
                  their maddest height of fun and frolic. I see the same exhibitions I have read of
                  hundreds of times in books of travel; but, as it is my first Carnival, the
                  festival strikes me not exactly as a new thing might, but with greater power, I
                  fancy. When I read the descriptions of others I often tried to imagine these
                  scenes; thus I have now in my mind their impressions sions, the feeble pictures of my fancy, and the
                  wonderful reality which is indeed hard to represent in words, or even on canvas,
                  for it is such a motley, changeable, emotional thing.
               I find myself recalling the various instrumental Carnivals of musicians with
                  greater satisfaction than those given in books. To read aloud the finest written
                  description here in its presence would sound tame and insipid; but Venitia goes
                  from the window to the piano every little while to play passages recalled or
                  suggested to her memory by something in the street from some musical composer's
                  Carnival, and the music, instead of sounding out of place, seems to give even a
                  richer color to the fête.
               I have drawn my writing-table into the large balcony on the outside of the window,
                  and as I write I can look down on the thronged strada beneath, and sketch from
                  nature as a painter painting a picture. Barouches filled with gayly dressed
                  people, some in grotesque costumes, are driving slowly along. One barouche has
                  just passed by, in which was a merry party of children dressed superbly in the
                  magnificent costume of the time of Louis XIV. Two little girls represented, one a
                  marquise and the other a duchess; they wore paint, powder, and patches, and robes
                  of the richest satins and velvets, but all their fine clothes could not take the
                  child out of them, for the carriage scarcely held them in their frolic mirth.
               From these carriages come showers of confetti; the occupants throw them at each
                  other, on the crowd and even up into the balconies, for Venitia has just received
                  a shower of very nice ones from the carriage load of children.
               Now a clown dashes through the crowd, and the people ple scatter on each side, as
                  if his bursts of reckless fun and droll somersets were handfuls of sharp missiles;
                  he jingles his bells, leaps up in air, making the eyes dance as his mantle of
                  brilliant zigzag figures waves about, and his Joseph garment of many colors
                  flashes to and fro from his rapid movements.
               The people give a fresh shout, and out from a strada at the east comes trotting a
                  troop of asses; the clown is forgotten; he has dashed off to amuse another crowd,
                  while we gaze at the gay feathered trappings of the asses, and laugh ourselves
                  almost sick over the droll devices of the various riders; each one carries an
                  absurd bâton, whose ends are surmounted by heads of geese and pigs, &c.; and
                  the faces of the donkey-riders are hidden by ludicrous, huge-nosed, broad,
                  grinning-mouthed masks.
               "O look!" cries Venitia; and the crowd stop laughing to gaze, as we do, admiringly
                  at a party of young gentlemen, who pass by with stately tread, masked and richly
                  dressed. Their glittering spurs clank against the stones of the strada, their
                  swords ring in the scabbards, and the gay hat-plumes nod with a gracious wave.
                  Behind them are their horses superbly caparisoned, and each is led by a servant in
                  an Oriental dress. It is just sunset; and although the golden rays cannot enter
                  the narrow street, still the air is made bright, and we feel the sunlight, if we
                  do not see it.
               As the graceful cavaliers disappear, we hear music approaching. A band of singers
                  are turning that corner of Piazzi Bianchi, and their chorus is as mellow and
                  golden as the atmosphere. They pass on, and from another point a crowd of
                  motley-hued maskers come pouring tumultuously into our already crowded strada; but
                  they all mingle together as quick blending figures in a kaleidoscope, or like the circles and eddies in a
                  stream, where a fast-flowing downward current meets a bubbling up spring; they
                  form bewildering mazes, and yet there seems some curious tangled harmony of figure
                  in the whole variegated mass.
               There are shrill ear-piercing fifes and whistles, while real Pulcinellas squeak
                  and brandish their wooden swords. A glorious peal of the merriest laughter mounts
                  up like the foam on a goblet of new wine. Every moment there is a fresh absurdity,
                  and each absurdity is sometimes graceful, but never vulgar. The mingling, blending
                  crowds grow more noisy as night comes on; there is, however, no fighting,
                  brutality, or coarseness; they sweep on in one endless flow of gayety.
               Opposite our window, on the other side of the strada, is a shop where masks and
                  dominos are sold; they hang around the door and windows, flapping about in the
                  evening wind, as if longing to leap off their hooks and dance along in the merry
                  crowd. Every rank and condition of costume is swaying there, from costly corn
                  color or pink satin, bordered with this delicate silver lace of Genoa manufacture,
                  down to common red and black muslin. Then the masks are as various. There are
                  strings of lovely Venetian ones, made of black velvet with falls of rich lace,
                  looking most bewitchingly and entreatingly out of their almond-shaped eye-hollows,
                  while hob-nobbing beside them are absurd Pulcinella masks, with huge noses and
                  hideous mouths.
               We saw a living picture this afternoon at the corner of the Piazza dell'
                  Annunziata, such a one as would have set an old painter half beside himself. A
                  handsome Genoese woman, one of the lower class, sat in a chair in the open street,
                  having her fine hair dressed by a girl almost as pretty as herself. Two or three
                  men stood near her, "assisting," (as the French say,) and seemed really to enjoy
                  the plaiting and trailing out of those rich long tresses as much as we did. The
                  work also exhibited to advantage the fine arms and well-formed person of the
                  pretty hair-dresser.
               One of the men held in his hands a long veil with gay flowers stamped on its
                  border. It was the mezzaro, as it is called, the
                  costume of every woman in Genoa; for even those of the highest rank wear it to
                  church. In most Catholic countries a French-shaped bonnet, such as all women wear
                  elsewhere, is considered bold and irreverent at a place of worship. Italian and
                  Spanish women, who delight in the costliest and gayest bonnets for a promenade or
                  visit, will shroud their heads meekly and devoutly in a simple veil when going to
                  their devotions.
               But to return to the Genoese mezzaro. It is worn
                  like the Spanish rebosa, thrown over and
                  covering the head, and extending nearly to the waist; the ends are gathered up on
                  the arms, and crossed over the breast, making one of the most bewitching costumes
                  imaginable, combining the gracefulness of the scarf with the pretty coquetry of
                  the veil.
               I must not forget our street picture, however. Another lucky dog literally
                  "assisted" the pretty hairdresser, for he smoothed out awkwardly, but softly and
                  tenderly, one of the long thick braids of hair. The girl, who was the fortunate
                  possessor of the luxuriant tresses, sat leaning lazily back in her low wooden
                  chair, twirling a gilt hair-pin between her fingers, laughing and looking up at
                  her friend in high glee. Both were evidently "belles in their own circle," and, if
                  rivals, were friendly ones, or wise enough to know they were most powerful united. According to Janet's and
                  Venitia's report,—for they understand this Genoese dialect,—the girls were saying
                  all manner of saucy things to their beaux.
               Their brilliant eyes shot out sparkling jets of fire, their lips were as red as
                  the coral beads encircling their proud, well-formed throats,—throats which looked
                  like bits of fine columns,—and the skin! O that was delicious, "Phœbus had loved
                  it and kissed it brown," and the genial warm blood mounted up in a rich glow on
                  their cheeks.
               "Ah!" I exclaimed, "if an artist would only deign to copy such pieces of nature
                  from these street corners of Italian towns, his pictures would be ravishing before
                  he hardly knew it. As Stendhal says, 'Filippo Lippi and Freère Angelico da
                  Fiesole, when they had the good luck to meet with a fine bit in nature, copied it
                  with conscientious fidelity. It was this close study of real life in its most
                  perfect form which makes the works of the painters of the last half of the
                  fifteenth century so enchanting.'"
               "But those old Italian artists," said Janet, "were something more than mere
                  painters. When you come to see the numberless walls, ceilings, and altars in South
                  Italy, covered with fine decorative frescoes and paintings, you will say they were
                  the works of men possessing more than ordinary mind, and higher, purer culture
                  than we see now. Their creations must have cost them vigils of meditation, days of
                  labor, and concentrated thought; then, added to this, they had a gift of
                  conception, such as great poets or famous writers possess."
               "Lord Lindsay," I remarked, "after giving the first period, from the sixth century
                  to the fifteenth, to architecture, as the voice of the simple, pure faith of the
                  age, devotes the fifteenth century to sculpture, as the expression sion of
                  Christianity battling with Intellect; the third, however, extending from the
                  latter half of the fifteenth to the middle of the sixteenth century, he says
                  witnessed the successive triumphs of that struggle, and Painting became then the
                  handmaid and exponent of Christianity."*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *Lord Lindsay's Christian Art, Vol. II. p. 4.
               
               "There is something very earnest and true in architecture," responded Janet, "I
                  mean that architecture of the early ages of the Church. Jean Paul was right, or
                  felt right, when he said, 'the giant stood out of it and close before the soul.'
                  The men who built those great works were nourished on 'plain living and high
                  thought'; they must have had a faith, not childlike, but godlike. The painters who
                  followed them—those marvellous men I was just speaking of—seem to me to have been
                  earnest believers too; but they had become poets, and were as little children in
                  their expression of the new gift. They looked up into the throbbing heavens, and
                  saw adoring cherub heads crowding in to behold the glory of the Infant God; and on
                  the long, cool, level clouds beautiful Madonnas stood, crowned with the glory of
                  the setting sun of old Heathenism beaming on them, while the long folds of their
                  chaste garments swept above the young crescent moon of Christ's faith, which was
                  just rising. These men had hearts running over with love, bodies brimming up with
                  rich exuberant life, and minds not so full of learning as of heavenly inspiration.
                  A great Word was given to mankind in each one of those periods; but we do not seem
                  to possess, now-a-days, organs capable of hearing or comprehending the language.
                  Even the few of us who fondly think we possess them, grope as children at twilight
                  or see as 'through a glass darkly.'"
               
               —The night has closed in completely; the turmoil still goes on in the strada, but
                  as a sea-breeze is blowing, and it is cool, I have come in and closed the window.
                  Venitia is playing mad wild bursts of music, broken bits of conception suggested
                  by these Carnival sights. She is more than clever, but her thoughts to-night are
                  disjointed and rugged.
               Here comes our refreshing nine o'clock tea; for we Americans, like the English,
                  never lose our home habits, whatever part of the world we may float to. We shall
                  have a little pleasant talk over the teacups, and then we shall part for the
                  night, as the confusion of the Carnival has wearied us sadly.
            
            
               PRIDE, PIETY, AND AMBITION.
               WE have spent the day in church-visiting. First we went to the Cathedral of San
                  Lorenzo, one of the oldest churches in Italy, built in the beginning of the
                  eleventh century; but only one of its towers was ever completed. It remains
                  unfinished, as do so many of these old churches on the Continent, notwithstanding
                  the early date of its foundation.
               The traveller soon grows accustomed, however, to these half-completed works of
                  Europe; and, indeed, to so much that might seem to be hinderances to enjoyment;—to
                  ruins that are not even sublime; to all the surroundings of rugged footpaths, and
                  the rude makeshifts of an indolent population, such as hovels and ignoble
                  buildings, crowding close in against these vast piles of architecture.
               But these drawbacks are no more noticed than the withered branches, dead leaves,
                  unsightly bugs, or woody paths made muddy by the trickling of a wandering rivulet
                  in a vast forest. The unfinished towers and spires, too, are like some
                  forest-trees that have shot out one complete branch to its full and perfect
                  height, and quite forgotten, through stress of storm, or some other forest trial
                  of earth, or air, or sky, the rest of the branches belonging to the original
                  tree-plan.
               
               The exterior of the Cathedral of San Lorenzo is curiously ornamented with blocks
                  of white and black marble, a Saracenic fashion of decoration. In the interior, the
                  nave has sixteen columns of black and white Parian marble. The architecture is of
                  no particular style, and ineffective, the church having evidently undergone those
                  alterations which the architects of the Renaissance saw fit to make.
               San Lorenzo has a number of side chapels, into one of which Venitia was
                  obstinately bent on entering, and had quite a playful, coaxing talk with the
                  Sacristan, endeavoring to bribe him, not only with silver lira, but with her own bewitching smiles and beguiling words;—all in
                  vain.
               It was the Chapel of St. John the Baptist; and Innocent VIII. having been attacked
                  with a fit of anger against the memory of the pretty dancing daughter of the cruel
                  Herodias, resented her sin on her sex, by forbidding all women to step foot over
                  the threshold of this Chapel, except one day in the year, the fête day, which does
                  not fall during our stay.
               "Your church, Ottilie," said Janet, "has always been sadly wanting in gallantry to
                  our sex."
               "On the contrary, my dear," I replied, "it has always acknowledged our great
                  power."
               "Not in very courteous terms or ways. But do listen to that witch, Venitia. How
                  well she remembers this Genoese dialect! Dear child! She makes me think of those
                  old days. Her born tongue is that caressing, child-like Venitian; but she was
                  always very quick in catching these peculiarities of speech which make up the
                  different dialects of a language. Hear! how she rings out this Gallicized Genoese,
                  as good, I assure you, as any of the people might speak it themselves."
               But all Venitia's sacrifice in the way of pronunciation had no affect on the
                  Sacristan, who was quite willing to show us the rest of the church, the Queen of
                  Sheba's Emerald Vase,—the famous "Sacre Catino,"—all the wonders, in fine, but not
                  this Chapel; and wound up his refusal with a compliment that made us laugh
                  heartily.
               "The Signorine was so charming and dangerous, that he now saw how necessary it was
                  for the poor men to guard themselves against such perils."
               Before leaving the Cathedral we held the "Sacre Catino" in our hands, and
                  reverenced it for its great legendary history.
               "What if it is not a real emerald," said Janet, "and suppose the Queen of Sheba
                  never did present it to her beloved Solomon, human faith has rested on it; it is a
                  relic of those blessed, childlike days, when belief was what doubt and unbelief
                  are now, a credit and a virtue. Seven hundred and odd years, little vase, you have
                  lived, to our knowledge;—Heaven only knows how much older you may be;—and so great
                  was your success at one time, that you grew tyrannical, and punished with death
                  any one who should doubt your regal and holy history. That was a mistake,—a
                  mistake of pride,—a poison which lies at the root of all errors. 'A haughty spirit
                  goeth before a fall,' dear emerald, and, as high as was your pride, so great has
                  been your ruin; shattered and valueless you remain now, except to some dreamy
                  believers, like Ottilie here, or, charitable, indulgent legend-loving heretics,
                  such as I. You are very dear to me, little vase, and I shall kiss you to show my
                  reverence."
               We had to laugh at Janet's droll apostrophe to the "Sacre Catino"; and the
                  Sacristan, who did not understand a word of her English, stared, as he well
                     might; but when he saw her lift the
                  famous old crystal to her lips and kiss it reverentially, then hand it to us for a
                  like show of respect, he nodded his head approvingly.
               From San Lorenzo we drove up La Strada Nuovo, which is bordered on either side
                  with fine palaces; while looking at and admiring this grand réunion of lordly buildings, we understood well why
                  people called this city "La Superba." We went also through Stradas Balbi, Carlo
                  Felice, Carlo Alberti, Giulia Carrettiera, and several other streets, enjoying the
                  Italian appearance of the place.
               It was high noon; the magnificent architecture of this gay, southern city, which
                  lay inundated with golden sunlight, looking so regal and opulent, running over
                  with exuberant life and action, the merry, mad Carnival mood of the population,
                  their beautiful costumes,—all affected me deeply. It reminded me of the delicious
                  dreams I used to have of a summer's day, when I was a girl, and would fall asleep
                  in a hammock, under the shade of an old walnut-tree, after having read myself
                  luxuriously full of fancies over Arabian Nights or Spenser's Faëry Queen. It being
                  the hour of luncheon, we returned to our hotel; after that meal was over and we
                  had rested a while, we started out 
                     "To fresh woods and pastures new."
                  
               
               "Oh Jennie," said Venitia, after we were seated in the barouche, and the courier
                  stood at the door to receive his orders, "let us go look at that brilliant Church
                  of L'Annunziata. You cannot tell, Ottilie, how much I adored its gold and purple
                  splendors when I was a child."
               So to the Church of the Annunciation we went. It is one mass of gold-leaf and
                  frescoes, brilliant-hued silk, Genoese crimson velvet drapery, and cloth of silver
                  and gold. The effect is not only dazzling but bewildering, every part glittering
                  with costly adornments. It was built by Della Porta, and is a true church of the
                  Renaissance style.
               At the intersection of the cross—that is, where the transept and nave meet—there
                  is a gilded cupola, supported by caryatides, also blazing with gold-leaf. This
                  superb and costly church was built for the Lomellini, a great old Italian house,
                  the heads of which counted themselves sovereigns, and reigned over a little island
                  kingdom, about a mile and a quarter long and a few furlongs wide, with five
                  hundred subjects, out in the lovely Mediterranean. Kings of Tabarca! Half Spanish,
                  and half African; no wonder, when fashion required every noble family to own at
                  least one church, as part of the appointments of their establishment, these island
                  sovereigns displayed such barbaric splendor. As I was talking of this old custom
                  of family church-building, Janet said:—
               "Let us leave this place; I wish to show you a church which was really built to
                  gratify family pride; and, not only that, to heal wounded vanity, a superb palace
                  was demolished, in order to make room for a house of religious worship. It has a
                  curious history, which I will tell you when we are in one of its chapels."
               We left L'Annunziata, and, driving through the Carnival crowd to the other end of
                  the city, came to a hill on the eastern side, which overlooks the gulf and a great
                  part of the town. On this hill stands a fine church, Santa Marie de Carignan. We
                  entered it, and finding seats near Luca Cambiaso's "Pietà," placed so that we
                  could look at the picture leisurely,—the standing figure in which, to the right of
                  the spectator, is supposed to be the
                  portrait of the church founder,—I sat and listened to Janet's account of the cause
                  of the building of the church.
               "Near the middle of the sixteenth century the Marquis de Sauli was one of Genoa's
                  richest and most esteemed noblemen. He owned, among other delightful things, a
                  number of city palaces; and the one in which he loved best to live was a
                  magnificent building standing high and lordly on the Hill de Carignan.
               "Although the Marquis was so passing rich, strange to say, he had no chapel nor
                  church of his own. He was in the habit of going to hear Mass in the church
                  belonging to his old friend, Count Fieschi,—the Santa Marie in Vie Lata; and he
                  continued doing this even when his old brother nobleman died and the haughty
                  eighteen-year-old heir succeeded to the title and vast estates of the Fieschi
                  family. It never entered into his head that he might not be as welcome to the
                  young Count; for we middle-aged people are very apt to think lightly, and often
                  not at all, of the likes and dislikes of young folk. It was only yesterday they
                  were children, and had to obey; it is hard to step aside and give them our path,
                  while we fall off into the shadowy one of the elders; and this stepping aside to
                  make way for the young comes to almost every one of us unawares; we suddenly
                  awaken and find not only the old gone, but ourselves lifted into their places.
               "To return to the Marquis de Sauli.
               "Every church-day the good nobleman went, as he had done all his life, taking his
                  family with him, to the Fieschi church. Now 'family,' in those days, did not
                  simply mean one's children and grandchildren, but also retainers, a household
                  guard of soldiers it might be, or something of the kind, which made an addition to
                  one's congregation not always agreeable to a nobleman, who wished to worship God
                  as he lived with man, in solitary grandeur. The young Count Fieschi, I fancy, was
                  one of these same social, pious aristocrats, for one day he advanced the hour of
                  celebration, so that when the Marquis de Sauli and his suite arrived, Mass was
                  over, the church empty. The first time the Marquis met his young friend, Count
                  Fieschi, after this occurred, he complained good-naturedly about it.
               "'My dear Marquis,' said Fieschi, in a stately way, 'if a gentleman wishes to hear
                  Mass he should have a church of his own.'
               "'So he should,' replied the Marquis curtly, and, turning on his ringing heel, he
                  gave orders to have his superb palace on the Carignan Hill, the grandest he owned,
                  razed to the ground; and after some years of patient and costly labor, the
                  handsome Church of St. Marie de Carignan rose in its place. He wished to show the
                  haughty, churlish young nobleman that a gentleman could indeed have a church of
                  his own, and at the same time destroy a superb palace if he pleased."
               This story being told, we looked up at the sorrowful "Pietà" of Luca di Cambiaso
                  (Luchetto da Genova), that natural, unaffected artist of a period when nature had
                  nearly died out in art,—the mannerist era of the sixteenth century. We thought of
                  the poor, gifted painter's sorrowful life, and talked of him and his lovely
                  sister-in-law, whom he has painted in this picture as the woman who weeps, and has
                  wept silently there for near three hundred years! Luca is kneeling hopelessly
                  beside his dead Lord; the two have brought their mortal love and anguish to that
                  Sacred Presence of Immortal Life in
                  Death,—that passionate human love which man forbade, and which sent the great
                  artist to his grave and the woman he adored to the cloister, when they found nor
                  man nor God could help them.
               I looked at the portrait of the stately founder of the church, and then upon the
                  fine well-proportioned building, which had been raised to display wealth, to
                  gratify family pride, and heal wounded vanity,—not for the love of God. O no!
                  piety was as dead as that painted Christ of the heart-broken painter, for 
                     "'T is the substance that wanes ever, 't is the symbol that exceeds."
                  
               
               This church is a specimen of fine architectural unity. It is built on a square of
                  a hundred and fifty feet, without including the absis, and was erected on the
                  original plan of Michael Angelo for St. Peter's at Rome. Three naves divide the
                  interior, and a Greek cross is formed by the intersections. In the centre is a
                  grand cupola, supported by four massive pillars; at the four angles of the cross
                  are four smaller cupolas. We went up into the large central dome to see the
                  magnificent view it commands of the gulf and part of the city.
               On the left of us were the ramparts, with the whole length of the picturesque
                  wharves bordered by the fishermens' huts, and the petty gulfs of the harbor making
                  graceful indentations in the shore. The peaks of the Apennines rose behind the
                  town, the west was gorgeous with light, the blue waters of the harbor tossed up
                  the sun's rays playfully, then seemed to rush off with frolicsome glee out of the
                  clasping arms of the Mole into the green sea beyond. Towards the west the
                  beautiful shore stretched out, looking like strips of lapis lazuli, the headlands
                  were so blue, resting on
                     
                        "The waters crystalline;
                        And before that chasm of light,
                        As within a furnace bright,
                        Column, tower, and dome, and spire
                        Shone like obelisks of fire."
                     
                  
               
               We sat silent for sometime, feeling that it was quite impossible to point out to
                  each other the quick succeeding beauties which were causing us such sweet,
                  unutterable rapture. But gradually our eyes, as if satisfied with the first eager
                  sweep over the distance, rested on the objects nearer at hand, and at last upon
                  the church itself.
               Then we felt that need of expression which comes to us when some strong emotion
                  has been roused and gratified on the instant. We do not care to talk of the cause
                  of our joy precisely, but talk we must, of something, or deep sadness will
                  ensue.
               The beautiful church made one common subject for us, and was a pleasant theme, as
                  it satisfied our yearning for social communion. Venitia was the first to speak;
                  for the young are always restless and impatient when fronting these silent,
                  invisible barriers which stand between the world of emotion and this outside
                  life.
               "These great 'symphonies in stone,'" she repeated, "that expression is very
                  beautiful."
               "There is a fitness in comparisons made between architecture and music, Venitia,"
                  I said, "that is seldom thought of. Goëthe called architecture 'frozen music,' and
                  remarked that the influence which flows upon us from it is as that from music.
                  Lord Lindsay, too, from whom we have been quoting so much lately, says, apropos to this very subject, 'as symbolical and
                  expressive of emotion, not of definite ideas, Music and Architecture are identical
                  in principle, and distinct, the one from
                  Painting and Sculpture, the other from Poetry or verse,—and not only distinct, but
                  independent of them to such a degree that, in proportion as they rise to absolute
                  perfection, the addition of words to the one, or of subsidiary design to the
                  other, becomes not only unnecessary, but obtrusive.'"*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *Lord Lindsay's Christian Art, Vol. II. p. 13.
               
               I then gave her a short and rapid outline of the deep symbolic meaning contained
                  in the construction of a church when architects were the great poets and wrote
                  their epics in stone. The position of the church had to be first considered. It
                  was placed towards the east in memory of the birth of our blessed Lord. It was
                  built on a hill or elevated place if possible as an emblem of divine superiority,
                  and also as an intermediate place between heaven and earth.
               These two points obtained, then rose the church. Four parts were essential to it,
                  the porch, the nave, the choir, and the sanctuary, as emblems of the life of the
                  penitent, of the Christian, the saint, and the angel. Thus in the early ages of
                  the Church, the penitents, called audientes and
                     prostrati, prostrated themselves in the porch
                  during the offering of the Sacrament, not being considered pure enough to be
                  present during the holiest part of the celebration.
               In the nave were the consistentes or members. In
                  the ambo, or choir, which was always elevated a
                  step or two above the nave, the clergy or participantes sat: while at the sanctuary stood the representative
                  of our blessed Lord offering the Holy Sacrifice.
               The church sometimes had four doors, two symbolical of earthly life, specioræ portæ; two of celestial life, portæ sanctæ. The sanctuary, which could be entered
                  only by the clergy, was separated from the choir and nave by a chancel or
                  balustrade, which prevented the laity from intruding, expressing in a mystical
                  form the barrier which separates heaven from earth, and opens only to one who is
                  dead to the world, such as the priest consecrated to the service of the altar.
               In the representations which decorated the church those on the left side were
                  subjects taken from this life, those on the right side from the future life. The
                  form of the cross in the ground plan of the church was in memory of the
                  crucifixion of our blessed Lord: the absis indicated the place where his head
                  rested. The absis, or apsis, as it is sometimes spelled, is the termination of the
                  choir; the altar was often placed there, although in many churches of Italy the
                  altar will be found in front of the choir, especially in churches which have
                  religious brotherhoods attached to them. The chapels, which were placed often
                  around the absis, were symbols of the glory or aureole. The transepts were the arms of the cross.
               In some churches there were three doors and three gable-ends; these signified the
                  Trinity. The beautiful Catharine-wheel window meant also the Unity as consecrated
                  in Christ, the Light of the Church, from whose Greek monogram its shape was
                  probably taken,—the well-known monogram formed of the initial of the name of
                  Christ in Greek.
               The monsters that supported the pillars of the church, or placed on the roof as
                  gargoyle heads, had various meanings; they were talismans to frighten off evil
                  spirits, or indicated evil spirits driven out of the Church by the Sacred Presence
                  within. The crypt which is to be found under some Basilicas, and which is often
                  almost a subterranean ranean church,
                  signified the moral death of man. The cruciform shape of the church recalled also
                  the Atonement; the cupola, heaven.*

                     par M. Alfred Maury.
               
               "I love Gothic architecture best of all," Janet remarked; "and yet the Lombard
                  style, so much of which we shall see in Italy, has its own peculiar beauty."
               "Before I came to Europe," I answered, "I was sure I should never be content with
                  anything but the pure Gothic; my opinion, however, has changed very much. I now
                  find more repose and calm beauty in the circular arches, horizontal lines, and
                  expanding cupola of the Lombard architecture. The Gothic, with its pointed arches,
                  springing vaults, and elaborate tracery, fatigues me beyond expression. There is
                  infinite rest and peacefulness in the beautiful Basilica. The Lombard church, with
                  its octagonal baptistery and the graceful campanile or bell tower grouped around
                  it, seems to me just the perfection of religious architecture. It is so complete
                  and satisfying, while the Gothic is more like human life, yearning, aspiring,
                  incomplete."
               "The Gothic is an emblem of the unapproachable ideal," said Janet. "However, I
                  will not argue with you, for, like all new converts, you are of course bigoted.
                  Your excellent author, Lord Lindsay, says, you may possibly remember, that the
                  mind capable of comprehending the Gothic would be likely to appreciate the Classic
                  more justly than the devotee of the Classic would the Gothic."
               The Sacristan, just at this moment, told us, with many civil excuses, that the
                  hour for closing the church had arrived; so we left our fine cupola seat on the
                  Santa Marie de Carignan, though very loath to do so, and thus put an end to our
                  pleasant talk on the calm Greek Basilica and the restless Teuton Church.
               On returning to our carriage we found we had nearly an hour at our disposal, for
                  we had given orders that dinner should not be served until after sunset, that we
                  might have all the daylight for sight-seeing. We drove again through the Strada
                  Carlo Alberti, which fronts the harbor.
               When we reached the Douane we alighted and walked on the marble-floored promenade,
                  which extends from the Douane, or Custom-House, to the Darsena, or Water Dock, and
                  Marine Arsenal. This walk or terrace is supported on fine porticos, and is one of
                  the beauties of the city; from it the whole port can be seen.
               We looked up at the Douane very earnestly, when Janet told us that in it were the
                  rooms which had been formerly used for the famous Bank of St. George, which had
                  begun to receive deposits and make loans before Columbus crossed the Atlantic; it
                  was the India House of the Middle Ages.
               Our courier, a quiet, intelligent person, showed us a heavy iron chain, which
                  hangs over the principal entrance door; it was formerly the chain with which the
                  Pisans closed their gates, and which the Genoese, after the fatal battle of
                  Meloria, in 1290, broke and carried off in triumph to Genoa, nearly six hundred
                  years ago!
               It was the hour of sunset, and, though a mid-winter month, the air was soft and
                  balmy. We returned to the carriage, and drove slowly, enjoying the lovely sight of
                  the sunrise and sunset shores of the Genoese Gulf, as they are called,—Riviera di
                  Levante, where the coast stretches out towards Tuscany in the east; and Riviera di
                  Ponente, where the shore leads off towards Nice in the west. We examined the distance with our glasses.
                  The long western coast, with its Lantern, or Lighthouse, at Cape St. Benigne, was
                  brilliantly illuminated with the twilight glories, for the sky was 
                     
                        "Robed in flames and amber light,
                        The clouds in thousand liveries dight."
                     
                  
               
               Nearer to us, on a rocky terrace projecting out on the water, almost in front of
                  the port, we observed a group of ilex-trees; and back of them, the palace of
                  Genoa's great Admiral, Andrea Doria, who gave his state a Constitution which
                  lasted near three hundred years.
               As we talked of this Palazzo Doria, its famous master, and the regal banquet he
                  had given to Charles V. on that ilex-shaded terrace, we were very naturally led to
                  the memory of his unfortunate young rival, Count Fieschi.
               "In these very waters of the Darsena," I remarked, "the unhappy young man
                  perished. It was just touch and go with Admiral Doria's power then; but for that
                  fatal midnight mistep of the young Count, history might have had a different tale
                  to tell. At the moment Fieschi was treating the Marquis di Sauli so haughtily, he
                  was probably planning his conspiracy; therefore, was it, that he did not like
                  being approached as an equal when dreaming of sovereignty.
               "'Madam,' he said to his startled wife, on that sorrowful night three hundred
                  years ago, when he disclosed to her his intended revolt, 'you shall never see me
                  again, or you shall see everything in Genoa under your feet.'
               "She never did see him again! He left his palace; one short hour after, when he
                  was stepping on board the captain galley, which lay here in this Darsena, to take
                  command, and bring his masterly-planned conspiracy to a successful conclusion, the
                  plank broke on which he strode. Nothing could be seen, for it was dark midnight;
                  but a plash of heavy armor falling on the sullen waters was heard, a plunge, a
                  short gurgle, that was all! The Fieschi pride had met its fall; and the long line
                  of popes, cardinals, and great generals ended in this young noble man of
                  twenty-two, while his ill-fated ambition became a mere fact for history to mention
                  and people to forget, until, three centuries after, a bold young German poet made
                  it into a famous play; for although Schiller's Conspiracy of Fieschi may not be
                  equal in literary merit to his other historical dramas, it is more popular on the
                  German stage than anything he wrote, except the Robbers."
               "It was the old political quarrel between Guelph and Ghibelline," observed Janet,
                  "that struggle which had then been raging five hundred years. Doria was a Guelph
                  or Papal adherent; Fieschi, a Ghibelline or Imperialist. You should not be
                  sympathizing with young Fieschi, Ottilie; he did not belong to your side of the
                  question at all."
               "No; that is very true," I replied; "but Fieschi was bold, young, aimed high,—and
                  failed! Nine times out of ten that is the side on which women will be found,
                  utterly regardless of all reason, principle, or opinion, simply from admiration
                  for that which she does not possess,—high courageous daring; and tender, loving
                  pity for that which is so often her own fate,—failure!"
               The twilight deepened; the driver turned his horses' heads towards the hotel, and
                  quickened their gait. In a short while after, we were enjoying a capital dinner,
                  and a merry talk on the trifles of the present moment, quite forgetting for the
                  while history's tales of mingled luck and wanluck.
            
            
               
               PLANTING ROOTS.
               
                  NAPLES,—Strada Mergellina.
               
               I HAVE no visit to Pisa or Civita Vecchia to tell of,—no sweet raptures over the
                  voyage from Genoa to this place, on the beautiful Mediterranean, with historical
                  memories aroused at every turn. During the whole period I was ill,—ill in body and
                  mind, heart and soul.
               Apprehension stalked beside me like an evil genius, stretching out its long,
                  spectral finger to deaden every pleasure. A crowd of forms surrounded me, all the
                  shadowy beings that people the lands of presentiment and memory; and there arose
                  before me " those towering gates of the Past which seem to stand forever open."
                  Once in a while the eager, hot breath of love and longing sweeps aside the sombre
                  curtain, and discloses for one brief instant joys, hopes, and aspirations forever
                  gone; then the black folds fall with dumb, appalling weight, and we move onward
                  oppressed with the dreary thought, that forever in this life our hands are
                  unclasped from the loved one's neck, our lips forever parted, our confidences
                  forever stilled, for the ear of the fond, indulgent friend is filled with the dust
                  and ashes of death!
               But these sorrowful thoughts are quite out of place here; they sound like harsh
                  dissonances in a beautiful melody. It seems impossible to be sad under such a sky
                  and breathing such an atmosphere. The simple play of light and shade over the
                  heavens, and on the beautiful land and sea, produces on me the effect of sweet
                  succeeding harmonies in some musical creations,—Mozartian, for it is joyful and
                  fresh.
               We are enchanted with this city; with its picturesque streets paved with lava; its
                  beautiful surroundings; its buildings, telling so many legends of olden times; and
                  its lovely bay, whose shores, from one arm to the other, are crowded with memories
                  of poetic myths and historic facts.
               I never shall forget the effect produced by the first sight of Vesuvius,—" that
                  stall of the incessant stamping thunder-steeds." In front of us lies Capri, where
                  Tiberius sinned,—and suffered. Farther off to the right, a little hidden by those
                  beautiful elm-crowned heights of Posilippo, lie "the heavenly hills," true
                  mountains of azure, Ischia and Procida, each bearing a chaplet of memories; and
                  Nisida too, where Brutus and Portia parted to meet no more.
               Then follows Baiæ, with its ruins, telling of those old voluptuous days when
                  Romans came to its baths in the gay season, " to enact the Greek," as they said.
                  They had in their language one short word, Græcari,
                     græcatus, græcanicus, which meant something pleasant but wrong, and
                  this word they applied to the lives they led at Baiæ. They put aside with business
                  all the stern personal habits of Rome, they loosened their robes, took off their
                  sandals, and indulged in recreations which Roman eyes could hardly distinguish
                  from vices.*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *Merivale's Rome.
               
               But Baiæ has another memory, a buried tomb, the earthly trace of which is lost;
                  but not the tradition, for a poet has
                  made it immortal. Petrarch visited the grave of the great Scipio Africanus at
                  Baiæ, and leaning over read, "Ingrate patrie,"
                  chiselled on the stone which has now crumbled to dust.
               Between us and Baiæ, however, at Posilippo, stands a poet's grave, which is not
                  yet levelled and lost in the bosom of mother earth. Though some antiquarians may
                  call it a mere columbarium, Petrarch believed it
                  to be Virgil's tomb, and planted a laurel on its green summit.
               Naples, beautiful Naples, beneath whose burning breast sleeps the siren
                  Parthenope! Here Virgil lived, drank deep of poesy, and gave "imp feathers to the
                  wings of his fancy from harsher, stronger studies." Here Tasso was born, and held
                  consoling converse with his demon. Here Petrarch feasted, and Boccaccio loved.
                  Naples, the golden, the glorious, whose chalice of beauty is filled to
                  overflowing! 
                     
                        "No more, no more
                        The worldly shore
                        Upbraids me with its loud uproar;
                        With dreamful eyes
                        My spirit lies
                        Under the walls of Paradise!"*
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  *Read's Drifting.
               
               Our lodgings are pleasantly situated on the Mergellina, which is the western
                  branch of the Riviera di Chiaja extension,—that part which fronts this beautiful
                  Vesuvian Bay,—just on the hem of the great city. We are in an old palazzo, a
                  square solid mass of white stone several stories in height; its different floors
                  run off irregularly, so as to form terraces for the various suites of apartments
                  contained in it.
               This palazzo, like all other buildings of the kind, has in its centre an open
                  square, called a court-yard, opening on the street with a huge gateway. This
                  gateway is flanked on either side by the porteress's lodge and her dwelling rooms.
                  At the window of the lodge is hung a large frame containing the cards of the
                  different occupants of the palazzo. We amused ourselves looking over it this
                  morning, when the porteress, a pretty, civil-spoken woman, put into it our cards.
                  We found there a principezza and an excellenza, among other notorieties.
               When we enter the court-yard we find a motley group and strange occupants,
                  according to American ideas of the entrance to a palace containing an ambassador
                  and a princess. The place is as crowded and probably more noisy than it was in
                  those " grand old times," when the count or baron to whom the palace belonged
                  assembled in it his retainers. There are poultry, yelping curs, and dirty children
                  rolling in the mud-puddles,—for our courtyard is an untidy place, as are most of
                  them,—and noisy men and women screaming out this shrill Neapolitan dialect.
               The place is so novel to us that we often stop a few moments in the morning, as we
                  are stepping into our carriage from the broad white marble slab at the foot of the
                  handsome stone stairway leading to our suite of apartments. There are the men hard
                  at work, and the women busy gossiping. These Neapolitan women of the lower class
                  are a lazy, listless set, and remind us of what Thackeray said of "every Irish
                  gentleman needing another Irish gentleman to wait on him," for every Neapolitan
                  woman seems to have at least one man, if not more, to wait on her; and they are
                  not a pretty race either, but show their mixed blood of Moor and Spaniard, making
                  an ugly, mongrel Italian.
               
               The first floor of all these palazzos has, beside the porter's home, the stables
                  and coach-houses. Carriages and horses consequently take up a good part of the
                  place. In one corner a coach will be receiving its daily cleaning and the horses
                  their rubbing down; in another part of the yard a fine establishment will be
                  waiting on its owner, who is paying a visit to some friend in one of the
                  numberless apartments of the palazzo, while the tired coachman sleeps on the
                  box.
               In the early morning, and at sunset, our court-yard is a much more curious place:
                  it becomes a sort of farmyard, and is filled with cows and goats, which are
                  brought in to supply the different occupants of the palazzo with milk; once in a
                  while a goat clatters its little pan-like heels, up the stone steps of one of the
                  various passageways, to the apartment of some invalid, who must drink goat's milk
                  fresh and warm.
               This lowing of cattle and tinkle of cow-bells has a sweet pastoral sound, and
                  pleasing too, making us think of green meadows and rich pastures while living in a
                  large, crowded city. At sunset, when the Riviera di Chiaja is crowded with
                  brilliant equipages dashing along, filled with the rank and fashion of this Paris
                  of Italy, the eye is struck with the curious appearance these flocks of goats and
                  herds of cattle present, pouring down from the hills of Posilippo into the broad,
                  gay thoroughfare, to spread themselves throughout the various streets, as if going
                  into farms and dairies.
               Virgil's Bucolics and Georgics rise to Janet's lips from her well-stored memory;
                  and this evening, as I sat on the terrace listening to these rural sounds and
                  gazing dreamily over the Posilippean hills, bathed in the gold and purple of the
                  sunset, their beautiful bases washed by the glittering waters of this Vesuvian
                  Bay, placing her hand on my shoulder, she repeated, with her pretty, earnest
                  enjoyment of the memory, which took all air of pedantry from it, even supposing
                  any one could have been so ungenerous as to imply its presence,—
               "Thus of the culture of fields and flocks and of trees I sung, whilst great Cæsar
                  at the deep Euphrates was thundering in war, was victoriously dispensing laws
                  among the willing nations, and pursuing the path to Olympus. At that time me,
                  Virgil, sweet Parthenope nourished, flourishing in the studies of inglorious ease;
                  who warbled pastoral songs, and, adventurous through youth, sung thee, O Tityrus,
                  under the covert of a spreading beech."
               The third floor of this palazzo, according to our counting, is, nevertheless, the
                     premier piano with Italians,—that is, the
                  first lodging-floor for gentlefolk. On this floor are our rooms,—a charming suite,
                  consisting of parlor, dining-rooms, and bedrooms; part of them opening on a
                  terrace; the parlor and dining-room are on the west side; from them we can look
                  over to the glorious hills of Posilippo, while from my bedroom window 
                     
                        "Ischia smiles
                        O'er liquid miles;
                        And yonder bluest of the isles,
                        Calm Capri waits,
                        Her sapphire gates
                        Beguiling to her bright estates."*
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  *Read's Drifting.
               
               The view from the terrace is ravishing. In front is the beautiful bay; to the
                  right are the heights of Posilippo; and on the left the town seems to draw back,
                  to give us a full view of the Sorrentine promontory and that great altar Mount Vesuvius, which is forever
                  sending up its incense into the high heavens.
               Behind our palazzo rise graceful hills, crowned with fair villas and "clad with
                  greenery." Beside it is a tufa-hill, in which are hollowed out huge picturesque
                  arches, half in ruins, with vines and the tender-hued, feathery-leafed,
                  maiden-hair fern clambering up around the stones. Above this tufa-hill, houses
                  seemed piled on houses; and, if I lean over the terrace side and stretch my neck a
                  little, I can see on another hill far above us a carouba-tree, whose round,
                  cauliflower-shaped top brings back to me my earliest ideas of Italy; for, ever
                  since I can remember, one of these trees was as necessary in my mind to the making
                  up of an Italian as poplars and willows for a French landscape.
               We were very lucky in obtaining these apartments; and this pleasant good fortune
                  came to us through a social connection which Janet and I have, with one of the
                  foreign ministers and his wife, both charming accomplished persons.
               All the morning we have been out "planting our roots," as Janet says. We have
                  called on our minister and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Rochester; opened our accounts
                  with the pleasant English banker, Mr. Iggulden; and established ourselves as
                  subscribers and good customers at "Detken's," the "Foreign Book Store and
                  Circulating Library," where they speak all manner of known and unknown tongues,
                  and keep a most attractive collection of new books, photographs, and journals.
               Venitia's piano is under the tuner's hands, and she is busy sorting her music.
                  Janet is making our apartments look habitable. The only coquetry Janet shows is in
                  the arranging of furniture and the effective display of attractive
                  room-ornaments.
               She is placing piles of pleasant books about; stereoscopic stands, with fine views
                  just at hand's grasp; neat portefeuilles of
                  engravings and fine photographs; and diminutive easels, with beautiful little
                  pictures on them, standing on the tables and consoles. A few costly ornaments are here and there, not many; a
                  small Sevres vase or two, and tapering amber, and ruby-hued Bohemian, and old
                  Venetian glasses; some rare bronzes,—just enough to touch the rich, high tone of
                  luxury, without having the artistic freshness overpowered. Then, as if scattered
                  by a Flora's hand, there are delicious bouquets; clusters of rich purple violets;
                  anemones, whose deep scarlet is softened by the cool neutral tint of heliotrope
                  sprays; and delicate mignonette.
               And I? What am I doing? Filling up my journal; trying to remember some of the
                  clever information which the intelligent minister gave us this morning. He has
                  certainly one of the freshest, most attractive minds I have ever met with. His
                  description of the topography of this place was not only graphic and clear, but
                  also very interesting.
               The town is divided by a ridge of hills into two parts, the old and the new town.
                  The different elevations of this ridge take the names of Capo di Monte, St. Elmo,
                  and Pizzofalcone; the termination of it is the promontory on which stands that
                  Castel del' Ovo, considered by Froissart one of the strongest forts in the world,
                  "which only could be taken by necromancy or the help of the Devil," but which has
                  a sweeter memory to us than all Froissart's mystical accounts. In this Castel del'
                  Ovo, Robert the Wise, and the happy, light-hearted artist Giotto, had many a merry
                  hour together, when the father of modern painting was decorating its walls with
                     those wonderful frescoes which have
                  unfortunately disappeared,—gone, doubtless, as Mr. Rochester, our minister,
                  observed, to that land of fantasy Gautier whimsically imagined, which contains all
                  the divine lost landscapes ever painted, and whose inhabitants are the lovely
                  figures created by art, "in granite, marble, or wood, on walls, canvas, or
                  crystal," which have perished.
               But, to return to our real living land. The ridge of hills of which I speak,
                  united to the graceful indentations of the bay, forms two crescents in the outline
                  of the town. The beautiful bosom of hills on which the town is built slopes down
                  gracefully, stretching out into the superb, arm-like promontories of Misenum and
                  Sorrento, which seem to embrace tenderly the Mediterranean.
               On this central ridge stands St. Elmo's Castle, the next great feature, after
                  Vesuvius, in all pictures of Naples,—another of those fortified palaces of Robert
                  the Wise. This St. Elmo height explained to me the reason of the beautiful bridge
                  which spans one of the most thronged streets of the old town, Strada Chiaja, and
                  which arrested my attention yesterday when we were walking. It is called the Ponte
                  di Chiaja, and is a viaduct, connecting St. Elmo with Pizzofalcone, the hill which
                  terminates in the promontory of Castel del' Ovo.
               To the east of this ridge lies the old town. In it are the Royal Palace, and a
                  superb city artery, called Strada di Toledo, which sweeps from the bay at the
                  Santa Lucia coast, or whart, clear through the great throbbing
                  heart of this tumultuous city, for the distance of a mile and a half. In the
                  Middle Ages this street, which is now the centre of modern Naples, was out on the
                  very edge of the suburbs, having been built on the fosses of the old city (1540),
                  by Don Pedro di Toledo, that wise Viceroy of a wise Emperor, whose government is
                  remembered as a precious legend to this day, both by the presence of good works
                  and the memory of good acts.
               This morning we stood at the foot of this grand street, on the fine, spacious
                  square called Largo del Palazzo, Reale, with the Royal Palace on one side of us,
                  and a modern Pantheon, San Francesca di Paolo, on the other. In front of us was
                  Canova's equestrian statue, which has contrived, like Goldsmith's chest of
                  drawers, not only a double, but a treble debt to pay;—first it was Napoleon, then
                  Murat, now Charles III.! What shall it be next? Louis Napoleon, Victor Emmanuel,
                  or——Garibaldi? Poor statue and poor Italy!
               We laughed over this history of changes, and made many speculations on its future;
                  then grew silent, as we gazed up into this noisiest street of Europe, with its sea
                  of human beings surging to and fro, and its wave-crests of carriages. The noise
                  that arose from it, like the alternate come and go of an ocean's grand pulse, made
                  us feel a little bewildered, and very still.
               To the west of this central ridge lies the second crescent, or new city, called
                  Chiaja, on the outskirts of which we live.
               After the Toledo, which it surpasses in beauty, the next great street of Naples is
                  the one running around the bay, skirting gracefully the little indentations of the
                  coast from one end of the city to the other, and bearing as many names as any
                  Spanish viceroy might.
               This street starts from the Sebeto, on the very outer edge of the old city, at the
                  Ponte della Maddelena, where the road to Portici leads off. First it is called La
                  Marinella, which used to be the old head-quarters of the Lazzaroni; but the
                  Cantastorie have now taken possession of
                  it, those marvellous public street-singers of Naples, who, as Mr. Rochester told
                  us, sing at this day the old mediæval poem of Rinaldo and his Paladins.
               Passing by the Castel del Carmine, Masaniello's stronghold, it becomes Stradas
                  Nuova and Carlito; then it reaches Porto Piccolo, the port of old Palæpolis, the
                  conquering of which Greek town (323 B. C.) gave a Roman prætor a triumph. The Molo
                  follows, which is now the rendezvous of the dying-out race of the Lazzaroni.
               This brings us to the Castel Nuovo, built in that Italian morn of Dante and Giotto
                  (1283), by the brother of St. Louis, Charles of Anjou. A little farther on is the
                  Royal Palace, from whose Largo, or Square, springs the Toledo, at which place this
                  coast-street comes out to the famous wharf of Santa Lucia, the great fish market
                  of Naples, where "fruits of the sea,"—"frutto di
                     mare,"—as they call them, are sold in great abundance.
               Now we have arrived at the little promontory which lies at the base of the
                  Pizzofalcone Hill, on which stands the Castel del' Ovo; and the road, as it sweeps
                  around this place between the foot of the hills and the little jutting-out bit of
                  land, is called Chiatamone.
               After this central point is passed, there comes another pretty sweep around an
                  indentation of the shore, which is named Vittoria; then the street opens fairly
                  into the new town quarter, called Chiaja, at which place this graceful coast-road,
                  or street, bears the name of Riviera di Chiaja, Chiaja Shore; this part of it is
                  the celebrated promenade of Naples, and has on it the narrow strip of a park,
                  called Villa Reale.
               Mr. Rochester traced out the whole route of this street for us on a map this
                  morning; then, when he reached this point, he rolled the map-table to the balcony
                  of his library window, and pointed across the broad Riviera di Chiaja, on which
                  his palazzo fronts, to a villa, or park, filled with a variety of shade-trees.
               "There," said he, "is the Villa Reale. It is about five thousand feet long by two
                  hundred in width, and on the sea side it has a fine wall and parapet. You see
                  sentinels standing at the gates of the iron railing which separates it from the
                  Riviera di Chiaja. Only the gentry and nobility are allowed to use it. It is the
                  only spot in Naples into which the lower classes are not permitted to enter. They
                  may invade your court-yard, and even the steps of your palazzo; keep house
                  literally out on the sidewalks of the finest streets; cook, eat, wash, live, and
                  sleep in front of the noblest palace; but into the Villa Reale they cannot enter,
                  except one day in the year, the eighth of September, at the great festival of
                  Santa Maria di Piedigrotta. It is an agreeable lounging-place, with pleasant
                  winding paths and fine broad walks, a terrace running out into the sea, some
                  grottos with statuary, two small handsome temples to Virgil and Tasso, and
                  pleasant fountains. The trees are mostly acacias and oaks, with some few Oriental
                  shrubs.
               "Now we will come back to the Riviera di Chiaja. After you pass the Villa Reale,
                  you will observe that it divides into two branches; the left, or lower one,
                  running by the sea-shore, is called Strada Mergellina,—that is where your palazzo
                  stands. The right, or upper branch, is the Strada di Piedigrotta; follow it some
                  distance, and you will arrive at Virgil's tomb, which stands at the entrance of
                  the celebrated Grotto of Posilippo, the one Petrarch and Corinne made
                  famous,—called also Grotto di Pozzuoli. This is a tunnel, over two thousand
                     feet long, and twenty-one feet wide.
                  In the after part of the day this Grotto is lighted by the western sun, but during
                  the morning and midday, you will find it pretty much as Seneca describes it,
                  'Darkness made visible'; and to foot-passengers it seems a terrifying place, for
                  it is nearly always crowded with two streams of people going and coming, screaming
                  donkey-drivers, carriages, and peasants. But once through the Grotto, the road
                  leads off to Pozzuoli, where it finds the little bit of Mergellina that has been
                  straying gracefully around by the sea. At Pozzuoli the two join, and then, as the
                  old song sings, it goes, 
                     'Over the hills and far away';
                   out, if you please to follow it, Mrs. Dale, to that Eubœan coast of Cumæ,
                  where 'the anchor with tenacious fluke moored the ships of Æneas, and the bending
                  sterns fringed the margin of the shore.'"
               When we returned to the carriage, on leaving the palazzo of the embassy, Venitia,
                  with a playful, knowing air, directed the driver to take us to "Detkens," as if
                  quite at home in this new city.
               "The truth is," she said, "that although I cannot help feeling as Goethe did in
                  Sicily, when you and Ottilie will persist, like the Sicilian guide, in 'marring,
                  by your ill-timed erudition, my refreshing feelings of peace, calling up departed
                  spectres, and reviving tumults and horrors,' I must, in self-defence, do as the
                  contradictory German poet did at Palermo, rush off to purchase a Homer and Virgil;
                  for I find I am to be persecuted with learned allusions on all sides, in these
                  eternally classic heights of the ancient world. So, while you and Mr. Rochester
                  were dancing stately tongue minuets à la cour, I
                  learned from his agreeable wife that this place,—'Detkens,'— to which we are now
                  driving, is where bookish strangers most do congregate, finding there all manner
                  of nice things."
               To "Detkens" accordingly we drove, and Venitia—who has not Janet's cleverness in
                  old tongues, never having been willing to study any but modern languages and
                  music, which have needed but little application on her part—supplied herself with
                  translations of all the old poets and historians she could find.
            
            
               
               ELECTRA.
               VENITIA is playing fugues. How positive the dear girl is, but very clever and
                  original. She has just finished a fugue of Bach, with a throbbing beat in it like
                  a full heart. It is the one in the Chromatic Fantasia,—that Fantasia so soft and
                  tender and flowing in its modulations, that one would scarcely imagine a single
                  deviation had been made from its fundamental harmony. He was, indeed, a great
                  master, this same John Sebastian Bach. While listening to his fugues I forget that
                  they are exercises of deep thought, great intellectual power, and profound
                  knowledge,—mental musical feats,—for he throws into them a rhythmical life that is
                  full of freedom; they are not mere themes transposed into different keys, one hand
                  following the other slavishly, but independent, reasoning poems.
               Of a totally different nature are Handel's fugues, and yet, to my ears and taste,
                  not less masterly. They are not so self-contained or persistent, but quite as free
                  and strong. Some few of them give me more pleasure than Bach's even, especially
                  the one Venitia has just commenced, the superb fugue in E minor (mi); it sounds
                  like the concentrated roll of mid-ocean.
               But I do not like her execution of fugues. She thinks they must be rigid, because
                  they are exact. While she executes other compositions freely, stamping them with
                  the sharp impress of her unmistakable genius, she shows the student in these; you
                  can hear the beat of the metronome through every measure. She needs emancipating,
                  as it were, in almost everything. Not that she is bound by Janet, or me, or any
                  one; on the contrary, her opinions are independent enough. She is a little
                  dogmatical and obstinate once in a while; at such times we combat her, but are
                  very careful not to repress her in any way. But she is angular, and hard, and too
                  devoted to technical minutiæ. I feel discouraged sometimes, and fancy that this
                  enchantment results from the fairy-like spell which extreme culture and exquisite
                  surroundings of social refinement exercise over some natures. There have never
                  been any rough points in her life since her recollection; no heavy shadows to
                  bring out rich, strong lights; it is this smoothness of existence which deprives
                  her of comprehending some things in Art as well as in Life, seeing only the cold,
                  bald, matter-of-fact side of the crystal, entirely losing sight of the beautiful
                  prismatic play of Fancy and Poesy. She would fain touch, hold, weigh, and measure
                  all things, never dreaming that the sweetest, dearest, loveliest emotions in this
                  existence are but the shadows of a dream,—intangible, inexpressible, like the
                  faint odor of a rare fruit or flower, the delicate droplet of a luscious grape,
                  the perishable down on Psyche's wing.
               But to return to Handel's fugue.
               There are some creations of Art which can never be comprehended until one has been
                  anchored as far out in the deep waters of sorrow as the master who created them;
                  therefore I will not complain that Venitia is not capable of seizing the meaning of this great E
                  minor fugue. God forbid that she should ever have her ears, eyes, and taste
                  sharpened into consciousness on such a brackish wave of grief as is contained in
                  it! As I read over the notes of the music lying near me on my writing-table, I
                  think of the composer, and of his life, which was so void of love and tenderness.
                  The solitary suffering of Handel is betrayed in such passages as "He was despised
                  and rejected of men," in the Messiah,—which he is said to have written with hot
                  tears raining down on his manuscript, mingling with the ink,—and this fugue, which
                  makes every fibre in one's being vibrate with emotion.
               Poor, passionate Handel! A haughty pride, almost Satanic, made his life what it
                  was. In his youth he loved a beautiful young girl, and she adored him. Her parents
                  looking upon him as an inferior, insulted him. He never forgave them. So keen was
                  the wound that even when at last they consented to the marriage to save her life,
                  he refused; and the poor girl died of a broken heart,—of the harshness of her
                  lover, not of her family.
               Now go play that fugue in E minor, and think of this opening theme in his
                  life-fugue,—of his haughty reiterated anger, which, like that thrice-repeated B in
                  the music, led through all the stormy modulations of his fierce, contentious
                  existence. In every measure of it you will hear the passionate love and passionate
                  anger which combated together, resulting in a life of sullen loneliness for him,
                  and death for the woman he loved.
               We were talking of Vêpres Siciliennes, after
                  sunset, " over our Hyson," as Lamb says, " which we are old-fashioned enough to
                  drink unmixed still of an evening." For we all love our tea; and Janet quotes with
                  great satisfaction isfaction DeQuincey's approving declaration, that "Tea will
                  always be the favorite beverage of the intellectual." I had been singing the
                     Bolero of Helène, in the fifth act of the Vêpres.
                  After I had finished it, I came out on the terrace, humming the sparkling motivo of this enchanting passage, while I took my cup
                  from Janet's hand, she of course being tea-maker.
               We drink our tea on the terrace, where we can look over on Vesuvius, down on the
                  gay-thronged Mergellina, out on the sparkling bay, and up on the beautiful hills
                  and soft heavens. This glorious view, the delicious atmosphere, and this
                  bewitching bit of melody combined, touched Venitia unconsciously; for a few
                  moments her little silvery thread of a voice united gayly with mine, in the
                  passionate bursts of the short-lived joy which this Bolero expresses.
               "Bigoted as you think I am," she said, "I like the Vêpres; it has
                  the French élan in it. It might have been an
                  early effort of Meyerbeer, when he was under the influence of the golden Capri
                  wine of Tancrede, in those gay Romildo e
                     Costanza and Crocciato days; and I
                  am giving it great praise when I say this. I know we do not agree about Meyerbeer,
                  but I think one cause of your opinion is, that you have never heard his music as I
                  have."
               "You may be right, Venitia, for I have never heard a Meyerbeer opera to
                  advantage."
               "And I," she exclaimed, with enthusiasm,—"I have heard the finest of them in
                  Paris, where they were brought out superbly. Think of seeing and hearing that
                  grand creature, Viardot-Garcia, in ' The Huguenots'!"
               "She whose ugliness," interrupted Janet, with a laugh, "is, according to Heine,
                  noble; and 'when she opened her great mouth, with its white, sparkling teeth,
                     and smiled with a horrible sweetness
                  and gracious grincement,' made the poor nervous
                  poet think of leopards, giraffes, and young elephants."
               "Yes, that same Pauline Garcia, whose ugliness is beauty to my eyes," answered
                  Venitia, seriously. "But we were talking of Meyerbeer," she continued. "You say he
                  sounds labored, Ottilie; now, I enjoy his effets
                     d'industrie, because they result in such a marvellous control and
                  power of harmony. And yet the labor is not without inspiration, for a divine unity
                  of thought exists throughout his compositions. His orchestra is one grand whole;
                  it is like a huge heart, palpitating and bounding with every varying emotion, from
                  the 'Piffpaff del fuoco,' in the first act of
                  'The Huguenots,' to that solemn and grand fourth act of the same opera; or that
                  heart-rending Andante of Fidés, in the famous fifth act of Le Prophète. Wait until you hear this great master's gorgeous
                  instrumentation, before you call him labored, and wanting in clearness of thought.
                  His music is not sensational, like that of Verdi; it thrills me, not to the heart,
                  that would be momentary, but to the very centre of my brain. It is impossible to
                  talk while hearing one of his operas. You may take Verdi for flânering, but never Meyerbeer."
               She was in one of her most dogmatical moods, so she continued extolling Meyerbeer,
                  his rich and powerful sonorousness, his melodies so full of dignity. She expressed
                  herself so prettily, too, that I liked to listen to her, while my silence seemed
                  to pique her on to a further assertion of opinion.
               "The melodic tissue of Meyerbeer's music," she said, "is sown with seed-pearls;
                  and rubies, diamonds, and emeralds are strung and hung in glittering chaplets all
                  over it, flashing out their various brilliant rays, each one struggling with
                  playful splendor for superiority. Then his nuances are not shades; they are tints, for light mixes with the
                  normal color, as painters say, not black. His broad German manner, too, is
                  softened by the modern poetical fire which he possesses, and which gives lyric
                  effect to his superb instrumentation, thus satisfying both mind and heart."
               I could have overthrown her enthusiastic praise in two or three weak parts; and
                  Janet and I had exchanged glances upon noticing the slips made by her youthful
                  earnestness. But it would have done no good; on the contrary, chilled and
                  mortified her. So I contented myself with stating a few instrumental facts by way
                  of answer, first saying, as introduction,—
               "My dear, the very sonorousness which you admire is as painful to my ears as too
                  high and brilliant coloring in a painting is to my eyes. His power does not lie,
                  to my seeming, where we are told it should, in the idea, but in rich
                  instrumentation—"
               I was about continuing, when she interrupted me hastily.
               "The coloring of modern instrumentation is not a defect, Ottilie. A composer like
                  Meyerbeer knows how to use with masterly power the fine full palette of sounds
                  gained from modern orchestral improvements; his imagination finds new resources in
                  them; and as to the idea, how can you say that is feeble because it is decorated
                  with greater beauties? He has a right to use these fine extensive powers of
                  musical coloring; they are the natural elements of art."
               "But the greatest masters, my dear, produced greater effects without all this
                  instrumentation. Let us run over some of
                  the masterpieces of Beethoven, Mozart, and Haydn, for example. There is the grand
                  Symphony in A (La) of Beethoven; it has nothing but two horns and two trumpets.
                  The famous Symphony in C (Do) of Mozart has no more, and yet on account of its
                  power and splendor it is called the Jupiter Symphony. Then I have read somewhere—I
                  cannot give you my authorities now, but I can hunt them up for you—that only
                  fifteen of Haydn's one hundred and seventeen Symphonies have two trumpets; the
                  remaining one hundred and twelve have only two horns. Venitia, if those old
                  masters produced so fine an effect with such simple coloring, how far superior
                  must they have been to our Meyerbeers and Verdis."
               Janet here interposed,— 
                     
                        "'When we drive out, from the cloud of steam, majestical white
                           horses,
                        Are we greater than the first men, who led black ones by the mane?'
                     
                   "O ye fanatics in music! Why cannot you both be more truly catholic? These
                  different masters are like the various colors of the rainbow; some delicate, some
                  gorgeous, some delicious; celestial blue, golden, and purple, with soft violet and
                  the green of nature's garb, each lovely in itself."
               "You are right, dear Janet; your comparison is just. The rainbow is a perfect type
                  of Art,—manifold gifts working resolutely and harmoniously for a great unity, an
                  everlasting and beautiful truth. Whenever I look at a rainbow, I shall hereafter
                  remember your art-type. To me, as to all expectant souls, it should also prefigure
                  the mystery of the true life, and the longings of the many-colored instincts of
                  our varying hearts, which shall arrive in the end—but not in this world—at that
                  Unity, that great Light, which is divine."
               "But the music-rainbow," said Venitia, " let me divide it. Mozart shall be the
                  celestial blue of promise; Verdi the soft, rich purple, appealing to our senses;
                  Bellini and Donizetti many-tinted, with the tender violet hanging like a sweet
                  atmospheric haze over them, as Capri looked an hour ago; but to Meyerbeer shall be
                  given the glory that hung around the hills of Posilippo, gorgeous crimson and
                  gold. And now, Ottilie, I shall gratify you by my last comparison: to Beethoven
                  belongs the whole rainbow of beauty."
               She turned to leave the terrace, intending to go into the salon, to the piano;
                  suddenly she came back to the window, and said,—
               "O Ottilie, Mrs. Rochester told me to-day she has heard Schroeder-Devrient in '
                  Fidelio.' Just fancy what a treat it must have been, listening to 'Fidelio'—this
                  Comus of epic music, as ' Adelaide' is the sorrowful Lycidas Idyl—from the lips of
                  such an actress and singer. Remembering this has put me in the humor of playing
                  it."
               She then went to the piano, and commenced at the Introduction, or opening of the
                  third act of "Fidelio." She rendered it finely. It is a touching scene, that
                     mélodrame, where Rocco and Leonore are
                  digging in the subterranean prison of Florestan. I leaned on the iron balustrade
                  of the terrace while I listened, and looked up at the slender line of smoke
                  ascending from Vesuvius, observing the faint, sudden fire-glow which pulsated from
                  time to time at the base of this waving column of vapor. I drew a fanciful
                  comparison between this vapor and fire-glow and the effect produced by the
                  violoncello and double bass in this passage of "Fidelio."
               
               The double bass has an isolated part, broken by rests, which throws the harmony,
                  as it were, on the violoncello; but the real bass remains, notwithstanding these
                  interruptions, with the double bass. Thus this vapor, rising from "Vesuvius's
                  misty brim," continues forever streaming and floating off into the heavens, as if
                  it was the real flame; but ever and anon, broken by rests, as it were, comes in
                  the gloomy, deep throb of true fire,—short, dull even, but unmistakable, like the
                  reiterated recurrence of this passage,—  in all its various pathetic
                  forms, broken and detached though it may be, but showing that the true throb of
                  the volcanic heart of the music is there.
               Venitia then modulated into some improvised studies of curious bass passages,
                  undoubtedly suggested to her by this remarkable one; and Janet and I had a little
                  talk, which sent me to my room somewhat sad and dispirited, although it was far
                  from her intention to produce any such effect on what she calls my " too easily
                  impressed nature." The talk was something after this fashion. I have been trying
                  to forget it, by recalling the Meyerbeer argument, but in vain, and perhaps if I
                  write it down I may " lay the torturing demon." I have often found my journal good
                  for such purposes. Many a morbid evil spirit lies safe locked up in its various
                  volumes.
               As Venitia concluded the "Fidelio" passage of the mélodrame, Janet turned to me, and, resting her beautiful little
                  hand half playfully, half caressingly, on my cheek, quoted,—
                     
                        "I loved Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
                        Could not, with all their quantity of love,
                        Make up my sum."
                     
                  
               
               "I was thinking of the burial of poor Ophelia, Ottilie, during all that passage,
                  and yet cheerful Shakespeare's 'jocund wood-note wild' should not be recalled by
                  Beethoven's music. It is another Hamlet,—a religious one. Pascal I think of most
                  often when listening to Beethoven. Who was it, my friend, by the way, that called
                  Pascal a religious Hamlet?"
               "Indeed, I do not remember; but Pascal was what Goethe called Hamlet,—'a being
                  possessed with a great action, and incapable of accomplishing it.'"
               "Both had such delicate organizations," continued Janet, " as to be almost
                  feminine, and both were called upon to perform duties too strong even for the
                  ruggedest masculine natures."
               "Hamlet's nature is indeed like that of some women," I said, half to myself, as if
                  thinking aloud. "So many women seem to be introverted as he was, and also, like
                  him, possess too great a sense of their own individuality, which, if unaccompanied
                  by great energy, is apt to create morbidity, if not something worse."
               Then, rousing myself, for I felt to what a painful end the conversation was
                  tending, I tried to divert it a little.
               "I have been thinking lately, Janet, of Shakespeare's skilful use of the
                  supernatural in expressing to the reader or the audience the secret workings of
                  the mind. By means of the Ghost in Hamlet, we are shown the struggle which takes
                  place in a young heart filled with a craving for enjoyment of life,—a life of love
                  and courtly pleasure,—and the stern duty of avenging the death of a father. The
                  supernatural part gives us the key to the
                  sorrowful and strange transformation of a dreamy, pleasure-loving youth, tortured,
                  like Orestes, by the furies of his own imagination into a fitful, capricious
                  monomaniac. Hamlet, by the way, is a sort of Shakespearian Orestes."
               "Yes, in some points; but there is this distinction to be made between Greek
                  tragedy and the romantic tragedy of Shakespeare,—one is the classic Ideal, the
                  other is pure Nature. Greek tragedy is like sculpture,—one idea, and that carried
                  straight without deviation to the end; no vagueness, no doubt. The sin may have
                  arisen from Destiny; still it is sin, and must be punished by Death. You hear the
                  tramp of the guards from the opening scene; you see the instrument of Fate ready
                  to make the blow; its shadow falls sharp and dark on the victim from the first
                  moment. But in Shakespeare how different! How like nature,—like that mysterious
                  web which we see woven in real life! With picturesque and sometimes sorrowful
                  fidelity, he throws in the mingled weft of joy and grief; we have the same strange
                  triumph of the guilty, the incomprehensible suffering of the innocent, the tangled
                  braid of light and shadow, the whole weary, complicated life-knot,—all is shown in
                  its utter hopelessness, until we feel at last, as we often do in life, that Death
                  is indeed gracious in unknotting the tangle, and that the peace and rest of the
                  tomb is very sweet."
               "Shakespeare was so great, Janet, that I am not surprised posterity has doubted
                  his individual existence. His plays display gifts and wisdom never before or since
                  combined in one human being."
               "That is true; but you must remember his advantages were greater than any other
                  writer who ever existed. United to his own superiority, the period in which he
                  lived was singularly adapted to a Prophet of the New Word. It was an age advanced
                  in science and arts, and still retaining all the picturesque character of the
                  Middle Ages; the very soil and atmosphere were ready for the planting and growth
                  of the romantic drama."
               "The modern school of music, Janet, is like the romantic drama," I added, with a
                  forced attempt at continuing the conversation, for I felt my sadness increasing
                  beyond my control. "I mean the music commencing with Beethoven; not the gay,
                  joy-loving, Athenian Mozart, but from Beethoven, the sad old giant, up to poor
                  Schubert and Schumann and Chopin. There is a whole lifetime of woe, sometimes, in
                  one of their shortest creations. I wonder, Janet, if the Greeks ever suffered and
                  sorrowed as we moderns do? They seem to have been exempt from our curse; they
                  worshipped the beautiful, and raised it to their altars,—made of it God."
               "Their drama, my friend, was the voice of their ideal, not of their real life. The
                  moderns have indeed bowed down before sorrow and pain, lifted them up to their
                  most holy of holies, and there they will remain so long as the quick pulse of
                  anguish throbs in man's and woman's heart. But why are you going? It is not late.
                  Are you not well, dear?"
               "Quite well, thank you; only I wish to have a little chat with myself in my
                  journal, while I can have the benefit of Venitia's music as an inspiring
                  accompaniment. Good night."
               So here I came, and have been all this while striving to write myself quiet, but
                  in vain. The inward unrest still remains. Venitia has stopped the fugue, and is
                  now playing a passage which sounds at times like poor Florestan's delirium, that
                  grand air in "Fidelio" which is "filled with such immeasurable grief." No, it
                  sounds like the short Adagio in the
                  Beethoven Sonate, which is twin sister to the "Lauben Sonate" of the Countess
                  Juliette (Opus 2, No. 1, E flat). De Lenz says, "It is a distant echo of this
                  great air of 'Fidelio'; it is not the rhythm or the tonality which establishes the
                  analogy, it is the soul of this Adagio which is identical with Florestan's
                  aria."
               Yes, it is that Sonate she is playing; and, as I listen to her, my conversation
                  with Janet comes up in my memory, like that mounting, syncopated passage of
                  octaves which Venitia has just grasped so finely; and I think of Hamlet, and of
                  Janet's likening him to a woman. I recall his sensitive, delicate feelings, his
                  truthfulness, honor, chivalric romance, deep love, high moral code, and noble
                  nature, quite feminine in its elevation and tender purity. All this might well be
                  likened, as it was by the great German poet, to a frail porcelain vase, for to put
                  such a nature to stern uses is to shatter it.
               And thus can we say of woman. Our code is nobler, our moral nature higher than
                  man's. In intellect he may be stronger,—he is. We can freely cede him the
                  intellect, so long as we possess the other. We show this difference thus: when a
                  man feels he is wronged by his brother man, resentment is natural; and not only
                  that, to right himself, even at the bitter expense of his enemy, is a duty. It is
                  admitted by the world's practice that "society can justly be harsh upon a man for
                  being tame under insult or injury." But a woman cannot right herself as a man
                  does, and preserve her interior peace. No matter how just may be her cause, if she
                  violates the high code of her nature by leaping down from her pure, still
                  atmosphere into the hot, crowded arena, to seize on or wrest justice from the
                  hands of her oppressors, she comes out of the fray fatally wounded. Justice for
                  her is as Prince Adeb's Imam,*
                  —she must forego all hope of it, and yield "the Imam for her own soul's
                  sake."
               
                  
                  *Boker's "Prince Adeb."
               
               Characters of delicate make and subtile stamp should not, cannot contend; they
                  must endure with patience and courage, and look with sorrow and pity, not scorn
                  and anger, on their oppressors. Truly unto woman were the words of Gospel law
                  addressed: "Resist not evil, but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek,
                  turn to him the other also."
               Woe unto that feminine nature that is forced by necessity, as was Hamlet, to right
                  a great wrong. Intense mental anguish must result; and even when the assistance of
                  the Most High seems vouchsafed by the gift of courage and the mysterious power of
                  holding the poor bewildered mind well balanced,—even then she is fated, as
                  Electra, to a solemn state, dedicate as it were to sadness. All glad, joyful
                  feelings are hushed, and she will be as "an angel who has lost its way from
                  heaven, and its wings also, looking perpetually up, with a sigh and a longing to
                  return."
               Why did I touch on this nerve, and set it to aching so fiercely? Venitia's music
                  is ended. She and Janet have gone to their calm, quiet sleep. On the still, soft
                  spring air comes the noisy throb of a steamer passing near the coast, sounding
                  like the throes of some huge animal in mortal anguish. But physical pain is weak
                  when compared with this agony of the lonely heart stung with the necessity to
                  perform a stern duty, and filled with wild, passionate memories of a past forever
                  gone,—a past which planted no seed for a future in this life!
               Beat, beat, beat, comes that sorrowful steam-throb on my ears, and to its
                  melancholy sough my heart replies
                  sullenly back a dull, slow pulse. Poor heart! It sits, like Electra, mourning
                  rebelliously over its griefs.
               The steamer has passed, and I now hear the cool, passionless ripple of this
                  tideless sea breaking on a shore strewn with mysterious fragments of a long lost
                  past! 
                     
                        "And the stately ships go on
                        To the haven under the hill;
                        But O for the touch of a vanished hand,
                        And the sound of a voice that is still!
                     
                     
                        "Break, break, break
                        On thy cold gray stones, O Sea!
                        But the tender grace of a day that is dead
                        Will never come back to me."
                     
                  
               
            
            
               THE TITAN'S CHILDREN AND CAPRI THE SPHINX.
               THIS delicious climate of Naples is to work wonders upon me;—so says Mrs.
                  Rochester, the agreeable wife of the Minister. She paid us a visit last evening,
                  and gave us much clever information on the character of the atmosphere, and the
                  various winds that blow over and around this beautiful boot-like promontory of
                  Europe. The climate, from its lively action on the skin, and the variety of
                  impressions it makes on the body and mind, is capitally suited for alleviating the
                  suffering arising from all sorts of melancholy, and every kind of neurotic
                  intermittent produced by mental causes.
               Naples, more than any other place in Italy, is strongly influenced by two great
                  powers,—the volcanic soil and the wind. The atmosphere is constantly filled with
                  various gaseous emanations, sulphuric and the like, and carbonic acid is spread
                  throughout the air.
               The account Mrs. Rochester gave me of the winds of Naples interested me
                  exceedingly. The gulf or bay is open to the west and southwest. The hills of
                  Posilippo, extending around to Capodimonte, protect the city from the north wind,
                  and Monte Somma is a shelter against the east; but the northeast, southeast, west,
                     southwest, and south meet with little
                  obstruction, especially the west and southwest, which come in from the sea. The
                  south and southeast winds, called mezzogiorno and scirocco by Italians, are the
                  most disagreeable and injurious, especially to the natives; they are hot and damp,
                  favorable to vegetation, but enervating and exhausting.
               "They are, in truth, 'winds of idleness' in every sense of the word," said Mrs.
                  Rochester. "You can feel them most sensibly at the entrance of the Toledo, and
                  near the Royal Palace. I have often stood there during the blowing of a scirocco,
                  and noticed with curiosity the warm, half-visible vapor which seemed to bathe
                  everything; it permeated, like a subtile fluid, not only my whole physical nature,
                  but also my mental,—prostrating muscular energy, and even vivacity of thought. I
                  have often believed that this wind might be the unrecognized cause of Neapolitan
                  indolence and Oriental fatalism, for these people are much more affected by it
                  than we forestieri, or strangers. During its
                  blowing the sky is of a dark leaden hue."
               "This scirocco, which is so overwhelming here," remarked Janet, "is our old friend
                  the föhn of Switzerland. There, however, it is
                  of great service."
               "Yes," said Venitia, "I remember, when I was a little girl, and we were living for
                  a season or two in the Grisons, hearing the peasants there saying, 'that without
                  the föhn neither the good God nor a golden sun
                  could do anything.'"
               "This scirocco of Italy, and föhn of
                  Switzerland," continued Janet, "is the same thing as the simoom of Africa; it
                  springs up in those immense sand-plains of the Sahara, which lie exposed to the
                  rays of a tropical sun, and are easily heated. Just opposite Sicily and Italy the
                  Atlas Mountains of Africa lower their peaks, and through this passage the simoom
                  reaches the Mediterranean; then, after pouring its hot breath on the Peninsula, it
                  sweeps up the Rhone valley as through a tunnel, and spreads over Switzerland. It
                  is the saving wind of the Suisse; for, without its gracious presence, the snows on
                  the Alps would never melt, and the glaciers, constantly increasing, would in time
                  invade the valleys, and make an ice kingdom as fearful as Dante's description of
                  Lucifer's abode in the lowest depth of Hell,— 
                     
                        'Where all the shades beneath the frozen tide
                        Transparent shone, like straws in crystal clear.'"
                     
                  
               
               After this little episode on the scirocco's wanderings, its good and evil doings,
                  we returned to the other children of the Titan who visit Naples. The notus, or
                  mezzogiorno, south wind, first cousin to the scirocco, blows oftenest in autumn.
                  It is gentle, but oppressive. The libeccio, or southwest wind, is stormy. The
                  northwest, or maestro, is not a pleasant wind in Naples: its passage over the sea
                  makes it damp. Our palazzo is so situated on the Mergellina that we shall not feel
                  it, nor do those suffer who live near the Villa Reale; but around the Chiatamone
                  this wind is very unpleasant, and causes such a lively effect on the skin and
                  nerves as to prevent some persons from living there. It is a noisy, glacial,
                  squally wind, which makes dolce Napoli as
                  disagreeable as any "common vulgar town"; in autumn and winter it visits this
                  place about one day in four.
               The tramontana, or north wind, is cold, but dry and invigorating, and serves as an
                  antidote to the scirocco (southeast) and mezzogiorno (south). But the most
                  pleasant wind in Naples is the west, or ponente. It is the conciliatory one, for
                  it softens the cold and tempers the hot blasts; under its sweet influences the
                     Cantastorie rie, or street-singers,
                  pour out their mediæval melodies, the women dance the Tarantella, and everything
                  goes as merry as a marriage bell. It is blowing now, making the bright, sunshiny
                  morning delicious; and Venitia is standing at my room window informing me of it,
                  repeating at the same time snatches of Owen Meredith's "Seaside Song."
               Now she walks away, paying the sweetest compliment to this young poet that he
                  could receive,—reciting his beautiful poetry in the soft morning air, and she as
                  lovely as the poetry. I wish she had a lover for whom she felt, as this song says,
                  "this joy of life." She is walking with all the gentle dignity of a graceful young
                  empress up and down the terrace; her step is queenly, and yet without any
                  affectation of dignity or consciousness of its fine air; it is a simple, natural
                  motion, resulting from her well-formed limbs and perfectly proportioned body. She
                  is just pronouncing these words, with a sweet beat and rhythm as musical as her
                  gait:— 
                     
                        "For o'er faint tracks of fragrance wide
                        A rapture pouring up the tide,—
                        A freshness through the heat,—a sweet
                        Uncertain sound, like fairy feet,—
                        The west wind blows my love to me."
                     
                  
               
               We spent a day at Capri last week, in company with the Rochesters and some other
                  friends. On reaching the island, we visited first the far-famed Grotto Azzurra, or
                  Blue Grotto, one of the old haunts of Roman luxury. Who does not remember Hans
                  Christian Andersen's lovely story of the "Improvvisatore," with its Blue Grotto
                  episode? Venitia, who had never read this book, sat up all the preceding night to
                  finish it; but brows never ache, nor eyes grow heavy, at twenty, so she looked
                  nearly as fresh as usual, the next day at noon, when we entered the Grotto.
               The opening of the cavern is so low and narrow that we had to lie flat in the boat
                  to enter. It is to the form and peculiar position of this opening that some
                  heliographers attribute the faëry-like atmosphere of the Grotto. They say the sea
                  is deeply imbued with light at this entrance, and emits it at every flow inside
                  the cavern. The best hour for seeing the cave is "at silent midday," 
                     "The hush of noontide quiet";
                   then the waters are sapphire-hued, the walls of the purest blue,—that India
                  shade which the Chinese call "the blue of the heavens after a rain,"—and the
                  ceiling is like the empyrean. It was at this hour we went, and seemed suddenly
                  transported to a land of dreams.
               We dipped our hands in the magic stream, and they became as alabaster, with a blue
                  light playing through them. With these spectre-like fingers we dashed up the
                  waters playfully; we seemed to be tossing up liquid gems, sapphires, and bluish
                  pearls.
               There was a sparkle on everything, as if a blue flame was lighting up and playing
                  upon the glittering surface of crystal. The whole atmosphere seemed charged with
                  blue, and the vaulted ceiling looked as if made of some azure-hued, transparent
                  substance as clear as crystal, lighted by fire-rays from above, shining down on
                  it.
               After leaving the Grotto, we loitered up the steep walk to the hotel, stopping
                  from time to time to enjoy the divine bits of landscape which came in at the
                  spaces made by the lowering of vineyard walls. After luncheon, I did not accompany
                  the rest of the party to Lo Capo, where are to be seen the remains of the famous
                  twelve palaces of Tiberius. The noon-day visit to that enchanted Grotto, followed by the long walk, had caused
                  total physical prostration; but the repose which I took while they were gone, and
                  the full goblet of amber-hued, fragrant Capri wine, 
                     "With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,"
                   which I drank, restored me so completely, that I was able to be up and
                  walking on the terrace of the hotel, when they came back from their
                  sight-seeing.
               The party returned full of the subject of Tiberius and his history, each one with
                  a learned speculation. As I sat listening to their various opinions, I remembered
                  Jean Paul's words,—"Sphinx-like Capri, lying on the broad plain of the
                  Mediterranean, as a beautiful sphinx, forever offering up to man the solving of
                  her Tiberius and Blue-Grotto riddles."
               "It is a beautiful spot," said Mr. Rochester, leaning on the terrace-rail, and
                  looking off into the distance. "From the heights of this island, on a clear day,
                  can be taken in at one view the whole Italian coast, from the promontory of Circe
                  to the temple of Pæstum. There, on one side, stretch out the Apennines, away back
                  to the Lucanian Mountains, while Vesuvius stands fronting the eye, an ever-smoking
                  altar. Here to the south lies the Mediterranean, and, with a little exertion of
                  the imagination, one can almost see the fair coast of Sicily. I was reading
                  yesterday a glowing description of Capri in Merivale's 'Rome.' He speaks of the
                  island as fronting the Sorrentine promontory with bold beauty, advancing forward,
                  as some lovely nymph proud of her charms."
               "Yes," replied Janet, "I remember the passage. I recalled it as I stood at Lo
                  Capo, and the same associations he writes of came to my memory. On these exquisite
                  heights the pedantic but scholarly Tiberius must have thought over many a grand
                  old heathen legend, as he gazed on the various points in the landscape which told
                  of Circe and Ulysses, the old poem of the 'Odyssey,' and the new one of his
                  uncle's laureate, Virgil, the 'Æneid,' which sang the works and exploits of his
                  own fabled ancestor, Æneas. Recalling all these tales, he could well perplex his
                  parasites with his favorite insoluble questions on the subjects of the sirens'
                  songs and the name of Hecuba's mother."
               This beautiful island of Capri—so called from the wild goats which inhabit it,
                     capreæ—produces many excellent things. Its
                  olives and white figs are far-famed; its wines, both red and white, are
                  luscious,—the red smells and tastes of raspberries, but the white wine has the
                  taste and aroma of violets, and is a drink fit for the gods and goddesses of
                  Hellas. While talking of the productions of the island, Mr. Rochester
                  observed,—
               "In our frigid climates we can form no conception of the delight of simple living
                  and breathing in this part of Europe. The earth yields its fruits a hundred-fold:
                  for example, there are three vintages a year, in December, March, and August; a
                  very little suffices for existence, even for the poorest, and such an existence as
                  cannot be found elsewhere."
               "In our Northern countries," I said, "physical necessities being great, we have to
                  throw out all our strength to meet them, and the superfluous force spends itself
                  on those painful and fatiguing subjects, human liberty and human progress. Here
                  the people trouble themselves little, and purchase pleasure, or rather accept it.
                  What do they care for freedom and the march of mind? Happy souls! they leave that
                  illusion, that Sisyphus labor of life, eternal progress, to nations whose rugged,
                  inhospitable soils force them to advance."
               
               "I hardly agree with you," replied Mrs. Rochester; "or, rather, with that which
                  your words imply. Little is done here, it is true, for those great life-works,
                  human liberty and human progress, because the people are lying fallow. They may
                  need a red fallow of blood yet to clear out the weeds; but I believe
                  Italy will some time in the future revive her past; and surely, when we recall
                  that past, we, who are only beginners, have need to be patient."
               Janet looked triumphant at this earnest reply to my heresy. I shrugged my
                  shoulders, laughed, and remained silent; while Mr. Rochester, with the pretty,
                  attractive gallantry of a husband, came to his wife's aid.
               "This little peninsula," he said, "and its surrounding shores have produced more
                  eminent men than any other country on the face of the globe. Art and love of
                  Nature were earliest and best developed here; and history can prove that it was
                  the leading country in all civic and political activity in the early and middle
                  ages of our era. Its history is the base, and gives the key-note to all æsthetical
                  and philosophical study. It is the intellectual home of all artists, where they
                  can best commence true study, and develop themselves most satisfactorily. Many
                  nations have often governed the world by fraud, or force of arms; but only twice
                  in the range of ages has the gentle rule of the Fine Arts held sway. Here in this
                  little quarter of the globe the fair throne of Parnassus was raised; and the world
                  shall ever remember those two epochs, the age of Pericles and the age of the
                  Medici."
               Just then some Italian gentlemen passed beneath the terrace, conversing earnestly,
                  pouring out, like rich oil, their beautiful language.
               "Listen!" said Venitia, in a low voice; "listen to the music of this tongue.
                  Notice its rhythm. Its very prose sounds like poesy."
               This reminded me of a fine description I had heard of the Italian tongue, and I
                  repeated it to them. "It is by turns royal as the Eridan, boiling like Vesuvius,
                  but always harmonious as the voice of the wind in the great pines on the shores of
                  the Chiassi."
               Mr. Rochester quoted to us passages from the Greek poets, to prove to us the
                  analogy between these two tongues in sound. The spoken Greek sounded no more
                  satisfactory to my ears than its tantalizing hieroglyphics appear to my unlearned
                  eyes. But I am as Uncle Miramont, in Fletcher's "Elder Brother," 
                     
                        "Though I can speak no Greek, I like the sound on't,
                        It goes so thundering as it conjured devils."
                     
                  
               
               No signs of the word tongue are so despairingly provoking to me as Greek
                  characters. They have a mysterious beauty too. Those eternities of ο's; those λ's,
                  looking, with their tails upturned, like frolicsome dolphins in the waves of a
                  Grecian archipelago; the prim ω's, with their
                  various accents, seeming to hold a great secret as Lara's nodding steward; busy
                  spider ε's weaving, Arachne-like, interminable
                  webs of mystery; incomplete Δ's, like Schumann's
                  mute, questioning chords; Π's, silent as the
                  weird columns of the Serapeön; the subtle, serpent-like forms, ς, θ, π, and those reflective η, μ, ρ, with "their tenacious flukes mooring them to the shore" of
                  some mighty thought.
               I made Mr. Rochester laugh by telling him this, and his wife added,—
               "Yes, you are right; these word-symbols are as lovely and deceptive as 'those
                  ivory gates of sleep, through which
                  come false dreams to mortals.' Whenever I meet with a Greek passage in my reading,
                  it seems as if it intended to resolve itself, just for me alone, into full and
                  perfect meaning; and the sparkling and pretty-winged accents, that hover over the
                  hieroglyphics, wink with seductive familiarity, wooing me on,—in vain; the vision
                  passes, and it all remains as incomprehensible as the great stone sphinx which
                  gazes out alone over the desert so silently,—and looking almost scornfully too,
                  for every passage seems to resolve itself into those ominous characters pointed at
                  my vulgar ignorance, οι πολλοι!"
               "But luckily a path for deliverance remains, ladies," said Mr. Rochester. "Being
                  women, you are not expected to understand Greek. Remember what that great master
                  of our strong Anglo-Saxon tongue, De Quincey, says:—'Fair reader, our sex enjoys
                  the office and privilege of standing counsel to yours, on all questions of Greek.
                  We are, under favor, perpetual and hereditary dragomans to you; so that if by
                  accident you know the meaning of a Greek word, yet by courtesy to us, your
                  counsel, learned in that matter, you will always seem not to know.'"
               And thus passed away this lovely day. We returned by moonlight, and the stars and
                  the sea-ripples shone with a golden sparkle; even the pure moon-rays, as they fell
                  on the tideless Mediterranean, broke into a flood of gold. Part of the company
                  walked the deck of the steamer, chatting gayly; the rest of us remained at the
                  upper part of the boat, and fell into a sweet silence. I passed off into a reverie
                  that was too full of fine visions to be called ordinary slumber, unless it was as
                  Endymion's magic sleep,—
                     
                        "Great key
                        To golden palaces, strange minstrelsy,
                        Fountains grotesque, new trees, bespangled caves,
                        Echoing grottos, full of tumbling waves
                        And moonlight; ay, to all the mazy world
                        Of silvery enchantment!"
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
               NEW FRIENDS.
               VENITIA is reading Pope's Homer with great interest, and her remarks afford us
                  much amusement. She laid down the book just now, and, walking across the terrace
                  to the window where I am at my writing, said: "Ottilie, in the Iliad I notice,
                  more than in anything I ever read, the great power, the irresistible influence,
                  exercised by beauty, breeding, grace, and gentleness. Before these the haughty
                  rage of Hector bows, and Priam's afflicted anger melts. Even Troy's matrons accept
                  the naughty, unchaste Helen, won by her unassuming loveliness and lowly grace.
                  Paris, so courtly, gentle, and beautiful, disarms all attacks, however well
                  merited, and yet he shows so much dignity in his meekness as to maintain his
                  position as a gentleman."
               I had to laugh at this conclusion.
               "Why, listen," she continued earnestly, half joining in my laugh, and taking up
                  her Homer. "You remember, in the sixth Book, the stern, stormy Hector gives the
                  naughty 'Phrygian boy' a sound berating, which it must be admitted the lazy, but
                  charming, young fellow had richly deserved; but how ashamed the Trojan chief and
                  the reader feel of his violent epithets, when the graceful Paris answers:
                     
                        'Brother, 't is just.
                        Thy free remonstrance proves thy worth and truth;
                        Yet charge my absence less, O generous chief!
                        On hate to Troy, than conscious shame and grief.
                        Here, hid from human eyes, thy brother sat
                        And mourned in secret his and Ilion's fate.'
                     
                   Now pray what reply could be made to such a gentlemanly waiving aside of
                  well-merited reproaches?"
               "Look out on the terrace, both of you," cries Janet, "and admire my sweet flowers.
                  You can quote your Pope's Homer over them."
               She is watering her pot-plants and flower-beds, for she has quite a hanging garden
                  on this lovely terrace. The morning sun is peeping around on them, and the air is
                  filled with their fresh fragrance. I look up at her, and acknowledge the loving
                  thoughtfulness she displays by having a huge box of blooming mignonette, violets,
                  and hyacinths placed beside my window; and after Andrea, our waiter, has arranged
                  it to her perfect satisfaction, she strikes a pretty attitude before it, and
                  repeats, with playful emphasis,— 
                     
                        "Thick new-born violets a soft carpet spread,
                        And clustering lotos swells the rising bed,
                        And sudden hyacinths the turf bestrow,
                        And flaming crocus makes the mountain glow."
                     
                  
               
               
               We have formed and renewed some pleasant acquaintances. I say renewed, because
                  Janet has met some English friends whose acquaintance she made during her
                  husband's life. Among them is a Mrs. Folham, who, like ourselves, is making a
                  tarrying-place of Naples. She has a daughter, Florence, with whom we were very
                  much pleased the few times we saw her. She has gone on a journey of a few weeks
                  through the Abruzzi, with an uncle and
                  aunt. When she returns, we hope to have much pleasure in her society, as, added to
                  her being an agreeable, pretty, and well-bred girl, she is something of a
                  musician. We found her a pleasing singer, with a soft, delicious voice, just a
                  little veiled and well-trained.
               Mrs. Folham had a thé musicale—as her pretty
                  little note of invitation called it—just before Florence left, a few evenings
                  since. At it we met Tito Mattei, a young Neapolitan pianiste, whose execution, when he was a boy, attracted the
                  attention and praises of Thalberg and his father-in-law Lablache. Mattei is about
                  three or four and twenty, quite youthful in appearance; his face has a frank,
                  boyish expression, with more simplicity and good nature than deep feeling or
                  vivacity.
               During the evening, being asked to play, he executed a fragment which puzzled us,
                  for the accessories of execution created a contest with, and partly veiled, the
                  musical thought. The idea contained in the piece was masterly, and provokingly
                  familiar to us, but we could not seize it as a whole, so as to give it its proper
                  name. This happens to me often, however, for I have a curious difficulty in
                  commanding the names of pieces when I hear them unexpectedly, which is very
                  tantalizing to one who has studied music so closely as I have.
               Venitia is never at a loss. Her musical information is not packed, labelled, and
                  docketed as mine is; it lies out near at hand. Thus, when the unexpected or
                  unknown comes suddenly upon her, she is quite ready to encounter either. This
                  exact memory and quick reading on the keys which she possesses, and is naturally
                  so proud of, arise, I think, partly, if not entirely, from her being so fine an
                     executante; she applies everything she
                  studies in music instantly to the piano,—indeed, studies through it and through
                  her ear. I, on the contrary, am an indifferent performer, and have enjoyed music
                  for many years, as I do books, in silence and to myself, independent of all
                  instruments; thus, the notes appeal more forcibly to my mind and fancy than to my
                  ear, and when I hear the full battery of sounds, I am a little bewildered. But on
                  this occasion Venitia could not name the fragment either, and it vexed her, for
                  she felt all the pride of an executante, and did
                  not like to find herself as confused as a mere carpet knight, such as she regards
                  me.
               The passage was brief, breathless, and full of vigor, and Mattei played it well;
                  but, just as it would be putting aside its mask, like a sprightly Venitienne at a
                  carnival fête, in order to show its bewitching
                  self, he would throw over it a gorgeous mantle, studded with brilliant octaves,
                  and embroidered with graceful arabesque scale forms, while his thumb flashed like
                  a little demon Ariel from one end of the piano to the other, just in the most
                  difficult and unexpected places, and the curious but beautiful fragment would peep
                  through here and there with a mocking smile, then dance off in bewildering zigzags
                  in company with chasing scales, showing itself only in sparkling bits. After a
                  while, the first and second passages of the opening gleamed out again, and,
                  melting together in sorrowful minor, closed in the most fragmentary doubt. When
                  Mattei arose from the piano, some one asked him the name of it.
               "The motivo was a passage from Beethoven," he
                  answered, with a frank smile.
               "O, to be sure!" exclaimed Venitia, impulsively, to me, as if provoked with
                  herself for not recognizing her old friend. It was the finale to the first Sonate in Opus 10, C minor, the Prestissimo, you
                  remember."
               
               He started, for he had overheard her, and turning half towards us, said to Mrs.
                  Folham and her daughter, "Mademoiselle is a musician."
               Mrs. Folham presented him to us, and we entered into conversation.
               "You have of course read De Lenz?" I remarked to him.
               "Plait-il?" he replied, with that blank
                  expression of countenance a person has when he does not comprehend even your
                  words, much less your thought.
               "The man never read anything in his life, my dear, I'll wager a bright golden
                  guinea," whispered Janet in English, "except probably his Book of Prayers. His
                  music nascitur non fit, of course."
               Choking down a laugh, I extricated myself in a few words of explanation, telling
                  him as simply and concisely as possible, that De Lenz was a clever German musical
                  writer, who had published a useful book on Beethoven's Sonates, and had said some
                  nice and suggestive things about this very Sonate, the finale of which he had been
                  playing. He listened to me as a person looks in the dark, and, when I had
                  finished, shook his head wistfully, as if just understanding my words, and no
                  more. Then he turned to Venitia, and they talked about different piano-forte
                  compositions.
               While they were talking, I seemed to be listening to them, but I was really
                  thinking of what a different thing music was to each of us. To him it was innate,
                  and seemed to require no mental nourishment, nor give rise to any ideas or
                  feelings out of and beyond it; he was not a creator, but a gifted executant, who
                  controlled the instrument as a member of his body, and bent and moulded the
                  musical ideas of masters at will into numberless berless forms of beauty, like the
                  Florentine artist-goldsmiths of the fifteenth century, who took precious ore, and
                  worked it into beautiful and graceful garlands for fair women.
               But music to me is a language, and though, so far as my own fingers are concerned,
                  it may be a dead one, it is like the ancient tongues to a classical scholar,—the
                  beautiful 
                     "fluent Greek, a vowel'd under-song";
                   and tells me through my eyes and my mind of diviner thoughts and things than
                  any living spoken words can breathe. 
                     
                        "Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard
                        Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on,
                        Not to the sensual ear, but, more endeared,
                        Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone."*
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  *Keats's Ode on a Grecian Urn.
               
               We found Mattei intelligent enough about everyday musical matters, and tolerably
                  posted in the history of his noble old Conservatoire. I made his inexpressive dark
                  eyes glow with something like emotion, when I told him of the younger Trajetta
                  dying in indigence and obscurity, at an advanced age, some years before, in
                  America, and he listened, as if deeply interested, to my account of Trajetta's
                  mode of training the voice, and the beautiful Solfeggi he had given me to study.
                  When I ended, he said, in a pretty, tender, half sad tone,—
               "He was one of our holy men in art, and he died far away there, unknown and poor.
                  Mais que voulez-vous, Mesdames? We poor artists! So we go!"
               He shrugged his shoulders, threw up his hands with the palms outward, raised his
                  eyebrows, and pouted his lips in the true Neapolitan sign-language, indicating,
                     even stronger than words could,
                  sympathy with the master's sad fate, reverence for his memory, all united to a
                  calm acceptance amounting to fatalism; which last, I have no doubt, he inherited
                  from nature, for his face bore that half vague, half indifferent look which is
                  entirely distinct from the dreamy expression of the poet, or the hopeless look of
                  the discouraged: it is the unmistakable sign of the born fatalist.
               Venitia talked with him about Thalberg, Liszt, Mendelssohn, and Chopin, but it was
                  difficult to get his individual opinions about any one of them, though he was
                  quite willing to tell what other persons thought. We asked him if he played Chopin
                  much. Then came again his expressive shrug, and another motion of the hands, with
                  a smiling elevation of the lips, meaning, as we translated it, that however he
                  might admire Chopin, he was not his own master as to what he should play for the
                  public; indeed, the remark he made a few moments after these graphic gestures had
                  finished, confirmed us in the truth of our interpretation.
               "Chopin's music," he said, "is not popular in Naples. After all, it is the music
                  for the virtuoso, Mesdames, not the multitude."
               Some one addressed him, and he turned away from us, which gave us an opportunity
                  to speak of what we cannot help noticing constantly in Naples, this curious
                  sign-language. All the lower classes, especially, use it with great skill. One of
                  our anteroom windows looks over into the court-yard. I often stand there,
                  watching, through the blinds, with great interest, the coachman, grooms, servants,
                  and porteress, engaged at their various occupations, talking together, and I have
                  observed closely their use of this mysterious means of communication. They seem to
                  have certain gestures for a whole phrase. Indeed, I have often seen one of them
                  stop when half-way through an animated sentence, as if words were powerless, and
                  finish his meaning by a few rapid, fierce gestures, which seemed to be perfectly
                  comprehended by his companions, and much more effective too than the words had
                  been, judging from the flashing of their keen eyes. Thus, when Mattei left us, we
                  talked about it, and Janet said,—
               "This sign-language is not original with these modern Neapolitans. I have no doubt
                  it is a descendant of the sign-language of ancient Italy."
               "I wish I understood it better," I remarked, "for I am sure a knowledge of it
                  would make the symbolism of the old painters much plainer to us."
               "The other evening at Mr. Rochester's," said Venitia, "a gentleman told me that
                  when Ferdinand I. returned to Naples, after the downfall of Murat, he addressed
                  the people from a terrace or balcony of the Royal Palace entirely by signs; he
                  gesticulated furiously and rapidly; conveyed his reproaches, promises, and
                  reconciliation entirely by these motions of the hands and muscles of the face; and
                  although he did not speak one word, they perfectly understood him, and gave him
                  shouts of applause expressive of their satisfaction and admiration."
               "That was what made him so popular with the lower classes," observed Janet; "you
                  remember it was said the lazzaroni were faithful subjects of a king who made a
                  lazzarone of himself, meaning this Ferdinand I.; but they obeyed grudgingly a
                  lazzarone who had been made a king, meaning Murat."
               "But what a droll sight that must have been," I remarked, "that royal pantomime!
                  Their replies, however, should also have been mute. Fancy, my dears, how excessively funny it would be to
                  see such a town-meeting, with the vox populi
                  having no vox at all, and speech and applause
                  going on by gestures. I should think a great deal of violence might be spared, if
                  all popular assemblages had orator and audience limited to motions and
                  gestures."
               "Not at all," said Janet; "noise might be prevented probably, but not violence,
                  judging from these Italians; for you know very well that here the blow can come,
                  and does, without the word."
               Just then our hostess asked Venitia for some music; and I noticed with pleasure
                  that Mattei stopped his conversation in the anteroom where supper was served, and
                  came into the salon to listen to her. Notwithstanding he had said Chopin was not
                  popular in Naples, all the company appeared charmed with her execution of the
                  Romance from the Concerto dedicated to Kalkbrenner by this composer. Her beauty
                  and calm self-possession increased very much the effect her music produced. She
                  looked like a young Sibyl as she sat at the piano, still and fair as a piece of
                  sculptured marble, her glorious full eyes gazing out into the beyond, while her
                  fingers seemed to draw from the instrument this charming passage. Her playing
                  makes me understand what Heine felt when he said of Chopin's own execution:
                  "Whilst Chopin is playing I forget entirely that it is the performance of a
                     pianiste whose reputation is that of a
                  master, and I bury myself in the sweet abysses of his music, in its sad delights,
                  which are as exquisite as profound. Chopin is the great musical poet, the artist
                  of genius, that can only be named in company with Mozart and Beethoven."
               As Venitia finished, a gentleman came in, who was received by the family and
                  musical circle with great friendliness, and kind reproaches for his coming so
                  late.
               "Our friend, Mr. Luini," said Mrs. Folham, coming to Janet and me. "I was afraid
                  we should not have the pleasure of seeing him this evening. An exceedingly nice
                  person, I do assure you. Yes, Mr. Luini."
               Mrs. Folham has a droll way of repeating the motivo of her remark, as a sort of refrain, looking around the room
                  as she does it, as if driving four-in-hand, and watching her leaders.
               "Luini!" I repeated, in a stupid way I have of thinking aloud; "Luini, I wonder if
                  he is a descendant of the Milanese Raphael!" for in Italy we are constantly
                  startled at hearing names used familiarly, and applied to living, breathing human
                  beings, no better than ourselves, which we have been accustomed to seeing only in
                  books, and there applied to the great landmarks in history and art, setting such
                  brains as mine to work in the most absurd manner, framing imaginary
                  genealogies.
               "Milanese?" asked Mrs. Folham, in the most ridiculously practical manner; "quite
                  likely, my dear." (She had lost the word "Raphael," and, if she had not, I do not
                  know that it would have been of much use to her.) "Mr. Luini is a Milanese by
                  birth; probably he knows the family to which you allude, and may be a kinsman. Let
                  me present him to you, and you can ask him."
               And to my intense amusement and embarrassment she bustled off to fetch her friend.
                  Mrs. Folham is a very intelligent woman, so far as all ordinary practical subjects
                  go. But it must be confessed that everything relating to what she calls, with
                  amusing emphasis, "the Fine Arts," is about as clear to her comprehension as
                  "Shakespeare and the musical glasses." She looks upon "the Continent"—another
                  English expression of hers, as if there was but one continent on the globe—as a
                  vastly agreeable able place for persons
                  of failing health or invalid income, a capital place indeed for educating
                  children, and I sometimes think she hopes to make it an available place for
                  picking up a count or a baron for her pretty blonde, Florence. Galleries of
                  pictures and statuary, ancient ruins, and old churches, she regards as accessories
                  to the country, like bowling-alleys, the shows, and exhibitions of a
                  watering-place, gotten up by the natives as amusements and attractions, and quite
                  likely she shrewdly suspects them of being speculations on the easily-gulled
                  travellers, who are not as clever about those sort of things as she is. Thus, my
                  allusion to the celebrated pupil of the great Leonardo da Vinci, Bernardino Luini,
                  was Greek and Latin to her ears. As Mrs. Folham left us, I looked at Janet
                  dismayed, and yet the mistake was so absurd we had to laugh. While we were in the
                  height of our merriment, imagining what possible explanation I could make to the
                  strange man about the mythical Luinis in question, we saw Mrs. Folham approaching,
                  leaning on the arm of her friend.
               "He is very handsome, at all events," whispered Janet.
               Mrs. Folham presented him; and just as she was about speaking of my unfortunate
                  Mrs.-Harris-of-a-Luini, that Providence who watches so kindly over the halt and
                  the blind of good society, interposed in my favor, in the shape of her youngest
                  boy, un vrai enfant terrible, and she
                  disappeared hastily with him, saying, as she did so, in the best satisfied manner
                  imaginable,—"Now, my love, ask Mr. Luini all about your friends. Yes, your
                  friends." And she nodded her head encouragingly.
               As our ridiculous position presented itself to us, good breeding, self-control,
                  every discipline of courtesy and Mrs. Grundyism, which keeps us poor human beings
                  in check and good order when we meet together in those crowds called "society,"
                  was forgotten,—no, not forgotten, but completely swept aside by the torrent of fun
                  which rushed over us both, and Janet and I astounded our new acquaintance by the
                  merriest peal of laughter he surely had ever heard.
               He opened wide his cold blue eyes on us; but I saw creeping around his handsome
                  mouth quiverings which showed he should like to know the cause of our mirth, that
                  he might enjoy it also. This encouraged me, for I had been afraid of encountering
                  an Italian, not only as innocent of "the Fine Arts" as poor Mrs. Folham,—no
                  uncommon thing, by the way,—but equally innocent of appreciation of humor. After
                  the first burst of laughter had subsided, I controlled myself sufficiently to
                  speak, and said,—"Really, we must appear very rude. You must excuse us. I am
                  almost sure the same cause would make you behave just as badly."
               "I have not the slightest doubt of it," he answered, with a cordial laugh and the
                  loveliest voice I ever heard in man or woman; then he added, "Permit me to take
                  this seat beside you, and pray let me into the secret of this merriment. Food for
                  fun, you know, is not to be found every day."
               In a few moments he was laughing as heartily as we, and our rather noisy laughter
                  attracted Venitia's attention. She was standing at the piano with Florence and her
                  mamma, and she reports that Mrs. Folham said, "Yes, my dear, your friend knows
                  some relatives of Mr. Luini. How lucky, to be sure, for he is an exceedingly nice
                  person. We have known him these two or three years. In Rome we first met him, was
                  it not, Florence? Yes, my dear,—Mr. Luini,—in Rome,—a Milanese by birth, I am pretty certain. A very proper
                  person, I do assure you. What did you say, Florence? An artist? Beg pardon, my
                  love, you are entirely in error"; then she added, in a solemn and reproachful
                  tone, as if Florence had accused him of some sin or dishonor, "An artist! no,
                  indeed; on the contrary, comfortable means, lives very handsomely, quite the
                  gentleman. Plays finely, to be sure, but only en
                     amateur. I have heard," here she lowered her voice confidentially,
                  "that he is noble"; and, with a little nervous laugh, like Toots's "no
                  consequence," she added, "He may be a prince in disguise, or something of the
                  sort, who knows? But, at all events," here she resumed her ordinary hearty English
                  tone, "he is a very nice person,—very;—yes,—Mr. Luini,—O no, not an artist at all.
                  By no means;—quite the gentleman, on the contrary;—amateur, that's all."
               Mr. Luini and we were capital friends from the start. When we bade him good night,
                  we invited him with sincere cordiality to visit us.
               "Yes, my dears," interrupted Mrs. Folham, "Mr. Luini shall fetch me some time very
                  soon to see you. Pray, what evenings are you receiving?"
               The kind, pleasant woman had all the proper feeling of an English person about it,
                  and by offering to have him "fetch" her, as she expressed it, she wished frankly
                  to assume any responsibility there might appear in the sudden acquaintanceship.
                  The next day, when we returned from our morning drive in the Toledo, where we love
                  to see the motley crowd, we found his card.
            
            
               SPIRITISM AND DREAMS.
               WE have been having a strange and interesting conversation this evening, arising
                  out of our meeting to-day with Mr. H——, the celebrated Spiritist. This gentleman
                  has lately arrived in Naples, and his sayings, doings, and movements are so freely
                  talked upon, that he seems to be the public property of the English and American
                  society collected in this city. We hear more of him than others, because he is
                  very intimate with our friends the Rochesters.
               He is not in full possession of his powers at the present moment, they say. He has
                  held only two or three séances since he came,
                  and these have been strictly private, at Mr. Rochester's palazzo, at which no one
                  has been present but the immediate family of the Minister and the King's brother,
                  Prince Luigi, for whose gratification they have been held.
               The reports of these séances have made us
                  curious to meet this spiritual lion; but although he told Mrs. Rochester he would
                  call on us with her some day, sans cérémonie,
                  his promised visit has been deferred from time to time, for he is as the man in
                  the parable, "marrying a wife and cannot come." His intended bride and her family,
                  with whom he is travelling,—wealthy Russians,—are making excursions to Amalfi and
                  Pæstum, Sorrento rento and Capri,
                  Pozzuoli and Baiæ; thus every moment of his time is occupied.
               This morning Mrs. Rochester called and told us that Mr. H—— had asked Mr.
                  Rochester to present him to Mr. B——, the distinguished American poet, now also in
                  Naples; that he was to-call on this gentleman and his family this afternoon, and
                  that she had come to invite us, in their name and hers, to be present at the
                  interview. Accordingly, at three o'clock we went to Mr. B——'s apartments at the
                  Hotel de l'Europe, where we were received cordially by him and his ladies. We
                  arrived a little before the expected visitor, but a few moments after Mr. H—— and
                  Mr. Rochester were announced.
               When Mr. H—— was presented to Mr. B——, I noticed that he took a rapid, keen survey
                  of the poet,—who has as distinguished a presence as name,—just as if he were
                  weighing and measuring him mentally. "You are very cunning and clever, young
                  Aureolus, doubtless," I thought, "but you cannot measure that man."
               Only a few moments passed during the presentation, and no one seemed to notice, as
                  I did, the sharp weight-and-measure glance that flashed out of the bright, blue
                  eye of the young Spiritist, as he scanned the patriarchal-looking poet, who
                  received his boyish guest with simplicity and loyalty of manner, as if he
                  respected himself and his surroundings, and was willing to extend the same feeling
                  to all who approached him; but short as the moments were, this look made a strong
                  impression on me. As I noted the young man's expression, there rose to my lips the
                  words which Browning puts into the mouth of Paracelsus, when he first sees Aprile
                  the poet,— 
                     
                        "Art thou the sage I only seem to be,
                        Myself of after time, my very self,
                        With sight a little clearer, strength more firm,
                        Who robs me of my prize, who takes my place,
                        For just a fault, a weakness, a neglect?
                        I scarcely trusted God with the surmise
                        That such might come."
                     
                  
               
               During the first part of the interview I examined the personal appearance of the
                  young man. He seemed about five or six and twenty; had light brown hair and blonde
                  complexion; a frank, boyish countenance; and a quick, bright, blue eye, clear as
                  the waters that wash the base of a granite mountain. His voice was ringing, and
                  had a cordial tone in it; and his laugh was the fresh, throaty one of youth, as if
                  no care or sorrow had sent the laugh lower down for springs to feed it.
               A genial, merry manner, an egotistical freedom in talking of himself, which had
                  the appearance of hearty, innocent candor, also struck me; but for the sharp
                  expression which I had observed on his face when first looking at him, I probably
                  should not have examined him closer, but have listened to, and regarded him as an
                  imaginative person, possessing a great deal of this mysterious magnetic power of
                  which so little is known, and using it with the unconsciousness of a real
                  childlike nature.
               But the recollection of that look remained; and after the first survey of his
                  person and manner, I returned to the examination of his face, to find out where
                  lay the sharpness and shrewdness. At last they were discovered in those glancing
                  blue eyes, and frank, laughing mouth;—there, around the eye and mouth-setting were
                  numberless little foxy lines, which gave a curious, cunning, knowing expression to
                  the face, strangely at variance with its surface-character. They were the marks
                  left by the constant use of a subtile and intuitive power of penetration into
                     the characters of others,—that
                  strange, bland, and noiseless gift, the practice of which is called shrewdness by
                  some, dissimulation by others, but is, after all, best named tact. 
                     
                        "Has for genius no mercy,
                        For speeches no heed;
                        It lurks in the eyebeam,
                        It leaps to its deed.
                     
                     
                        Church, market, and tavern,
                        Bed and board it will sway;
                        It has no to-morrow,
                        It ends with to-day."*
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  *Emerson.
               
               How curious is the history that each human face tells! No matter how hidden the
                  labor, how strong the will, how stern the self-control, the murder will out in
                  some little leaf of the countenance.
               I looked from the Spiritist to our Minister, from him to the Poet, and contrasted
                  the three remarkable men. Mr. Rochester's face is dreamy, speculative, and almost
                  poetical; but there are certain hard lines about the mouth and square wrinkles on
                  the brow which tell of the struggle that may have gone on in his nature between
                  wild, Utopian visions and sober common sense. This struggle has transformed a
                  vague, youthful dreamer, who would have spent his life in trying to carry out
                  impossible schemes, into the practical, acting man, fit to be what Madame de Staël
                  said his great preceptor, M. Fellenberg, desired his educational system to
                  produce: "A liberal bond between the inferior and superior classes; a bond which
                  should not be founded only on the pecuniary interests of the rich and the
                     poor."†
                  
               
               
                  
                  †Madame de Staël's "L'Allemagne."
               
               Mr. B——'s face and head are as satisfactory as any admirer of the great poet could
                  wish. He has a fine, high brow; a head as classic in its outline as an antique; a
                  calm, reflective eye, so serious that but for its serenity it would be stern;
                  inquiring in its expression at times, not so much of outward things, but as if
                  communing with the high and beyond; a mouth expressing sensitiveness and purity.
                  Gray hair clusters around his fine head, and he has a patriarchal beard, which is
                  as oddly at variance with the fire of his eye as Richelieu's eye and voice were
                  with his tottering gait. His manner is calm, simple, and plain; but the simplicity
                  and plainness arise from high breeding and culture, and an inherent self-respect,
                  which is unobtrusive but none the less felt. I have heard him described as cold,
                  stern, and exclusive; to me he always seems serene, self-poised, and just.
               From his quiet face, expressive of that perfect wisdom which results from a
                  constant communion with good, true thoughts, I shifted my eyes again to the young
                  Scotchman, whose success in Spiritism has made him famous enough to be mentioned
                  hereafter, in the history of this unknown, magnetic human atmosphere, when future
                  discoveries have made it as "natural" and "easy to
                     believe" as steam and electricity.
               While the young man's tongue was running with voluble facility, his eyes were
                  scanning closely and keenly his audience; the graceful form of the poet's invalid
                  wife, who lay upon the sofa, her delicate, lady-like features and exquisite little
                  hand and foot, which peeped out from the folds of the soft, silken
                  dressing-robe,—all these attractions, I felt certain, were noted, as that sharp,
                  blue eye swept over her.
               One by one he took in each member of the company, and I observed that he
                  remembered exactly which lady among us was the great poet's daughter. He had a
                     word for each and all; in proportion
                  to our ranks, however, for intellect sat on that American throne,—a B——, not a
                  Bourbon.
               He talked of a living double he had, with frank fun, as if he
                  heartily enjoyed the thing,—some charlatan who was pretending to be Mr. H——. This
                  person had played numberless pranks, which were even rascally and dishonest,—such
                  as introducing himself into families, getting invitations to stay all night, and
                  decamping before daybreak with the plate and other valuables. This
                     double had visited Florence, Marseilles, and various other
                  places.
               "And so droll!" said the young man, with a burst of innocent surprise, as if all
                  the world should be familiar with his personal appearance; "so odd! the
                  descriptions given of this person show him to be totally unlike me, for they all
                  say he is a middle-aged, large, dark-haired man."
               He talked of his matrimonial engagement with delicious naïveté; said, with a merry laugh, that he had only known the lady
                  six weeks. "Although," he added, with a little dash of the chin up, and toss of
                  the head, "we had known each other by reputation long before." It was inimitable.
                  He said he was born in Scotland, had been taken to the United States in early
                  childhood, then returned, while yet young, to his native country.
               There was none of the accepted notion of a magician about him. Indeed, it seemed
                  strange, while looking at this eager, boyish, apparently enthusiastic youth, to
                  think of him as the man who had been consulted seriously by the long-headed Louis
                  Napoleon, and had been invited by persons of the highest rank in Europe to visit
                  them, all treating him and his faith and powers with respect.
               He did not, during the whole interview, say one word about Spiritism. He spoke of
                  himself as well known, not with offensive conceit or presumptuous vanity, but with
                  the frankness of a youth. Notwithstanding all this openness, he impressed me with
                  the thought that he was sharper and cleverer than this air implied. There was
                  certainly method in his manner.
               
               He made the conversation as general as possible, for he held the reins in his own
                  hands. He seemed to possess, among his other gifts, that art de causer, which De Tocqueville defined as that charming science
                  which consists in touching upon and agitating a crowd of ideas, without dwelling
                  in tiresome detail on any one; with this difference, that Mr. H——'s talk touched
                  on personalities, not ideas,—things, not thoughts. He kept the ball rolling
                  swiftly, and even when speaking of himself left no room for suggestions, or the
                  natural remarks or questions that might have arisen from such a personal
                  style.
               After talking an hour or so, Mr. Rochester reminded Mr. H—— of the time. He arose
                  with a quick, alert movement, which was quite in keeping, and took leave of Mr.
                  B—— and us with the fresh, eager manner of a very young man, who had not been long
                  enough in society to grow conscious or affected, but entirely free from
                  awkwardness or shyness.
               Of course, we "talked him over" after he left, and among other things that were
                  said and told of him was this pretty story:—
               One evening in Florence Mr. H—— was visiting two distinguished English authors,
                  husband and wife. While talking with them; he played idly with some fresh leaves
                  that were lying near him, forming them into a wreath, which, after he had finished, he threw carelessly
                  on the table, and turned to play with something else; for this thoughtless,
                  unconscious handling of cards or little table ornaments and trifles while he is
                  talking is said to be one of his peculiarities. A low exclamation from the one 
                     
                        "who mutely sits
                        Musing by the firelight, that great brow
                        And the spirit small hand propping it,"
                     
                   attracted the attention of each one present to the little leafy wreath. It
                  was rising in the air without the help of any visible hands. It rose gently,
                  swayed an instant to and fro, as if a soft breeze half lifted, half impelled it.
                  It moved slowly along, each one watching it earnestly, until it hung directly over
                  the head of the lady he was visiting; then it fell eddying down, like the leaf
                  commemorated in the beautiful poem "By the Fireside," and rested on "that great
                  brow," mingling its soft, green leaves with the hair, 
                     
                        "So dark and dear, how worth
                        That a man should strive and agonize,
                        And taste a very hell on earth
                        For the hope of such a prize."
                     
                  
               
               We all united in the opinion that Mr. H——'s powers had never been better employed
                  than in making his "unseen spirits of the air" crown 
                     "My perfect wife, my Leonor."
                  
               
               This evening Mrs. Rochester came to talk over with us the visit of the day; and
                  while we were drinking tea on the terrace, she told us of some strange things
                  which had occurred in her drawing-room during the late séances held there for Prince Luigi. Shapes like baby hands had
                  appeared under the table-covering, supposed to be spirits of children Mrs.
                  Rochester had lost by death twenty years before! Their small clenched fists had
                  played in the silk flounces of the mother's dress, their little unseen forms had
                  nestled down beside her. 'Kerchiefs had been snatched up by invisible hands, and
                  knots were tied in them with unseen fingers. An accordion was held beneath the
                  table, and the little invisible spirits played on it a broken but sweet minor
                  melody,—only a few measures; then the instrument trembled, as if held by tiny
                  hands too weak to bear its weight, and fell to the ground.
               After Mrs. Rochester left us we remained on the terrace talking. Janet said:
                  "Spiritism has its root in the imagination, and this root is as old as humanity
                  itself. In every age a new shoot comes up in some form or other, but the root
                  remains the same,—the same burning desire to know and determine the future. It is
                  but a repetition of that old longing which impelled the astrologists 'on the
                  mooned plains of Chaldea, and by the dark waters of Egypt, to penetrate into the
                  womb of Event.'"
               "But this Spiritism," I replied, "does not seem to be a very poetical repetition
                  of that glorious astrology, and its evidences are more positive and tangible,
                  while they are not so elevated as those which the learned philosophers of old
                  exhibited. The greatest charm in the supernatural for me, however, lies in losing
                  sight of the Before and After. I long to soar into a realm of eternal Present,
                  where I can be free from the goading sting of the snake Memory, and the delusive
                  dream of Hope."
               "Wait patiently," said Janet, with serious tenderness, "and that great Present
                  will come. When the undetermined hour strikes, our Past and Future will be shown
                  to us as one divine Whole!"
               We talked of Life and Death with sweet solemnity.
               
               "Dissolution, Ottilie dear, is not death nor birth," said Janet. "Life—that is,
                  what we call Life in this world—is a transient division from the creative power,
                  and Death is simply a reunion with it." Then, in her pleasing, speculative way,
                  she rambled on something after this fashion:—"Life, real, true life, is like a
                  beautiful tree bearing one matchless flower. It takes ages to perfect root and
                  tree-stem, branch and leafage, and, in fine, the blessed blossom. Each being is a
                  contribution towards this purpose, and the warmth of countless suns is needed for
                  its glorious ripening, for 
                     
                        'I doubt not through the ages one increasing purpose
                           runs,
                        And the thoughts of men are widened with the process of the suns.'
                     
                  
               
               Each earnest life-labor goes towards this increasing purpose, and each complete
                  existence is as a snowy petal opening in perfect whiteness to help the expanding
                  of the one great thought-flower."
               We talked of dreams and the inexplicable influence arising from them, which
                  constitutes what Lewes calls "the atmosphere of life." I remarked that in dreams
                  we seem to be completely disengaged from the distractions of common life; nothing
                  exists but ourselves, our very spirits, without contact or mixture. "La bête," as De Maistre wittily called the body, lies
                  senseless and helpless, while "l'autre" is free
                  and soaring.
               "Some physiologists think," said Janet, "that dreams, instead of being a
                  reflection of spontaneous will, uninfluenced by the narrow experiences of the hour
                  and surrounding circumstances, are simply an organic action, a reflex movement of
                  the nerves, an automatic operation of the brain."
               "It may be," I replied, "a sentiment of the difficult or easy, strong or
                  languishing, course of organic life. I have noticed that trouble often makes the
                  sleep as heavy as if it resulted from an opium draught; petty annoyances, on the
                  contrary, cause wakefulness, and so does gayety; but deep grief, after it has had
                  its full sweep, mercifully turns and spreads the dense covering of a leaden sleep
                  over the prostrated mind and body."
               "Descartes said that sorrow and danger, or disagreeable business, made him both
                  hungry and sleepy," remarked Janet.
               "Have you ever noticed," I asked, "the sensations following sleep? Sometimes I
                  awaken with the current of life flowing abundantly and with facility. I seem to be
                  hearing the inspiring murmurs of a far-off ocean, and the mysterious sounds fill
                  me with a strange gladness, an unaccountable light-heartedness."
               "As if," responded Janet, resting her hand affectionately on my shoulder,— 
                     
                        "'Though inland far we be,
                        Our souls have sight of that immortal sea
                        Which brought us hither;
                        Can in a moment travel thither,—
                        And see the children sport upon the shore,
                        And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.'"
                     
                  
               
               "Then at other times," I continued, "I awaken with lead in every little organ-pipe
                  of nerves, the current of life flows languidly, and I seem plunged into a state of
                  insurmountable melancholy. I am apt to fancy that only the body has awakened, and
                  the soul is still lingering in that home, where Rahel Levin said 'it goes in sleep
                  to recruit,' and that the animal spirits are waiting in sadness for their
                  Prospero, to relieve them from the gnarled oak-like prison-house of matter."
               "Do you remember, Ottilie," asked Venitia, "old Volktman man in Bulwer's Godolphin? He talked of 'girdling
                  our sleep with dreams,' and when the wished for dream glided into us, our souls
                  walked with the Spirit of the Vision. I cannot help indulging in a little fanciful
                  superstition about dreams, it is so pleasant. In the morning I often find myself
                  thinking if the last night's visions are of good or evil omen. Indeed, I have
                  never removed this ruby ring at night since I heard that the ruby gave pleasant
                  dreams."
               "But, Venitia, if you observe yourself closely, you will find that you rarely
                  admit any dream to be positively ill-omened. Cunning Hope always contrives some
                  little loophole to let in on it a bright glimmer of good meaning."
               "Let me tell you a strange dream I had once," said Janet. "The clock is striking
                  midnight; it is the very hour for a weird story, and this terrace has a ghostly
                  look, with the phantom-like vapor of Vesuvius flashing out on us its fierce
                  fire-eye. One evening, some years ago, I sat alone at bedtime, thinking how happy
                  I was, how well in mind and body. I was leading a comparatively solitary life, for
                  we were at Paul's country home in England, and my days and hours were flowing by
                  silently and sweetly. I went to bed and fell asleep.
               "I dreamed I was standing on the door-sill of a strange house, looking out into a
                  garden which I had never seen before, but I did not feel any surprise at being
                  there. A servant told me that a certain woman, who was in some way associated with
                  me, I cannot tell how,—for, of course, you have observed how vaguely information
                  is conveyed in dreams—we accept everything without any of the 'whys and
                  wherefores' of waking life,—that this woman had just passed out with a
                  strange-looking snake following her. I ran into an adjoining arbor, or
                  summer-house, and looked after this person.
               "I saw her very near where I was standing. She was walking slowly away, and beside
                  her, as if listening to and following her, was a horrible little Cobra de Capello!
                  It was about two feet in length, and it leaped along with a bold, agile movement,
                  that had a strange fascinating grace in it. It stood half upright, the slight
                  undulatory body supported on the foot-like tail, the hood dilated, showing plainly
                  the black curved line and spots, and they had the mysterious expression that is
                  seen on a mask. The yellow color of the serpent's body glowed like fiery gold, and
                  the delicate black stripes and spots on it flashed and glimmered as if each
                  possessed individual fiendish life. As I looked at this fearful creature, I heard
                  distinctly a faint stridulous sound, resembling the staccato note of a treble
                  hautboy, and I remember saying to myself, 'That is the voice of the serpent! It is
                  answering the woman, and they are talking about me!' I was seized with a feeling
                  of insurmountable terror, and an apprehension of coming evil.
               "I returned to the house. Soon after, this same woman entered the room where I
                  was. She looked like some one very different in character, for she had taken the
                  form and manner of my dead mother; but I was not deceived, and kept myself on my
                  guard. She came up to me with the tenderness of a mother. I tried to avoid her,
                  but my precautions were all vain! She succeeded in resting her hands on my
                  forehead, then passed out of the room silently, looking back at me with an air of
                  sly triumph.
               "Something seemed to inform me that this touch had put me in great peril, for by
                  it the serpent could recognize me. I was almost beside myself with terror. Just then I heard the Angelus bell of a
                  neighboring church. On the instant I resolved to go and put myself under the
                  protection of the sacred roof.
               "In olden times, I said, the sanctuary was a safeguard, the very Spirit of Evil
                  itself falling powerless at its threshold; and although no Catholic, I seemed to
                  have unwavering faith.
               "I went to the church and became a resident, for there was a religious order
                  attached to it, and also many buildings. This order seemed to have secular as well
                  as religious occupations; it was a large community.
               "Soon after, I was standing in one of the reception or business rooms. A strange
                  woman, looking like a traveller, entered, and asked to rent one of their halls;
                  she wished to exhibit to the towns-people some curious things she had for show.
                  The business arrangements were concluded. As the woman was leaving the hall, one
                  of the members of the community came to me, holding in his hand a placard, printed
                  in gay colors, saying, 'There is to be quite a curious show to-morrow evening,'
                  and handed me the placard.
               "It was an advertisement or bill of the woman's exhibition. To my horror, I saw at
                  the head of it, in red letters, that seemed to scintillate, these words: 'A very
                  curious Cobra de Capello, that is perfectly tame; so docile that it will perform
                  anything its mistress bids it, as an intelligent dog would.'
               "I let the placard drop, and, trembling in every fibre, looked towards the woman.
                  She was just leaving the room, and her eyes rested on me with a smiling,
                  triumphant expression. She was dressed not only plainly, but commonly; her face
                  was perfectly unknown to me, yet I knew it was SHE! She had on her
                  arm a small wicker-basket basket with lids, but both lids were thrown back, and I
                  saw that the basket was empty. She left the room.
               "Just as I was trying to command my agitation, I felt a sharp, stinging bite on
                  the back of the upper part of my left arm. I groaned, for I knew on the instant
                  the cause. The Cobra had found me. And lo! out from the thin mull sleeve of my
                  gown crept the horrible snake; and before we could recover presence of mind, it
                  had glided out of the half-open doorway, and disappeared, no one knew whither. We
                  heard very plainly, however, the clear, treble, hautboy note of its voice, which
                  sounded to me like the exultant cry of a fiend. This strange sound passed through
                  the building as a swift wind, then died away, with a faint wail, into utter
                  stillness.
               "Death seemed inevitable. I felt the bite burning and aching intensely. I plucked
                  off my sleeve, and there upon my arm was a yellow spot as large as a pea, with
                  skin and flesh bitten out, and the hollow filled with the angry poison of the
                  serpent. I was taken to the infirmary of the establishment. Two members of the
                  community said I must have a place two inches square cut out, and a hot iron
                  applied; this must be done immediately, otherwise I had only thirty minutes to
                  live.
               "I was stretched on a bed; and watched them as they sharpened their instruments
                  for the excision, and heated the iron for searing. The serpent poison was
                  beginning to act upon me; this, added to the dread of the approaching suffering,
                  overpowered me, and I fainted.
               "When I recovered my senses, I learned that the operation had been performed
                  successfully, the poison completely extracted, and I was safe; for they told me
                  that some days had elapsed during my insensibility.
               "Soon after, I awakened, trembling from head to foot. I was unable to arise, and was ill for some days;
                  indeed many weeks passed before I recovered my usual health and elasticity; and,
                  strange to say, for a long while after I felt a pain in my left arm, and a
                  sensitiveness to the touch in the spot where the dream-bite had been, though there
                  was no mark or bruise perceptible.
               "My physician, to whom I told my dream, said my whole nervous system was as much
                  prostrated as though I had really suffered the terrible serpent bite, excision,
                  and cauterization which I had imagined with such vivid power in my dream. So,
                  Venitia, my rubies did not save me from that dream trouble, you see."
               "Ah," answered the girl, with a pretty look of half superstition, half
                  playfulness, "but in your ring the rubies surround the ill-omened opal,—that
                  unlucky gem that brings the wearer disappointment and fallacious hope."
               And thus closed our midnight talk.
            
            
               HUMAN FAME.
               TALKING of the Toledo crowd, "what a sight it is to be sure," as Mrs. Folham says.
                  Every clear morning we drive through it, getting out of the carriage occasionally
                  to hunt up old buildings, or spend an hour or two looking at the wonderful things
                  contained in the Museo Borbonico. The bronzes, and marbles, and pictures, and
                  precious relics of "those palimpsests of Nature,"—as Heine so finely called
                  Herculaneum and Pompeii,—"where the original old stone text is brought out,"—these
                  are all safely deposited in the fine halls of this building, and displayed there
                  with striking effect.
               But most often we go and study in the churches; for study indeed it is, to hunt up
                  the old tombs and monumental marbles contained in them, and link correctly
                  together the double and treble chain of the artist who carved the story, of the
                  man who lived it, and the full period of history which rounded it into a
                  whole.
               Persons who visit Naples are hardly aware of the vast amount of sepulchral wealth
                  contained in her churches. They are lined and floored and almost roofed with
                  tombs, sarcophagi, statues, bas-reliefs, and stone chests, covered with fine old
                  monumental sculpture, the works of the artists of the fourteenth and fifteenth
                  centuries. We go again and again to
                  certain favorite ones. Santa Chiara, for example, is an unexplored mine of curious
                  beauty and wealth. The old pulpit and bas-reliefs overhanging the western entrance
                  are fine leaves, as it were, in the history of Middle-Age sculpture, for they are
                  the works of the elder Masuccio, who died on the threshold of the fourteenth
                  century (1308).
               By means of ladders and glasses we examined both of these old relics. The
                  bas-reliefs contain the whole of the beautiful legend of that learned and saintly
                  woman, St. Catharine of Alexandria,—she whose history has inspired so many great
                  artists. The daughter of a king, and renowned for her beauty, her learning, and
                  her pride, when a mighty prince asked her in marriage, she refused him, saying she
                  would take no one as her husband unless as noble, as rich, and as wise as
                  herself.
               Some time after, her mother, the queen, sent her to see a holy hermit, who, having
                  promised her a spouse that should be not only her equal, but far exceeding her in
                  rank and all beauty of mind and body, then showed her a tablet on which was traced
                  an image of the Mother of God, holding her Son in her arms. The princess returned
                  home, and dreamed that the figures she had seen on the tablet came to her, as if
                  alive; and when she went to receive the lovely Child, he turned from her, saying
                  she was not beautiful enough.
               Through her mother's prayers, and the intercession of the hermit, she was secretly
                  converted to Christianity; then again she had a vision, and in it Christ's Mother
                  came to her with her Holy Infant, who held a ring in his little hand, and the
                  royal maiden was wedded to him with that ring, which the Child put on her
                  finger.
               All the principal passages in her life are told with touching simplicity in these
                  bas-reliefs. Her first visit to the hermit, her visions, her mystic marriage, her
                  great dispute with the learned heathen doctors, her scourging, exposure to the
                  wheel, and the angel of God breaking it to pieces, her martyrdom,—each one is
                  sculptured with curious grace. They seem uncouth and rude to some eyes. Venitia,
                  for example, sees no beauty in them; on the contrary, she considers them barbarous
                  and frightful. But to Janet and me they unveil all the lovely thought and feeling
                  which lie folded up in them, as the many-hued petals of the flower in the green
                  bud-sheath.
               The secret is, we love the old masters who lived in the early ages of art; we
                  reverence their labors and their memory. These are the master-keys of entrance
                  into the closed chambers of Art's mansion. Some one has beautifully said: "These
                  old sculptures and frescoes remind one of the beneficent fairies, who appear
                  disguised as withered hags, and bestow diamonds and pearls on the discreet maidens
                  who accost them with reverence."
               These bas-reliefs of Masuccio I., rude and unattractive as they may seem to modern
                  eyes, have served, as Spenser said of Chaucer, as a "well of
                     sculpture undefiled"*
                   for great artists. The famous Florentine painter, Masaccio (1402-1443),
                  one of the great founders of a dynasty in art, whose age was an epoch, who had his
                  successors hailing from him like a mighty emperor, and whose frescoes greatly
                  influenced Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, and Michael Angelo, not only studied, but
                  borrowed freely from them for his frescoes at Rome in San Clemente. When we go
                  from such old works to a church filled with modern sculpture, such as the Santa
                  Maria della Pieta de' Sangri, with its figures covered
                  
                     
                     *"Well of English undefiled."
                  
                   with veils and nets,—feats of skill rather than
                  fruits of genius,—it is like passing from fresh, pure, mountain air, into the
                  oppressive atmosphere of a conservatory.
               After seeing these bas-reliefs, we never rested until we had hunted up all we
                  could find of Masuccio's works. We left Santa Chiara without examining the
                  beautiful royal tombs sculptured by his nephew, Masuccio II.; they must take
                  another day of study, we said, and we drove off to the cathedral to find his
                  labors there.
               The cathedral or Duomo building was designed by him for Charles of Anjou, in 1272.
                  The troubles arising out of the "Sicilian Vespers" (1282), which cost Charles the
                  central gem of his newly-acquired crown, Sicily, prevented both king and architect
                  from seeing it completed; it was finished, however, by his nephew, the younger
                  Masuccio, during the reign of Robert the Wise, grandson of Charles of Anjou
                  (1316).
               Several earthquakes damaged the original edifice so much as to require frequent
                  rebuildings; thus its original character is nearly destroyed, little remaining of
                  Masuccio's work except the four lofty towers in the centre of which the architect
                  placed the church. It is a Latin cross, with a nave and two aisles. There are one
                  hundred and eighteen columns in these aisles, of Oriental or Egyptian granite, and
                  African and Cipollino marble, taken by Masuccio I. from the ruins of the temples
                  of Neptune and Apollo, on whose site the cathedral was built. The baptismal font
                  at the entrance, over which we lingered, is a beautiful antique vase, of Egyptian
                  basalt, with a porphyry pedestal, and sculptured with Bacchanalian masks, thyrsus,
                  and festoons of ivy, showing that it must have been a lustral basin in one of the
                  old temples.
               Not wishing to have our chains of dates hopelessly tangled, we did not stop to
                  look at the numberless points of attraction which beckoned to us at every
                  footstep, but proceeded to the Minutoli chapel, to see the tribune, or Gothic
                  altar, and crucifix, with its statues of the Virgin and St. John, which are said
                  to be by Masuccio I., though Lord Lindsay attributes these statues to his friend
                  Pietro de' Stefani.
               Under the tribune of this chapel is inserted the tomb of the Archbishop Filippo
                  Minutoli, by another of Masuccio's pupils, Bamboccio. I should not have noticed
                  it, but Janet, with roguish eyes dancing merrily, said, pointing to it:—
               "O, those naughty, wicked poets! How their bright fun intrudes into these sacred
                  places! Look, Ottilie. This is the very sarcophagus Boccaccio describes in his
                  story of the Jockey of Perugia.*
                   This fellow, Andreuccio by name, came here with two robbers, the night
                  after the Archbishop was buried, to steal a ruby ring of great value which was
                  said to be on his finger. They made a cat's-paw of Andreuccio; but he was more
                  cunning than puss in the fable, for although they frightened him into entering the
                  sarcophagus while they lifted the lid, they could not make him give up the ring.
                  After he found it, he secreted it, and declared it was not there. They did not
                  believe him, of course, and became so provoked that they let the lid fall, and
                  left him, half dead with fright, shut up with the dead body. But they had scarcely
                  gone, when another set of robbers, headed by a naughty priest, entered this chapel
                  on the same errand. They lifted the lid, propped itup, and the priest entered the
                  sarcophagus boldly. Andreuccio said not a word, but gave a furious
                     
                     *Decam, Giorn. II. Nov. V.
                   gripe on his leg, and the priest, being suddenly
                  seized with faith, howled from terror. Making a desperate effort, he broke loose
                  from the Evil One, as he supposed, and rushed off, with his three companions, as
                  if demons were pursuing them. Andreuccio quietly stepped out of the sarcophagus
                  with the ring, left the chapel and the cathedral, and walked straight out of
                  Naples; the next day he was hard on his way to Perugia. Are you shocked, my dear?
                  Well, never mind, I will stop remembering these wild, wicked, witty stories;
                  though, I assure you, your half-serious, half-amused look is very provocative. You
                  know you enjoy them."
               Of course I laughed heartily at the Boccaccio interlude, and replied:—
               "I do not object to hearing it. Boccaccio, with all his naughtiness, was, I fancy,
                  a better believer than many more straight-laced persons. In his day, faith had a
                  living, breathing existence. The poet loved his Church so dearly, and believed it
                  to be so true a thing, that he dared to take liberties with its objectionable
                  accessories. He did not feel afraid of hurting that which he held as immortal, and
                  above all harm. But let us go see the crucifix in the Caracciole Pesquizi chapel;
                  that is another work of Masuccio II."
               While looking at it, a longing took possession of us to see the miraculous
                  crucifix that spoke to St. Thomas Aquinas, and which is preserved in the Church of
                  San Domenico Maggiore; supposed by many to have been made by Masuccio I., and by
                  others to be the work of his unknown master, that aged artist of the
                  semi-Byzantine succession, whose fame, but not his name, is faintly whispered down
                  through Time's long, dark corridor. We drove to San Domenico Maggiore, and had a
                  long and patient search for it; at last we found it, hanging over the main altar
                  of the Capellone del Crocifisso,—Chapel of the Crucifix,—a small side church
                  attached to the main building.
               "Now I am no Catholic," said Janet, as we stood in reverential silence before this
                  wonderful old painting, "but I can never look unmoved on such relics as these;
                  they stir up my whole being; mind and fancy both begin to work. How beautiful the
                  story of this crucifix is, Ottilie. Before it the learned monk St. Thomas Aquinas
                  studied and prayed; and after he had finished his great theological work, the
                     Summa, he fell down humbly before this, offering
                  up himself and his labors to the Lord. The scene took place on this identical
                  spot, the sacristan says; at all events, it could not have been far off. While the
                  'Angelic Doctor,' as men called him, lay prostrate in prayer, one of the brethren
                  entering, Dominick Caserte, beheld the holy man lifted from the ground in ecstasy,
                  and heard a voice from the crucifix saying tenderly and soothingly, 'Bene
                  scripsisti de me, Thoma; quam mercedem accipies?' And the great Father of the
                  Thomists answered meekly, 'Non aliam nisi te, Domine.'"*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *"Thou hast written well of me, Thomas; what recompense wilt thou
                     receive?"—"No other than thyself, O Lord."
               
               After a little pause, Janet, who was bubbling over with Montaigne's sparkling
                     folle de logis,—"bright nonsense and humor
                  full of wisdom," as some one has prettily translated this quaint old
                  expression,—said:—
               "I must tell you another droll story, Ottilie; not a naughty one, but very
                     apropos. Let us leave this sacred old place,
                  and go into that long hall of the sacristy, we passed so hurriedly through a
                  little while ago. We can sit down in those old oaken stalls, under the crimson chests in which rest the dust and ashes
                  of the Aragonese dynasty."
               Three sides of this sacristy corridor to which Janet alluded have rows of coffins
                  on narrow shelves, near the ceiling, covered with faded crimson velvet; on them
                  are the effigies of a sceptre and crown, telling us of the high birth and royal
                  rank of those who were laid away there to sleep, before our western continent was
                  discovered.
               It was the third royal burial-place we had been in that morning. Two were of the
                  Anjou family, which governed Naples from 1266 to 1435. Over the principal entrance
                  of the cathedral we had seen the marble chest or tomb of Charles of Anjou, the
                  founder of the house, the brother of St. Louis of France (1266-1285). At Santa
                  Chiara we had left abruptly the famous and beautiful monumental tomb of his
                  grandson, Robert the Wise (1309-1343). Now we seated ourselves under the remains
                  of the poor descendants, as they claimed to be, of that Manfred Dante sang,*
                   and of those glorious Hohenstaufen Barbarossas whose deeds in the Middle
                   Ages history loves to dwell on (1194-1266).
               
                  
                  *Dante's Purgatorio, III. 112.
               
               With the last one of these unhappy Aragonese princes the romantic Middle Ages
                  ended. Naples, too, ceased to be a kingdom, and for nearly three hundred years
                  swung back into the humble state of a Spanish and German possession (1496).
               These wooden coffins, with their shabby velvet and tarnished gilt ornaments, tell
                  as well as history does of the ruin of the house. In Sicily, costly sculptured
                  marbles and precious porphyry columns commemorate the resting-places of the
                  Suabian Hohenstaufens, from whom these illegitimate Aragonese were descended.
                  Crumbling wood and decaying finery point out gloomily the end of the reigning
                  Neapolitan branch. Illegitimate and unfortunate, it was time for it to cease.
               The sacristan demurred a little when we seated ourselves in the oaken stalls for a
                  comfortable chat; but, telling him we wished to rest awhile, and giving him "that
                  metall," as old Froissart says, "whereby love is attayned both of gentlemen and
                  poor soldiers," he left us undisturbed, and Janet told her story:—
               "After I repeated that dear old legend of St. Thomas Aquinas and the miraculous
                  crucifix, and was thinking how many persons would laugh at it, an anecdote flashed
                  into my mind. The winter after the war with Mexico was over, I met an American
                  gentleman in Paris, who told it to me, and vouched for its truth. This is it. In
                  one of the battles during the war, a colonel was severely and dangerously wounded;
                  he was taken to a neighboring hacienda to be nursed. This hacienda, or plantation,
                  was some distance up in the country, and its master, a wealthy Mexican, had lived
                  on it all his days. He was a gentlemanly, pleasant person, and did all he could to
                  make the stranger comfortable. After some delay and doubt, the colonel was
                  pronounced out of danger, but his convalescence was slow. The Mexican showed him
                  every courtesy. As the invalid grew better, and as the host was a tolerably
                  intelligent man, the two gentlemen naturally fell into conversation over their
                  wine and cigars.
               "The Mexican loved to hear his guest tell of the various improvements modern
                  science had made in the machines and engines used for manufactures and commerce by
                  men in that outer world of which he knew so little. Born and brought up on his
                  hacienda, quite out of the reach of
                  modern books and journals, he was entirely in the dark as to all these things. So
                  the American officer, being a fluent and graphic talker, described, agreeably to
                  his host, the steam-engine and its various uses, and many other wonders, which
                  sounded to the Mexican as marvellous and much more exciting than his holy legends
                  and church miracles. He listened to his guest with a childlike faith that was
                  interesting, never doubting a word he said.
               "One beautiful moonlight evening, they were walking the full length of the long
                  gallery surrounding the house, smoking, and enjoying the freshness of the air
                  after a heavy thunder-shower. The lightning still played in some clouds along the
                  horizon, and, as the colonel looked at it, he commenced describing to the Mexican
                  the electric telegraph. The profound silence of his host made him more earnest; he
                  grew even eloquent, and gave a glowing account of its discovery, application, and
                  use. When he arrived at the close, noticing that his host did not ask the usual
                  questions, he said, 'Is it not wonderful?'
               "'Yes,' answered the Mexican coldly, taking his cigar from his mouth, and leaning
                  his back against a pillar of the high gallery. 'It is very wonderful. Everything
                  you have been relating to me, Colonel, is wonderful. But I will tell you what is
                  more wonderful still, your powers of invention. I have been listening to you now
                  for some time, not only enjoying your fine conversation, but believing with the
                  innocence of a child all the great things you have been describing. I might have
                  known they were fables, but I did not; nor should I have suspected you, if you had
                  not created this last story. Now I know that they are all untrue.'
               "It was useless for the colonel to assure his incredulous host; he never gained
                  any credence after that last great demand on his faith. I often think of this
                  story when I hear the marvellous old legends which have come down to us from that
                  saintly age when sweet Faith was what Science is now, the sovereign ruler of men's
                  minds and hearts. The world was benighted then, according to modern views,—the
                  Dark Ages! And yet that blessed sun of Faith must have thrown lovely lights. Now
                  it is twilight; and our lamps of Science show us that the branches, and leaves,
                  and ground are not pure gold, as those beautiful rays made them appear; but it
                  seems we walk darkly, notwithstanding all our lamps and all our knowledge."
               Before leaving the sacristy, we stopped to look at one of the coffin-chests
                  resting on a balustrade against the wall. Above it was a portrait of a fine
                  soldierly-looking man, in a Franciscan habit, with a banner and a sword. As with
                  one thought, we both exclaimed, "Francis Pescara, O unconquered peer!"*
                   It was the tomb and portrait of the celebrated Ferdinando Francesco d'
                  Avalos, Marchese di Pescara, who died, in the flower of his age, of the wounds
                  received at the battle of Pavia (1525), after contributing greatly to the capture
                  of Francis I. He was the husband of Vittoria Colonna, the woman who was adored by
                  Michael Angelo, and reverenced by Ariosto, and all the great men of her day. The
                  conjugal love between Francesco d' Avalos and Vittoria has always been a subject
                  of comment and admiration. When he was taken prisoner at Ravenna (1512) by the
                  French, he addressed to her a beautiful dialogue on love.
               
                  
                  *Ariosto's Orlando Furioso, Cant. 37, Stan. 20, Rose's trans.
               
               Vittoria was only thirty-three when she lost him; and though living many years
                  after, and wooed and worshipped shipped
                  by poets, artists, and famous men, she remained true to her husband's memory. She
                  was a gifted poetess, as well as a beautiful and virtuous woman; and sung her
                  love, her loss, and her sorrow, over on that island of Ischia, in lines that won
                  not only Ariosto's praise,*
                     but gained her the title of "Divine" from her contemporaries.
               
                  
                  *Ariosto's Orlando Furioso, Cant. 37, Stan. 16 et seq.
                  
               
               It is true Aretino calumniated the wife, and Guicciardini said very harsh things
                  of the husband; but the historian must have been blinded by political prejudice;
                  and as for the infamous Aretino, as a witty Italian said, "he satirized every one
                  except God, whom he spared only because he did not know him."
               So we stood a little while before the coffin-chest and portrait, remembering only
                  the beautiful things which had been said and believed of this great general and
                  his noble wife; for the woman graced with Michael Angelo's love and reverence, and
                  the man adorned with Ariosto's praise and friendship, could not have been wanting
                  in honor and excellence.
               The next day we returned to Santa Chiara to look at the royal tombs which we had
                  left so abruptly the day before. They were sculptured by the nephew and successor
                  of Masuccio I. This Masuccio the younger was patronized by Robert the Wise,
                  Charles of Anjou's grandson, he who afterwards gave royal favor and reception to
                  Giotto and Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio, for he had a long and a prosperous
                  reign.
               When the king and the architect were young, they labored together for God's and
                  Art's service, in completing the cathedral, which had been commenced by the
                  grandfather of the one and the uncle of the other, as I have mentioned before.
                  Then when the young king had passed early manhood, and reached his first
                  grief,—the death of his only son, the Duke of Calabria,—Robert sent for his
                  favorite artist to come and sculpture a fitting monument for this beloved child,
                  who had lain down to sleep just as manhood was beginning.
               Masuccio sculptured a beautiful sarcophagus to the memory of the prince, and laid
                  the stone image of the young man on top of it, clothed in royal robes, which are
                  spotted with fleurs de lis. On his head is a
                  crown, and two angels draw aside the veil from the body. A bas-relief in front
                  represents the young Duke as a sovereign, surrounded by his court; at his feet are
                  a wolf and a lamb drinking together at a fountain, emblematical of the peace and
                  good-will which would have resulted from his justice. Columns supported by lions
                  uphold the sarcophagus, and the whole is placed in a recess to the right of the
                  main altar, which recess is a lofty Gothic arch.
               After Masuccio II. had finished this work, he showed to the king a design which he
                  had made for a monument to be placed over Robert when he lay down to rest beside
                  his child. The king was pleased with it, but said "it was too magnificent for a
                  man of little merit in the sight of God." But after some years the good king died,
                  and his lovely but unfortunate granddaughter, Joanna I., commanded the sculptor to
                  erect it to the memory of that beloved grandfather who had reared her so tenderly,
                  as the only child of his darling son, and left her such a perilous inheritance as
                  a kingdom. Poor queen! All the sorrow which her young father escaped by his early
                  death must have been held back in store for her, as she had more than double the
                  anguish that falls to the lot of mortals, even when grievously afflicted.
               
               On approaching the church, we tarried awhile in the close, to look at the
                  Campanile, also said to be a work of Masuccio II. It remains unfinished, as Robert
                  the Wise died before its third story was completed. Masuccio's design gave it five
                  stories, each bearing one of the five orders. The arrangement of the capitals on
                  the third or Ionic story is attributed to Michael Angelo.
               Upon entering the church, to our vexation we found the place around the high altar
                  and tombs filled with persons preparing for a grand fête. There were ladders
                  leaning near the gaudy modern altar, which stands in front of one of the tombs,
                  and upholsterers on scaffolding, hanging rich draperies of crimson, sewn with
                  gold. We feared we were to be baffled, but Janet and I are equally pertinacious;
                  so, by a judicious and generous application of old Froissart's "rare metall," we
                  secured even a better view than we could have had on any other day, for they
                  allowed us to mount the ladders and walk on the scaffolding; thus we got so close
                  to the upper parts of the sculpture, that we stood face to face with the marble
                  effigies, and touched them with our hands.
               They are fine specimens of Gothic beauty, when we remember the early age in which
                  they were done (1350). The modern altar stands in front of and hides King Robert's
                  tomb. It is a stately pile of marble, full thirty-five feet high. The king is
                  seated on his throne, clad in royal robes; he lies extended also on the
                  sarcophagus, wrapped in the monkish habit which he assumed a few weeks before his
                  death,—the Franciscan gown. There are apostles, saints, and various other
                  emblematical figures distributed around the tomb. Every part is conscientiously
                  worked; the back, which is far away from sight, is just as perfect as the front;
                  and, as I stood on a swaying ing ladder, I passed my hands around the decorations
                  of the royal chair and upper part of the monument, and found that nothing was left
                  incomplete, all was as perfect as if intended for the most exposed part of the
                  tomb. The artist had worked for himself and Art's holy service. On the tomb is
                  this line, which is said to be by Petrarch:— 
                     CERNITE. ROBERTVM. REGEM. VIRTVTE. REFERTVM.
                  
               
               On our return home, we stopped at Detken's, and were lucky enough to find a copy
                  of Cicognara's Revival of Arts in Italy, in the first volume of which is an
                  engraving of the tomb of the Duke of Calabria, Robert's son. I cannot pretend to
                  do justice to either of these stately and beautiful tombs; but if ever monumental
                  art should revive, become again a living work, and there should be Pre-Angelites
                  in sculpture as there are now Pre-Raphaelites in painting, Naples will be their
                  Mecca.
               While at Detken's, I purchased a book, which I am reading with great
                  interest,—General Colletta's History of Naples, which is the popular one of the
                  day, especially among liberalists. It was recommended to us by "that
                  vigorous-minded little person, Mrs. Rochester," as Mrs. Folham, with true English
                  expression, calls our agreeable Ambassadress. Indeed, it was through her husband's
                  kindness that I obtained the work, as it is, of course, a forbidden book; he
                  ordered it for me from Paris, through Detken; and, being for the American
                  Ambassador, no questions were asked.
               Mrs. Rochester, by the way, is really full of intelligence and esprit; as clever in mind as a man, and naïve as a gay
                  girl. Her social position, with its attendant duties, she being "La Doyenne," or
                  eldest resident of the diplomatic
                  circle, separates her a little from our daily course; but she loves nothing better
                  than to throw off the trammels of her position once in a while, and enjoy what she
                  calls "true life" with us. She has lived in Naples several years, and is quite
                  familiar with the country and its history in its various remarkable phases,—its
                  classic, mediæval, and modern,—so that with her assistance, added to our own
                  previous and continued studies, we find out nearly all we wish to know.
               She told me a curious story about this Colletta book. General Colletta, its
                  author, was an officer in the Engineers, who served under Murat, and distinguished
                  himself. In 1820, after the return of Ferdinand I., he was banished from Naples.
                  He went to Florence, and soon found his way into the literary and political
                  society of the Palazzo Buondalmonte.
               Now I must make a little digression to explain what this Palazzo Buondalmonte was.
                  It was literally a great literary workshop, belonging to a Genevese, Jean Pierre
                  Viesseaux. In 1820 he took this palazzo, and divided it off to suit his purposes.
                  On the ground-floor he put his printing-presses; on the next was a circulating
                  library, of great extent, with magazines, reviews, and journals from every part of
                  Europe spread out on the tables,—a public reading-room. The upper stories were
                  devoted to his editors, press-correctors, secretaries, clerks, in short all the
                  staff of an extensive publishing business. The Anthologie, a review something like the Revue
                     des Deux Mondes, was published by him. When it had reached its
                  thirteenth year, it was suppressed to gratify the Czar of Russia, who thought it
                  had treated him and his affairs too familiarly in one of its numbers. Cavour was
                  one of its contributors, when Predari was its editor, somewhere near 1846 or
                  1847.
               But to return to the Palazzo. Its reading-saloon has always been the rendezvous of
                  the literary and political men of the day. Giordani, Nicolini, Leopardi, Pœrio,
                  and many other Italian notorieties, could be found there. A gentleman carrying a
                  letter of introduction to M. Viesseaux would always receive an invitation to his
                  Thursday réunion of artists and savants. He was
                  a generous and intelligent publisher, not only helping authors to means, but to
                     fame.*
                   His encouragement and good advice developed General Colletta into an
                   historian, for he felt a great sympathy as well as friendship for the old man.
               
                  
                  *Viesseaux had some happy days at the close of his long life. In 1859 he
                     completed his eightieth year, on which occasion his friends presented him
                     with a gold medal, bearing his profile and this simple legend:— 
                        
                           Per quarant' anni benemerito
                           Dell' Italiana Civilità
                           Compriva l'Oltantesimo della Vita
                           Il 29 Settembre 1859.
                        
                     
                  
                  Before he died the old man had the satisfaction of seeing his friends who
                     had been disgraced and persecuted for politics' sake high in favor, and
                     foremost in rank,—Peruzzi twice in power, Ricasoli at the summit. The great
                     work was accomplished, the dream verified, and Viesseaux could sing the
                     canticle of old Simeon, and go to sleep in triumph.
                  One morning in 1863, Victor Emmanuel arrived in Florence, and Viesseaux
                     seemed to have grown sixty years younger. His serene joy burst out into
                     youthful gayety. He invited relatives and friends to reunite at his house
                     the next day, and rejoice with him over the attainment of National Unity.
                     But on that very evening the old man was stricken down with apoplexy, from
                     which blow he never arose, and the 30th of the same month a funeral
                     procession from a mourning city followed the remains of this great publisher
                     to the Protestant cemetery of Florence.
                  Up to his last moments he retained his faculties and mental strength. His
                     correspondence extended over two hemispheres, and was with high and low. M.
                     Marc-Monnier, from whose article in the Revue
                        Germanique, July, 1863, the facts in this note are taken,
                     mentions that he has upwards of twenty letters from Viesseaux, written just
                     before his death, the handwriting of which is firm and clear.
               
               
               Soon after Colletta became a habitué of the
                  Palazzo Buondalmonte, finding his companions were all great authors, a natural
                  spirit of emulation made him desire to be one also. And two greater reasons than
                  mere ambition impelled him,—a need of support, and an earnest desire to tell his
                  country's story, which he felt he knew by heart better than any one else. The
                  brave old soldier had never read a book in his life but Tacitus. This was nothing.
                  He resolved to write his nation's history, taking up the thread where Giannone had
                  stopped, and continuing it up to 1825; for, he thought, in that period the causes
                  of many present evils could be found, the palliation of many sins discovered, and,
                  from them, future help and improvement be obtained. So he set to work boldly.
               When he brought the manuscript of his first volume to his literary friends at the
                  Palazzo Buondalmonte, to his extreme mortification they condemned it. Leopardi, it
                  is said, even discouraged him from continuing. The style was stiff and diffuse,
                  the stories prolix and dull.
               But the kind, good publisher would not listen to his giving up the work. He
                  encouraged him, and roused anew the old man's flagging energy. Accordingly, the
                  brave soldier set to work again courageously from the very beginning.
               "Write your story as you tell it; that's all," said the practical Viesseaux.
               And he did. He tore up the stilted pages of the first volume, and
                     put down on paper his own simple, but fiery and rapid words. He
                  recast the whole work, and grouped facts with soldierly precision together. The
                  result was a striking, well-written narrative, that was applauded highly by the
                  very ones who had condemned the first attempt.
               Viesseaux did not think it prudent to publish the book in Florence, so he sent it
                  to Geneva to be brought out. The good old man, like Byron, awoke one fine day and
                  found himself famous. The free tone of the work delighted the large body of
                  Liberalists throughout reading Europe; and the book was gladly received, as it
                  contained just the information everybody wished to know. But its stern
                  condemnation of the poor Bourbons created a great alarm and enmity. The
                  good-natured Grand Duke found himself forced to banish the author from Florence,
                  even before his work had appeared in the city.
               But the order of exile, and the fame, and the worldly prosperity arrived nearly
                  too late. When the officer came to deliver the Grand Duke's message, he found the
                  poor old man in bed, dying.
               "Ask his Highness," said Colletta, "to grant me the delay of a few hours. In that
                  time I shall have departed for an exile where no police will trouble me
                  again."
               A little while after, the stout-hearted old soldier lay stiff and dead. He never
                  had the gratification of seeing his fine History in print; but the coming sound of
                  its future fame reached his dying ears, and, I hope, it gave him much peace and
                  content.
            
            
               
               "NOBILE OZIO."
               NAPLES is the very place in which one can best enjoy Machiavelli's nobile ozio,—"a noble idleness of delightful society,
                  with classical associations, under a heaven of beauty."
               The weather is delicious just on the threshold of May,—a pleasant season in most
                  countries, but in this paradise particularly lovely. 
                     
                        "Soft, silken hours,
                        Open suns, shady bowers;
                        'Bove all, nothing which lowers."
                     
                  
               
               I have already told how we spend our mornings. Late in the afternoon we drive on
                  the Chiaja, and out to Posilippo, or loiter through the long alleys of the Villa
                  Reale, which, "with its ever green groups of holm-oaks and laurels, its fountains
                  and sculptures, its temples sacred to Virgil and Tasso, lies along the shore of
                  the Mediterranean like a string of emeralds."*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *De Reumont.
               
               Sometimes the morning's occupation keeps us out so late that we feel indifferent
                  about the drive to the Posilippean hills; then we meet on the terrace, to enjoy
                  the sunset, and watch the stream of elegant equipages rolling along the smooth
                  lava pavement of the Chiaja and Mergellina, and look at the groups of idlers lying
                  down or sauntering about,—the thriftless, do-nothing Neapolitan masses.
               Over on the Mergellina bank are crowds of fishermen and boatmen, preparing for a
                  sail or row, either to take a party of pleasure or to follow their fishing trade.
                  This Mergellina beach is their only home; they know no other; here are their
                  children playing in the pebbles and shells, their wives lounging and gossiping,
                  and their gray-headed grandmothers spinning with the old distaff of Clotho,
                  looking as if they were grim Fates, attending the coming destiny of this doomed
                  land,—the fulfilment of that fearful old oracle, 
                     
                        "Some day, around the Siren's stony tomb,
                        A mighty multitude shall meet their doom."
                     
                  
               
               These common people of Naples are a strange race; full of contradictions; lawless,
                  demanding liberty even to license, and yet king-loving; a religious nation, full
                  of faith and devotion, but quite devoid of piety. They can no longer be called
                  Lazzaroni, for they are losing fast all claim to that title. Indeed, on a grand
                  fête-day there is not a lazzaro to be found in
                  all Naples; every man is dressed, and going as swiftly as he can on his road to
                  the tiers état, or Third Estate; that is, so far
                  as decent appearance is concerned.
               General Colletta, in his History, speaks very bitterly of the origin of the name
                  of these "Sons of Lazarus." "They," he says, meaning the Spaniards, "called them
                     'lazzari' (for lazzaroni is only an augmentative), a word borrowed from the
                  language of these superb tyrants of ours who insulted a misery of which they were
                  the authors, and made its memory eternal by this name.
               "A man was not born a lazzaro. The lazzaro who applied himself to a trade lost his name;
                  and the man who lived like a beast,
                  became a lazzaro. These Lazzaroni increased to
                  an innumerable swarm; for how was it possible to take the census of such a
                  semi-savage, vagabond population? At one time, it was believed they amounted to
                  thirty thousand; poor, audacious, eager and greedy in robbery, and ready for every
                  sort of disorder."
               Under the Spanish vice-regal rule (1502-1700), which was the period of time when
                  the Lazzaroni flourished in fullest force and vigor, this wild set had a species
                  of government, an organization as strict as that of the thieves in the Paris
                     Cour de Miracles, during the reign of Louis
                     XI.*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *
                     Notre Dame de Paris, of Victor Hugo.
               
               Every year a chief (capo lazzaro) was elected,
                  charged with the duty of defending their interests before the viceroy. One of the
                  most famous of these capo lazzari was the
                  fisherman of Amalfi, Massaniello, the chief of the great revolution in 1647.
               "By the fruit judge ye the tree," says a French author, alluding to this curious
                  clan of people. "The Lazzaroni were the fruit of the Spanish vice-regal
                  government. Naples has often been reproached with the shame of having produced
                  this race of white negroes. This reproach is unjust. The plant flowered and bore
                  fruit at Naples, it is true, but the seed came from Spain. The Spaniards carried
                  it into Italy as their garrisons and vessels have so often taken the plague
                  there."
               This Spanish vice-regal government was the saddest and most injurious rule in its
                  effect that could have been inflicted upon a people; it lasted two hundred years
                  (1500-1700). Spain held Naples all this time by virtue of a right derived from
                  Ferdinand the Catholic, who was the legitimate representative of that Aragonese
                  house which traced its genealogy back to Constance, the daughter of the great
                  Roger of Sicily, daughter-in-law, wife, and mother of the three famous Barbarossas
                  of the "splendid Suabian house of Hohenstaufen" (1194-1250),—she whom history and
                  poesy has contributed to make immortal.

               I will turn back the pages of history rapidly to repeat over the story of the
                  kings of Naples deposed by Ferdinand the Catholic in 1500. Those poor crumbling
                  coffin-chests, covered with faded velvet and adorned with tarnished tinsel, which
                  we saw the other day in the Sacristy of San Domenico Maggiore, hold the remains,
                  as I mentioned then, of the illegitimate branch of the family which came in
                  possession of the throne in this way.
               Joanna II. (1414-1435), great-great-granddaughter of Charles of Anjou, left as one
                  of her heirs Alfonso, king of Sicily, the descendant of that Hohenstaufen family
                  just alluded to, from whom her ancestor, Charles of Anjou, had wrested the kingdom
                  of Naples (1266).
               This king of Sicily, called in history the Magnanimous, reigned in Naples until
                  1458. When he died, Sicily reverted to his brother, John II., king of Aragon and
                  Navarre, father of Ferdinand the Catholic; and Naples also should have gone to
                  him, but Alfonso had a natural son, Ferdinand, who had been legitimated by Pope
                  Calixtus III., fourteen years before his father's death, and to him Alfonso left
                  the crown of Naples.
               
               From 1458 to 1490 this illegitimate branch held Naples, when the last one,
                  Ferdinand, Prince of Almatura, was expelled by the son of John II., king of Aragon
                  and Navarre, who had succeeded to his father's dominions and claims. This son is
                  well known in history; he was Ferdinand the Catholic, husband of Isabella of
                  Castile,—Columbus's queen,—representative of the old Suabian Hohenstaufens, and
                  grandfather of the Emperor Charles V.
               After some contests between Ferdinand and Louis XII. of France, arising out of the
                  Partition Treaty of Granada (November 11, 1500), in 1504 the kingdom of Naples
                  became, like Sicily, a Spanish province or possession.
               The "Great Captain," Gonsalvo de Cordova, whose military skill and success had
                  secured this rich kingdom to his royal master, Ferdinand of Aragon and Castile,
                  was the first Spanish viceroy (1504). With him commenced this unhappy rule of
                  Spanish viceroys in Naples, the injurious effect of which can be seen to this day,
                  for they oppressed the people with taxes, and degraded the nobility by encouraging
                  them in vice and extravagance.
               Among these viceroys, however, some honorable exceptions can be found; for
                  instance, Don Pedro de Toledo, who was the father-in-law of Cosmo de' Medici,
                  first Grand Duke of Tuscany, and representative of Charles V. (1532-1552). Over
                  three centuries have passed since this vice-regal sovereign held rule in Naples,
                  and yet the impression remains sharper in its outline and deeper in its stamp than
                  the rule of any later governor or king, except Don Carlos, the founder of the
                  present Spanish Bourbon family (Charles VII., son of Philip V. of Spain, and his
                  queen, Elizabetta Farnese of Parma, 1734).
               In walking through the streets of Naples, and visiting its public buildings, we
                  find that these two men, Don Pedro and Don Carlos, stand out prominent as almost
                  fathers and founders of the place. Their respective eras are two hundred years
                  apart; but the traveller unites the two in his mind, and wishes this beautiful
                  place could have been blessed with a long line of such wise and just rulers; then
                  would the peninsula have been a governmental reality instead of a mere
                  "geographical expression."
               "No ruler," says De Reumont,*
                   "ever had such despotic power, or exercised as great an influence over the
                  fate of Italy as this first Toledo. He governed the Neapolitans for their own
                  benefit, and not for the king of Spain only. He treated the people with so much
                  favor, and the depraved nobility with such severity, that the barons offered the
                  Emperor a million and a half of ducats to relieve them from his surveillance."
               
                  
                  *"Carafas of Maddaloni, Naples under Spanish Dominion," by Alfred de
                     Reumont.
               
               But that Emperor was Charles V., who, although he was one of those "great royal
                  devourers of the people," ate them after a generous, soldierly fashion. He was a
                  wise prince, so far as kingcraft was concerned; he knew Toledo's value, his
                  fitness for his place, and paid no attention to the complaints urged against
                  him.
               So Don Pedro reigned twenty years, and steadily built up for himself and his
                  descendants fame and fortune, as he thought. In the most enviable and beautiful
                  principality in all Italy,—Tuscany,—he placed one of his daughters, the unhappy
                  wife and mother, Eleanor de Toledo, Duchess of Cosmo de' Medici, first Grand Duke
                  (1537-1574). But what matter if sin and sorrow and fearful tragedies did flow in a thick-clotted red
                  current around this Grand Duchess's daughter; the golden and purple drapery of
                  rank and royal station enveloped her and her griefs in their gorgeous folds; was
                  not that recompense?—Heart-breaking anguish, enough to shake her reason from its
                  balance, crimes that make the reader of history shiver and close his eyes in
                  disgust, and shut the chronicle with a sickening loathing, whether it be that
                  fearful scene in the hall of the Ducal Palace, at hot noontide, which the painter
                  Vasari saw from his scaffolding where he lay half asleep, after his ceiling fresco
                  labors of the morning, or that of the fratricidal son clinging to the robe of his
                  mother,—poor Eleanor de Toledo,—for protection against the uplifted and relentless
                  dagger of his crime-stained father! O no, these were nothing when weighed in the
                  balance with success and power!
               Don Pedro neither saw nor thought of any of these sorrowful attendants on his
                  firm, granite built grandeur. He gave this beautiful daughter a rank which was
                  almost equal with a queen, and saw his son viceroy of Sicily; resisted Pope Paul
                  III.; put haughty Neapolitan nobles to the torture; reformed the laws; remodelled
                  the town; built castles and fortresses and watch-towers on all the coast around,
                  in order to protect the country from the ravages of the Turks; opposed and
                  prevented the establishment of the Inquisition in Naples; and this, too, in the
                  very teeth of his royal master, Charles V., a monarch that not many men dared
                  brave or oppose; and, through all his stern, iron, but just rule, kept the
                  confidence and favor of this master, and held also his almost kingly office from
                  middle age up to his death.
               Full of years, honor, and success was this great Don Pedro when they brought him
                  to the palace of his daughter ter at Florence to die. As commander-in-chief of the
                  emperor's forces, with his ducal son-in-law, Cosmo di Medici, serving under him,
                  he had been enforcing submission on the Republic of Siena, the brave old man!
                  Though threescore years and ten, he was taken from the battle-field to his
                  death-bed, dying with the harness on (1553).
               Mrs. Rochester loves this grand old Viceroy's history and memory. The other
                  morning she took me to the Church of San Giacomo degli Spagnuoli, in the Largo del
                  Castello, to see his tomb. This church was built by Don Pedro, in 1540, as a
                  church for the use of Spanish soldiers. The architect was Manlio, pupil of
                  Giovanni Merliani, or da Nola (as he was called, from his birthplace). This
                  church, and Santa Chiara, are under the jurisdiction of the Papal Nuncio.
               The tomb is the masterpiece of Giovanni da Nola, who is called also the Neapolitan
                  Michael Angelo (1478-1559); it is covered with fine sculpturing, and surmounted by
                  kneeling statues, full life size, of Don Pedro and his wife. It is behind the
                  grand high altar of the church, in the place called the choir. We sat for some
                  time in the beautifully carved stalls, and examined leisurely this fine work of
                  monumental sculpture, while we talked together about Don Pedro's eventful,
                  successful life.
               "Soon after I came to Naples," said Mrs. Rochester, "becoming interested in this
                  great Spaniard's history, I searched out faithfully every trace of his career. I
                  found this tomb by chance.
               "One day my friend A—— and I had been groping about down in the old quarters of
                  the town near the sea. We had been hunting up the cloisters of Mont' Oliveto, that
                  old garden where Tasso had mourned and held mysterious intercourse with the unseen spirit who
                  visited him in those last sorrowful years while he was waiting for the peace and
                  rest of death to come.
               "I love to recall the morning of which I speak. A—— and I had heavy loads of
                  trouble weighing us down at the time; but we shook them off, and were as gay as
                  girls, while we hunted up the old gardens and cloisters. At last we found them;
                  but they were wofully changed into a fruit and vegetable market, filthy and muddy
                  of course. We bought apricots, figs, and green almonds; leaned against the columns
                  of the cloisters while we ate our fruit, and listened to the screaming, shrill
                  talk of the people around us.
               "A—— contrasted these unmusical tones with the sweet sounds which had filled the
                  place when the dying poet found tranquillity under the shadows of the trees long
                  since dead. We bought some flowers, too, I remember,—for it was only a little
                  later than this in spring,—June roses, in memory of those famous white and red
                  ones which had grown in Tasso's time in this now crowded and dirty market-place,
                  where nothing thrives but petty trade and vile dirt. Very different in that time
                  was it, indeed,—not only for this market-place, but for everything; grand old
                  tyrannical days were they, when, as you and A—— say, if great wrongs and great
                  sins were committed, the acts and works of Poesy and Art were correspondingly
                  magnificent.
               "But to come back to my story,—what little I have to tell. After leaving the
                  desecrated garden of Mont' Oliveto, we rambled through one or two of the old
                  quarters of the town, which you know bear this day the names of the callings or
                  trades to which they were formerly devoted,—the Guantai or Glove quarter, and the
                  like. About midday, we came out on this Largo del Castello, hot and tired enough,
                  I assure you; the air from the Mole was very pleasant, and the sparkling water in
                  the Fountain Medina was refreshing to look at. I think the jets darting up from
                  the stone trident of Neptune, and the spouting tritons on the sea-horses in the
                  centre of the fountain shell, never looked so beautiful to me as they did on that
                  hot June noonday.
               "On our way into the Toledo, where we intended going to rest at the nice cake-shop
                  on the corner of the Strada Chiaja, we stumbled on this church. We were attracted
                  by those sarcophagi in the entrance-way. A—— asked a man the name of the church.
                  'San Giacomo degli Spagnuoli,' was the reply.
               "We were just linking Don Pedro's history together; and, tired as we were, we
                  could not resist the temptation, like children reading a fairy-tale at bedtime, to
                  turn over just one leaf more.
               "'Here is where Don Pedro is buried,' I said. 'This is the very church we have
                  been intending to search for. Come, let us go in for one minute at least.'
               "We entered, and spent a full hour feasting on this huge sarcophagus. Look at the
                  grand old Viceroy,—the Imperial Commander! There he kneels, opposite his young
                  wife,—not the beautiful heiress bride of his boyhood, the one he wedded when he
                  was only thirteen, and who brought to the favorite little page of King Ferdinand
                  the Catholic—this second son of the ducal house of Alva—a title, a fortune, and
                  fair sons and daughters who were born to reign and sorrow. No, not that wife: she
                  had been dead some years, not only before her Tuscan duchess daughter wept tears
                  of blood over incest, and fratricide, and all those shivering sins,—but also in
                     time to give her husband another
                  fair young wife to cheer his martial old age.
               "Very meek this second wife, Donna Vicenza Spinelli, looks in that sculptured
                  image of her. See, she is bending over her book of devotion. And then the old
                  soldier Viceroy, bold and resolute is his air; he leans on the hilt of his sword,
                  and gazes around with pride, as if he tasted and loved his power,—while the young
                  wife prays. Great need for prayer there, Ottilie. For, powerful and successful as
                  was this Don Pedro, ruin and disgrace flew fleet as hounds on the heels of his
                  posterity. It is a superb monument, is it not?"
               Mrs. Rochester then pointed out to me the bas-reliefs on its base, and read to me
                  from her active brain and memory the sculptured history. All Toledo's proudest
                  deeds are there recorded in stone,—his enterprise against the Turks at Otranto,
                  his victory over Chayreddin Barbarossa, and his triumph over his enemies, after
                  the Inquisition insurrection, when the Emperor Charles V. made his grand entry
                  into Naples, leaning on his proud Viceroy, and saying, with grim pleasantry, "Don
                  Pedro, you are not the fierce tyrant they have described you."
               Neither of these two men indulged in pleasantry often; when they did, it was for a
                  more serious purpose than mere mirth. Both were solemn, stern, warlike, and full
                  of unwearying activity. Life was no holiday for them, no merry fête, but a strife
                  for dominion and success,—a season for the planting of that sorrowful vine,
                  climbing ambition, which yields a sad vintage, and did for the posterity of both
                  these men,—imperial master and vice-regal servant,—for their second generation
                  drank the bitterest draughts of the blackest sorrow; from the golden cup of high
                  station, it is true, but so bitter and black as to make the most ambitious recoil
                  from rank and high estate, if such penalties must come with them.
               Just two hundred years this vice-regal government lasted, during which time Naples
                  was treated by Spain as another Mexico or Peru,—used and abused. Her nobles
                  sacrificed their fortunes, and sometimes their lives, in foreign wars,—in the
                  military service of a foreign government,—or remained at home, in idleness,
                  deprived of all political employment and influence. The people were oppressed by
                  taxes and degraded by the bad example set by their rulers,—the example of loose
                  morals, not only in politics, but in their daily domestic and social life; and all
                  that Naples gained, by having established the political succession of the Spanish
                  house of Aragon, in 1490, were humiliations, misery, and a demoralizing servitude
                  of two centuries, the corroding marks of which chains can be seen festering at
                  this very day.
               During these two hundred years of Spanish tyranny, two great insurrections broke
                  out, which were remarkable for two curious things; they took place exactly a
                  century apart, and were each headed by a popular leader bearing almost the same
                  name.
               The first one was the Inquisition revolt during the viceroyalty of Don Pedro in
                  1547,—the insurrection that set Tasso's father on his wanderings, by ruining his
                  patron Ferrante Sanseverino, Prince of Salerno, teaching the poet and his father
                  Dante's bitter experience,— 
                     
                        "how salt a stranger's bread,
                        How hard a path still up and down to tread
                        A stranger's stairs."
                     
                  
               
               The leader of the Inquisition insurrection was Tommaso Annello of Sorrento, who
                  had not, however, the ruinous success and unhappy fate which attended the leader of the great second rebellion a
                  hundred years after, Tomaso Anniello of Amalfi, so well known as Massaniello, a
                  name formed by a union of the diminutive of the first name with the surname.
               This second insurrection, headed by Massaniello, broke out in 1647, under the
                  viceroyalty of the Duke d'Arcos, and was caused by the heavy weight of taxes,
                  which had grown to be so painful a load as to make restive even the patient,
                  good-natured Neapolitan human mule. "Everything was taxed," says De Reumont, "even
                  the light of the sun."
               This last Massaniello insurrection is famous also for having had among its
                  rebellious numbers a little group of artists, whose names, especially one,
                  Salvator Rosa, are associated more with fine works of art than patriotic
                  street-fights. They banded together, and called themselves by the murderous name
                  of "Compagnia della Morte," Company of the Dead. Salvator Rosa's master, Aniello
                  Falcone, the great battle-painter, headed this little band; he was a relation of
                  Massaniello; the cavalier Calabrese (Mattia Preti) and Mico Spadaro were also
                  members of this company. These artists were all friends and boon companions of the
                  unfortunate fisherman of Amalfi. Mico Spadaro's fearfully graphic pictures of this
                  insurrection and the plague which ravaged Naples ten years later can be seen in
                  the first room of the "Early Neapolitan School," in the Musée Borbonique; also a
                  life-like portrait of Massaniello, smoking his pipe.
               We were talking of this fearful insurrection to-day at dinner; and Janet suggested
                  that the sudden and mysterious madness of this ill-fated capo di Lazzari might have been caused by that subtle power, so well
                  known, and employed with such fearful sang-froid
                  by the rulers of that day,—poison!
               At last an end came to this vice-regal rule. In 1700 the Spanish or elder branch
                  of the house of Austria ended with Charles II. of Spain. By the will of this
                  monarch, the Spanish kingdom, with all its possessions, went to Philip, Duke of
                  Anjou, who was his grandson and the son of Louis XIV. Philip's mother was Louis
                  XIV.'s queen, the Spanish Infanta, Maria Theresa, daughter of Charles II. This
                  prince ascended the Spanish throne as Philip V., the first of the Spanish house of
                  Anjou. But, when he proceeded to continue possession of the Neapolitan part of his
                  dominions, Leopold I. of Austria, who had married a younger daughter of Charles
                  II., disputed his claim, presenting his son the Archduke Charles as the rightful
                  heir, under a will of Philip IV., father of Charles II.
               Then came a long war, called in history the "War of the Spanish Succession," in
                  which figured "the crafty, uncertain, fascinating hero," Marlborough, and the
                  high-minded, noble Prince Eugene; it lasted until 1713, when it was partially
                  terminated by the Peace of Utrecht; but only partially, because neither of the two
                  leading governments engaged in the war would yield its pretensions. Austria
                  continued, however, to hold Naples until 1734, under a succession of German
                  viceroys. Then a gallant, bold young paladin of a prince, scarcely eighteen years
                  of age, conquered, by his sword, what he considered his birthright, the Neapolitan
                  throne. This was the great "Don Carlos," Charles de Bourbon, founder of the
                  Neapolitan Bourbon family, son of Philip V., by his beautiful second wife, the
                  ambitious and clever Elizabetta Farnese of Parma.
               In this chivalric young prince the Bourbon blood of France and the Aragon blood of
                  Spain were centred. He was one of those
                  great breakwaters in history which seem to rise up suddenly while the waves of
                  political events are sweeping noisily and confusingly on, as if created for the
                  occasion, either to stem and check the tide of some overwhelming chaos of
                  rebellion run riot, or to establish a new dynasty.
               There was no reason why this young Bourbon prince should not have been one of the
                  same royal figure-heads that had preceded him in the Spanish family. In his veins
                  ran the same sang azur, and he had fed on the
                  same white bread. But Nature needed a man, and it suited her waywardness and
                  caprice just then to toss the soul of a conqueror and a hero into a royal cradle,
                  instead of a bourgeoise bed.
               His life was one of those military romances common to the close of the eighteenth
                  and opening of the nineteenth centuries; since then Europe has relapsed into the
                  old way of statecraft and policy, and has more heroes of tools and protocols than
                  heroes of the sword. While reading his dazzling career we seem to be transported
                  to mediæval times, even to that far-off Norman era of his ancestors, commemorated
                  by the Monk of Monte Cassino,*
                   when the "forty valiant pilgrims appeared in the world, a thousand years
                  after our Saviour's death";—the Boemond and Tancred of Tasso's song, and Robert of
                  Guiscard, and the great King Roger of Sicily, who conquered the fair Neapolitan
                  dominions from "Paynim dog," just by way of employing their swords, for "they were
                  on their road home from Jerusalem," says the old cloistered chronicler, "where
                  they had been to worship Jesus Christ"; and, as their vessels came up the
                  Tyrrhenian sea, and they neared the lovely coast of Salerno, they found their old
                  enemy the "Paynim dog" at his favorite work of oppressing Christians; so they
                  tarried, and unsheathed their swords, delivered their brother Christians from
                  "horrid heathen rule," and gave them, in lieu of it, their own adventuring selves
                  for masters.

                        Cassin, publiée par M. Champollion-Figeac. Paris, 1835.
               
               One of these heroes, King Roger, was an ancestor of the young Don Carlos de
                  Bourbon; and it may be, his ambitious, beautiful young mother had fed his mind, in
                  boyhood, with these stories from old historic legend,—monkish chronicle and poet's
                  song,—for surely no ordinary mental food had nourished such a youth. At eighteen
                  years of age the boy-conqueror was crowned at Palermo; ten years after, in 1744,
                  when only twenty-eight, he routed the Austrians at Velletri, and expelled them
                  from his kingdom; and, at the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748), Europe
                  acknowledged him as Charles VII.,*
                     King of the Two Sicilies.
               
                  
                  *He was Charles VII. of Naples, in order of succession, and by the Bull of
                     Investiture of Pope Clement XII.; but he is generally called Charles III. by
                     the Neapolitans, because that was his title on the Spanish throne.
               
               For twenty-five years Don Carlos reigned wisely over Naples. But the romance was
                  not ended then. 
                     
                        "Glamis, and thane of Cawdor:
                        The greatest is behind."
                     
                   When only a little over forty, he succeeded to the Spanish throne of his
                  ancestor, Charles V., by the death of his half-brother, Ferdinand VI. This
                  succession requiring that the king should reside in Spain, Don Carlos gave up the
                  Neapolitan part of his dominions to his third son, Ferdinand I.,—as he is counted
                  in the Neapolitan Bourbon house,—who was only eight years old at the time (1759). Don Carlos had commenced
                  life so early himself, I fancy he did not think the boy too young; but Nature had
                  stopped her grand work in that quarter, and the succeeding Ferdinands of Naples
                  have relapsed into the old mould of royal figure-heads.
               A succession of such kings as Charles III. would have ameliorated many of the
                  national ills; but this lovely peninsula seems to have been born in that unlucky
                  day-dawn of nations just as 
                     "Pale Hecate, star of the sorceress,"
                   was flying before the spirits of the new revelation, and her angry eye of
                  malediction fell upon this fated land; for, as we look back upon its history, we
                  see but a succession of short-lived promises of good, followed by long seasons of
                  misrule and misfortune.
               During Charles III.'s reign a new element entered political life,—the Bourgeois,
                  or Tiers État,—which then took position and
                  rank. To be sure, under the Spanish vice-regal government, the throb of this great
                  social pulse could be seen by the appearance of such men as the lawyer and
                  historian Giannone, the jurisconsult Gravina,—Metastasio's beloved patron and
                  friend,—and the professor and rhetorician Vico; but these were exceptions, and not
                  a class, as now. The effect of this new element, which has been steadily working
                  for years, is now showing itself, not only in Naples, but all over the peninsula,
                  and will cause material changes both in the governments and the people before
                  long. In the present day, however, this same Tiers
                     État is a very necessary element in all European states. As Janet
                  said to-day: "It gives the backbone to all the new governments of this old
                  continent."
               The history of Naples since the reign of "Don Carlos" is short and inglorious.
                  During the minority of the young king, the government was directed by that wise
                  minister of Charles III., Bernard Tanucci; but, though he ruled well over the
                  country, he left one duty unperformed, the proper training of his royal ward.
               When this young Ferdinand I. reached the age of seventeen,—a year younger than his
                  great father was at the period of his crowning at Palermo,—he completed his
                  minority, and the following year married an Austrian archduchess. This
                  archduchess, Maria Carolina, was the unworthy daughter of Maria Theresa, the
                  unwomanly sister of Maria Antoinette, the fit friend of the infamous Lady
                  Hamilton, and the bad queen of a weak husband.
               Ferdinand allowed her to assume the control, for she had the same desire for rule
                  which characterized her mother, but she lacked Maria Theresa's ability. Her first
                  exercise of power was the dismissing of Tanucci; and the result of her ill
                  management was not only injurious to the kingdom, but to her own interests, for,
                  when the terrific political European earthquake of 1789 burst out, Naples was in a
                  weak and unprotected state. Nature had played truant then; there was no "Don
                  Carlos," no Vanucci, to hold the government firm when the revolutionary tide swept
                  over the peninsula; and the feeble king, with his unwise queen, had to fly from
                  Naples for their lives.
               Then followed the Parthenopian republic, established by the French General
                  Championnet, which failed, for Naples is essentially a king-loving place. After
                  its down-fall, Ferdinand returned for a little while, but was soon driven out
                  again, to make room for Napoleon's brother Joseph. When Joseph was transferred to
                  Spain, Murat succeeded him; then came Napoleon's downfall, and with him his little
                  family of sovereigns.
               
               At the Treaty of Vienna, in 1816, Ferdinand recovered his throne. To him succeeded
                  his son, Francis I., who reigned only five years; then Ferdinand II. ascended the
                  throne (1830).
               There have been short-lived rebellions in the mean while, and it is said there is
                  no stability now.*
                   The Bourgeois, and even the nobility, are tired of the Bourbons; and "the
                  innovation-loving, excitable, loquacious, and unsteady Neapolitan people" are also
                  quite ready for any change. But look, 
                     
                        "What envious streaks
                        Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.
                        Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
                        Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain-tops."
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  *1858.
               
               I have been so interested in my nobile ozio as
                  to write all night, a poor preparation for to-morrow's—nay,
                  to-day's—sight-seeing.
            
            
               STONE TONGUE.
               I HAVE received great assistance lately in this examination of Neapolitan churches
                  from our new friend Mr. Luini. New friend? He does not seem new to me. It is not
                  more than two months since I first met him at the Folhams, and yet I feel as if I
                  had known him years instead of weeks. There are many reasons to be offered for the
                  close intimacy which is fast growing up between us. We are of the same faith, and
                  hold similar views about our grand old religion. Then we are travellers, not
                  residents, and acquaintances ripen into friendships on journeys much more quickly
                  than by firesides.
               Janet rallies me playfully on my enthusiasm about him once in a while, although
                  she also likes him very much; but I retort quite good-humoredly by quoting Jean
                  Paul to her.
               "There is a sacred fault noble maidens have of forming too enthusiastic
                  conceptions of their friends. Married women rarely do this, because ordinary men
                  check and discourage all feminine enthusiasm which is not for themselves, and
                  sometimes they weary of that."
               Mrs. Rochester teasingly says, "Are you not afraid of spoiling Mr. Luini?"
               And I reply, with one of my strong human faiths,— "It is the way to test him. Great natures are never
                  injured by appreciation and preference, even when frankly and openly expressed; on
                  the contrary, they are encouraged by it, and grow nobler, nor do they ever
                  misunderstand it. It is only the petty, inferior mind which puts a wrong
                  construction on such regard, and wounds us by its vanity and conceit."
               He appears to have made Naples his home, for the present, at least. He has a
                  pleasant suite of apartments in a palazzo on the Chiaja, near the Church of San
                  Pasquale, not far from our friends the Rochesters. He has a very fine library,
                  judging from the nice works he lends me: indeed I cannot mention a book of
                  reference, without receiving it from him immediately,—handsomely illustrated old
                  folios, such as St. Non and Montfaucon, together with modern works like Cicognara,
                  and all the standard histories, Guicciardini, Giannone, and the like.
               He is very intimate with that excellent man, the Saint Charles Borromeo of the
                  present day, the Archbishop of Naples, Cardinal Duke Sforza; and when any surprise
                  is felt by his acquaintances at his perfect independence of life and opinions, his
                  intimacy with this prelate seems to be the satisfying reason. I fancy, however,
                  that the intimacy has no more power than this; the Cardinal knows him to be a
                  prudent, wise, good man, and such men command independence of mind and action
                  everywhere.
               There is some mystery, I believe, about his "antecedents," as we Americans say;
                  and, although an Italian by birth, he has very little intercourse with resident
                  Neapolitans. His intimacies are mostly with foreigners, especially the English.
                  This arises, I suppose, from the fact of his mother's having been an Englishwoman.
                  She must have been a person of high culture and great loveliness liness, for he
                  has spoken of her to me with an affection amounting to veneration. She died while
                  he was quite young; for he has passed the age of early manhood, being now about
                  thirty, or may be a little older.
               There is a rumor that he was interested in the Milanese political troubles of
                  1848, and this same rumor makes the story complete by supposing him to be one of
                  the discontented noblemen, who preferred withdrawing from a rule they could not
                  endure to keeping up a disturbed condition of affairs in the present unripe state
                  of the times. Whatever may have been his past, it is shrouded in impenetrable
                  silence, which in him is not at all melodramatic. I suppose—nay, I know—that rumor
                  has some foundation for its stories about him. He has tasted of the enchanted
                  plant of our day, Liberty, and, like the Chevalier of the Saint Esprit in the old
                  legend, has dreamed of finding the lost Grayle, and bestowing on all humanity the
                  blessed draught of Love, Fraternity, and Equality.
               After his political disappointments he retired from the world for some time, and
                  found peace and consolation in meditation and books. Like Kenelm Digby,
                  Montalembert, and De Broglie, he is a thoroughly educated, devoted Catholic, but
                  unlike them, he has no desire, it may be he has no power, to express himself to
                  the world. He has by degrees passed into the rôle of an intelligent spectator, and has lost all taste for action,
                  while he has gained more capability for, and pleasure in, thought. He often quotes
                  Goethe's expression, "Thought expands, action narrows."
               His study of, and belief in, human individual liberty, have led him to prefer
                  almost the tyranny of the masses, sooner than accept the old rule of the
                  privileged. Only certain urgent circumstances, I am sure, could make a prominent political man of Luigi Luini.
                  It may be he is deficient in political instinct. But I think, under different and
                  happier circumstances, he might have been useful to his kind, and covered himself
                  with distinction, for he has the calm, self-poised, honorable nature of a wise
                  ruler.
               He began life as a politician,—that is, in the highest sense of the word,—he
                  devoted himself to the study of governing. While analyzing men and making himself
                  familiar with the general laws which rule their mobile natures, his far-seeing
                  mind displayed to him a higher, wider scope of thought and labor: it showed to him 
                     "The very pulse of the machine."
                  
               
               Gradually as his pure nature has soared aloft from one range of mighty thoughts to
                  another, he has become indifferent to the passing struggles of the day. He sees a
                  mighty moral law which is unceasingly governing Nature.
               "Beautiful, careless, ever fertile Nature!" he exclaims sometimes in our
                  conversations. "She is like a lovely Undine. She displays her exquisite resources
                  under a million of forms. She feels in herself unexhaustible powers, and therefore
                  throws off failures and successes with the same bewitching indifference; sometimes
                  it seems she loves the fascinating wrong the best. But, my friend, her vagaries
                  are all divinely corrected. There is a power which follows her as a loving mother
                  does a charming child, purifying, governing her, directing even her follies to
                  good, and in some blessed future she will possess herself and gain her soul, as
                  did the lovely creation of the German."
               But such speculations, while they enrich his mind and heart, take from him the
                  desire for action or creation. He loves to hear all great acts and doings in the
                  world, to gather from all sources the works of men in every quarter of the globe,
                  having some sublime consolatory word to offer for the fearfulest human folly; but
                  he no longer thinks of playing a part in the life-drama,—his work seems ended,—he
                  only remains, as he says, in the present existence.
               Luigi,—for this is his beautiful first name,—viewing thus all things from an
                  elevated point, is happily relieved from that curse of clever men,—ambition. There
                  is a calm, tranquil look from his blue eyes which is as limpid and smooth as the
                  surface of deep waters. His moderation is not timidity or caution, but a quiet
                  consciousness of interior strength too deeply felt to need assertion. He is
                  enthusiastic too, quite enough so to satisfy even me; but his enthusiasm has no
                  feverishness, and his fine imagination, quick taste, and keen appreciation of the
                  beautiful are tempered by that rare gift,—good sense. He is practical without
                  being narrow, and self-contained without being cold or selfish. In society he must
                  always command the love as well as respect of his associates. He startles the most
                  artificial, and even the most doubtful and desponding into human faith. He
                  possesses that powerful magnetism which enables some persons to pierce through the
                  cold surface with which society, like the globe, is enveloped; and he touches the
                  warm current which flows burning in every one's heart, though covered over as with
                  a lava crust, by the conventionalities of out-door existence.
               I have known him but a little while, to be sure; the instincts of a woman,
                  however, are as quick as they are keen in action, and stand her in lieu of reason,
                  which is slower in its judgment; thus
                  she is enabled to discern character much more speedily than man can. Besides, the
                  calm Janet, who is almost his feminine counterpart, agrees with me in my opinion
                  of him.
               During one of our first conversations he discovered my interest in the history of
                  Naples, written so marvellously in stone, as Dumas says of Florence,—"on its
                  palaces, its statues, and its tombs, and we jostle against these stone leaves at
                  every step we take in the streets and public places." Since then he has gone with
                  me to several old churches and palazzos.
               During Holy Week, at the close of Lent, he kindly gave me opportunities of not
                  only enjoying the ceremonies of our church at that solemn period, but also of
                  seeing many things which, as a stranger, I could not have seen or known. Every
                  evening of the week I went with him to the old Celestin Church of San Pietro a
                  Maiella, adjoining the Musical College, to hear the scholars of the Conservatoire
                  sing the music appropriate to the season.
               One evening they executed a most unmistakable Stabat
                     Mater of Mercadante. I say unmistakable, because Rossini's, though a
                  fine thrilling composition, is the song of a triumphant Christian describing
                  imaginary sorrows; some of its passages are almost exultant, they are so full and
                  rich; while this of Mercadante, though cold and scholarly, is solemn and religious
                  in its character. How different both are from the Stabat of Pergolesi, which is simple and tender, and yet the grief it
                  expresses is as mild and intense in some of its bursts as a woman or young child
                  might utter under the sting of deep anguish.
               Another evening they sang a Miserere of Zingarelli,
                  the Master of the Conservatoire, who preceded Saverio Mercadante. The accompanying
                  ceremonies, the darkening of the chapel, and the extinguishing of the cruciform
                  tapers, were very effective; then, added to these, was a harp accompaniment of
                  Mercadante, which sounded like what I suppose persons mean when they speak of "the
                  music of the spheres," but I should have rather listened to the Miserere without it, although I have no doubt the harp
                  accompaniment is more popular.
               At the present day persons will not inquire into the whys and wherefores of
                  certain traditions in art, and by demanding that which is superficially pleasing,
                  they are fast losing the true spirit. By this means art is ceasing to be a
                  revelation; it may produce fruit after its present nature and be a willing
                  handmaiden to us, but it is no longer an inspiration.
               But to return to Naples "sight-seeing." It is an "embarras
                     de richesses" here. One grows stunned, as it were, with the
                  fast-thronging memories that crowd the brain at every turn. Greek, Roman,
                  Barbarian, Mediæval, and modern traditions and remains jostle each other, mingling
                  dates, incidents, and names in the most bewildering manner.
               One morning in Easter Week, which is just over, I stood on the grand stone
                  platform leading into the Church of San Paolo in the Strada Tribunali, and resting
                  my hand on one of two old blackened and broken columns, I gazed up at the
                  architrave, and then down at the crowd of Christians pouring like a stream up and
                  down the spacious broad stone steps, sweeping a living tide every little while
                  against those pillars. Then there arose in my brain a "sweet pain of mental
                  wilderment" as I recalled that on this very spot where we were worshipping the
                  despised, crucified Nazarene, had stood in olden, olden times, a temple of Castor
                  and Pollux, and these shattered columns
                  and remnant of an architrave remained to tell us, in their mysterious stone
                  tongue, which thrills every fibre of our being, the tradition of that heathen
                  faith and that heathen day. Then, mingling with the crowd of visible mortals, in
                  my fancy arose a ghostly multitude, fleeting fast along, like the water-shadows
                  racing swiftly over the bushes beside a running stream, and there sounded a dim
                  distant chant which uttered, 
                     
                        "There to the Great Twin Brethren
                        Vow thou thy vows and pray,
                        That they in tempest and in fight
                        Will keep thy head alway."*
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  *"Battle of Lake Regillus. Lay sung at the Feast of Castor and

               I went afterwards into the cloister, looked at its twenty-four granite pillars,
                  and remembered that there had stood the Theatre, on the stage of which Nero had
                  played. Three hundred years my memory had swiftly stepped over in passing from the
                  platform of the great entrance of the church into the cloister. I leaned dreamily
                  against one of the columns, imagining the scene so graphically described by the
                  historian,—Nero, the poor crazy Emperor,—"mounting the stage, tuning his lute with
                  much care, and flourishing before he began his part. About him were his
                  companions; the cohort of guards was also there, with tribunes and centurions, and
                  Burrus, praising his master, but grieving for him."†

               After lingering some time in the cloister we were taken into the Sacristy to see
                  some pictures and frescoes. We found it thronged with clergymen, not priests of
                  Castor and Pollux, "clad in purple and crowned with olive," but simply dressed
                  men, whose long closely-buttoned black cassocks clung to their bodies from the
                  throat to the foot, servants of that New Faith now near two thousand years
                  old.
               On a stand was a superb church vestment of cloth of gold, embroidered and studded
                  with precious stones; little sapphires, rubies, emeralds, and diamonds flashed out
                  from the gorgeous mass of work; over one corner of it had been flung a magnificent
                  worked white linen alb, with a heavy broad fall of rich antique lace, whose
                  creamy-hued Spanish point told out well as it lay on the gold of the vestment.
               At the head of the room some of the clergy, with some gentlemen, were assembled
                  together admiring an exquisitely wrought gold chalice. Luigi was among them.
                  Seeing us he stepped forward to show us the costly and beautiful thing, worthy in
                  workmanship to have come from the skilful fingers of a Cellini. I held it in my
                  hands while they told me its history, not one word of which did I hear; for I was
                  thinking of the old worship of the proud Ides of Quintilis, and ringing in my ears
                  came the verses,— 
                     
                        "While flows the Yellow River,
                        While stands the Sacred Hill,
                        The proud Ides of Quintilis
                        Shall have honor still.
                        Gay are the Martian Kalends:
                        December's Trones are gay;
                        But the proud Ides, when the squadron rides,
                        Shall be Rome's whitest day."
                     
                   And then flitted again before me the sorrowful Imperial displays of the poor
                  degraded grandson of that proud, but pure, good Agrippina, Germanicus's wife,
                  surrounded by his Rosencrantzes and
                  Guildensterns, with poor mortified Burrus, applauding but grieving for his royal
                  master's shame,—and I wondered what new faith shall be worshipped here after the
                  tide of two thousand years to come had swept over this spot.
               Now how can one return home and sit down leisurely, and in cold blood to hunt up
                  dates and parcel out historical information from books to fit this church, or that
                  statue, this palazzo or that fountain? The labor would be wearying in the extreme;
                  moreover, I should not enjoy as I do now this delightful half-dreamy feeling which
                  steals over me while listening to the conversation of such a man as Luigi Luini.
                  In nervous, picturesque language he tells me the history of each spot or work of
                  art which attracts my notice or admiration, and much better, too, than I could
                  find it in books. Then he revives, as by a magical touch, all my own knowledge,
                  and has that happy faculty, not often possessed by clever men, of drawing out from
                  his companion, by his own suggestive remarks, the most delightful talk.
               This is a feminine gift, by the way. Men generally are monologists, they deal only
                  in large bills and notes of language. Some witty Frenchman has said that an
                  intelligent woman can always seize the thoughts of a man, and give him back
                  immediately the small change. Blessed little word-brokers it makes of us to be
                  sure, but how could society get on without such bewitching bankers?
               The streets of Naples are becoming so thickly thronged to me with old historical
                  memories that sometimes, as I lean back in the barouche and gaze up at the
                  palazzos or churches, I fancifully compare them, as the carriages sweep by, to the
                  rapidly turning leaves of a gorgeously illuminated missal, or some brilliantly
                  decorated Pugin Glossary, whose vivid colorings of old diaperings and monograms
                  flash on the eye with a painful pleasure; therefore it is a luxurious relief to
                  have such a person as Luigi Luini beside me, to hold down as it were, one of these
                  stone pages, and shade its brilliant past by the calm recital of its history, so
                  that I can look and learn, or remember without bewilderment or confusion.
            
            
               
               "CASA DELLA SIRENA."
               JUST as we were starting out on our afternoon drive to-day, Luigi entered the
                  court-yard. He helped us into the barouche, then stood for a few moments talking,
                  and resting his delicate, graceful hand on the low door of the coach; for he is
                  not large, nor is he under size, but he is slender, and has all the patrician
                  marks of form,—small hands and feet, suppleness of limb, and grace of motion.
               "Why cannot you go with us, Mr. Luini?" asked Janet, as he bid us good day,
                  wishing us a pleasant drive, for, Janet attends to all the inviting and etiquette
                  business of our little community, Venitia being too young, and I now-a-days am too
                  dreamy and forgetful.
               "Should you really like to have me?" he answered, with a bright smile, which
                  lighted up finely his handsome face.
               "I should not ask you, I am sure, if I did not," replied Janet, with a natural
                  abruptness, which is always softened by her musical laugh and cultured voice; "and
                  as for Ottilie, I know I can answer for her gratification."
               He opened the door of the coach without saying another word, and took his seat
                  beside Venitia, thus giving me a chance of enjoying the good looks of both, for he
                  is as handsome for a man as she for a woman. I repeated to myself his name as I
                  looked at him, and recalled what Poe had written of a beautiful Italian woman's
                  name,— 
                     
                        "Two words, two foreign soft dissyllables,
                        Italian tones made only to be murmured
                        By angels dreaming in the moonlit dew."
                     
                   But I thought "Luigi Luini" sounded best when pronounced by waking, loving,
                  human beings, in their sincerest, most cordial tones.
               Our carriage swept out the Strada Nuova along the fine, broad road that skirts
                  this picturesque coast, in and out its various little indentations, which shows
                  the skill that has been displayed in the making of this grand route, the broad
                  pathway of which has been gained in many places from the rocks themselves. High up
                  in air, on our right, rose gracefully the green hills of Posilippo, crowned with
                  elms and beautiful villas; and as we came around the Punta di Posilippo, the
                  setting sun shot brilliant rays on the beautiful old ruins of the Palazzo della
                  Regina Giovanni, as it is called, which lay to our left. The sparkling sea flowed
                  into its marble-paved court, and plashed restlessly up against the
                  foundations.
               "Casa della Sirena," said Luigi, "should be its name. It is not known certainly
                  that it ever belonged to either of the Queen Joannas, although both were unhappy
                  and unlucky enough."
               This led us to talking of the beautiful unfortunate granddaughter of Robert the
                  Wise, Joanna I., the tombs of whose father and grandfather in Santa Chiara I have
                  already mentioned. She was also great-great-granddaughter of that bold adventuring
                  brother of St. Louis of France, Charles of Anjou, Count of Provence, and is the
                  Mary, Queen of Scots, of Neapolitan history (1343-1345). No matter what may have
                  been the shortcomings ings of this
                  unhappy queen, one thing should be remembered of her. When her bitter enemy,
                  Charles of Durazzo, her cousin, was besieging the poor lady, she shut herself up
                  in one of the fortified palaces of her city. The people came clamoring at its
                  gates for admittance, praying for protection and food.
               "Open the gates," said the weeping, beautiful woman.
               "No, your Majesty!" replied her counsellors, "that cannot be done, for, added to
                  our having only enough food for ourselves, barely sufficient to last until aid
                  comes, if we open the gates the enemy may also force an entrance."
               "And they are to suffer and starve!" she cried. "O no, there are women and young
                  children among them; open the gates and let them enter! I cannot leave my people
                  in danger to preserve my own safety."
               The gates were opened, and while the populace rushed in, clinging with tears
                  around their beloved queen, the enemy did indeed force an entrance; the poor woman
                  was seized by her cruel kinsman and brutally murdered. But the mangled remains of
                  that once lovely form, the queenly presence of which glows down upon us from the
                  ceiling of the Church of L' Incoronata, made immortal by Giotto's pencil, found
                  rest at last in the same stone coffin where lay her dead mother beside the high
                  altar of the Church of Santa Chiara.
               After we had dwelt on her history tenderly and charitably, we talked of the second
                  Joanna, the weak, vain daughter of this cruel Charles Durazzo, almost as beautiful
                  and almost as wretched as the first one, for fate seemed to wish to avenge on her
                  the wrongs and cruelties her father had inflicted on her predecessor
                  (1414-1435).
               This occupied us while our carriage rolled around the promontory of Posilippo, and
                  we came out on a full view of Cape Miseno, Procida, and Ischia, with the pretty
                  little Nisita close in shore.
               Nisita, with its sweet, sad memories! Joanna II. had a gay villa there, in the
                  days of her prosperity; but far, far back, fourteen centuries before that, the
                  stern Brutus did there fulfil his tender promise to his Portia, on the eve of
                  their final parting before the battle of Philippi (42 B. C). 
                     
                        "And by and by thy bosom shall partake
                        The secrets of my heart,
                        All my engagements I will construe to thee,
                        All the charactery of my sad brows."
                     
                  
               
               The sun gilded every tree that lay against the western horizon, giving them a true
                  leaf-glory. Janet of course quoted Virgil.
               "See!" she cried, "'the gold sprouting forth on the shady holm-oaks, and the
                  metallic leaves tinkling with the gentle gale,' The decorations of the hero's tomb
                  are gone,—the sculptured oar and trumpet,—but, as the Mantuan poet said, 'the
                  lofty promontory, which from him is called Misenus, shall retain eternal through
                  ages the memory of the son of Eolus, whom none excelled in rousing warriors by the
                  brazen trump, and kindling the rage of war by its blast.'"
               "I wonder," said Venitia, with a shy playfulness quite new in her manners, but
                  very becoming, "whether the trumpeter, if he has lain under that lofty cape all
                  these long ages, has made the acquaintance of old Typhon,—poor, oppressed gaint,
                  with all these burning loads of the Crater Bay resting on his shaggy breast!"
               We talked of old myths awhile, then, looking over at Ischia, recalled some of its pleasant, historical
                  memories, and dwelt longest on that part of its history which relates to the three
                  beautiful women, whose names will hang forever over it as a halo,—Costanza d'
                  Avalos, the sister of the hero of Pavia Francesco d' Avalos, Marquis of Pescara;
                  Vittoria Colonna, his wife; and Mary of Aragon, his cousin.
               First, Costanza, who so valiantly defended the Castle of Ischia against the army
                  of Louis XII., preserving thus a home for Frederick of Aragon when the Partition
                  Treaty of Granada, between Louis XII. and Ferdinand the Catholic, left this poor
                  Prince of Altamura homeless (1500). Her famous brother, the hero of Pavia, was
                  born at this Castle (1489), and the government of the island remained in the
                  family nearly three hundred years after Costanza's display of valor and
                  fidelity.
               Twenty-five years after, her beautiful young sister-in-law sought a home of
                  consolation in the island. When I described the Marquis of Pescara's coffin, and
                  banner, and sword, which we saw in San Domenico Maggiore, I told then of Vittoria
                  Colonna's going to Ischia to mourn her youthful wedded lover, and how she sang,
                  like "the nightingale with its breast against a thorn," her husband's virtues and
                  valor, in verses which a famous poet said should give her so much honor that they
                  should 
                     "burst the tomb and live through every age."*
                        
                     
                   We dwelt again on the sweet story of this lovely woman, quoting Ariosto, and
                  talking of Buonarotti's pure love, and of the great sculptor's presence at her
                  death-bed, watching with reverential tenderness for her last sigh and last
                  breath.
               
                  
                  *Orlando Furioso, Canto XXXVII. St. 16.
               
               Then we had a merry laugh over the third beautiful widow whose memory is connected
                  with Ischia; the lovely Mary of Aragon, Marchese del Vasto, who followed
                  Vittoria's example when left a widow in 1548. She went to this island to grow old
                  gracefully, and succeeded so well that Brantome said, "her autumn surpassed the
                  spring of other women." It was she, who at sixty was so irresistibly attractive,
                  as to charm the heart out of a grand Prior of France, who should have been
                  thinking of other things than of delectable feminine amaranths.
               Yes, we talked of all these pleasant memories, sweeping over the first three
                  quarters of a century, which followed the termination of the Middle Ages
                  (1490-1560) and which saw the firm establishment of Spanish rule in the Land of
                  the Sirens, the age of Ariosto, and Angelo, and Raphael.
               "Casa della Sirena, House of the Sirens," exclaimed Luigi as the coach, whose
                  horses' heads were now turned homewards, came near again to the beautiful ruin
                  outside of Punta di Posilippo, and we listened to the history of this ill-fated
                  Palazzo in the Sea, which looked gray as the shades of evening gathered around it,
                  and solemn sounds of warning seemed to breathe through its ruined halls as the
                  sullen plash of the waters of the Crater Bay could be heard against the Siren
                  rocks of the foundation.
               The lofty arched windows and empty niches, the heavy projections and peculiarities
                  which it displays of that seventeenth-century architecture,—grand and splendid
                  like Genoa's magnificence, but not equal to Venitian glory and beauty,—were all
                  noticed as though we had looked on it for the first time, and might never see it
                  again. We gazed earnestly, too, at the "various desert and rocky little islands
                  which are called the Sirenusæ," on which this ill-fated palace stands.
               
               As far back as anything is known of this castle, the tradition tells of ill luck.
                  It might seem that those transformed Sirens possessed power to harm, though
                  stilled into solid rocks. Every owner of the place has had ruin to track him to
                  his doom. Outlawry, death, and disgrace have steadily followed its various masters
                  and their descendants, even more relentlessly than sorrow attacks other mortals.
                  At last, by some chance, it came into a family whose name is more frequent and
                  continuous than any other in Neapolitan history,—the Carafa.
               These Carafas were a grand old set of people; generation after generation made
                  their mark on history faithfully. Nature never forgot them, through ages of change
                  and extinction of other families. The last "Duke of Naples," who in the year 1130,
                  after a long and heroic defence, yielded to the superior strength of the Normans,
                  and delivered the last Grecian free state of Italy up to King Roger of Sicily, was
                  a Carafa,—Duke Sergius Carafa.
               Then in 1435, a Lord Malizia Carafa was sent by the poor childish Joanna II.—the
                  last queen of Naples, indeed the last of the Anjou-Durazzo family—to summon her
                  cousin Alfonso of Aragon, king of Sicily, to be her heir and protector. His
                  monument, with other fine ones of the family, is in the Carafa Chapel at San
                  Domenico Maggiore, a sculptured knight under a canopy, with a sepulchral urn, and
                  his arms folded quietly over the cross he loved and served.
               The Carafas swept grandly along through the Aragonese dynasties, both legitimate
                  and illegitimate, and also in the hard iron Spanish times, managing to be loyal
                  through all changes,—that is, faithful to the reigning power, but never failing to
                  give history in each generation a landmark.
               One of this great family was so famous, he must have more than a mere mention of
                  his name. This was the austere friend of St. Cajetan of Thiene, Gian Pietro
                  Carafa, Cardinal Archbishop of Naples, who, with his holy and dear companion,
                  founded the order of the Theatine Monks (1524), that great and noble "Seminary of
                  Bishops," formed "of men of noble birth who might have revelled in the enjoyments
                  of life, but who began to seek out the sick in their habitations and in hospitals,
                  and administer the last consolations to the dying."*
                   They lived in profound solitude and extreme poverty, never asked alms, and
                   studied closely the Gospels, then went down in the cities to preach.
               
                  
                  *Ranke's History of the Popes.
               
               Cardinal Carafa himself appeared with cap and cross and clerical habit in the
                  pulpit, and "poured forth that copious and vehement eloquence which distinguished
                  him till his death." He did not produce mere excitement and ebullitions of feeling
                  in his auditors, but a deep impression. He was "tall and thin, moved quickly,
                  appeared to be all nerve," had an iron will, "was never known to have made a
                  concession or compromise, and always acted on his opinions with the utmost
                  vehemence." Men said he led a strange and austere life, he slept by day and
                  studied by night, and, what is rare with such solemn, stern men, he was gifted
                  with a flow of words that was filled with earnestness and freshness, and which
                  poured out in a powerful stream, influencing every one who came within his reach.
                  Of course Charles V. hated him, for Cardinal Carafa was a man free from selfish
                  ambition, but full of holy zeal and ardor for the restoration of the Church to its
                  original purity; therefore he felt a contempt for the double-dealings of the
                  ambitious Emperor, and despised the
                  game of fast and loose with Protestants which Charles played so skilfully to suit
                  his kingcraft and policy. But notwithstanding this, Cardinal Carafa was elected
                  Pope in the very teeth of Charles V.'s power and disapprobation, and will be known
                  to all ages as Paul IV. When the Imperial Ambassadors warned him that their master
                  would never consent to his election, the bold prelate answered,—"If God wishes me
                  to be Pope, no emperor can hinder me from being so; but for myself his opposition
                  will be so much the better, for then I shall owe my elevation to no human
                  power."
               Stout words these for an old man of seventy-nine. Whatever may have been the
                  influence, human or divine, he was elected Pope; and the same life and death
                  struggle which the haughty Hildebrand, Gregory VII., had fought nearly five
                  centuries before with the Hohenstaufens, was renewed by this Pope with the
                  Hapsburgs.
               That grand old Pope, Paul IV., with his strong Italian nationality, religious
                  fervor and zeal, and Brutus-like severity to his unworthy kinsman, stands out in
                  bold relief, even in the sharply-chiselled history of that day, and for three
                  things shall he be remembered; as the undaunted opponent of Charles V., the dear
                  and loving friend of St. Cajetan and St. Charles Borromeo, and one of the leading,
                  indeed most active, spirits of that great Council which was intended by the wise,
                  earnest, and pious churchmen of the day to assist in the reviving of a true
                  catholic and apostolic spirit,—the Council of Trent.
               Like all great Popes who have ever been at the head of the Church, he was an
                  earnest opposer of foreign rule, whether French, Spanish, or German, and a warm
                  advocate of Italian union and nationality. He called "Italy an harmonious
                  instrument with four strings,—Rome, Venice, Milan, and Naples," and looked upon
                  Lodovico Sforza, the Duke of Milan,—"Il Moro," as he was called,—and Alfonso of
                  Aragon, as eternally lost for having destroyed the harmony of this beautiful
                  instrument by their divisions. "Infelice quelle anime di
                     Alfonsa d' Aragona e Ludovico duca di Milano che furono li primi che quastorono
                     cosi nobil instrumento d' Italia."*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *Navagero.
               
               He said of the French, what will apply to them at this day, "The French break off
                  in the middle of their work, and do not stop even where they are tightly
                  bound."
               Only a little over four years did this resolute, strong-willed old man hold the
                  Papacy, but in that time he made a stamp on history which will remain deep and
                  clear for ages. He died in 1559.
               Along through succeeding generations came this rich old Carafa blood, until in the
                  second quarter of the seventeenth century,—at that period when Vandyke, and
                  Poussin, and Domenichino were painting, and Calderon singing, and Richelieu
                  governing, and Charles I. and his beautiful Henrietta losing, a fair kingdom,
                  while Queen Christina of Sweden was receiving one to play with as a toy,—in 1630,
                  the Carafas, Princes of Stigliano, the main branch of the family, brought short up
                  in the presence of a young, golded-haired, beautiful girl, Anna Carafa, who was
                  not only a Carafa, but a granddaughter of Vespasian Gonzaga, one of the most
                  illustrions men of his day; her mother was Elena Aldobrandini, niece of Clement
                  VIII., and she was the richest heiress of all South Italy.
               She was sought in marriage by a nephew of a Pope; an Austrian Archduke; a Prince
                  of Poland; a reigning Duke of Modena; a
                  son of a Spanish viceroy; and her own handsome cousin, the brilliant, dashing
                  Diomed Carafa. But she married none of these. After much stormy wooing, in 1637,
                  the heiress beauty was at last wedded to the Duke of Medina de las Torres, and
                  became Vice-Queen of Naples.
               Whom the gods wish to ruin, they first drive mad, and so it was with this
                  beautiful young girl and her Viceroy husband. Their immense wealth and dazzling
                  position bewildered them. They made all Naples even, so accustomed to Spanish
                  display, stare at their magnificence, which was more than regal, and to this day
                  their extortion and dishonesty are remembered.
               Into the hands of this young vice-regal Duchess had come, with her other
                  possessions, the sorrowful Casa della Sirena. A Ravaschieri, too prudent to defy
                  destiny, had sold it to Donna Anna's grandfather, Prince of Stigliano, and
                  straightway commenced that "waywardness of fate which baffles all human
                  calculations." His son, the father of Donna Anna, a prosperous, brilliant man,
                  with fair sons and daughters clustering around like strengthening young branches
                  to the Carafa house-tree, was soon after snatched from him by death, and also
                  every child except this young girl Anna, felling the poor old Prince Stigliano to
                  the earth with grief, just in the very hour of his brightest prosperity; he left
                  the world and his great possessions and went into a Jesuit monastery to die. I
                  remember the other day standing by his monument, which is also in the Carafa
                  chapel at St. Domenico Maggiore. He was buried in the ground under the chapel.
               But the daring young Vice-Queen would not see ill-fortune in the beautiful ruin;
                  nor would she hear the song of the mysterious Fate, who, it was said, could be
                  seen sitting on those rocks spinning, through the long watches of the night, like
                  the fearful vision of false Sextus:— 
                     
                        "A woman fair and stately
                        But pale as are the dead.
                     
                     
                        "And as she plied her distaff,
                        In a sweet voice and low,
                        She sang of great old houses,
                        And fights fought long ago.
                        So spun she and so sang she,
                        Until the east was gray,
                        Then pointed to her bleeding breast
                        And shrieked and fled away."
                     
                  
               
               Donna Anna commanded a goodly palace to be built on the foundations of that
                  fearful place, in which she vowed she would dwell in royal splendor. She sent for
                  the great architect, Cosimo Fanzaga, and made him sketch a fine plan for her
                  daring castle. Then four hundred workmen were set to work at its stately arches;
                  and Naples was robbed of ancient statues to fill the niches, and of rare pictures
                  to adorn the walls.
               The beautiful, golden-haired young girl developed rapidly into a covetous,
                  tyrannical woman. She oppressed her subjects, and joined with her husband in every
                  scheme of selfish exaction and extravagance that could be thought of. Only seven
                  years ran their brilliant, comet-like course; then the Duke of Medina was recalled
                  to Spain in disgrace, and his vice-regal office taken from him.
               This disgrace was keenly felt by his haughty young wife. Not that she had ever
                  loved her husband, nor had their marriage been a happy one. She had loved her
                  brilliant cousin Diomed,—he who had wooed her, so like a knight of old
                  romance,—with his painted felucca sailing up and down the lovely coast, a
                  Cleopatra's barge in luxurious
                  magnificence, dedicated to her honor, whose music and songs in her praises came
                  wafting over sea and land,—the gallant young Carafa of Maddaloni, who, to win her
                  hand, out-rode, out-feasted, and out-fought the princely foreign competitors.
               But in an evil hour she had listened to the voice of ambition rather than love.
                  Probably there was some pique, some lover's quarrel, which, instead of ending in a
                  wild, keen joy of reconciliation, had snapt off suddenly in eternal silence.
                  Whatever may have been the cause, she, instead of being the happy, loving wife of
                  Diomed, and probably a better woman, had become a Vice-queen, and sought bitter
                  remedies for the stinging pain of her heart, in the fierce, dangerous game of
                  selfish ambition. But how could it be otherwise? 
                     "So spun she and so sang she,"
                   that Siren fate, who sat invisible to mortal eyes by the rocky foundations of
                  the Palace in the Sea.
               Thus when her husband's sudden downfall and ruin came, she had nothing,—not even
                  poor despised love to sustain her. A few months after the Viceroy was recalled,
                  and while he was standing his trial at Madrid, the lovely Anna Carafa, whose
                  beauty poets had sung, and dukes and princes had wooed, and in whose veins flowed
                  the richest Italian and Spanish blood, was lying in a villa at Portici, dying,
                  almost alone! For if the unprosperous, even when good, are apt to be deserted, how
                  can the wicked, when sorrow comes to them, expect to reap that which they never
                  sowed,—grateful, devoted friendship?
               On the Christmas-eve of that year, 1645, at midnight, Donna Anna Carafa, Duchess
                  of Medina de las Torres, Ex-Vice-Queen of Naples, was buried privately, and
                  without honor, in the church of the barefooted Augustinian monks, at Resina, at
                  the foot of Mount Vesuvius.
               "And the Casa della Sirena?" asked Venitia of Luigi, who was telling us this sad
                  story, whose tragic fatality, aided by the melody of his rich voice, touched us
                  deeply.
               "It remained unfinished of course," he replied. "The earthquake of 1688 made a
                  complete ruin of it. It stood a long while unappropriated. At last, as years went
                  by, the Mirelli, Princess of Teora, bought it, tempted by its small price. The
                  same ill-fortune attended them that has visited every owner of this 'House of the
                  Sirens,'—rapid prosperity and sudden ruin. Then it remained unclaimed for a time,
                  and was afterwards used as a glass-manufactory,—a fitting use surely to put it
                  to,—the fabrication of that frail, glittering substance which has been compared to
                  successful ambition. Now the report is that the ruin belongs to the king."
               "Alas!" I said sadly, "he, poor man, does not need the possession of any tangible
                  Casa della Sirena to bring him ill luck, for he is a Bourbon, and his family have
                  been playthings of Fate for ages."
               Luigi returned home with us, and drank of our "Hyson" on the terrace; then we
                  spent a charming evening of music and talk. After he left, I threw some fresh
                  pastilles into a little bronze pastille-brazier of beautiful antique form, and sat
                  inhaling the delicious vapor, playing idly with the graceful little folds of smoke
                  drapery, as they rose up and floated off into the air.
               "Now," said Venitia, "I shall place candles in those alabaster vases; have all the
                  other lights put out, and, while you continue burning pastilles, I will play."
               I have never seen the girl look so lovely as she has the past week or so; and
                  to-night, as she said this, I noticed
                  again the indescribable charm which is beginning to breathe softly through and
                  over her beauty, as the faint, subtile odor of some rare flower creeps out of the
                  half-opening bud.
               She did not observe my look, but with a preoccupied, unconscious air, which is
                  peculiar to her and Janet, and which is uncommon in a young girl, she lighted the
                  vases, put some flowers on the piano, near the key-board, then drew two little
                  easels forward, under the vases, so that the pictures on them might be seen in the
                  picturesque pearly brightness which streamed down from the illuminated
                  alabaster.
               These two pictures are fine copies Janet has lately purchased of Di Napoli; they
                  are of two Correggios, the originals of which are in the Musée Bourbonique; one
                  the famous small "Marriage of St. Catharine," in which, as Schlegel says, "smiling
                  grace is exalted and refined into almost unsullied beauty"; the other that
                  bewitching "Zingarella," the sleeping "Madonna del Coniglio," or Madonna of the
                  Rabbit, called so because of the cunning little rabbit which peeps its head out of
                  the bushes with droll inquiry at the sleeping Mother and Child, and points up his
                  long ears, as if it indeed heard the low songs of the little angels who are
                  floating over head, bearing rushes to make a shelter for the Divine Mother and
                  Son. It is the loveliest of his pictures, to my fancy.
               The expression of fatigue in this picture is not at all repulsive, as physical
                  suffering of any kind is apt to be; and yet the poor Virgin is so very tired that
                  it can be seen in every part of her form. She has thrown herself down beside not
                  on a bank: every muscle relaxed, every limb drooping; she presses her child close
                  to her from instinct, for her sleep is very, very leaden; and the poor baby, like
                  its mother, is so weary, too, that it sleeps despite its uncomfortable position;
                  one of her hands has fallen down from the little feet which it had wished to
                  support, and the arm is held in position by a tight fold of drapery, which is
                  bound around it, while the other hand is clasped in clinging fondness by the
                  child.
               Love, divine love, of the purest, tenderest nature, is the exquisite motivo of this melodious picture. It shows itself in
                  all the details, which are as so many modulations and workings of the theme. The
                  expression of the faces—breathless exhaustion, beautified and mellowed by the deep
                  happiness which both mother and child feel in sleeping close, close to each
                  other—is almost voluptuous.
               There is a sort of sensible sonorousness in the works of such painters as Titian,
                  and all rich, warm colorists; the effect is like that of fine, satisfactory
                  passages of orchestration; but Correggio and Raphael are like delightful
                  executants on a single instrument,—fine solo players.
               "There," said Venitia, leaning back, with a sweet air of languor and content,
                  looking around the room, and drawing a long, full, happy sigh. "Now for the
                  music,—for Chopin. I was thinking this evening, Ottilie, that Chopin should be
                  listened to by shaded lights, in air filled with fragrant incense, flowers, and a
                  few Correggios and Raphaels, with two or three darlings like you and Janet for the
                  audience."
               I wished to exclaim, "Venitia growing sentimental!" but I would not, for I should
                  give a great deal to see the sweet birth of what she calls, mockingly, sensiblerie—but which I call true feeling—in her
                  heart.
               Her fingers rambled over the piano-keys, letting drop sweet chords, but nothing connected, not the shadow
                  of a modulation; at last the combinations of sounds took form and shape, although
                  she still played dreamily. It was that Prelude in E flat of Chopin, in which 
                     
                        "Thought and memory ring, like a funeral peal,
                        Weary changes on one dirge-like note."
                     
                   After she had finished it, she said, as if thinking aloud,—
               "What a gift Chopin had of phrasing in music whole volumes of unexpected joys, and
                  dim, mystical senses of loving; not love,—not tangible, practical, housekeeping
                  love, such as you and Janet believe in, and which is good enough, I have no doubt,
                  for those who like it,—but it is a vague, poetical expression of this 'joy of
                  life,' as you call it, Ottilie. And he seemed to know, too, that for him his
                  Psyche could never take form or shape; for just as his previsions approach
                  positive resolutions in the music, what a flood of misgivings pour out in the
                  fast-succeeding chords!"
               She played again for a little while, and I leaned back on the sofa, with
                  half-closed eyes, listening to the music. Janet was walking up and down the room,
                  half hearing, half thinking. Venitia suddenly stopped, and leaning forward, looked
                  earnestly at the "Zingarella."
               "Venitia, Stendhal says,"—I commenced.
               "Bah! The scoffing wretch!" interrupted Venitia.
               "'Strike, but hear me,' as Themistocles said," I replied.
               "That's right, Ottilie," said Janet, laughing, "never give up your quotation."
               "Et tu, Brute?" I answered with playful
                  reproach; but, true to the persistency of my nature, in little things at least, I
                  repeated the same words, and at my obstinate reiteration of "Stendhal says," both
                  women burst into a contagious fit of laughter, in which of course I joined; but,
                  never daunted, I carried my point.
               "Stendhal says, 'Is there anything true in this life, but the tender pleasure we
                  feel while listening to Mozart and looking at the creations of Correggio?'"
               "That is so like him," responded Venitia; "he could not enjoy with hope and faith,
                  but must wither everything with his doubt and unbelief."
               "I like his appreciation of Mozart," remarked Janet. "Mozart is one of those
                  'sweet men,' as old Chaucer says, 'who giveth absolution to his grieving
                  listeners.' His glorious draught of joy is of a 
                     
                        'vintage, that hath been
                        Cool'd a long age in the deep-delved earth,
                        Tasting of Flora and the country-green,
                        Dance, and Provencal song, and sunburnt mirth!
                        a beaker full of the warm South,
                        Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene,
                        With beaded bubbles winking at the brim
                        And purple-stained mouth.'
                     
                   His happiness is sparkling and clear as the note of Shelley's Skylark, and
                  seems as 'free from sad satiety.' His love, too, if it was what you, Venitia,
                  saucily call practical, housekeeping love, is beautiful; much more charming to my
                  ears, certainly more healthy, than poor Chopin's sad misgivings, and wayward,
                  doubting tenderness."
               "But Figaro was gay, Janet," I remarked, with a malicious laugh.
               "Yes, and so was Mozart, I admit; but happy would it be if the women who possess
                  the real love of such men as Mozart could do as Constance Weber, his wife,—shut
                  their eyes to the shortcomings, and receive in return for their generous faith
                  adoring love; for to her he was, no matter what were his errors, true as the
                  needle to the Pole—"
               
               "North Pole, Janet," I interrupted, teasingly; "rather a cold atmosphere, but I
                  fear the true one of many loving women."
               "Heaven forbid," said Venitia, in a low voice, and with a shudder, "that I should
                  ever be the North Pole to any man's heart."
               "Or like Fancy," continued Janet, pleased with her comparison, and not hearing
                  Venitia's half-whispered remark, "which 
                     
                        'like the finger of a clock,
                        Runs the great circuit and is still at home.'"
                     
                  
               
               I shook my head with laughing doubt, and Venitia commenced playing the "Voi che sapete," Cherubino's delicious air in Figaro,
                  of which Scudo says: "The world may grow old, a great many miracles may be
                  performed, the very surface of the earth may be changed, but the sentiment which
                  Mozart has expressed in this divine passage is eternal, and can never be said in
                  any other way."
               I left her playing, and came to my room, thinking I could sleep, as I felt a
                  little weary; but as usual I have written until not only the whole Palazzo, but
                  even the great city, are stilled in slumber, indeed are almost ready to burst out
                  into the daily Babel of sounds.
            
            
               PHILIP.
               PHILIP has come. No need of telling any one who Philip is. Every journal I have
                  kept since my girlhood has Philip in it, in some form or shape, with his mother,
                  his father, his wife, or himself.
               His father was my sworn defender and friend from childhood. There was a chivalric
                  tone in Mr. Edelhertz's regard for me, which was like that love which an
                  enthusiastic, highly cultivated man feels for a daughter, born to him in his young
                  manhood, and who, as she grows up, is more friend and companion than child to him.
                  It is a feeling totally different from that which he could have for any other
                  woman, and is one of the sweetest, tenderest emotions of which a man's heart is
                  capable. Yes, of all masculine loves, this one is to be preferred by a woman, the
                  tender, protecting regard of a father near enough to mid-age to have enthusiasm
                  and appreciation, and old enough to have grown generous and indulgent, and to
                  command obedience and reverence.
               Thus Gaspard Edelhertz, Philip's father, loved me, and I gave back to him the
                  trusting, adoring love of a daughter in full measure. Ah, if he had lived, I
                  should not be what I am! But let that pass, and 
                     
                        "Upon the heat and flame of my distemper
                        Sprinkle cool patience."
                     
                  
               
               
               Mr. Edelhertz was a German of high birth and culture. He had come to America in
                  his youth in the diplomatic service of his government, had married an American,
                  and settled in the States. He had only one son, the possession of whom had cost
                  him his wife; and poor Philip bid fair to be not only a costly but grievous
                  possession to his father.
               Brilliant, gifted, erratic, he was exposed to numberless temptations, and just on
                  the outer lintel of manhood he returned home from Europe, where he had been sent
                  for his education, almost a disgraced boy. I say almost, for I never knew the
                  details of his errors, as I was too near a friend of the family. It is the
                  curious, prying outsider, the malicious or inquisitive acquaintance, who knows
                  "everything" in a disgraceful family trouble,—knows more, indeed, than ever
                  happened. I needed no further information than that which I saw, the silent sorrow
                  of my honored friend, Mr. Edelhertz, his proud anguish that but for me would have
                  been solitary.
               Philip came amongst us haughty, handsome, and with a recklessness that amounted
                  almost to insolence; had his father been a reproachful, wordy, fretful man, he
                  would have gone to ruin. I was only a few years his senior, but having been early
                  settled in life, and moreover a woman, I seemed much older than he. I fancied I
                  discovered under this recklessness resentment at injustice, and in this pride
                  promise of future reparation.
               Society, that capricious, fitful goddess, who is quite ready to cry "Fie!" at
                  vices which, at another moment or under other other circumstances, she will adore,
                  had prepared herself to let down the grate against Philip, and he was just as
                  willing to throw the scabbard aside, and wage perpetual war for life on this power
                  which he has now made his slave.
               All the Scandinavian in his blood seemed to surge up, an indomitable pride of
                  will, an appetite for struggle and contest, a craving for danger, a species of
                  inner exaltation which I think would have almost gloried in destruction. Revolt
                  and battle appeared to be his ruling tastes. His father was a man for whom nature,
                  education, and society had done everything towards producing in him the true
                  gentleman; he never noticed this mental and spiritual fever; he avoided all causes
                  and chances of collision with his son; never watched him, nor uttered a syllable
                  of warning or remonstrance, never showed that he even noticed his savage
                  predispositions. With admirable philosophy and prudence he must have resolved to
                  allow time and nature to cure this disorder, feeling sure that no mortal means
                  could be applied.
               Philip's little ocean of passion washed up with fierce will on the shores of his
                  petty social continent, and finding no obstacles, lashed out all its impotent fury
                  on the dry sands of his egotism and selfishness; but at last the good in him grew
                  weary with this useless and unopposed violence, and Love, that grand and potent
                  power, also aided him.
               My cousin Ellen came to live with us after the death of her grandparents. She was,
                  of course, the exact opposite of that which many supposed would please Philip, and
                  yet she had in her the very qualities to suit him. She was beautiful, graceful,
                  intelligent, and had the culture and breeding of a gentlewoman. "She was still as
                  a mountain," he would say of her, drolly, "and gentle as a lamb." At any rate she
                  quelled the lion in him and held him as another Una.
               When Philip first returned home, I luckily was in possession of sufficient
                  position to influence the society in
                  which we mingled. I received Philip with as much earnest friendship and attention
                  as if he had come to us covered with honor instead of disgrace. I ignored his
                  affairs; treated him with the confidence and respect of a valued friend; and I did
                  more, I smoothed the road to his love, and helped to make Ellen his wife.
               Only once has Philip Edelhertz spoken to me of his youthful trouble. It was a year
                  or so after his return, when our little world and his then happy father seemed to
                  have forgotten the past, so brilliantly was the future opening to the gifted young
                  man. With the enthusiastic exaggeration of a warm-hearted youth, he was thanking
                  me for my friendship, and overrating, with that imprudent but natural generosity
                  in such dispositions, its worldly value and effect.
               Alas! how often in life are such costly acknowledgments made to the selfish, who
                  take advantage of them cruelly, and wring and pierce the heart that would have
                  adored them, with instruments forged out of the very abnegation and self-sacrifice
                  of this generous nature, to which they should have bowed down in reverence!
               "O Ottilie!" he cried, "but for you I should have gone to ruin. You knew all, and
                  yet—"
               "I knew nothing, Philip, and never wish to know. Nor should you ever speak of this
                  past in confidence to me or any one. Whatever your errors may have been, my
                  friend, they rest between your conscience, your father, and your God."
               "Three very disagreeable individuals to face, Ottilie, under certain
                  circumstances," he answered, in his own peculiar frolicsome way, which meant no
                  irreverence. "But you are right," he continued earnestly, "and I thank you now,
                  not only for your frank, confiding friendship, but for your wise counsel. If
                  anything can make me forget the past and believe in a future, it will be your
                  kindness and regard."
               "Errors repented of, Philip, have no past, only a future of atonement and
                  amendment."
               "And mine shall have a future, Ottilie, a future that neither you nor I shall be
                  ashamed of, so help me God, my dear, dear friend," he added solemnly.
               He has kept his word, with God's help. His errors have had a golden future, for
                  Fortune is now as prodigal of fame and good gifts, so far as worldly success is
                  concerned, as she seemed disposed on the other hand to be churlish and frowning in
                  his youth. But, if Fortune is gracious, Fate resents it, and poor Philip has had
                  two great sorrows, which have made him hold lightly his more material
                  blessings.
               Formerly his happy artistic nature enabled him to slide easily over the ordinary
                  trials of existence; but when we parted, three years ago, it was with him, as "if
                  life were worn threadbare, and he had got to the end of things, as if indeed he
                  had worked his way through the upper coats of existence down to what Bossuet calls
                  the 'inexorable ennui which forms the basis of human life.'"
               First, Mr. Edelhertz was taken from us; then, shortly after, Philip's young,
                  beautiful wife, Ellen. Poor Philip! How bitter sorrow made him! Such visitations
                  are apt to bear thorny fruit, when grafted on the enthusiastic and deep-loving
                  human soul. The calm nature, that never loves unwisely, or suffers immoderately,
                  bows to the very first blow of sorrow, with a meek patience that is called
                  beautiful; but the quick throbbing heart and active brain bound fiercely and
                  resentfully against such trials as lost love and death. It is wrong, I know, but
                  it is nature, the wickedness of which
                  we all admit, and this rebellious nature can only be subdued and stilled by God's
                  loving patience, not man's futile, irritating reasoning. 
                     
                        "Poor heart!—what bitter words we speak,
                        When God speaks of resigning."
                     
                  
               
               Resentful and wretched as Philip's grief had made him, it did not separate him
                  from me; on the contrary, we seemed to be closer and nearer than ever before, for
                  sorrow, too, had laid its heavy, dull hand on me, and we stood unveiled by those
                  two events which show us poor human creatures, not only to ourselves, but to each
                  other,—Love and Death. They are the apples of our tree of knowledge, of good and
                  evil,—the supremest joy and the supremest suffering; they tear away all false
                  coverings and leave us naked.
               Of this sweet and bitter fruit we had eaten, both after our kind; and after the
                  awakening we had met on the outside of our lost Edens, and sitting down sternly in
                  our desert, gazed with stony looks at each other, and said, "Friend, can we ever
                  again make anything out of this life?"
               There was nothing of what is called resignation in our stunning, blinding grief;
                  nothing of that deadening condition in which one loses all memory of past good and
                  evil, all apprehension of future suffering, and is in a state of almost
                  nothingness and moral death. No, there was passion, and morose melancholy, and
                  bitter despair in our anguish; but notwithstanding our hearts were convulsed with
                  such sad feelings, courage breathed in the despair, and love in the
                  melancholy,—courage, which in time would help us to battle bravely to the end, and
                  love, which warmed our hearts to each other, and thus kept alive that divine spark
                  of true life, human tenderness.
               First, Philip's destiny lifted him up from his cold, bleak wayside, and he
                  journeyed far, far off from me. I remember how longingly I looked after him as he
                  faded from my sight, and I sat there outside my Eden too feeble and powerless to
                  move on. Life was a distracting burden to me; all my individual existence seemed
                  suspended, or crushed out by the force and weight of my surroundings. The social
                  atmosphere I breathed was suffocating and stifling. I struggled for mental breath,
                  then fell lifeless, and should have sunk into moral inanity had I not been
                  emancipated. And yet, so weakened had I grown from the effect of the influences
                  surrounding me, that the very emancipation was a pain. I said, hopelessly, "My
                  grief can never rise, take up its bed and walk." But it did, and now we two meet
                  again after these three long years in the most unlooked for way and place. He has
                  been travelling in the East, in Egypt and Syria. 
                     
                        "In the wilds
                        Of fiery climes, he made himself a home,
                        And his soul drank their sunbeams."
                     
                  
               
               Philip is a poet, not only a skilful and graceful verse-maker, but a true singer,
                  and the world acknowledges him as such. He is a perfect master of this curious
                  modern instrument of word-music. His style is throbbing; its passionate beats fall
                  on one's heart like the hammer on the anvil, each stroke driving out the brilliant
                  spark of keen enjoyment and appreciation.
               As Listz says of Heine, Philip's poetry tells us of enchanted atmospheres and
                  celestial marvels, inaccessible and unknown to those mortals who have not for a
                  godmother that marvellous fairy who during life counterbalances bad fortunes by
                  being prodigal of her treasures.
               He grasps the fullest and most difficult chords of emotion tion; makes the most curious and weird application
                  of words; weaving sound and thought together in such a mysterious combination, as
                  to play upon the hearts and ears of his listeners or readers as cunningly and
                  cleverly as he does upon his word-instrument.
               His poetry is essentially modern, the passionate lyric beat; the half acknowledged
                  mysticism; superb and glowing images, keen in their effect as the taste and odor
                  of a tropical fruit or flower,—dazzling lights on this word-coloring, whose
                  brilliancy is at white-heat from very intensity, like Dante's 
                     "Bianca aspetto di cielo,"
                   —all characteristic peculiarities of modern poetry, which arise from the
                  restless emotional nature of the times. It is as many-hued as the dying dolphin's
                  back, and is filled with vague sounds 
                     
                        "of that mysterious sea
                        Which brought us hither,"
                     
                   giving it an inexplicable charm. It is like some of those weird, musical
                  poems in the tone language, whose mystic modulations suggest to the listener
                  glorious aspirations or happy hopes, while it may be that the creator of them saw
                  in their waving, changing hieroglyphics a meaning totally different. Chopin's sad
                  Preludes, for example, written during his Promethean sufferings in Majorca,
                  chained fast to the rock of solitude, with the fierce vulture of his exacting
                  nature, not only eating out his own heart, but wounding mortally with its sharp
                  beak the love as necessary to his existence as breath. These Preludes were
                  soul-cries of anguish and rebellion as he uttered them; to my ears they sweep over
                  a higher range of thought. They are sublime poems filled with previsions sions and
                  promises of hope and faith, which sing out as clearly as a seraph's note in the
                  turmoil of all the despair.
               And yet these masters of this wondrous gift, inspired utterers of all these deep
                  suggestive thoughts of beauty, are sometimes unconscious of the power their
                  productions possess. They sing, as the Sibyl of old, words not their own; while to
                  us, mute worshippers before the tripod, hearing and understanding are given.
                  Philip is most provokingly unconscious, not only of the curious suggestions his
                  poems convey to me and others, but in music also, although he is a clever vocal
                     executant, and possesses that quick, exact
                  taste which is near akin to genius, he seems to have only the comprehension of a
                  half-developed nature.
               He will write a poem that thrills the hearts of multitudes, and when he reads some
                  fine criticism on it, which tells of this hidden spark of deep thought that lies
                  under the gray haze of outward meaning, he laughs and quotes teazingly to me, 
                     
                        "Shakespeare's critics bring to view
                        More than Shakespeare ever knew."
                     
                   It is the only point on which our minds and sympathies do not touch, and it
                  would grieve me, but for some reasons. I can see that it is wisely ordered so. We
                  cannot all be singers. Then, moreover, it may be that the men and women to whom is
                  given this great power of presenting to us the incarnation of the Ideal of
                  Beauty,—"this pure note of celestial reason and the fiery energy of the simple
                  spirit,"—must have this free, unconscious nature, into which "the prophetic god of
                  Delos can breathe an enlarged mind and spirit, and disclose the future" with
                  greater ease.
               It is a divine mystery, and like all such spiritual mysteries teries, beautiful. Therefore, though Philip and I
                  often have playful arguments, he teasing me for my enthusiastic fancies and
                  imaginings, and I reproaching him for the unworthiness of such an unconscious
                  nature, still I do not take it really to heart, but find comfort in the balance
                  made by the division of gifts. Mereover, we should remember that the instrument
                  cannot hear its own divine effects, nor can the executant judge of the power and beauty of his work, being all too
                  near.
               Philip is looking very well now. His health, which was so shattered by his fierce
                  troubles, has become invigorated by travel and change of scene. He has a strong
                  physique; and I was thinking to-day, as I contrasted him with Luigi, while the two
                  were sitting together smoking on our terrace, after they had dined with us, that
                  if I were a stranger, I should take Luigi for the great poet sooner than Philip,
                  Luigi being more spiritual-looking.
               In Philip there is a pretty fair balance between soul and body, indeed just now
                  his fine robust body seems to have the preponderance. He has broad, rather high
                  shoulders, is a tall, large man, has a fine, massive head, square, full brow, and
                  the outline of the nose is sharp and firm. The expression of the upper part of his
                  face is stern and reflective, but this look is softened by the full mouth and rich
                  curve of the chin and cheek, and fine lines flowing off into the well-set neck and
                  throat. His lips have almost a voluptuous beauty, not at all sensual, but full of
                  deep passionate feeling, which, added to the rich color on the cheeks, gives a
                  tenderness to the face.
               His manners are also as opposite to those of Luigi as his personal appearance,
                  being abrupt, and at times un-sympathizing. There is more self-consciousness about
                  him than self-possession; not at all conceited, for he is too proud a man for
                  that; but he has the air of a successful word-wrestler, who has tried well the
                  sinews of language, and felt, tasted, and gloried in his power over his brother
                  men.
               But he can be tender and almost womanly at times, especially to me, for he knows I
                  value these rare revelations of his feelings too highly to desecrate them by
                  alluding to them afterwards. I believe he loves to indulge himself in thinking
                  aloud to me. This evening, after tea, the moon shone brilliantly; a little lull
                  fell over us all, for we had been talking in a perfect gale of pleasant social
                  excitement. Philip leaned over to me and said,—"Cousin Ottilie, throw a shawl over
                  your shoulders, and come stroll with me on the terrace of the Villa Reale."
               I went with him, and we stood on the beautiful terrace which juts out into the
                  sea, watching the vapor and spark on the summit of Vesuvius, and noticing the
                  golden glitter of the moonlight on the waves, as they shivered into watery atoms
                  against the shining shells and pebbles on the beach, and the fishing boats rocking
                  softly to and fro on the waters, while the blazing torches in their sterns
                  streamed out a fiery splendor over the sea. We were entirely alone, for almost
                  every one had left even the Villa walks. Philip remained silent for a while,
                  sitting on one of the benches, leaning his arm on the iron railing of the terrace,
                  his large white hand buried in his thick light brown hair.
               "My God! it is beautiful, Ottilie!" he exclaimed, at last; then after a few
                  moments he continued, in his rapid, earnest manner, "What a fierce thrill of
                  appreciation a great thing of beauty creates in us! Have you ever analyzed it?
                  Have you never noticed that hot tears
                  spring to the eyes, and the heart throbs petulantly and impatiently? I am not now
                  speaking of the mere gratification which some lovely things bestow, like a rich
                  odor, or the sight of remarkable physical beauty, but that deeper feeling you
                  talked of this evening, when, as you said, 
                     
                        "one's nature is cloven
                        To its depths within depths by the stroke of Beethoven,"
                     
                   when the bliss is agony, and the rapture keen pain. Yes, Ottilie, you know
                  this feeling well. Indeed, to-day, in the Musée Bourbonique, when we were looking
                  at the divine Psyche torso of Praxiteles together, you must have felt thus, for
                  you turned to me, with a crimson spot on each cheek, and your eyes swimming in
                  tears, saying, 'Come, my friend, let us go. I have seen enough to-day; my heart is
                  full.'
               "I have often tried to discover the secret springs of this feeling, and in failing
                  to find them, I have analyzed its varying emotions, hoping to see what is its real
                  nature. I used to think it was envy,—but—and I dare be conceited to you—I have a
                  feeling strongly akin to it, whenever I write anything over which the enthusiasm
                  attendant on creation flings the halo of illusive beauty, satisfying my craving
                  ideal, but only for a brief instant. It is as if a door had opened, disclosing to
                  me a view of the most ravishing things, and then suddenly closed again; or, like a
                  flash of lightning, that in a dark midnight shows glorious outlines of beautiful
                  forms in the sky and earth, then night's solemn inky pall obliterates them in an
                  instant."
               "A shivering delight,—'Divine despair,'" I said, not in answer, but half thinking
                  aloud. Philip's quick responsive memory replied on the instant to my thoughts,
                     
                        "'Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,
                        Tears from the depths of some divine despair.'
                     
                   That delicious poem!"
               And as we paced up and down the solitary terrace, he repeated in his clarion-like
                  voice the whole of that etherial lyric of Tennyson, which, I know not why, had
                  suddenly presented itself to my memory. I suppose because the feelings he had
                  described, and which are as the soul's longing for the lost home, reminded me of
                  the sorrow for "the loved and gone," which always comes to me in the presence of
                  the beautiful. 
                     
                        "Deep as first love, and wild with all regret;
                        O Death in Life, the days that are no more."
                     
                  
               
               Then he "discoursed me," in his most eloquent style, for Philip is an inspired
                  rhapsodist under some influences; and what could there be more potent than the
                  divine Nature by which we were surrounded, and the presence of a friend he loved
                  tenderly, who understood him as a second self, and who is moreover connected with
                  all that his memory holds dear!
               It is very strange that we can never remember anything but the shadow of the
                  beautiful; and so it is with Philip's brilliant talks, they leave only a faint
                  representation of their superb outlines on my memory, and my meager sketches of
                  them are simply suggestive to me of the glorious reality. I wish I could recall
                  the sparkling words he uttered, when he broke out with something like this:—
               "Life is but the reflection of a remembrance, Ottilie." His light hair was thrown
                  off his high, fair temples, and his keen gray eyes shone resplendent. "There is
                  nothing real in it," he continued, his voice growing deeper than its usual
                  key-note,—which is high,—from intense
                  feeling. "There is nothing real in it, my dear, dear friend, but faith in God,
                  which purifies and strengthens it, and the pursuit and accomplishment of some
                  mental triumph. The only thing, too, a man really owns in this existence is a
                  creation of that which is immortal in him,—his mind. The sovereign, the rich man,
                  lose forever their possessions when they die, even though it be a great king who
                  may have carved out his kingdom with his sword, or a rich man who may have earned
                  with his own head and hands his vast possessions; death takes these forever from
                  them; and could they return, after the lapse of centuries, to claim their rights,
                  they would find them in the hands of others who had also earned them. But the
                  poet, painter, or sculptor, on whom this rich man or sovereign may have bestowed
                  his haughty patronage, own their creations forever; Dante's Divina Commedia,
                  Michael Angelo's 'suspended Pantheon in air,' his fresco world of giants on the
                  Sistine ceiling, and Raphael's Madonnas, remain intact,—they can never pass away
                  from their creators."
               Then we talked of Philip's last poem, which came out a few months ago, and has
                  added another circlet to the diadem of his fame. It was written in Egypt, and is
                  marked by all the peculiarities of his style and genius. It has "deep poetic
                  intention and noble harmonious conception"; that which we call accent in music is
                  in it, the pulse, the life-throb, which is one of his strong characteristics,
                  combined with profound thought; satisfying thus the two demands of the
                  world-audience on Art,—pleasure for the eye and ear, and what Poussin calls
                  "delectation" for the mind.
               He had been under the influence of his great grief during its creation, and this
                  had given it the rich soul-hues hues and profound shadows, and also "that
                  mysterious harmony between the personality of the poet and his creation," which
                  is, after all, the great secret of artistic success, the magnet which attracts the
                  hearts of our fellow-beings, the true divining-rod which sounds to the depths of
                  human hearts grown cold, unhappily, in 
                     "The dreary intercourse of daily life,"
                   and shows the hidden treasure of human tenderness, on which Custom indeed
                  lies 
                     
                        "with a weight
                        Heavy as frost, and deep almost as life."
                     
                  
               
               While talking of the state of mind and feeling he had been in during its
                  composition, he said: "Sorrow may surely be compared to opium, Ottilie,—that
                  delicate black droplet: dusky amber, with the dumb flash of the spirit-gold in it,
                  such as one hears in what you call 'a mute chord' in some wildering music. Yes,
                  this opium of grief, like the mysterious Oriental drug, increases the activity of
                  the mind in such a way as to enable us to construct out of palpitating feelings
                  and emotions curious and delightful intellectual pleasures."
               We walked up and down the terrace, talking, quite forgetting that the Villa was
                  locked at nine o'clock. When we turned to leave the grounds we found it was eleven
                  o'clock. The gates were fastened we felt certain, and we might be exposed to
                  disagreeable trouble by asking any of the sentries to open them for us. To be
                  sure, Mr. Rochester lived in the palazzo directly opposite the corner entrance;
                  and by sending for him as the American Ambassador, we could be relieved instantly
                  from all annoyance. But there was an awkwardness in this which I did not like.
               
               We had no business to be there at that hour; it had arisen from our
                  thoughtlessness, our habit of personal independence of action as well as thought,
                  which had been encouraged in us almost as a virtue,—certainly as a charm in our
                  childhood,—but which has plunged both of us into many sad scrapes since we have
                  grown up; and we have learned, that when we do thus innocently and unconsciously
                  outrage the world's dicta and laws, which are
                  wise and should be observed for many reasons, the best plan is to extricate
                  ourselves from the penalties and dilemmas as quietly and with as little help from
                  others as possible.
               "Can you clamber down a wall, Ottilie?"
               "We shall have to try it, at all events, Philip."
               "Suppose a sharp sentinel shoots at us? But I remember, you, like most nervous
                  persons, are as brave as Julius Cæsar,—especially under the spur of excitement.
                  You will neither halloo nor faint, if he does; so come, let us make the
                  attempt."
               If I was as brave as Philip gave me credit for being, I was feeling a most
                  cowardly repentance for having allowed myself to be placed in such a position. As
                  we walked to the parapet wall, near the terrace, I was actually shivering and
                  trembling with fear,—not at being shot at,—I would willingly have faced a battery
                  of shots,—but I was dreading the appearance that the whole affair would present,
                  in case some sentinel, seeing us, should take it into his dull head to defend the
                  fancy ducks and other public park property of his sovereign. Suppose Philip should
                  be killed, or I maimed!
               As this absurd proposition loomed down in all its gigantic proportions upon me, I
                  said to myself, "If they would only pitch us into the sea after they had shot us,
                  I should not care so much; for all idle talk and gossip would be silenced in the
                  presence of perfect ignorance of our fate."
               But no such tragic and terrific event happened. While Philip was clambering down
                  the wall, a fisherman in his boat passed near the beach. We called to him, and
                  explained our difficulty. The man went in search of a ladder, and soon returned,
                  giving me a chance of descending the wall safely and easily.
               We had a merry walk up the beach to the Mergellina, and quite an adventure to
                  relate on our return, magnifying it of course, and dwelling on the imaginary
                  danger of sentinel shooting and the like; for, once relieved from the immediate
                  presence of peril, my repentance, like that of most cowards, had passed away, and
                  I was quite as ready to enjoy the whole affair as if I had indeed shown what
                  Philip calls "game" through the dilemma.
            
            
               
               PSYCHE.
               PHILIP and Luigi are becoming close friends. They had met before in Paris, but
                  only in general society and among men. Their intercourse through us places them on
                  a different footing with each other. Intelligent, frank women, with generous
                  natures, bring truly superior men very closely together; and the influence they
                  exercise on each other is beneficial to all.
               A new period of life appears to be opening to Philip. A free interchange of
                  thought passes between him and Luigi, and the poet seems to gain new strength
                  while talking with this pure young high-priest of nature, who has been called so
                  early away from life's turmoils and placed in the sanctuary.
               Philip, like all truly superior persons, is free from petty jealousies and selfish
                  uneasiness in the presence of an equal; his fine, broad-chested, healthy mind has
                  no wretched diseases, no sad maladies of morbidity to con tend with: therefore he
                  is capable of doing full justice to Luigi. He makes me very happy by coming to me
                  with his enthusiastic expressions of delight at their intimacy, and his frank
                  admiration of his new friend. This morning he said to me, "Luini is a very
                  superior man, Ottilie. His calm, observing mind, his just intuitions, almost
                  feminine in their delicacy, his pure unspotted heart, make him a being totally
                  apart from the rest of men. He does me infinite service. He is a draught of old
                  Grecian to my thirsty, half-savage Teuton spirit,—very cool and refreshing. His
                  reason is strong and yet so enlarged, that while it holds firm the folds of his
                  character, it does not cramp or dwarf them. Now that is my trouble, you know; my
                  imagination controls me more than my reason, and, being less firm, lets the folds
                  fly loose, and the character therefore shows great inconsistencies."
               Luigi responds frankly to Philip's friendship, and shows to me the same kind
                  brotherly manner he has from the beginning of our acquaintance; but if I am not
                  very much mistaken, I think he is finding in our trio "metal more attractive" than
                  either the famous poet or his friend Ottilie. I am almost sure he is fast falling
                  deep in love with Venitia, and yet I do not think he admits it, even to
                  himself.
               From the commencement of our intimacy he has expressed an artist's rapturous
                  admiration for her rare beauty. As they have grown better acquainted, his
                  attention has been attracted by the charms of her mind and the striking
                  originality of her genius, toned down by exquisite culture and refinement,—which
                  are to intellect and genius what the polish is to the diamond's brilliant light
                  and the haze to the opal's fire. His sudden intimacy with me brought him first
                  into our little circle free of ceremony; and since Philip has been here, he has
                  seemed as one of our family circle.
               Gradually Venitia has thrown aside her girlish shyness, allows her playful,
                  piquant ways to sparkle out as she used to when we were alone, and completely
                  enchants the poor man.
               
               And Venitia?—Dear girl, she is beginning to be beautifully affected by this new
                  element which is operating on her. Her playfulness and piquancy remain, but her
                  hardness is fast disappearing. She is growing tender and gentle. All those
                  positive points of manner, which were so difficult to come at for correction, but
                  which I have always felt keenly and wished to have removed, are being completely
                  transmuted into charms, by the magical influence of this true philosopher's stone
                  of life,—love! 
                     
                        "D'un moment qu'on aime,
                        On devient si doux."
                     
                  
               
               Love is showing itself in a deliciously naive manner in her. She thinks she is not
                  in love with Luigi, I am certain,—that is, if she thinks about it at all. She
                  makes a show of talking about him frankly; greets him cordially; and asks and
                  receives help from him in her musical studies as if he were a relative; but she
                  shows a graceful hurry and pretty eager interest in everything, which most
                  becomingly replaces the former imperiousness and self-contained manner, that was
                  unnatural in so young a girl.
               It takes very little to make these two unconscious lovers happy; neither is
                  demonstrative by nature; both are highly intellectual; and a look, a tone of
                  voice, the slightest movement, contains more food for quiet rapture and love
                  dreams, during the hours of absence, than positive caresses could scarcely bestow
                  on more tangible lovers, especially at this stage of their intimacy.
               Luigi shows no impatience to be with her, rarely talks of her. I suppose his calm,
                  quiet nature keeps him from all unrest. He is more with me than with the others;
                  we walk and ride on horseback together; for neither Venitia nor Janet is fond of
                  the persistent, almost violent exercise my restless body needs. This craving for
                  motion in the open air is an appetite like hunger with me, and must be gratified
                  or I suffer; therefore we are a great deal with each other, even now that Philip
                  is here; for Philip is more fond of his cigar and lounging on the terrace over a
                  book, than of walking.
               But when we meet, as we do almost every evening, Janet, Philip, and I seem to be
                  resolved into pleasant accessories to their beautiful vision. We are the golden
                     fond, on which this intangible,
                  unacknowledged love traces its throbbing, delicate, arabesque designs. After I
                  return from a long walk or horseback ride, I love to lie on the lounge near the
                  window, and look across the orange leaves and blossoms which border our beautiful
                  terrace, on this subtle, delicate love-growth, which no one else is noticing. It
                  is so spiritual, free from all earthly soil or rustle; only one avenue, the eye,
                  between them; there, on that bounding, brilliant beam, their souls meet and hearts
                  blend.
               It seems to be a beautiful hour-plant, blooming in each succeeding present. I
                  never think of a future for it. The two are floating along happily together on
                  their enchanted life-stream, bathed in the sweet delirium of a love, which seems
                  to need no words of acknowledgment, no vows, no troth-plighting, as vague and
                  indefinable as one of Venitia's own wildering music-poems.
               We all lounged to-day for three or four hours in the Musée Bourbonique. Philip and
                  I went early after breakfast, as we have been doing ever since his arrival, for he
                  is very fond of looking at these ancient marbles with me. I grow bewildered among
                  them, they are such a vast crowd,—upwards of fifteen hundred. I am always wishing
                  that I might have the power to select a few and have them set apart in a private
                  gallery, that I might gaze my full, and in sweet leisure at them.
               
               First should come the Psyche torso, of course. I cannot express in words my
                  reverential admiration of its beauty; they are all too poor. I stand spell-bound
                  before this great creation, and find myself listening for the tender, low words,
                  which it seems should come from those almost speaking lips. But Cupid is flown,
                  Psyche's wings are broken, and she stands there, stilled into cold marble,—this
                  lovely heathen thought,—telling of the sweet faith of those old Greeks in the
                  power of love to bestow a soul, even though it might be a soul for
                  suffering,—still for love!
               That strange myth of Psyche! The ancients were forever representing it tenderly,
                  as if throwing "the shadow before" of what the moderns are living so fiercely. The
                  human soul, aspiring after the divine, loses the sweet, childlike confidence in
                  the first mysterious presence of happiness, and seeks to make this happiness
                  tangible and positive. This was the antique thought; but it exists actively in the
                  spirit of the present age. Everything must be tasted, held, and possessed. Nature
                  is forever punishing this bold, rash curiosity; for penances and expiations must
                  continue, until the human soul perfected will enter into full possession of the
                  divine, and all the lovely foreshadowing of ancient myths and modern faiths and
                  hopes, Eden and Psyche, Prometheus, and that Holy Sorrow, which, like the Jews'
                  Jehovah, must be nameless, shall be made manifest.
               The frolicsome young Cupid, tangled in the Dolphin's folds; his graceful limbs
                  tossed playfully up in air with the dolphin's tail lashing in mad glee,—this group
                  should come next, to brighten me after the solemn, stilling suggestions of that
                  deserted, wingless Psyche.
               What debtors we are to the Greeks! They have left behind them deathless images of
                  the beautiful. Their statues speak eloquently to those of us who listen
                  understandingly; they are petrified poems, sweet emotions and sentiments, earnest
                  expressions in stone. But this ancient Greek sculpture tells very plainly that it
                  appealed to a candid, frank race of people, who required a visible language of
                  beauty. Less sensitive, less nervous than the people of the present day, they
                  found their æsthetical food and pleasure in the simple beauty of form. They loved
                  best the nude too; for there is a flowing beauty, a cadence, so to say, in the
                  soft lines of that human form which is perfectly but delicately developed, that
                  produces true sculptural harmony. The fulness and richness of drapery, which adds
                  so much to painting and is such a powerful accessory in all modern sculpture, had
                  no place in antique art; it seems not only to have been an interference to the
                  chisel, but to the poetical freedom of thought and expression of their idea of
                  sculptural beauty.
               I often see persons smile when they hear us talk of "the language of art,"—of
                  different forms of art having a tongue, so to speak, by which they express the
                  sentiments and feelings of the age producing them. They think it fanciful, and
                  some very practical ones call it affected to use such expressions. A building is a
                  building they say, a statue a simple stone figure, and a picture nothing but a
                  copy on canvas of nature. But I never grow impatient with such persons; rather
                  feel sorry that this sweet æsthetic sense, which endows us with so much capacity
                  for enjoyment, is denied to them.
               We can read these dead languages of the ancients and the Middle Ages with so much
                  pleasure, seeing that the Beautiful has had its full rich voice in every day. The
                  Greeks had their sculpture and architecture; the Middle dle Ages, their architecture and monumental
                  sculpture and painting; and now the voice of this nineteenth century, we music
                  lovers fondly believe, is the tone tongue. This is the true art language of a race
                  which combines the positive, fiery character of the semi-barbarian with the poetic
                  imaginative nature of the old Greeks, and which, too proud to show its emotions,
                  its sufferings, its keen enjoyments in visible forms, gladly seizes on a tongue
                  that will express its whole moral history discreetly.
               "La langue de la musique est la seule qui permette à la
                     pensée de garder ses voiles." The tone tongue alone permits thought
                  to remain veiled. Psyche can fold her beautiful wings over her throbbing heart,
                  and floating on the sonorous wave of harmony, feel, suffer, rejoice, grieve, hope,
                  and fear in secret.
               But I have wandered far away from my gallery. The next piece of sculpture I would
                  select should be the work of a day many centuries later than these lovely old
                  Greek groups. The sitting figure of Agrippina—this piece of statuary so very full
                  of feeling and tenderness—should have the next place in my collection. That great,
                  good woman, against whom Tiberius could urge nothing but that she had "haughty
                  looks and a turbulent spirit!" How these words tell of the struggle this
                  granddaughter of Augustus made to obey her dying husband's conjurations:—
               "By her remembrance of him, by their common children, to divest herself of her
                  unyielding spirit and humble to fortune in the storm of her displeasure; and on
                  her return to the city not to irritate those who were more than a match for her by
                  a competition for the mastery."*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *Tacitus.
               
               In this representation of her which Winckelmann preferred ferred before all other
                  statues of this great woman, she is seated in a chair of exquisite form, her hands
                  are clasped in her lap, her head droops on her breast, and her face, though
                  expressing deep anguish, has a resolute look, showing that she had courage enough
                  to face her great griefs. Some French writer has said finely of this statue, "She
                  seems manacled by Fate, but still unable to give up the superb thoughts which
                  filled her soul in happy days."
               Thus might she have looked when, as the historian tells us, "on her return from
                  the perils and rigors of a sea voyage, in winter, carrying the funeral ashes of
                  her husband, uncertain of vengeance and alarmed for herself, she stopped at the
                  island of Corcyra, situated over against Calabria. Unable to moderate her grief,
                  and impatient from inexperience of affliction, she spent a few days there to
                  tranquillize her troubled spirit.
               "Philip," I asked, "why does not some modern sculptor give us a representation of
                  Tacitus's touching description of her landing at Corcyra?"
               Philip repeated the passage with all his thrilling accent of expression:—
               "The fleet came slowly in, not as usual, in sprightly trim, but all wearing the
                  impress of sadness. When she descended from the ship, accompanied by her two
                  infants, and bearing in her hand the funeral-urn, her eyes fixed steadfastly on
                  the earth, one simultaneous groan burst from the assemblage."*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *Tacitus.
               
               Then he added: "But, Ottilie, sculpture is not a need of the present day. These
                  grand epics in stone are no longer really loved. The remains of the past are
                  regarded with reverence as the great epics of Dante, Ariosto, Tasso, and Milton are read and revered; but they
                  are all traditions, not living things. This sensation-loving age has a stronger
                  taste for prose than poetry of the higher order, for rhetorical, eloquent, highly
                  decorated prose or passionate lyric poetry. The calm quiet of simple beauty and
                  the severe thoughtfulness of ancient art are no longer demanded. The human heart
                  now asks to be cloven, not touched; to be made to shiver with keen tingling
                  pleasure, or pain. Then imagine how fiercely dramatic, how emotional, must be the
                  creation which can produce the desired sensation on this nineteenth-century heart,
                  which has grown* callous from its exacting inventions, making lightning a
                  messenger and fire a slave."
               I reminded him of what Hegel says in his Cours d'
                     Æsthétique, that the character of antique art is the perfect
                  equilibrium between the idea and the sensible form, its purity, serenity,
                  sweetness, and calm, tranquil majesty; a rhythmic beat or measured cadence, which
                  affects us as a piece of musical sonorousness, and which makes up the charm of all
                  its creations, whether in marble or verse, by a Phidias, a Sophocles, or a
                  Plato.
               Since Christianity appeared, the equilibrium is broken, the sentiment of the
                  Infinite has spread itself throughout the human soul, and the idea is profoundly
                  agitating. Humanity feels impatient at seeing itself at once free and a
                  slave,—immortality and mortal life forever struggling,—the soul forever
                  manifesting itself under a form which compresses and restrains it,—hence arises in
                  Christian art a new style of the pathetic, entirely unknown to the ancients.
               "O, that is all very plausible," replied Philip, "and may probably apply to the
                  works of the Middle Ages, but not to the present day. It is not so much
                  Christianity with us now as the positive nature of our people. The truth is, we
                  are like the Romans. Their relics are as true to their character as are those of
                  the Greeks to theirs. One was a poetical people; the other, like us, a practical
                  race. In the place of statues that seem like transfixed souls, and temples which
                  are the very ideal of beauty itself in marble, we see relics of great roads,
                  superb aqueducts, huge excavations, noble bridges, just as at present, everything
                  to help on the actual material life of man, not his soul."
               We walked up and down the silent gallery, peopled with these still, cold
                  creations, that stood around us, like some world of fancy or fairy tale, waiting
                  in expectant attitude the power who should give motion and speech to their "life
                  breathed into stone," and held there in magic death. Philip's clear voice rung
                  out, undaunted by the weird stillness and strange solitude which awed me.
                  Undaunted? Indeed he seemed inspired, and continued pouring out earnestly his fine
                  rhapsodical talk, of which this is only a faint shadow.
               "Sculpture is now purely a decorative thing," he said, "not an expression of
                  thought and of worship, as in those old Greek days. The cities of the New World
                  demand its portrait works for public adornments; the nouveaux riches, its prettinesses for their salons and gardens; but
                  the faith of the present day has no saints to represent, no sweet or solemn
                  allegories to put life into marble. Sculpture is no longer an expression of any
                  leading thought or feeling of the times, or representation of the great schemes
                  and plans of progress. The love and appreciation for the pure ideal is gone from
                  the crowd. Man's great poems, which he used to ask to have sung and painted and chiselled, he now seeks for in
                  practical, tangible objects, which he calls creations,—in tubular bridges,
                  spanning, with a keen, gratified sense of danger escaped, some perilous abyss; the
                  tunnelling of a mighty strait through which the waters of an ocean rush; or a
                  magnetic chain, which comes thrilling across the great sea, seizing on the hearts
                  of distant continents, and binding them in one thrall of positive
                  materiality."
               For a while he remained silent, and we returned to the Agrippina statue. I looked
                  at it for some time, and then walked over to the famous one of her son Caligula.
                  The Romans hated this unfortunate child of Germanicus so fiercely that they
                  strove, after his death, to blot out every record of him in existence. But,
                  notwithstanding, this statue remains, even after such treatment as might be
                  supposed to have destroyed it forever. It was broken into fragments; and on its
                  head can be seen the marks left by the ferrymen of the Garigliano, as they used it
                  to steady the wheels of chariots which crossed the river in their boats. Low,
                  mean, and degraded is the expression of the face,—very unlike that of his sister
                  Julia, to a bust of which I then went, and after that to a bust of her son
                  Nero.
               Nero's head is, as some one has said, a biography in itself,—inflated nostrils,
                  sensual eyes, thin lips; the whole expression of the face showing a mere enjoyer
                  of art, not a creator. But for the possession of supreme power he would probably
                  never have been a monster, simply a selfish egotist. Added to his evil
                  propensities, he had mental capacities which were more than respectable, and much
                  artistic skill and cleverness; but when able, clever men give loose to their
                  animal passions, they do not become simply brutal, as ordinary men do, but
                  demoniacal,—for the best idea we can form of a demon is an immortal brute.
               Philip followed me in silence as I went from one marble head to the other, and I
                  saw him smiling as I returned from Nero abruptly to Agrippina.
               "I am thinking," I said, "how strange it was that the great and wise Germanicus
                  and this virtuous Agrippina could have had such children. There must have been bad
                  blood beyond which crept out in that pretty creature yonder, Julia, and then came
                  to a culminating point in her son, that terrible man-devil, Nero.
               "Beautiful woman she is, truly," I continued, going again to the lovely head of
                  Julia Agrippina; "ambition scarcely shows itself in that girlish face. Her
                  mother's resolute countenance might have ambition in it, but there is no sign of
                  persistency, no steadiness of purpose, in these soft, mobile lines. This delicious
                  mouth and rounding chin, and the very eyes, look as if they loved and coveted
                  case, pleasure, and freedom from all care. I cannot imagine such a woman replying
                  to the Chaldeans whom she consulted on the fortune of her son, and hearing that he
                  would certainly reign and kill his mother, 'Let him kill me, so that he
                  reigns.'"
               "Follow me," said Philip, taking my hand abruptly, and leading me across the
                  building to the "Gallery of Large Bronzes," saying, as we walked there, "You
                  believe in blood. So do I. And we can find proof for our belief in this very
                  family."
               On entering the hall he took me to a fine bust of Julia Augusta, as Tacitus calls
                  Livia Drusilla.
               "There is the answer to your mystery," he said. "Leave the brave, good Germanicus,
                  and his excellent wife Agrippina, and step back another generation. Here you find the bad blood in, this woman;
                  for do you not remember she was the adulterous wife of Augustus, mother of Drusus,
                  grandmother of the excellent Germanicus, great-grandmother of the vain, sensual
                  beauty, Julia Agrippina, and, consequently, great-great-grandmother to Nero. The
                  bad blood you talk of held back these descents, to gather fresh force and sweep on
                  to a flood-tide in a Caligula and a Nero."*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *The bad blood might also be attributed to Nero's great-grandmother, Julia,
                     daughter of the Emperor Octavius Augustus, by his first wife, Scribonia.
                     This Julia was the wife, first, of her cousin Marcellus (Octavia's son,
                     commemorated by Virgil), afterward wife of Agrippa; by Agrippa she had a
                     daughter, Agrippina, wife of Germanicus, and mother of Nero's mother, Julia
                     Agrippina. This elder Julia is represented by history as a shameless, bad
                     woman.
               
               While he was talking we were very much surprised at seeing Janet, Venitia, and
                  Luigi enter the hall.
               "We have been searching for you," said Janet. "Florence Folham has returned. She
                  and her mother came to see us this morning, and Mr. Luini and I took the liberty
                  of making an engagement for you with her, which I will leave him to explain."
               "Miss Folham expressed a great liking for riding on horseback," added Luigi.
                  "Trusting to your approval, and encouraged by Mrs. Dale, I invited her to go with
                  us this afternoon."
               "By all means. You did right. The pretty creature will be a delightful
                  addition."
               "Is she pretty?" asked Philip. "But I forgot," he added saucily, "all Ottilie's
                  men and women—that is, those she likes—are Venuses and Sapphos, Apollos and
                  Adonises. Luini, you and I stand a fine chance of being made demigods, I assure
                  you, in her imagination, which is a veritable hallucination."
               "Go on with your historical lecture, my learned professor," I interrupted; "you
                  are most eloquent on that subject."
               So we continued talking of Livia.
               "But, Mr. Edelhertz," said Janet, with her troublesome exactitude of memory, which
                  upsets provokingly all poetical jumping to conclusions, "do you not remember what
                  Tacitus says of this Julia Augusta, as he calls her? 'In her domestic deportment
                  she was formed after the model of primitive sanctity, but with more affability
                  than was allowed by ladies of old; as a mother, zealous and determined; as a wife,
                  kind and indulgent, well adapted to the fastidious and complex character of her
                  husband and the subtle nature of her son.'"
               "Yes, madam, I remember all that; but I remember also, that, to gratify her
                  ambition, she married the enemy of her husband, while her husband was still
                  living; then, to satisfy it still further, she plotted the ruin of every one who
                  could stand in the way of her son Tiberius; and, to make this same Tiberius
                  emperor, she murdered the very man whose blind adoration for her had placed her on
                  the throne. No, despite the loose praise of Tacitus, she was a bad woman. Look at
                  her, Ottilie. Here you see the same beauty which her granddaughter, Julia,
                  inherited from her, and, added to it, is all the persistency of purpose you looked
                  for in vain in the pretty Julia's face."
               "I am always disposed," urged Janet, "to take the part of women who are abused in
                  history; nine times out of ten, they are innocent."
               "I have a capital answer to make you, Mrs. Dale," said Philip, with a laugh.
                  "Thackeray supplies me, luckily. 'So was Helen of Greece innocent. She never ran
                  away with Paris, the dangerous young Trojan. Menelaus nelaus, her husband, ill used her, and there never
                  was any siege of Troy at all. So was Bluebeard's wife innocent. She never peeped
                  into the closet where the other wives were with their heads off. She never dropped
                  the key, or stained it with blood; and her brothers were quite right in finishing
                  Bluebeard, the cowardly brute.' Yes, this Livia was innocent, I shall interpolate.
                  She never poisoned her husband, not she; and Mary of Scotland never blew up hers;
                  nor this Joanna of Naples, whom Ottilie defends, never murdered hers; nor, as
                  Thackeray winds up drolly, Eve never took the apple,—it was a cowardly fabrication
                  of the serpent."
               Of course we laughed heartily, and dropped the argument; then went across the room
                  to look at a Sappho head which Luigi and Venitia were admiring. We noticed every
                  detail of this charming bust; the cheek and chin full of feeling, the tender,
                  tearful mouth, the chaste style of head-dress,—consisting of two simple fillets,
                  one banding the temples, and both holding up the hair, which is rolled in a rich,
                  loose knot almost on the back of the neck,—and the poise of the head, and form of
                  the throat, which are very fine. I looked for some time at this lovely face, and
                  as I dwelt on its divine beauty, and recalled her genius, and sorrowful, tragic
                  love, I thought of what that strange Frenchwoman, Madame de Staël, said,—she on
                  whom "hunger of the heart" acted as "love on the Psyche":—"Man gives homage to
                  woman according to the affection with which she inspires him, but all that woman
                  grants is almost always a sacrifice."
               After leaving the Sappho, we united in one burst of admiration over a bust of
                  Plato, which might serve for a head of our Blessed Lord. There are in it majesty,
                  dignity, and sweetness. The head is bent a little forward, and the face expresses
                  deep thought, and a sublimity which is divine; but for its gentleness and
                  softness, the character of the countenance would be stern. I remarked this, and
                  Philip replied: "'As sad as Plato,' was a Greek proverb. He always walked with his
                  head bent downward."
               Some little bronze figures attracted our attention: a Venus Anadyomene, which is
                  beautiful; it has an exquisite back, and perfect loveliness is displayed in the
                  form and play of the limbs: also a Fortune, poised tiptoe on a globe; this last
                  airy and delicate thing is considered one of the most curious relics from
                  Herculaneum. Like the Venus Anadyomene, it has delicate inlayings of silver in the
                  bronze.
               Then we shook the huge key of a water-pipe, and listened, with light, trifling
                  words, but strange, unavowed feelings of awe, to the noise of the water inside,
                  which has been shut up there for nearly two thousand years, almost ever since that
                  fearful night when God said "No!" 
                     "To the pulse's magnificent come and go"
                   of those gay cities.
               We loitered awhile by the "Drunken Faun," and laughed merrily; for Philip said all
                  manner of droll things to the tipsy creature, who sits jollily on the empty
                  liquor-skin, snapping his fingers in air with the maddest sort of fun. The
                  "Mercury in Repose," by Polyclete or Lysippus, or some other great artist of those
                  grand old Greek times, took our fancy next. The mouth is so full of life, that one
                  listens for short breath-pants to be heard; for he seems spent with a long flight,
                  and every muscle is relaxed and trembling with fatigue.
               We noticed the bird-of-prey look in the face of Tiberius's bust, the wilful,
                  cruel, Napoleon shape of the head, and
                  curiously projecting ears. But the face is handsome, there being a bold,
                  courageous strength in the fine outlines that is almost noble. The mouth, however,
                  that sad, telltale feature of the face, reveals the cruelty and cold
                  depravity,—thin, hard, dry-looking lips, utterly devoid of feeling or refinement.
                  He resembles his mother, Livia; the same patrician features, quiet, secret brow
                  which tells nothing, and composed expression, free even from the hate and
                  selfishness which lay like a snake coiled around their hearts in withering folds.
                  Dissimulation and cruelty were a necessity with both, and both were too brave and
                  capable to show either in outward ordinary signs.
               As we stood in the centre of the room, near a beautiful bronze gazelle, and looked
                  around to see if we had missed any striking or beautiful creation, Luigi
                  said,—"But for that sorrowful covering up of Herculaneum and Pompeii we should
                  have had but few and imperfect specimens of antique bronzes. The Saracen and other
                  barbarian hordes which overran Italy melted all the metal they could find into
                  money and arms. The Juno of Samos, you remember, was made into money. Therefore
                  this little collection of one hundred and fifteen bronzes is now the most
                  remarkable in the world."
               "Look at this Seneca, Luini," cried Philip. "I never saw such a face in inanimate
                  substance before. Every feature seems quivering with life. It is not remarkable
                  for good looks, Heaven knows, nor for elevation of thought, but for life
                  itself,—the thing almost speaks."
               "The lips have a painful expression, and there is a restless feverishness about
                  the whole face," said Venitia.
               "It does not give one an elevated impression of the philosopher, that is true,"
                  remarked Janet. "He looks mean, hard, worldly, and selfish. I remember hearing
                  Ampère say, however, that the numerous busts of Seneca he had seen represented him
                  always without nobleness, almost pitiful in expression; beard and hair badly kept,
                  an affectation of exterior stoicism, a lying severity, which would deceive us if
                  we were ignorant of Seneca's life; but that being known, they describe well the
                  hypocritical pretensions of this Tartuffe of the Portico."
               "Poor man," said Luigi; "he at least knew how to die."
               The cicerone of the hall stepped up, and set us off on a peal of laughter, by
                  informing us, with great earnestness, that all Americans said that bust resembled
                  "a great American warrior," he had forgotten his name.
               "Monsieur le Général—le Général—le Général"—and the man meditated, tapped his
                  forehead, while we suggested every living and dead American lion we could think
                  of. Suddenly the President hero of the Mexican war flashed across my memory. "The
                  very one, that was the name."
               We looked again and again, to see if we could discern the slightest resemblance to
                  the effigies of General Taylor.
               "The upper part of the face does look like his pictures, a little," said
                  Janet.
               "It looks a great deal more like some weather-beaten old Yankee sea-captain,"
                  remarked Philip.
               Then we examined the face closely to see where the meanness lay, and where we
                  could trace the marks of the philosopher; and we agreed that thought was expressed
                  in the brow and head, the meanness can be seen in the mouth and chin.
               "I am like old Montaigne about Seneca," said Luigi. "I do not like to hear him
                  abused. You remember how modestly the French philosopher gives his reasons for
                     defending fending both Plutarch and
                  Seneca:—'La familiarité que i 'ay avecques ces personnages icy, et l'assistance
                  qu'ils font à ma vieillesse, et à mon livre massonné purement de leurs
                  despouilles, m' oblige à espouser leur honneur.'"*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *"The familiarity I have had with these two authors, and the assistance they
                     have lent to my age, and to my book, wholly built up of what I have taken
                     from them, oblige me to stand up for their honor."—Hazlitt's
                        translation of Montaigne, Chap. 32, Book II.
               
               "Diderot," remarked Philip, "said his veritable image—that which will strike you
                  with admiration, which will inspire you with respect—is in his writings; it is
                  there you must go to seek Seneca."
               "I am disposed," said Janet, "to hold your men in history to the same harsh, exact
                  judgment you display to the women. Macaulay's summing up of Seneca's claims to the
                  name of a philosopher is more true, to my fancy, than Diderot's opinion, or
                  Montaigne's defence. He says, according to Seneca's views, 'the business of a
                  philosopher was to declaim in praise of poverty, with two millions sterling out at
                  usury; to meditate epigrammatic conceits about the evils of luxury, in gardens
                  which moved the envy of sovereigns; to rant about liberty, while fawning on the
                  insolent and pampered freedmen of a tyrant; to celebrate the divine beauty of
                  virtue with the same pen which had just before written a defence of the murder of
                  a mother by a son.'"
               "I yield," replied Philip, bowing. "You took my severe judgment of women so
                  quietly, Mrs. Dale, that, in the presence of this bust and you ladies, I am
                  willing to accept anything you urge against the poor philosopher; but when Luini
                  and I are alone in his library, enjoying that fine old Amsterdam Montaigne of his,
                  over his equally fine cigars, I shall return to my manly allegiance, and repeat
                  what the charming old Frenchman says of his favorite author, who is, as he
                  expresses it so quaintly, 'full of notable commodity for his humor.'"
               "Ampère," remarked Janet, "said that one of the Seneca busts in the Vatican seemed
                  to say, 'Alas! I can do nothing more.' What is this bust saying to you, Ottilie?
                  You are looking as if you were holding a parley with it."
               I started, for I was indeed, although listening to the conversation, giving speech
                  to that almost quivering mouth, and living thought to that frowning brow, so I
                  answered promptly in the philosopher's own words,—"Life, my dear Lucilius, is a
                  battle."
               "Vivere, mi Lucili, militare est," repeated Philip musingly, as he passed his
                  fingers with a sort of tender sympathy over the haggard, wrinkled face of the
                  great old Spaniard; "and this face surely tells of a fierce internal war. If this
                  countenance be a true index of his inner man, no wonder he thought death the best
                  part of life."
               "Here is a bust of Scipio Africanus we have forgotten," said Luigi. "Look what a
                  fine, benignant face it has."
               Again we analyzed features, and were well content to read in this bust the
                  character of that great man. The strong, heavy jaw and firm mouth are those of an
                  energetic, resolute, intrepid general; the rapt, vague eye, and intelligent, but
                  dreamy brow, told of that strange, half-comprehended faith which his
                  contemporaries called mysticism,—of that elevation or enthusiasm which impelled
                  him to hold those long, solitary conversations in the temple with Jupiter, whose
                  son he said he was. Yes, to that grand old Roman in that far-off heathen day
                     were given the glimmerings of a
                  Divine light,—the belief in one living God, who was his Father.
               On the left side of the fine, high, bald head we found the sacred marks,—the scars
                  of those twenty-seven wounds which he received when he was a boy of only eighteen
                  years of age, in defending his father, the elder Scipio. There is capability and
                  energy in this face, but no adroitness or world-wisdom. One can well understand,
                  while looking at it, that such a man could never maintain a hold over a mobile,
                  capricious people as the Romans were.
               "Like all leading republicans in stirring times," said Philip, "he was
                  unconsciously a fine actor, and he played his part well. Look at that simple, wise
                  face, and imagine it lighted up with the fire of wounded pride and indignation
                  when, on the day of his trial before the Roman Senate, he rose up superbly, and
                  made no other answer to his accusers but this grand one: 'Tribunes and citizens,
                  on this very day did I conquer Hannibal and the Carthaginians. Come, Romans, let
                  us all go to the Capitol and render thanks to the gods for our victories.'
               "And, gathering his mantle around him, he strode out of the Senate, followed by
                  the whole assembly, who forgot the trial, the charges, everything, in the effect
                  produced on them by this fine, telling point. Great Jove, but it must have been
                  sublime."
               "There was no play-acting, however," remarked Janet, "in his retirement to this
                  Campania; there was an honest, indignant contempt and a sorrowful, true feeling in
                  his words, 'My ungrateful country shall not have my bones.'"
               "There is no bust of Cato here," I said. "What a pity! I should like to contrast
                  it with this of Scipio. He was the one who drove him to Liternum."
               "How unhappy our enemies would be," said Luigi, "if they could only know how often
                  their persecutions and hatred turn out to be benefits to us. Scipio was happier
                  away from Rome. Such a man as that, after the heated life of youth and action was
                  over, with his fine tastes and culture, showed himself in a much better and more
                  dignified light in retirement."
               "His life here must have been a very agreeable one after all," cried Philip,
                  laughing. "A charming villa, in a delightful region of country, leisure, taste,
                  comfortable means, and the 'best society,' with the rather pleasant sting of a
                  little martyrdom, a little unjust persecution to make him comfortably pharisaical
                  and self-complacent. No, old Scipio, I do not think you need our sympathy in your
                  afflictions. I shall give all my heart holds to that sorrowful old Spaniard,
                  Seneca, who, supposing that the cruel things the relentless Mrs. Dale urges
                  against him were true, is so much the more to be sorrowed with; for he had to live
                  hourly and instantly with that divine inner man, who thought and wrote such
                  sublime words, and whose reproaches must have been fearful if he was disloyal to
                  himself."
            
            
               
               A MIRACLE.
               WE have been devoting the greater part of this first week in May to the famous
                  spring festival of Naples,—the "standing miracle," as Baronius calls it,—the
                  liquefaction of Saint Januarius's blood.
               We have seen the miracle performed almost every day this week; but the most
                  interesting ceremonies were those which took place the first day of the festival,
                  last Saturday,—which was the Saturday preceding the Sunday that falls next to the
                  calends of May,—the anniversary of the translation of the Saint's relics from
                  Pozzuoli to Naples (400 A. D.).
               Luigi had told me, some weeks ago, that he should make arrangements for me to see
                  this miracle satisfactorily. When he learned that Mrs. Rochester and Janet also
                  wished to be present, he kindly included them in the party; I say kindly, as it is
                  an uncommon thing for Italian Catholics, no matter how intimate they may be with
                  Protestants, to give them opportunities for seeing the most sacred services of
                  their Church. They will show their galleries, their palaces, their works of art,
                  with courteous freedom, but they jealously guard the solemn festivals of their
                  religion from the curious and unbelieving spectator.
               Through Luigi's intimacy with the Archbishop, permission was readily obtained for
                  us to go behind the High Altar of Santa Chiara, into the space between it and
                  those great mediæval treasures of the church, Masaccio's Royal Tombs, which I have
                  already described. This recess was made private by heavy crimson curtains hung at
                  each side; and eight or ten comfortable seats were placed there, for a few persons
                  as favored as ourselves. It was a most desirable situation, for between the altar
                  pillars and drapery we commanded a fine coup d'
                     œil of the grand religious pageant which always takes place in the
                  church the first day of the Miracle festival.
               On entering the church, a little after midday, we placed ourselves in front of the
                  altar, as we wished to see the bust of the Saint, the decorations, and, above all,
                  the curious attendants on the ceremony; these are "the relations of Saint
                  Januarius," as they are called, the oldest and poorest women in Naples, who are
                  always seated within the altar balustrade, and form one of the most remarkable
                  features of the spectacle. Seats are placed for them on the right of the altar,
                  and from time immemorial they have literally "assisted" at these services. They
                  were already assembled, filling up four or five benches, looking like the witches
                  in Macbeth, clothed in grotesque costume, with horribly ugly faces, and chanting a
                  rude, wild invocation; it was a Litany, which they repeated and repeated, unbroken
                  and undisturbed, through the whole long ceremony. Neither the superb music of the
                  orchestra, the interest excited by the procession, nor the intense emotion created
                  by the slow performance of the miracle, interrupted their rude chanting; on the
                  contrary, every interference only made them shriek the shriller, and louder; and,
                  wild as the chanting was, there was a curious melody in it.
               
               The costly High Altar, of fine marbles and lapis
                     lazuli inlayings, was draped with crimson velvet, whose rich folds
                  hung down beside and around the massive silver bust of the Neapolitan Saint. This
                  bust, which was placed on the right of the altar (to the left of the spectator),
                  holds in its interior Saint Januarius's skull.
               The sunbeams streamed in on the jewelled mitre, gorgeous necklaces, and crosses
                  adorning the bust, breaking into dazzling fragments of light as they fell on the
                  four thousand rubies, sapphires, and diamonds there collected. One of the crosses
                  alone had sixty-three handsome diamonds in it. Another superb one was composed of
                  alternate large diamonds and sapphires; and still another, of fine-sized diamonds
                  and emeralds,—all gifts from various Catholic sovereigns.
               We looked at these splendors leisurely, and the Catholic members of the party had
                  time to perform their devotions; for we were not to take our places behind the
                  altar until the procession came near the church; and the warning for our removal
                  was to be the martial music accompanying it.
               The plan of that day's celebration was this. In the morning, the silver bust
                  containing the Saint's head had been brought to Santa Chiara from its home, the
                  Chapel of Saint Januarius, which is in the right aisle of the Cathedral,—a
                  beautiful little Greek cross building, that cost half a million of ducats, and is
                  filled with exquisite works of art, such as Zampieri's, Giordano's, and
                  Domenichino's paintings, Fiorelli's bronzes, and Vinaccia's marvellous silver
                     basso-rilievos and sculpture.
               After the bust departed, a procession formed in the Cathedral, consisting of the
                  Cardinal-Archbishop, his clergy, and the municipal authorities; which after
                  forming ing proceeded to the Chapel, to obtain the sacred relics. These relics are
                  always kept in a place called the Tabernacle, which is a large aperture behind the
                  altar of the Saint Januarius Chapel. This Tabernacle is closed up by a massive
                  iron door, with two strong locks; one key is kept by the municipal authorities,
                  the other by the Cardinal-Archbishop, and both possessors must always be present
                  at the opening of the door. The Tabernacle contains the châsse, or shrine, of richly chased silver and cut-glass; in it are
                  the sacred vials holding the relics.
               The Cardinal, after entering the Chapel, unlocked the Tabernacle door, took the
                  shrine carefully in his hands, and left the Chapel and Cathedral at the head of a
                  most stately procession, composed of his canons, the municipal authorities, men
                  carrying the costly silver busts and statues of the forty-eight saints, protectors
                  of Naples,—which superb works belong also to the Chapel of the Treasury of Saint
                  Januarius,—accompanied by soldiers, and military bands playing all the while the
                  most inspiring music.
               This procession, with its fine gilt state coaches and statues; superb uniforms,
                  glittering banners, and rich canopies; burning incense, rising up from
                  beautifully-wrought silver censers, tossed high aloft in the air, and gay
                  music,—formed a sight well worth witnessing; and if we are here another year, we
                  shall select it for the first day's view. It proceeded along the Anticaglia and
                  through various streets until it reached Santa Chiara, followed by crowds of
                  people; and an hour or so after midday, while we were sitting in silence before
                  that superbly decorated altar, we heard the music first faintly, and then
                  approaching nearer.
               I had noticed a little group of gentlemen standing half within the archway of a side entrance to the
                  sacristy, composed of Church dignitaries, among whom was the Pope's Nuncio. As the
                  procession music drew nearer the church, one of these clergymen stepped forward,
                  and made a friendly sign with his head to Luigi, who arose and told us to follow
                  him.
               This gentleman was a fine, soldierly looking man; he walked in front of us with a
                  courteous air, managing his long purple robe with much grace. He wore on his
                  shoulders a small red silk cape,—cape and robe were buttoned from throat-band to
                  shoe-buckle with very small buttons, no larger than peas, placed as close as
                  possible. He held aside one of the curtains of the space where we were to be
                  seated with the most courtly reverence, while we passed in, then entered and
                  assisted Luigi with much interest in placing us in the best position for seeing
                  both the procession and the ceremony. This accomplished, he bowed gracefully to
                  us, and resting his hand on Luigi's shoulder, looked into his face with a
                  pleasant, friendly smile, said a few words in a low tone, and disappeared behind
                  the curtains.
               "That is one of the canons of Saint Restituta," said Luigi, as he took his seat
                  behind us. "He belongs to the Chapter of the Metropolitan Church, and enjoys many
                  of those distinctions you admire so much, Ottilie; he can wear the ermine cape and
                  the mitre,—can bear the crosier and cross. One of your favorite Popes, Paul
                  IV.,—Cardinal Carafa,—was a Neapolitan canon, like this gentleman; also Urban VI.
                  and Boniface IX. There are thirty of these canons officiating in the Duomo, or
                  Cathedral; but the church belonging to them is Saint Restituta, that ancient
                  building adjoining the Cathedral, in the aisle leading off on the left, as you
                  enter the Duomo. It is the oldest church in Naples, I believe, for it was founded
                  by Constantine the Great, in 334 A. D., and has always been independent of the
                  Archbishop, who can only visit it in the character of apostolical delegate. You
                  will see this canon taking part in the ceremonies of to-day. He has been detailed
                  for some special duty at this church, probably to assist the Nuncio, who always
                  has jurisdiction over Santa Chiara."
               Just then the Pope's Nuncio entered with a party of ladies, for we had found the
                  space unoccupied. This dignitary is rather a handsome, smooth-faced,
                  smooth-mannered man, not at all priestly or grave-looking, rather gay and mundane.
                  Luigi and Mrs. Rochester told us the rank of the ladies accompanying him, two of
                  whom were diplomatic associates of the American Ambassadress.
               One was a pretty young Roman princess, as tender and lovely looking as About's
                  "Tolla"; there was a regal-looking Russian duchess; and besides the two
                  Ambassadresses, a graceful German countess, full of unconscious and bewitching
                  coquetry, evidently the belle and popular woman of the party; for although the
                  lowest in rank, she was the one to whom the Nuncio paid the most attention and the
                  others showed the most courtesy; all of which she accepted in the prettiest
                  manner, generously insisting on seating them before she took her own place. To
                  this unselfish disposition, probably, she owed her popularity, for she was not so
                  very pretty, I think. Her face, however, had one great charm; it was, as Emerson
                  says, "fluid with expression," and so rippled all over with happy smiles and
                  pleasing looks, as to make us unmindful of its features.
               We have often spoken of her since, and not one of us has been able to tell Venitia
                  and Philip the color of her eyes, the
                  shade of her hair, or the tint of her skin; we simply say, "She was lovely and
                  charming."
               Very soon the procession arrived at the Basilica. The statues and busts were
                  carried in first. As they entered the large door, glorious music poured out from
                  the choir, filling every part of the grand old church with its rich, subtle fluid.
                  It was a fine orchestral symphony, composed for the occasion by Mercadante. Luigi
                  told us the great old master was there in person; but not to lead his beautiful
                  work, for, alas! the poor old man is becoming hopelessly blind.
               The procession was very imposing. The eight-and-forty silver statues and busts,
                  each one on a gilt pedestal, placed on a crimson-covered platform, with rich
                  silken canopy, and carried by golden rails on the shoulders of superbly-formed
                  Neapolitans, filed up one side of the large Basilica, and after a gracious,
                  reverential obeisance to the bust of San Januarius at the altar, swept grandly
                  around and moved, with their accompanying banners, down the other side of the
                  church, leaving ample room in the centre for the immense crowd of spectators and
                  soldiery collected there.
               This finished, the crowd separated as if by magic or machinery; and far down this
                  long aisle of human beings, near the door of the church, appeared the Archbishop
                  and clergy, robed in full canonicals, blazing in the afternoon sun with purple,
                  and gold, and precious stones.
               The music pealed out still more grandly. Every neck was stretched forward eagerly,
                  each one was anxious to see Cardinal Duke Sforza—who was holding the sacred
                  relics—approach the High Altar. Clouds of incense arose. The old women shrieked
                  out their witchlike plain-song in still shriller tones, some striking the keynote
                  note of the symphony, while others, with the unconscious ear for musical harmony
                  which these Neapolitans possess by nature, kept their wild chant in curious,
                  grotesque union with the scholarly composition of the maestro; the effect produced
                  reminded me of the demon supporters to old altars, or the impish gargoyle heads on
                  the roof-spouts of some superb cathedral.
               The clergy, on reaching the altar, ranged themselves on either side, according to
                  their functions; among them, I recognized the gentleman who had so kindly placed
                  us in our seats. His keen, dark eyes flashed in for an instant through the
                  pillars; I fancy he wished to see if he had been successful; a half-look of
                  recognition passed between us as our eyes met.
               The Archbishop placed the shrine in front of the altar, on the broad slab, a
                  little to the right of himself, directly opposite me, and so near that by reaching
                  out my hands I could have touched it. The shrine was hollow on the side towards
                  us, and the two bottles, which looked like old-fashioned vinegar-cruets, stood on
                  its small silver shelf. There was nothing under or above, and the illuminations of
                  the altar were not near enough to affect them.
               We examined these bottles with curiosity as well as great interest. They contained
                  a substance which in hardening had adhered to the sides, resembling dark red
                  sealing-wax. The Archbishop took them in his hands,—one and then the other,—held
                  them up by the top and bottom with his thumbs and middle fingers; turned them
                  around and upside down, showing that the substance inside was hard and immovable;
                  then be returned them to the shrine, and began the solemn services.
               The belief in relation to this miracle is, that the solution tion and ebullition of the blood are caused by the
                  approach of the vials and head to each other; while waiting for this to be
                  accomplished, solemn religious ceremonies are performed, and devout prayers and
                  litanies offered up to God.
               Saint Januarius was a Bishop of Benevento in the early part of Diocletian's
                  persecution of the Christians. This was the tenth and most bloody one, continuing
                  from 286 A. D. until the time of Constantine, 312 A. D. The good Bishop of
                  Benevento had a dear friend whom he loved tenderly, Sozius, Deacon of Miseno. This
                  Sozius, with several other men, was seized, by an order of Dracontius, Governor of
                  Campania, and thrown into prison at Pozzuoli.
               When Saint Januarius heard this sorrowful news, instead of caring for his own
                  safety, and keeping himself in seclusion, he travelled in all haste to comfort and
                  encourage his friend. The Governor, learning that an eminent person had come to
                  visit the prisoners, gave orders to have him also seized. The Saint was thrown
                  into the same prison with his friend and companions, and soon after an order
                  arrived from the Emperor condemning them to be torn in pieces by wild beasts.
               But when they were taken to the amphitheatre at Pozzuoli and exposed to the
                  half-famished lions, the savage animals crouched tamely and even kindly at their
                  feet; nothing could provoke them to touch the holy men. This exasperated the
                  Governor so much, that he ordered them to be beheaded. They were executed and
                  buried near Pozzuoli, as Bede testifies.
               When Christianity triumphed, about 400 A. D., the relics of these holy men were
                  disinterred and distributed. Miseno obtained Sozius, and Naples was fortunate
                  enough to secure Saint Januarius. The Neapolitan faithful believe that his relics
                  preserve their city, not only from volcanic destruction, but many other
                  dangers.
               At the time of the Saint's martyrdom there was a holy woman present, who collected
                  some of his blood in two bottles. The tradition tells that she took it to a Bishop
                  of Naples, Saint Severus, and when he touched it, the blood liquefied and bubbled
                  up, and continued doing so, on the annual feast of the Saint, 19th September, and
                  on various other occasions.
               Thus it can be seen that this miracle is of very ancient date, counting back as
                  far as 400 A. D.; and besides, many holy, learned, and venerable men have believed
                  in it. Cardinal Lambertini, afterwards Benedict XIV., published a famous defence
                  of the liquefaction of San Januarius's blood.*
                   Baronius, Ribadeneira, and Bollandus also wrote in its favor. Indeed, the
                  list of the great and learned men who have examined this miracle, not only
                  attentively, but with reverential, jealous suspicion, would be too long to
                  copy.

               Then, on the other side, many distinguished and equally learned German and English
                  Protestants have attributed this ancient and wonderful fact to the heat of the
                  officiating priest's hands, the steam or vapor of the altar tapers and lamps, or
                  some unknown chemical influence.
               Cardinal Sforza's hands did not touch the bottles on the parts where the blood is
                  congealed. There was no lamp or candle flame near them. And as for "chemical
                  influence," what a marvellous discovery would that chemical cal secret be, which has been so strangely kept for
                  fourteen hundred years!
               Scripture miracles are objects of faith, and never questioned by orthodox
                  Protestant or Catholic Christians. Other miracles are not regarded in the same
                  light, nor does our faith rest on them as on the revealed ones of the Gospel. It
                  is prudent and wise to examine such miracles closely, and be thoroughly convinced
                  that they are supernatural; but it is well, at the same time, however, to bear in
                  mind, that the glorification of God is the great thing contained in a miracle;
                  that its main intention is, to excite in us more lively sentiments of humble
                  adoration, love, and praise; not to obtain any worldly gift or advantage.
               Such a miracle as this of Saint Januarius illustrates and confirms the faith of
                  the devout Catholic Christian, while the doubting brother is not condemned for
                  withholding his belief, but treated patiently and tenderly, as our Blessed Lord
                  bore with St. Thomas.
               Janet said, after we returned home that day,—and it was the only remark made on
                  the subject, for we all felt too serious to talk much about it,—"Admitting that
                  there is a fraud or juggle, that may be discovered by some person cleverer than
                  all the great and good men who have examined the matter, this one thing is
                  certain, that pure and holy man, Cardinal Sforza, has never lent himself to it.
                  The strange work is accomplished without any help from him. I was sufficiently
                  convinced of this fact by the sight of his calm, beautiful, saintly face and
                  devout expression during the holy invocations. There was something inexpressibly
                  effective in the simple earnestness and childlike faith he displayed, when the
                  miracle seemed delayed, and he chanted aloud, independent of the service
                  apparently, 'Amen, dico vobis, quidquid orantes petitis,
                     credite quia accipietis, et fiet vobis.'"*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *"Verily I say unto you, whatsoever ye seek, praying, believe that you will
                     receive, and it shall be done for you."—St. Mark.
               
               I do not know how long the services lasted. While I was lost in deep thought over
                  such faith and its power, I was aroused by a shrieking chant which burst from the
                  old women shriller and more impatient than any of their preceding cries; just
                  then, too, the symphony pealed out in strange dissonances, and a discordant
                  passage from the wind instruments followed, reminding me of the weird incantation
                  scene in Weber's Der Freyschutz. The Archbishop
                  recited a litany, in concert with his canons, and each one seemed overflowing with
                  holy fervor.
               I turned and looked at the vials; as I did so, I felt thrilled to my heart. I
                  could hardly credit my senses, for on that very instant I saw the hard substance
                  suddenly change! Red blood trickled down the sides of the bottles, and, as the
                  liquid accumulated, it looked warm and bubbling.
               The Archbishop held the sacred vials aloft, that the multitude might see, and his
                  face seemed radiant and glowing with a divine exultation. A cannon thundered forth
                  from the close outside the church, a peal of thanksgiving burst from the people
                  and mingled with the wild melody of the symphony. The Archbishop descended from
                  the altar, carrying in his hands one of the bottles, and, followed by the canons,
                  went around the full length of the Basilica to share his joy with the people.
               When he had finished the circuit, instead of returning to the altar, to our
                  surprise he approached the place where we were seated. I never dreamed of the
                     high favor which was coming to me,
                  obtained by Luigi's kindness.
               The curtains were held aside, the Archbishop entered, and as he drew near us I saw
                  him exchange a look with Luigi, who took my hand in his for a moment. The
                  Cardinal-Archbishop stopped in front of me, and smiled kindly. With a
                  half-bewildered feeling I knelt down and received the sacred vial in my trembling
                  hands; he aided me in holding it to my lips, and gave me his blessing; then he
                  left the recess, accompanied by the few clergymen who had entered with him, and
                  returned to the altar.
               The military bands began beating their drums. The Cardinal, holding the silver
                  shrine high before him, in which were the bottles and the warm, flowing blood, and
                  followed by his canons, went in solemn procession down through the centre of the
                  crowd, leaving the building as he had entered it.
               The intense excitement which pervaded the dense mass of human beings thronging the
                  Basilica made them surge to and fro like a high sea. We reached our barouche,
                  which was waiting for us in the close, by a private passage-way through the back
                  part of the church, and drove home in serious, respectful silence.
            
            
               A DINNER AT BAIÆ.
               I HAVE had so little time to write in my journal, that I have allowed many
                  pleasant occurrences to pass unnoticed. Florence Folham and Philip have been
                  riding on horseback with Luigi and me, for Philip says he is captivated with the
                  exercise; I shrewdly suspect he is more captivated with Florence. He tries to be
                  very bold about this sudden fancy for riding, desiring to deceive either himself
                  or me, and I say not a word except to tease him a little about wishing to rid
                  himself of some of his superfluous corpulency.
               "How perfidious and cruel you women are," he cries; "I can call all the world to
                  witness that you have for years, Ottilie, admired what you called my 'superb
                  proportions.'"
               "But when they cease to be proportions, and become dimensions, dear Philip, you
                  cannot expect me to remain true to what no longer exists."
               I do not wonder, however, that he admires Florence. She is a charming
                     creature,—"si gentille et blonde comme les
                     blès," as a French lady said very prettily of her the other evening;
                  an alliterative comparison which loses half its point when translated into "fair
                  as the wheat," and yet it is strongly suggestive of just such beauty as hers. She has golden hair hanging in
                  loose, floating curls which let the light in over her soft red-and-white skin in
                  the most delicious flecks; and blue eyes with the hue of the Viola pedata,—the bright little flower found in early
                  spring on the margins of wheat-fields,—eyes that are as cold as the hardy little
                     Viola pedata itself, but which at times have
                  a strange misty expression when she is deeply moved, either by Venitia's playing,
                  or when singing one of her own operatic passages; this sweet mistiness seems as a
                  sort of prevision of future "trouble, love, and poesy." 
                     
                        "Such mystic lore is in her eyes
                        And light of other worlds than ours,
                        She looked as she had fed on flowers,
                        And drunk the dews of Paradise."
                     
                  
               
               Although "English from top to toe," so far as blood and birth go, foreign
                  education has made her a complete Parisienne in manner and appearance. Her
                  toilette is always comme il faut, and in the
                  last mode of the month, for the family has an income which counts well on the
                  continent; and her gowns, bonnets, and even light fancy jewelry, vary in the most
                  systematic manner according to the orthodox law of the Parisian mode. She looks
                  like a Follet fashion-plate done up into a charming little pastel study, as Philip
                  aptly observed when he first saw her.
               Her voice is in keeping with her appearance. She has been a pupil of Duprèz, and
                  has one of those true Parisienne voices Scudo describes so graphically, as having
                  "more sharpness than sonorousness, more vibration than force"; a true salon voice,
                  and exquisitely cultivated. The freshness of youth and her frank, warm English
                  heart make of this sharpness, or elevation of sound, and vibration tion an
                  excellence rather than a defect; for the one is thrilling, and the other
                  touching.
               "She sings with a tear in her voice," Luigi says, and Philip last night compared
                  her execution of the soliloquy in the last act of La
                     Traviata to the misty light in an opal. Her voice is a little veiled,
                  and the vibration in such heartrending passages sounds as the hidden spark in an
                  opal looks. Venitia compares her singing or execution of cadenzas to small diamond
                  points, and quotes also Scudo's delicious description,—"little pearls falling on
                  scarlet velvet."
               But to my ears, her notes, while they are sparkling, are also round and liquid,
                  not like diamond points or any hard gem, but as drops of dew, and they roll off in
                  the air as we see glittering beads of water fall from the downy petals of a
                  rich-hued flower. It is a pure soprano, very telling and bird-like in the upper
                  division, and though trembling and delicate in the bridge-notes, there is a warm
                  hue in them, which is not at all feverish, but gives just tenderness enough to
                  create interest and almost love for the pretty singer herself, as well as
                  admiration for the music.
               Philip is completely infatuated with her, but he carries it off bravely, as if it
                  were a mere fancy for a pretty girl, and compliments her openly,—compliments which
                  are so bewitching from a man like Philip, for they come colored with all the rich
                  hues of his genius. Last evening she was singing the Prayer in "Assisa al piè d' un salice," from Otello. Philip was
                  leaning over the back of the lounge on which I was sitting, giving me the benefit
                  of his short, enthusiastic ejaculations. I looked up in his keen, bright eye, as
                  she ended the last cadenza on "cenere a bagnar,"
                  where the voice mounted finely to the upper B, resting there an instant, and
                  making a half-ending in a very
                  effective "Ah," then came rippling down, full of little sobs, to the throat-notes,
                  giving the "bagnar" on the key-note with a most
                  touching expression of sorrow. I whispered,— 
                     
                        "''T is a sweet whirlwind(striving to get out)
                        Heaves her soft bosom, wanders round about,
                        And makes a pretty earthquake in her breast.'"
                     
                  
               
               For one instant Philip looked at me as if he could have worshipped me, with that
                  sublime generosity men show when you make them happy, and then electrified us all,
                  and covered dear Florence's delicate brow with the happiest blushes by repeating
                  to her, as a compliment, in his most impassioned and eloquent style, the whole
                  beautiful description from Crashaw's "Music's Duel," in which is the passage I had
                  quoted. His superb recitation of this lovely poem created the greatest enthusiasm
                  in our little circle; as Janet said this morning,—
               "Surely there can be nothing in this world so gratifying to a man, as a
                  society-triumph such as Philip experienced then. It was free from the vulgar
                  intoxication of public applause, and filled to the brim with that keen sense of
                  pleasure caused by the sudden sensation one feels when conscious of carrying along
                  on the brilliant magnetic current of one's own genius and eloquence hearts and
                  minds equal to one's own."
               A day or two since we had a fine dinner at Baiæ. We started early in the morning,
                  for it is now the latter part of May, and the weather, though delightful, is very
                  warm, especially at midday. Mrs. Folham, Janet, and Venitia went in the coach, for
                  we cannot persuade Venitia to ride; she says the management of the reins and
                  exercise of the arms unfit her for musical execution, making her fingers tremble
                  and her touch uncertain.
               We had a glorious day of course; lived over old Roman times, quoted Homer, Virgil,
                  Livy, Tacitus, and the Holy Book, for this whole promontory is filled full to
                  overflowing with sacred and profane memories, which rush along in swift currents
                  together, making a wildering whirlpool at times. We have to leap back and forth in
                  history with a mental agility that tests our skill finely.
               It was a regular excursion, and every celebrated spot in that direction was
                  visited; for although we have driven and ridden so often around the environs of
                  Naples, we have never yet stopped at any of the remarkable or classical spots. The
                  first place we visited was Virgil's Tomb, which stands near the entrance of the
                  Grotto of Posilippo.
               "I am indebted to Ottilie for my first idea of this place," said Philip, when we
                  reached the brow of the hill in which it is built; "it was given me by a drawing
                  of hers, which hung in my father's dressing-room when I was a boy."
               "Clear away in those happy years long ago," I thought, as I sat down on the top of
                  the ivy-covered columbarium, and remembered the little drawing. I recalled all the
                  feelings of girlish pride I had on receiving Mr. Edelhertz's praise, and the long,
                  pleasant talk we had at the time I gave it to him; he described to me in his
                  precise, elegant English, as he examined my drawing, the situation and sweet
                  surroundings of this delightful place, which he had visited in his youth. The past
                  swept over me like a flood; and it seemed as if I was living two existences at
                  once.
               Philip and Florence rambled over the hill-top, talking gayly, and enjoying the
                  delicious landscape, which the early morning sun made as fresh and bright as is
                     her young beauty. Luigi and Venitia
                  explored the inner part of the tomb, and I sat there listening to loved voices of
                  the dead and gone, feeling very gray and ashen hued. I could hear Luigi's rich
                  tones and Philip's clarion note gathering in around me; they were both loving, as
                  I had been loved, giving to two women the same hopes which had been given to me.
                  "But there let the likeness end," I said mournfully to myself, "for I sit here
                  alone, on the brow of a tomb, with snow falling inward on the dead hopes of my
                  heart."
               Janet, who had been clambering about like a kid, came up to me, and leaned her
                  hand on my shoulder in silence for a while, then she bent over and gathered a
                  branch of Casimir Delavigne's laurel, saying with a merry laugh,— 
                     "'Break from the sacred laurel the atoning bough.'"
                   The rest of the party joined us, and after a little talk on the numberless
                  memories connected with the spot, from the time of Virgil to the present day, we
                  descended the hill.
               "Now, ladies," cried Philip, as he helped Florence mount her horse, "I have made
                  myself guide-in-chief of this procession, therefore I shall announce when the
                  enthusiasm must commence and when it must cease. The curtain now falls on Virgil's
                  Tomb, and rises on the Grotto of Posilippo, sacred to the memory of Corinne and
                  Petrarch, for when a lady is in the question she must be mentioned first even at
                  the expense of a hundred years or so."
               We trotted gayly through the dark grotto, which, although it was so early in the
                  morning, resounded with the cries and shouts of the donkey-boys, and crowds of
                  people, forever surging to and fro in this dark tunnel. When we reached Pozzuoli,
                  we dismounted again in order to visit the numerous places of interest in this
                  "Little Rome" of Cicero,—the Temples, the Baths, the Amphitheatre, and the Villa
                  of the great Roman orator, in which he wrote the De
                     Fato and the Academicæ. The portico, and
                  its beautiful woods, which he called the Academy, and its lovely promenade along
                  the shore,—the whole of this charming abode in which he said he "could be so happy
                  if the importunate did not oblige him to desert it,"—are all gone; only some
                  ruined piles of stone, over which the sea washes, mark where the beautiful Villa
                  Puteolana of Cicero stood.
               Then we walked along the shore to the very spot where, nearly a hundred years
                  after the orator was murdered, two unknown men landed, "after a perilous voyage
                  from Cesarea, on their way to Rome," whither they were going to give to their
                  Faith that which is its seed,—the Blood of Martyrs. These two men "tarried with
                  the brethren" at Pozzuoli seven days, then travelled on to their great Life in
                  Death.
               Yes, at that very period while Nero and Poppea were sinning so madly, and the
                  poor, frightened, lovely Julia Agrippina was fleeing to this Puteolan shore to
                  escape the death she met so bravely,—in those wicked Roman days, described with
                  such awful severity by Tacitus, when the old oracles were growing dumb, and "the
                  gray old gods of Hellas" becoming palsied and dying out,—these two plain men of a
                  despised and enslaved nation went journeying on wearily to Rome as prisoners of
                  man, but glorious messengers of God, bearing strange news, "Great Pan was
                  dead."
               Venitia wished to go to the Cathedral to visit the tomb of Pergolesi. As we
                  approached the church and saw its
                  massive masonry and Corinthian columns, we remembered that when St. Paul and St.
                  Luke "tarried to rest awhile with the brethren" in the town of Puteoli, this
                  Christian church was then a Roman temple, dedicated to Augustus.
               "Two thousand years nearly have swung around," said Janet, "and that little leaven
                  has worked bravely."
               After visiting the church, we went to the grand ruins of the Temple of Serapis,
                  and looked up at the three mysterious pillars on which Nature has engraved her
                  curious hieroglyphics, telling wondrous tales of age and change. We stepped
                  carefully from stone to stone, and peered down wistfully into the fast-gathering
                  waters which hide from the most searching gaze the once beautiful marble pavements
                  of the temple.
               Luigi explained to us as much as is known of the history of this marvellous ruin.
                  The three columns which are standing were part of a pro-naos, or vestibule, of six columns and two pilasters, which
                  supported a richly sculptured frieze; fragments of the three other superb columns
                  and the frieze lie scattered around. The three which are standing are each forty
                  feet high, and formed of a single piece of cipollino marble. There was a court one
                  hundred and forty feet long, and one hundred and twenty-two feet wide, surrounded
                  by a portico of forty-eight columns; and in the centre of this court stood a
                  circular temple, which had sixteen columns of African marble, that have been taken
                  away and put in the theatre of the Caserta Palace.
               Some suppose it was an Egyptian temple, but the learned disagree about it
                  altogether. It is a grand, solemn mystery, as profound as the strange old faith
                  said to have been celebrated in it. A semicircular niche is shown, where stood the
                  Jupiter Serapis, which is now in the Musée Bourbonique. The many volcanic
                  eruptions, and the various physical changes to which the whole of this portion of
                  the Mysentine promontory has been subjected, at one time caused these ruins to be
                  covered over and forgotten.
               During the earthquakes of 1536-1538, in Don Pedro de Toledo's time, Monte Nuovo, a
                  mountain about a mile from this temple, and four hundred and forty feet above the
                  level of the sea, rose up in three days' time, formed by the accumulated ejections
                  from the earth of red-hot pumice-stones. As the base of this mountain covers about
                  a mile and a half of ground, the whole face of the country in its vicinity was
                  naturally very much altered in making place at such short notice for the strange
                  new-comer. The tradition tells of a village, royal villa, and other buildings
                  being destroyed. At that time, this temple, which is spoken of by writers of the
                  day as "the ruins recently uncovered," was again lost, and remained overgrown with
                  trees and brushwood, forgotten for over two hundred years.
               In 1750, when a palace which had been built for Don Pedro, over two hundred years
                  before, was converted into barracks, the upper part of these fine columns was seen
                  peeping above the ground. Charles III.—Don Carlos, that Bourbon hero—ordered the
                  place to be uncovered. Then this fine temple, adorned with costly marbles, full of
                  broken sculpture, was found. There were marble pavements and mosaic floors, and
                  statues and vases; and also some curious hieroglyphics left by Nature, that
                  silent, mysterious power, which told that this great temple must have known other
                  changes than that of mere earth-burial; for high up on these grand columns, within
                  a third of their summits, were distinct traces of ancient watermarks marks; also little holes, drilled deep
                  in by a species of bivalve sea-shell called lithodornus; and above these busy
                  little traces of ocean labor were marks of the restless, angry beating of
                  sea-waves!
               No wonder the antiquarians and geologists have been at a loss and not known how to
                  find their place in a stone book whose weird leaves tell such contradictory
                  stories.
               I felt very solemn as I wandered through this mysterious old temple, stepping from
                  slab to slab of stone, on the ruined fragments of superb sculpture, across the
                  dull, sluggish sea-stream which is again slowly creeping through it. About thirty
                  years after its last disentombing in 1780, the building was found to be slowly
                  sinking again; and during the last half-century it has sunk two feet; probably in
                  a few hundred years more it will be all gone and forgotten as before.
               From this temple, or Serapeon, as it is also called, we went to the Amphitheatre,
                  which was uncovered in 1838. It was here that Nero entertained Tiridates, King of
                  Armenia, with a bull-fight, and surprised his royal visitor by leaping into the
                  arena himself and killing two bulls with the same javelin. Foolish Nero! To use a
                     mot of Jefferson, he must have had "a canine
                  love of praise."
               We left Pozzuoli and proceeded along one of the Roman roads bordered by tombs.
                  Luigi directed our attention to the marks of the ancient chariot-wheels on the
                  huge blocks of lava with which it is paved. This famous old Vesuvius is looked
                  upon as a fearful destroyer, and so it is, of man and man's labor; but it creates
                  more than it ruins, renders back more than it takes away; and one of its most
                  marvellous creations is this fire-stone, called lava, which has been used for ages
                  in the building of ramparts, great castles, and the paving of roads like these
                  Appian and Flaminian routes, over which myriads of human beings have journeyed for
                  centuries, and yet the huge blocks of stilled fire resist the wear and tear of
                  time and use.
               Yes, centuries and centuries ago this road was journeyed over by great Romans, who
                  came to the Campania on warlike errands; or later, in more luxurious days, to
                  visit their superb villas in this Parthenopian Paradise;—Scipio in his pride and
                  then in his anger, Agrippina in her sorrow, Tiberius in his suffering, and the
                  poor Aphrodite Julia in her fear.
               Along its smooth course also rolled gay chariot-loads of pleasure-seeking people,
                  coming to these luxurious Baths of Baiæ, to lakes covered with rose-leaves, that
                  old Seneca talks of, where bathers floated in the perfumed waters by moonlight to
                  the sound of ravishing music. Stately Roman matrons, with fair, cold brows of
                  Pallas and Diana, but burning hearts of Venus and Psyche, rushed swiftly along in
                  their mad pursuit of pleasure.
               And along this road journeyed also those two travel-worn, unknown Israelites,
                  towards the Capitol of the world, going there to plant an unpretending standard,
                  which should wave through ages of desolation, war, luxury, learning, human craft
                  and cunning, all unchanged,—the standard of the simple fishermen of Galilee,—to
                  which king and kaiser bow.
               It was an hour or two past midday when we reached Baiæ, and we were really hungry
                  and tired, notwithstanding Janet's fine hamper of sandwiches and iced wine, which
                  had been well used during the morning.
               "I sent my Greek here yesterday," said Philip, "with Luigi's Andrea, and the
                  report was anything but favorable as to
                  accommodations; so that huge van which you see unpacking is for us."
               We walked towards one of the ruins of the magnificent ancient Thermæ or Baths. It
                  was the one called the Temple of Mercury; a superb circular hall with vaulted
                  ceiling, and the blue heaven looking down through the ivy-crowned opening in the
                  roof, shedding delicious rays and flecks of tenderness, as the sunlight broke
                  through the delicate maiden-hair fern. Lycopodia and all sorts of bind-weeds,
                  mingled with the fern and ivy, clambered around, set their little frail but
                  firm-toothed roots into the stone, then fell pendant in soft, swaying branches,
                  doing their best to hide and adorn this broken, irregular gap in the ceiling.
               Directly beneath this opening was quite a little garden-wilderness, nourished by
                  the rain and freshened by the sun which came daily streaming down upon it; mesem
                  bryanthemums of vivid purple hue peeped out with their bright yellow eyes among
                  the tangled mass of verdure.
               Upon the ground were spread large carpet-mats, and there were camp-stools and
                  small tables, and, best of all, nice cushioned hammocks. When we expressed our
                  delight and amazement at the sight of all these comforts, Luigi and Philip, to
                  whose gallant thoughtfulness we owed them, looked as happy as boys.
               "Now rest yourselves," said Philip, "while Luigi and I consult with our men about
                  that great business of the day,—dinner."
               Such a merry dinner as we had on the little tables, where each one was served by
                  one's self! And we had a pleasant lounge in the hammocks again, after the
                  luxurious feast was over,—a feast which had all the elegance of a grand dinner,
                  without any tiresome ceremony.
               The gentlemen smoked, and walked in and about the ruins, and talked to us
                  delightfully. Some girls came in with tambourines and danced the Tarantelle, which
                  was as poor as stage finery looks by daylight.
               "We are spoiled by the ballet," said Philip. "These peasant dances, like many fine
                  national melodies, have the rich kernel taken from them when the clever theatrical
                  or operatic artist appropriates them."
               "Are you too tired for a little more sight-seeing?" asked Luigi, as we stood out
                  on the roadside in the after part of the day.
               Not at all. We were all as fresh as larks at sunrise, and quite ready to complete
                  the well-planned excursion. We went to the birdless Lake of Avernus, the Mare
                  Morto, the Elysian Fields, and the cave of the melancholy priestess of
                  Apollo,—Deiphœbe, the Cumœan Sibyl.
               The classical associations connected with the names of these famous old places
                  gave rise to a delightful talk; and Philip's fine rhapsodies were as sparkling as
                  the glowing beads on the golden Capri wine which we had been drinking.
               The Piscina Mirabilis pleased me most of all that sunset sight-seeing. It can
                  scarcely be called a ruin: it is as strong and firm as when the Romans used it as
                  a reservoir for the waters of the Julian aqueduct centuries ago. We descended a
                  flight of forty broad stone steps, then an inclined causeway, which led us to the
                  bottom. There we found an apartment with a vaulted roof of grand masonry,
                  supported by four lines of massive pillars, twelve in a row.
               The whole hall or chamber was lighted by several circular openings in the roof,
                  which, like the irregular ceiling-gap
                  of the Temple of Mercury, were draped with all manner of lichens, ivy, and the
                  soft maiden-hair fern, the loveliest of all the fascinating order of Felices. This
                  clung about every part of the building, and, as the soft west wind of sunset came
                  frolicking in through the ivy-crowned opening in the centre, it would ripple up
                  the delicate, green, toothed leaves, like so many little waves on a streamlet.
                  This fine old relic of the great Roman days is to be found on the summit of a hill
                  between the Bay of Bauli and Mare Morto.
               "Here, Ottilie," said Philip, as we came to some ruins on the Punta di Pennata,
                  "this was the villa of that Roman matron who despised jewels, and considered two
                  unruly boys of more value than precious stones. I remember, when you were a girl,
                  you voted Cornelia, mother of the Gracchi, a woman of poor taste."
               We laughed over the curious betrothal of this great and good daughter of Scipio
                  Africanus. Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, her husband, was originally an enemy of
                  her father; but when the officers were taking L. C. Scipio to prison, and none of
                  the tribunes interfered to protect him, Gracchus said that he did not seek to
                  gain, by any act of his, the favor of the Scipios, but having seen Scipio
                  Africanus leading the kings and generals of enemies to prison, he should never
                  suffer his brother to be led to the same place. This generous and manly conduct
                  had a curious effect on the Senators and Scipio, which effect is an evidence of
                  the primitive, almost child-like state of feeling of the times, and shows also
                  that their hatreds and enmities arose more from jealousy—as do those of children
                  and immature minds—than from principle.
               Some time after, the Senators were supping together at the Capitol, and they
                  unanimously requested Scipio Africanus to give his youngest daughter, Cornelia, to
                  Tiberius Gracchus as wife; Scipio consented, and the contract was made in the
                  presence of the whole assembly. On his return home he told his wife, Emilia, that
                  he had arranged a marriage for her daughter. Madame Scipio did not like his taking
                  such a step without consulting her in the disposal of their common child. In her
                  resentment she said, "Why, even supposing you had given her to Tiberius Gracchus,
                  her mother should not have been kept in ignorance of your intention."
               Scipio showed a wisdom in managing this little domestic tempest which,
                  unfortunately, he did not display when he had to deal with his countrymen; he
                  waived aside all discussion, good-naturedly telling her she had named the very
                  man, and that he was glad her opinion coincided with the Senators and his.
               This young girl was the famous Cornelia, mother of the Gracchi. In her childless
                  old age she bought this villa, and followed her father's example, dying in
                  voluntary exile; but the Romans honored her memory by a statue, bearing the
                  inscription, "To Cornelia, Mother of the Gracchi."
               "This anger of the Scipio family," I remarked, "reminds me of feminine
                  resentments, in which the injured one seeks a revenge which afflicts herself as
                  much, if not more, than it hurts her opponent. Scipio's angry epitaph, depriving
                  his countrymen of his bones, was so like a high-spirited, affectionate woman, who
                  naïvely takes it for granted that her enemy will feel her reproaches as much as
                  she should under similar circumstances; and the eager desire the Romans displayed
                  to honor the family after death as much as they had wronged them in life, gives the whole affair the tone of a
                  sorrowful family quarrel, which is fiercer and bitterer than other disputes,
                  because of the pent-up love which feels itself scorned, and aching hearts stung
                  almost to madness by fancied or real wrongs inflicted by the very beings held
                  dearest and loved most fondly."
               "I fancy," said Janet, "that these Scipios must have been like many other
                  excellent and gifted persons,—too sensitive and difficult in disposition. An
                  enthusiastic restlessness of mind and body enabled them to perform splendid and
                  generous acts, but they exacted from plain, practical, commonplace mortals, with
                  whom they had to live hourly, more capability of appreciation than they possessed;
                  then, like all such exceptional persons, they suffered keenly, and, as they
                  happened to be distinguished, they called on all posterity to sympathize with
                  them, saying, 'Thus did I for my countrymen, and this was my reward!'"
               "Nor was it vanity or self-conceit," observed Philip; "but, as Milman said of
                  Tasso, that deeper pride which makes obligations painful, which cannot submit to
                  injury or insult, which claims and maintains the position to which it thinks
                  itself entitled, and expects that every one else shall render it the same
                  reverence."
               "And yet how deep-rooted was ambition in their hearts," said Luigi; "you remember
                  Cornelia's famous reproach to her sons before they attained their sorrowful
                  distinction, 'Am I to be forever known only as the daughter of Scipio?'"
               "Here, ladies!" cried Philip, "is a tenderer spot, sacred to the memory of—I was
                  going to say sensiblerie, but fear of Ottilie,
                  who may call me cruel, makes me say sentiment."
               We had reached the fine cliff-like promontory of Cape Misenus, the tomb of Æneas's
                  trumpeter, and the spot made famous by the French Corinne. We were disappointed at
                  finding her description of the promontory not correct in one point. Vesuvius
                  cannot be seen from Cape Misenus. "The Gulf of Naples, the islands with which it
                  is sown,"—all this is exact; but neither Vesuvius nor "the country which extends
                  from Naples as far as Gaeta,"*
                   for hills intervene between the sight in the latter; and as to Vesuvius,
                  the mountain sits too far back to be seen, and Punta di Posilippo extends like a
                  screen in front of it.

               After scolding a little about this harmless exaggeration of the gifted
                  Frenchwoman, we took back our fault-finding, and agreed with Luigi, that the poet
                  should not be trammelled by trifles; for, 
                     
                        "as imagination bodies forth
                        The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
                        Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing
                        A local habitation and a name."
                     
                  
               
               Therefore, possessing such marvellous power, it was an easy matter for the
                  Improvisatress to bring Vesuvius forward, when only a few miles of hill and
                  distance hid it.
               We talked of this wonderful woman, of her follies, some of which were the sweetest
                  part of her nature, and of her wisdom, which, like most feminine wisdom, alas! was
                  the most tiresome.
               "'Tout comprendre, serait tout pardonner,'—If we
                  understood everything, we would forgive everything,"—I repeated musingly. "Mme. de
                  Staël should be forgiven a great many of her parrot Schlegelisms, for the
                  numberless loving truths, like this, which she was constantly uttering."
               
               "Then, her devotion," added Janet, "to that lovely creature, Mme. Récamier, was so
                  wise and generous! 'If I could possibly envy one whom I love,' she wrote once to
                  Mme. Récamier, 'I would give willingly all that I am to be you'; and it was not
                  her friend's famous beauty which she thought most of, but 'those moral qualities
                  which seemed to every one as remarkable as her charms.'"*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *Notes to Corinne.
               
               "The experience of poor Mme. de Staël's sorrowful and yet brilliant life," I said,
                  "had doubtless taught her that which I once heard a great poet and good man say he
                  had learned,—to value most those who were more remarkable for qualities of heart
                  than head; and this can be applied particularly to women. As our heart-gifts
                  surpass those of our head, so are we, in proportion, happier and better able to
                  fulfil patiently our duty in life."
               "You did not always think so, Ottilie," remarked Philip, in that provoking way
                  which some men have of tossing up old worn-out opinions, like old slippers, after
                  one.
               "''T is held that sorrow makes us wise,'" was my only reply to him.
               As we walked along the shore, Janet and I talked of the capabilities of feminine
                  minds and the quality of feminine studies.
               "O, women read, they never study!" cried Philip, half jestingly.
               "That is very true, Mr. Edelhertz, about the majority of women, at least," replied
                  Janet, generously; for she has been, and is still, as capable and clever a student
                  as any man. "Our reading, too," she continued, "is rarely for the purpose of
                  acquiring exact knowledge, nor do we show that systematic holding-on to subjects
                  which you men display; for even in your leisure reading you always keep your
                     spécialité in view."
               "Few women have spécialités," I said. "Reading,
                  with us, is often a mere pursuit of food for our imaginations, which are ever
                  rising hungry from the meagre meal that realities make of life's table; many times
                  also it is, as I have heard Philip say cruelly, to soothe our ever-afflicted
                  sensibilities."
               "Then," asked Janet, "when clever women show that fierce book-hunger which they
                  sometimes do, startling men with the quantity of books they are able to read, I
                  suppose they are seizing on reading as a sort of mental or spiritual opium, to
                  give them relief from thought and memory?"
               "Exactly so," I answered; "and this reading very often excites the energies and
                  rouses into action the creative powers. A lot of rubbish is gathered together by
                  us, I admit; but in this rubbish are rough mineral stones, as it were, against
                  whose iron of suggestion the flint of the feminine fancy strikes out a bright
                  spark, which pleases even though it may not enlighten a great deal."
               "Realities make life's table meagre, do they, Ottilie?" asked Philip, in a gentle,
                  kind tone. "But you are right," he continued, without waiting for an answer. "You
                  women endure realities because you are instinctively—nay, divinely—patient; but
                  you have no love or even respect for them. There is one thing, however, which
                  puzzles me in women,—your prejudices and preferences color all things; hence your
                  judgments ought to be imperfect, and yet they are not. Why is this, Mrs. Dale? I
                  ask you instead of Ottilie, because I know her of old; she never gives reasons for her opinions: it is
                  always 'because,' nothing else."
               "It arises from a mysterious power we possess, Mr. Edelhertz," answered Janet,
                  "which eludes all analysis, and which has no name, unless we call it instinct, as
                  Ottilie does; but that is too poor a name, to my thinking, for these divine 
                     'Impulsions, God-supplied,'
                   which are the best gifts of women, and worth all your reason."
               "I call it instinct," I said, "because instinct has a swifter flight than logical
                  reflection. It is, in fact, a sort of unconscious inspiration."
               "Call it, rather, genuine conscience," observed Luigi, "which, according to
                  Goethe, 'knows only feeling and no logic, and goes straightforward to its object,
                  which it tries lovingly to comprehend, and, when comprehended, never lets go
                  again.' This agrees best, I fancy, with your views of your sex."
               "'Prends le premier conseil d'une femme, et non le
                     second,' is a French proverb," remarked Philip: "'Take the first
                  advice of a woman, and not the second.' Trench, in his Lessons in Proverbs, agrees
                  with you, Ottilie, and old Montaigne too. The English Dean calls it moral
                  intuition, and the wise old Frenchman l'esprit
                     primesautier, the reckless, unthinking leap which gains all or none
                  at the first bound."
               "Instinct, conscience, or intuition, whatever it may be called," said Janet, "we
                  women certainly show great cleverness and quickness through its aid, that is, when
                  we act on the first warm impulse; for the French proverb is true,—few women have
                  'sober second thoughts.' We seem to be filled with those perceptions aveugles (blind perceptions), pensées sourdes (deaf thoughts), which Leibnitz nitz speaks of, and
                  compares beautifully to the thousand little noises produced by the shock of a wave
                  on the sea-shore, and which compose, in their whole, the grand diapason of ocean
                  melody."
               "And this melody of the sea, too," I added, "is very like the workings of a
                  woman's mind,—wild, sometimes wayward, confused, and vague, but having a
                  mysterious meaning which attracts forcibly, and is filled with a never-wearying
                  charm."
               The two men looked in silence, and half unconsciously, on the two beautiful women
                  whom they were loving, and I fancied they both agreed with us. A few short weeks
                  ago, Philip would have turned into playful ridicule all this feminine sensiblerie, as he would have called it; but now Love,
                  that divine messenger, who heals all differences between poor blind Adams and
                  Eves, was brooding down over him, and filling his solitary, silent heart with
                  sweet murmurs of hope and happiness.
               At Baiæ we mounted our horses again for the last time, and Janet, Mrs. Folham, and
                  Venetia returned to the barouche. We rode swiftly and silently on; the sweet moon
                  shone down on us, and our horses' hoofs beat a martial measure on the hard
                  lava-paved road; they kept as accurate time as if the dumb beasts, like their
                  riders, had musical ears, and understood all the sweet subtleties of rhythm and
                  accent.
               The air was filled with the odor of orange-blossoms and the grape-flower; the
                  glowing west had grown purple and wine-hued, while a ruddy glow flashed here and
                  there most unaccountably over the heavens; but, as we doubled the point and came
                  out on Posilippo, we discovered the cause of it,—Vesuvius was in flames!
               "An eruption!" cried Philip; "at last, we shall see Vesuvius in its glory."
               
               We had been hoping for this event during all our stay in Naples. There had been
                  every sign of an eruption for months, and now, to our great joy, it had come; for,
                  as it was unaccompanied by any destructive earthquakes, and seemed a peaceable
                  display of the mountain's glorious powers, we felt no compunctions at rejoicing
                  over it. Vesuvius looked grandly, as we rode briskly along the road facing it.
                  Heavy columns of fiery vapor arose, touched on the edges by the moonlight, and
                  streams of fire glided, snake-like, down the mountain-sides.
               There was no terrifying darkness, no fearful explosions, none of the horrible
                  attendants on preceding eruptions. The mountain seemed simply like a huge
                  overflowing vase of fire; a beautiful and glorious spectacle, rather than a thing
                  of terror and ruin; and so unlike the ordinary idea of Vesuvius in action, that we
                  almost forgot its power to do harm. The flames and lava-streams did not pour from
                  the summit, but from the sides. We afterwards learned that new craters have formed
                  around it, and from these came streaming down the fiery rivers; there were two
                  beautiful currents, which we could see, of the most exquisite fire-color, not
                  sulphureous-hued, but mellow and almost rosy.
               After the first expressions of gratification we said little, but looked on the
                  beautiful mountain with indescribable, half-bewildered feelings, such as one has
                  in a vivid dream; it seemed like some scene from a fairy tale of gnomes and
                  mountain spirits,—some gorgeous, impossible vision of childhood, made real and
                  possible.
               Great phenomena of any kind are rarely seen under favorable circumstances; but
                  surely our first sight of Vesuvius in flames could not have been more happily
                  arranged.
            
            
               SKY-ROCKETS.
               LAST evening, being Trinity Sunday and the Queen's birthday, the whole town was
                  superbly illuminated. To form a complete idea of the extent to which town
                  illuminations can be carried, and their frequency, it is necessary to visit
                  Naples. I have never seen so many or such interesting ones as during the few
                  months I have been here. Partial illuminations of some quarter of the town take
                  place several times a week.
               The decoration of buildings for illuminations is quite a lucrative business in
                  Naples, they tell me. On the fête day of a church,—that is, the day devoted to the
                  saint whose name it bears,—its whole front is covered with hastily-erected
                  scaffoldings, and several men can be seen running up and down ladders, from tower
                  to roof, and roof to basement, suspending strings of small parti-colorea glass
                  cups, and arranging them skilfully, so as to form various symbolical figures when
                  lighted; for each cup is half-filled with oil, on which floats a taper. Sometimes
                  the houses and stores on the sides of the open square in front of the church are
                  decorated in a like manner. At nightfall these lamps are lighted and the
                  scaffoldings removed, with a celerity that seems hardly possible. The church
                  facade then looks like a fairy scene, with its twinkling, sparkling, brilliant-hued letters and
                  devices, and as they begin to pale and drop out, one by one, the attention of the
                  crowd is attracted by the firing-off of petards and the sending up of remarkably
                  fine fireworks. The pyrotechnical displays in Naples seem inexhaustible: there is
                  one called the Girandola, which is remarkably beautiful; it is formed by a
                  simultaneous discharge of numberless rockets, that fall back from a centre as they
                  explode, looking like fiery petals of a gigantic lily-cup or bell.
               After twilight this evening, while we were sitting on the terrace, looking at
                  Vesuvius and watching the gradual brightening of the town, Luigi and Philip came
                  in to propose a drive through the streets, to see the different illuminations and
                  fireworks, and the equally fiery crowd. Janet, Venitia, Philip, and I went in the
                  coach, Luigi on horseback.
               We first drove to the Largo di Palazzo Reale, to see the illumination of the Royal
                  Palace, and the grand sight presented by San Francesco di Paula, which is
                  opposite. The magnificent dome of this fine church was outlined against the
                  glowing sky by glittering gas-jets, whose tingling, tongue-like flames seemed like
                  living things, as they mounted from the base of the dome to its apex, on which
                  blazed a superb cross of fire.
               After we have seen a moderate amount of wonders, we become very unreasonable;
                  instead of being satisfied with our pleasure, we grow exacting, and ask not only
                  for more, but for something greater.
               To that dome and cross, whose graceful outlines trembled on the heavens and looked
                  as if springing from the clouds themselves, and not belonging to anything on
                  earth, we dared to suggest the addition of a new beauty.
               "Instead of that simple cross-form," said our poet Philip, "it should have been
                  like Constantine's visionary one, of which Eusebius tells us. Think how superb
                  would have been the effect, to have seen palpitating in that gas-flame a cross,
                  with the Greek characters, ΕΝ ΤΟΥΤΩ ΝΙΚΑ,
                  'Conquer through this.'"
               "O," cried Janet, deprecatingly, "how can you trouble the beautiful thing by
                  wishing for something beyond it? Surely, it is lovely enough to satisfy a poet's
                  imaginings. Look at those porticos and that vestibule."
               This church, San Francesco di Paula, has two semicircular porticos at right and
                  left, supported by forty-four columns, and in front of the church itself is a
                  vestibule with ten fine Ionic columns. These were all lighted by concealed
                  gas-jets, and, as Janet spoke, a fresh head of gas was turned on, which glowed
                  first at the base of the church and then mounted up to the summit, making these
                  porticos look like enchanted aisles leading to some angelic cathedral.
               "Do you remember," asked Philip, as we were noticing the resemblance of this
                  church to the Pantheon, "what Stendhal said of it, when it was building, in 1816?
                  Bianchi showed him the plan, and Stendhal wrote, 'Bianchi has adopted the circular
                  form, which is a proof he appreciates the antique; but he has not remembered that
                  the ancients proposed a very different end from ours in their temples. The
                  religion of the Greeks was a festival, not a menace. The temple under the
                  beautiful heavens was only a theatre of sacrifice, not immolation. Instead of
                  kneeling, of prostrating one's self, and striking the breast, they executed in it
                  sacred and beautiful dances. Shall our artists ever be able to read with their
                  souls? Those of the present day seem unable to raise themselves to a comprehension that the ancients did nothing
                  for mere ornament; the beautiful, with them, was only the natural growth of the
                  useful.' But I do not see," continued Philip, "how Stendhal could have been long
                  in Naples without discovering that this Catholic religion is a great deal like
                  that of the old Greeks,—a festival of the gayest kind."
               "The Neapolitans are neither Catholics nor Pagans," I remarked; "they are simply
                  image-worshippers. But what higher religious form can be looked for in a populace
                  so mobile, wayward, and, above all, joy-seeking? Of course, their religion must
                  take the gay color of their pleasure-loving dispositions. Wait until these people,
                  by some one of those great world-miracles, which take place every age or two, are
                  changed into more thinking, intelligent beings, not needing visible signs like St.
                  Thomas; then they can be St. Johns and St. Pauls."
               "Yes," said Janet, "I do not think Protestants give enough weight, particularly in
                  religion, to the needs of peculiar organizations, as well as influences of
                  climate. Here in Naples the national appetite is for show, éclat, and bustle, not for quiet reason and calm thought. The people
                  are quick at, and eager for, receiving impressions; but there must be new dies
                  ready, as the burning lava of feeling and emotion is ever flowing. Their love of a
                  sensation is a positive, passionate need, which, if not gratified, becomes as
                  fierce as unsatisfied hunger. During this present visit of mine to Naples, while
                  looking at the childlike throngs gazing at the spectacles in churches, or the
                  throbbing, eager crowd in the streets, making up the religious processions, or
                  kneeling devoutly as the sacred Host passes, I have repeatedly thought what
                  fearful savages these people would be, without the help and control of this
                  beautiful, tangible form of their faith. This grand old Catholic Church is very
                  wise; it possesses the collected wisdom of experience, and knows best how to
                  govern these people, who, as Ottilie says, are the St. Thomases of the Christian
                  world, and must be treated as gently as he was. Even such unbelievers as
                  Machiavelli and Voltaire admitted the wisdom of these gay theatrical devotions,
                  and thought they prevented public misfortunes."
               "What a true woman's use of an authority!" exclaimed Philip; "I am not surprised,
                  however, at your employing such weapons, for your own religious views, as a
                  Unitarian, are very free; but it is droll to hear Ottilie innocently wielding
                  Voltairian infidel supports."
               Janet seemed to feel that the conversation had gone a little too far, for she
                  answered in a courteous, but rather cold and serious manner.
               "You are disposed, Mr. Edelhertz, like many other formalists in religion, to
                  regard persons holding what you call Unitarian views as unbelievers, if not
                  heathen, because we do not subscribe to your Thirty-nine Articles, or your partial
                  acceptances of old Catholic mysteries, such as the Trinity, and the like; and,
                  indeed, it is not easy for us to comprehend each other, I fancy, for not only good
                  breeding, but the dignified reticence of true pious feeling, confines the whole
                  matter to a holier communion than differing mortals can hold with each other, to a
                  commerce with their own consciences and God, in solitude."
               "What is the subject of conversation?" asked Luigi, who, to my great relief, just
                  then came riding up; he had left us a little while before to learn the cause of
                  the shouting in the neighborhood of the Arsenal, and to see if it was practicable
                  for our carriage to drive there.
               
               "O, Mr. Luigi," answered Venitia, playfully, "they are talking like philosophers,
                  who, you know, grow always unphilosophical whenever they enter into argument."
               "No, no," interrupted Janet, with a sweet, good-natured smile, "we are not
                  pretending to be philosophers even; we have simply been treading, as De Quincey
                  finely says, 'that interspace between religion and philosophy which connects them
                  both,' and which is neutral ground."
               "But, like all neutral ground," said Venitia, slyly, "in warring seasons it is a
                  dangerous one, for it can be converted into a champ
                     clos on the slightest provocation, as I can testify."
               A fresh shout from the distant crowd interrupted the talk effectually, and Luigi
                  reported the cause of the noise. Some fine illuminations were being lighted up and
                  superb fireworks preparing at the Arsenal. Before driving thither, we remained a
                  few minutes looking at the picturesque scene which the street presented, and which
                  within the past fifteen minutes had arrived at its full height of interest. Words
                  can hardly describe it. The finely decorated stores on either side of the Toledo
                  were in a blaze, but the most attractive sight was the centre of the street and
                  the square.
               Buying and selling, cooking and eating, were going on briskly. The perambulating
                  orange-cars, and sherbet or ice-water temples, adorned with rude pictures of holy
                  subjects, looking indeed very Byzantine and pre-Raphael, as Philip said, stood
                  everywhere. These gay little booths on wheels were lighted up as fantastically as
                  the houses; branches of the golden broom waved around them, nodding like feathery
                  plumes; huge bouquets of what we call "hothouse flowers" glowed on their counters;
                  and graceful, fragrant garlands were festooned tastefully around them.
               On the sidewalks and corners of the square were literally hillocks of fruit,—for
                  it is now the high harvest season; there were melting apricots, fresh, milky
                  almonds, and huge, luscious Anana strawberries, looking as if carved out of pink
                  coral. Old women sat by their braziers, over whose glowing coals they roasted
                  sweet-smelling nuts, and brightened their fire by waving briskly, to and fro, reed
                  fans; bellows, to be sure, would have been more effectual, but not half so
                  picturesque; and it seems as if these people were just made for living pictures,
                  to gladden the eye with fast-resolving forms and shapes, and keep throbbing for
                  the artist, in this prosaic world, the warm pulse of Nature's beauty.
               Little iron furnaces sparkled and blazed under huge boilers, and in these seething
                  caldrons bubbled up mealy, bursting potatoes and yellow maccaroni; even
                  fish-frying was going on; and almost every domestic and private occupation, as
                  well as public, was there represented in a great square, in front of a royal
                  palace, and at the foot of one of the gayest streets in Europe, while the
                  screaming, roaring population poured down from the various stradas and vicos,—as
                  the large and small streets are called,—and up and down the Toledo, like a hot
                  lava flood, seeming as if it would demolish everything before it; a true Vesuvian
                  current, with a human voice, which swayed and surged in almost bewildering
                  confusion.
               We turned at last and left the Largo di Palazzo Reale. Luigi directed the driver
                  to draw the carriage up first on the Santa Lucia square, a position which gave us
                  a fine view of the city in outline, and also of the bay and mountain. The gray
                  phantom which always rises from 
                     
                        "Vesuvius' misty brim,
                        With outstretched hands,
                        O' erlooking the volcanic lands,"
                     
                  
                   was no longer visible. The whole
                  summit of the volcano was enveloped in a rosy vapor, as with a mantle; and down
                  the side towards Naples coursed two grand lava-streams, from which arose clouds as
                  golden and ruddy as those preceding a mountain sunrise. Dante's 
                     "Il tremolar della marina"
                   insensibly rose to the lips as we noticed the sparkling, trembling waters of
                  the Crater Bay, that reflected the volcano's light, as the day-dawn was reflected
                  from the mountains in Purgatory "on the ocean stream." Numberless little boats
                  with winglike sails, or plashing oars, passed to and fro, from which arose
                  snatches of song or the twang of a stringed instrument, just caught, and then lost
                  in the thunderous roar of the passing multitude, who were divided, in their
                  exultation and enjoyment, between God's and man's illumination.
               After a few minutes given to this Santa-Lucia view, we drove around the Arsenal,
                  to see the superb fireworks there. Even Vesuvius's grandeur could not pale them.
                  Fountains and waterfalls of fire poured out their blazing flood; girandolas spread
                  out their fiery lily-cups; and all the various pyrotechnic forms soared off on the
                  volcanic air, as if their compounds rejoiced to be released from the bonds in
                  which man had held them, and were dancing merry, exultant rounds, like so many
                  Ariels, as they joined their brother-spirits of the mountain.
               After looking until dazzled and deafened, we turned the horses' heads homewards.
                  As we came around the Chiatamone, and across the Vittoria, to the stately palatial
                  Chiaja, the Church of San Pasquale burst out upon us in a fine blaze of decorative
                  light; a brilliant St. Catharine's wheel spun around, and little rosy crosses and
                  stars and arrows of fire darted to and fro,
                     
                        "Before you could say 'Come' and 'Go,'
                        And breathe twice and cry 'So, so';
                        Each one tripping on his toe,
                        Were all there with mop and mowe."
                     
                  
               
               Luigi proposed we should go up into the drawing-room of his apartments, which are
                  in the Palazzo, opposite the church, the side-windows of which look out on the San
                  Pasquale square. We did so, and sat for some time enjoying this agreeable end of
                  the brilliant spectacle. After a while Philip drew me away from the window, to
                  show me Luigi's handsomely arranged bachelor apartments.
               First, there are two pleasant ante-rooms, floored with deep-blue and white tiles,
                  which made me feel as if I were walking on a great-grandmother's India dinner-set.
                  These two rooms are furnished with tall, beautifully carved cabinets, and fine
                  plaster copies of some of the master-pieces of sculpture in the Musée Bourbonique.
                  From them we pass through richly draped doors into a handsome drawing-room which
                  has two fronts, one on San Pasquale and one on the broad Chiaja. The furniture of
                  this drawing-room is simple and elegant, like the man himself, in its perfect,
                  quiet taste. Exquisite bronzes, whose subjects lead you, as through pleasant
                  corridors, to memories of some of the finest galleries of Europe; two or three
                  lovely bits of sculpture, each one telling its own classic birth in forms of
                  divine beauty; some rare vases; a few fine copies of famous old paintings, and one
                  or two undoubted originals; nothing ostentatious, nothing for display, but all
                  governed by that exact taste which is so near akin to genius as to be almost
                  identical with it.
               To the west of the drawing-room is the library, whose windows also look down on
                  the Chiaja and over on the beautiful Villa Reale, with the sea and purple Capri in
                  the distance. This room is a place for sweet, calm thoughts, such as the owner must often have. He has
                  had it decorated in the Pompeian style. The book-shelves run around the room,
                  within a foot or two of the ceiling, separated at certain distances by airy
                  columns; and the spaces between these columns, in which the books are placed, are
                  hung with rich-hued tapestry, which falls from the finely-decorated frieze or
                  cornice to the polished, in-laid floor. The light ornaments of the fretted
                  ceiling, and the refined arabesque forms on the broad cornice and tapestry, give
                  the room a graceful and cheerful appearance.
               There is something peculiarly attractive in these Pompeian wall-decorations,
                  especially under the bright skies of Italy, whose genial climate treats fresco and
                  stucco decorations kindly. The forms, too, are so pleasing,—slender, straight
                  lines, squares, right angles, and exact semicircles, adorned with exquisite
                  garlands, graceful pendent baskets, and twining, climbing vines. These are all
                  painted in bright, positive flat tints; but the extreme delicacy of the figures
                  keeps the coloring from discord and tawdriness.
               On top of the library cornice or frieze are beautiful vases, alternating with
                  airy, winged figures; among these last I noticed the lovely Isis, and the floating
                  figure of Fortune, just poised tiptoe on her globe, ready for a flight.
               "Is not all this charming?" asked Philip, as he rolled a delightful easy-chair
                  towards me, and placed under my feet a gorgeously embroidered Persian cushion;
                  then commenced showing to me his favorites among the treasures of this pleasant
                  retreat. Among other curiosities were some very fine pipes, one a gift from
                  Philip, a superb chibouk, of black amber encrusted with diamonds.
               But the books gave us both the greatest satisfaction. Luigi is the lucky owner of
                  many curious and rare editions; he has an Aldine Odyssey, a Guntt Iliad, and an
                  Elzevir Virgil with a margin of five inches, over which Philip's eyes looked notes
                  of admiration of the largest size and greatest number.
               "See this, Ottilie," he cried. "Here is an Elzevir New Testament, translated by
                  the Port-Royalists, of which Jules Janin says so drolly, 'If you find this book in
                  a good state, and have not money enough to buy it, go immediately to the
                  pawnbroker, and pawn your watch or your gun, or anything that is yours, and buy
                  this book; then sit down with satisfaction over it, feeling sure of having secured
                  a good bargain.'"
               He showed me some other Port Royalist books, and made me observe their covers.
                  Great ascetics as were the Port-Royalists, they were very nice about their books.
                  They had a binding made expressly for themselves, which is still known by the name
                  of Jansenist binding.
               While we were looking at the books, Janet, Venitia, and Luigi joined us. Luigi
                  left Philip to do the honors of the library to Janet and me, and took Venitia to a
                  book-stand on which were placed some fine illustrated folios on Architecture,
                  Sculpture, and the various European galleries. They grew so interested over the
                  prints, that they seemed hardly conscious of our presence; and yet I slyly noticed
                  that they said little to each other,—they were too quietly happy to talk.
               I leaned back in the easy-chair, half-listening to Janet's and Philip's
                  intelligent talk over the books, but at the same time imagining I could read that
                  sweeter, unspoken lore contained in the hearts of the two half-conscious lovers. I
                  felt sure that a strange, sweet feeling was welling up in both.
               
               Venitia seemed lapped in a soft, luxurious dream, doubtless caused by finding
                  herself suddenly lifted into the very atmosphere of Luigi's daily, hourly life. It
                  was a delicious mystery being unveiled to her. That subtle Frenchman who took
                  women's hearts and clove them "deep down the middle," said very truly, "It is so
                  sweet for women to know where and how those live who are dear to them."
               To Luigi it was the simple but exquisite pleasure of having Venitia in his own
                  home; it was a delicate sense of possession, as it were, which, though it could
                  only last a brief season, still for that period it was real. This feeling showed
                  itself in an expression which, though quiet, was exultant. As I looked at his fine
                  face, lighted up with this happiness, I wished to whisper to Philip, 
                     
                        "Open the temple gates unto my love,
                        Open them wide, that she may enter in;
                        And all the posts adorn as doth behove,
                        And all the pillars deck with garlands trim."
                     
                  
               
               Then I looked at Philip, and thought how different it was with him. He was talking
                  earnestly with Janet, displaying all his fine powers of courteous argument, which
                  he loves to do with her. He has a great respect for her almost masculine
                  intellect, and an admiration for her lovely character and high-bred manners.
                  Sometimes they have rather severe passes, arising from his forgetfulness for an
                  instant of her superior abilities, and his treating her, as men always do women,
                  when arguing with them, as a child or inferior, who must be tenderly borne with
                  for its sweet ignorance' sake; but she soon brings him to a consciousness that he
                  is measuring swords with an equal, and he likes her all the better for it.
               I watched his animated countenance, full of life and energy; and, I thought, he
                  has no sweet dreams to preoccupy him, to make him gentle and at peace with all
                  humanity; for love acts thus upon cultured, superior natures. Infatuated as Philip
                  is with the young English girl, the feeling has not yet taken deep enough root to
                  yield him the sweet fruit of joy and rest. There is some of the dull pain of
                  sorrow left rankling in his heart, just enough to give him a little goading sting;
                  for, upon bounding dispositions like his, which cannot be stilled by any power but
                  that called death, sorrow acts as a sort of mental intoxication, producing a
                  reckless, frolicsome state of feeling, which partially, but only for a brief
                  moment, deadens the anguish of 
                     "That old wound ever aching."
                  
               
               De Quincey said he "made of grief a fiery chariot, for mounting above the causes
                  of grief." Philip uses his as a bounding bark on a fast-running sea, under a head
                  wind; or, as if mounted on Arcite's horse, 
                     
                        "Who'd make his length a mile, if 't pleased his rider
                        Put pride in him."*
                           
                        
                     
                   And he does "put pride in" his, galloping bravely above his "causes of
                  grief."
               
                  
                  *Fletcher's Two Noble Kinsmen.
               
               After a while we were all brought to one common level, where love and divine
                  philosophy were merged in the enjoyment of more material pleasures. A delightful
                  fruit supper, with ices and wines, was brought in, and served on Sevres dishes,
                  whose pink hue was as delicate as the Mediterranean conch-shell, and whose
                  Etruscan forms were quite in keeping with the frescoes of the room. We drank each
                  other's health in a parting glassful of the luscious Capri wine, which rested on
                  the tongue and in the throat with a
                  fragrant, fruity taste; and as I held up the delicate-shaped, amber-colored
                  Bohemian goblet to the light, I thought how like molten gold the two mellow hues
                  united looked.
               "Near midnight, on one side or the other it matters little which, does it,
                  Ottilie?" said Philip, gayly, as he wrapped around me the pretty Arabian mantle he
                  brought me from the East, whose rich goat's-hair fringe looks like the foam on
                  cream, it is such a golden white.
               We walked slowly along the broad Chiaja, for we had dismissed the coach on going
                  into Luigi's. The clear, beautiful light of the young moon poured down a generous
                  flood over the lava-paved streets, the high white palaces and thick foliage of the
                  trees in the Villa Reale. The crowd had all left that courtly, stately part of the
                  town; but every little while a chance petard could be heard, or a whiz of a
                  sky-rocket, from the more densely-populated part of the city, and a distant murmur
                  arose thence; but the whole affair looked like a public garden towards daybreak,
                  after a fête, very shabby and dilapidated. God's illumination, however, continued
                  on, as fresh as at the beginning; the blazing lava streamed down the mountain's
                  side unceasingly, and the glorious, fiery vapor rose up and curled superbly and
                  slowly about the heavens, spreading itself everywhere, as if conscious of its
                  inexhaustible powers.
               Venitia, Janet, and Luigi walked together; Philip and I. We did not feel like
                  talking, although Luigi tried to by snatches; but Philip remained silent, wrapped
                  in his own meditations, yielding to the sweet influences of the night, and some
                  graceful poetic thought, which, as a chaste young Muse, was wooing him on with
                  pretty coquetry and tender waywardness.
            
            
               MALEBOLGE.
               A LARGE party of us yesterday ascended Vesuvius. We proposed going last Monday,
                  but have been waiting for Luigi, who has been really ill since Trinity Sunday
                  evening. Indeed, he is far from well now, and quite unlike himself in manner; so
                  absent and preoccupied, that even he notices it, for he tries to recover his old
                  self-possession, and in the attempt becomes unnatural and almost brusque. This
                  afternoon when he joined us he seemed so ill at ease that I advised him to stay at
                  home. But in a well-bred way, without any disagreeable words, he made me
                  understand that he did not like my counsel, and appeared annoyed at the notice I
                  took of him. I said no more, and felt relieved when I remembered that I was to go
                  with the Rochesters, and not in our coach, where the constant sight of his altered
                  countenance would cause me pain and anxiety.
               I managed with all the adroitness I possess to have Philip go with Mrs. Folham and
                  Florence. I found they expected to ask the handsome young Milnes, a nephew of Mrs.
                  Folham, to serve as their attendant; but as he is one of the officers aboard the
                  English royal navy ship which is anchored in the harbor, there was a little doubt
                  about his obtaining a long enough leave of absence. Immediately mediately I suggested to Philip that it would be
                  much better for him to take charge of them, as, even supposing Milnes should be
                  able to go, he was too young to have the entire care of both ladies: then, as I
                  was to join the Rochesters in any arrangement, we could have two pleasant carriage
                  loads, independent of the Minister's coaches.
               I could hardly refrain from smiling while I was making this remark to Philip, he
                  looked so intensely gratified at being able to arrange the party to please me, as
                  he said; and he set about it with angelic alacrity, getting rid thereby of a grand
                  attack of the blues, which have been tormenting him for some days.
               Philip possesses all the sterling points and special developments which
                  characterize the artist; and these make of him the most charming or the most
                  disagreeable companion, the happiest or the most unhappy of men, just his
                  capricious humors direct. But it is good policy to make such persons happy, they
                  are such delightful companions when they are in good spirits.
               There are two grand high-roads, however, which women possess, if they only knew
                  it, to the pleasant heights of every man's good humor and tenderness:—one, through
                  the sweet path of his affections, which youth and beauty tread so naturally; the
                  other, by making him feel comfortable in his surroundings. By the first, his heart
                  is oftenest captivated; by the last practical, material one,—alas for
                  sentiment!—the masculine citadel is held most securely.
               
                  Mais revenons a nos moutons in the shape of a
                  burning mountain. Dr. L——, the famous encyclopedist, whom I met the other evening
                  at Mr. Rochester's, told me that this eruption is one of the most remarkable
                  eruptions that have taken place in the mountain during the seventeen hundred and
                  seventy-eight years it has been known as an actual volcano.
               I have never felt until now any desire to ascend Vesuvius; and during my visit at
                  Naples I have often quoted the droll, original remark of Goethe's artist-friend,
                  Tischbein: "Such a frightful and shapeless conglomeration of matter, which,
                  moreover, is continually preying on itself, and proclaiming war against every idea
                  of the beautiful, is utterly abominable."
               Vesuvius is a marvellous sight, however, to look at from a distance, and adds a
                  valuable feature to this peculiar landscape,—a landscape which is so widely
                  different from any I have ever seen,—Elysium and Tartarus. Instead of calling the
                  mountain a great altar, I feel much more like using the German artist's words,
                  when I look at it, "This peak of Hell thus rearing itself in the middle of
                  Paradise!"
               But the present eruption gives the mountain a certain beauty; it has taken a
                  voice, and shows forked, fiery tongues; therefore it is less terrible to me than
                  when that fearful phantom-like cloud hung over its head, pressing down upon it the
                  dread weight of silence, an appalling silence, like some indistinct approaching
                  sorrows. For some time past the mountain has been showing symptoms of returning
                  animation; the earth has been shaken, the springs of water dried up, and various
                  other threatening signs of impending trouble and destruction have been given.
               There is a curious volcanic group collected around this Crater Bay, as Strabo
                  calls the lovely Bay of Naples; consisting of Ischia, Procida, the Solfatara,
                  Monte Nuovo, and Vesuvius. In the centre of them lies the Aphrodite Naples on
                     this
                  
                     "Vesuvian bay's deep breast,"
                   which, like another Adonis, is forever fleeing from her. The subtle,
                  dangerous volcanic fluid creeps beneath and around the city unheeded; and in some
                  places, as in the Solfatara, the fiery vapor rises, like Hamlet's dead father,
                  mysterious and ghostlike, out of the apparently solid ground. The ancients
                  believed the whole of this country was subterraneously connected with the Sicilian
                  volcanoes.
               In speaking of Pindar's myth concerning Typhon, "upon whose shaggy breast the
                  sea-girt shores beyond Cumæ and Sicily press," Strabo says: "Pindar throws more
                  credibility into the myth, by making it conformable to the actual phenomena; for
                  the whole strait from Cumæ to Sicily is subigneous, and below the sea has certain
                  galleries, which form a communication between the volcanoes of the island and
                  those of the mainland."
               The only active crater among the Neapolitan group, during the last three hundred
                  years, has been Vesuvius; but, like the others, it was at one time extinct, and
                  only in legend, scarcely in memory, did its volcanic history remain.
               Before the time of Titus there rested on its hot bosom, nearly to the top of its
                  crater summit, peaceful, cultivated fields, such as can be seen to-day on Monte
                  Nuova. Strabo, in his description of the Campania, speaks of Mount Vesuvius as
                  being covered with beautiful fields, except on its summit, which he says looks as
                  if it had been some time subjected to the action of fire, and that it might be
                  inferred that the place was formerly in a burning state, with live craters.
               Every lover of Plutarch will remember reading in the life of Marcus Crassus—the
                  grandson of that solemn old Roman who was never known to laugh—the account of
                  Spartacus and his band, and their use of this Vesuvian crater. Its now "misty
                  brim" was then made up of rough and slippery precipices, covered with wild vines,
                  the stems and branches of which were of old enough growth to support the swaying,
                  heavy bodies of those athletic Thracian shepherd gladiators, as they swung
                  stealthily down to the sloping grass-covered bottom of the crater. And this feat
                  of those "forty thousand huge barbarians" took place nearly a century before the
                  birth of our blessed Lord.
               In the present eruption, four new craters have formed along the sides of the
                  mountain, some distance below the cone; and from these openings great streams of
                  lava course down. Two are on the side towards Naples.
               The eruptions heretofore have always proceeded from the summit; and it is feared
                  that this new development may cause a great change in the form of Vesuvius, which
                  would be a great pity, for no one would like to see this most prominent feature of
                  the Bay of Naples altered in one jot or tittle. The eruption of 79 A. D.,—the one
                  that destroyed Herculaneum and Pompeii,—made enough change in the form of this
                  mountain, for it had then a great part of its grandeur of outline torn away.
               Vesuvius must have loomed out finely before that eruption. All the semicircular
                  mountain which lies around the north and east, called Monte Somma, was
                  incorporated with it; and there are several points of view, especially at the
                  Amphitheatre of Pompeii, from whence can be formed some idea how it might then
                  have looked. It is easy to fancy the immense crater it formed; and the sight of
                  the first gigantic fire lighted upon its summit, by unseen hands as it were, must
                  have been glorious. Such an immense burning mountain!—a Titanic altar reared almost to the skies!—Jupiter Summus
                  burning incense to the New Revelation!
               During our drive yesterday, we talked over this past history of the volcano, each
                  one contributing his or her little information to the conversation. We found the
                  road thronged with persons of every rank and condition. Some frightened peasants,
                  whose little homes lay alarmingly near the lava streams, were hurrying in to
                  Naples with all their earthly goods on their backs or on their mules; other
                  country persons, with some of the idle population of Naples, were following a
                  grand religious procession, which was directly in front of our carriages, headed
                  by the patron saint of Naples, San Januarius. The fine life-size silver bust—the
                  same one we saw so superbly adorned with precious gems on the great festival day
                  of the Liquefaction at Santa Chiara—was carried aloft by tall stalwart men, under
                  a crimson canopy, whose gold cords and tassels swung and glittered finely in the
                  sunlight. Around and behind us were equipages of princes, nobles, and commoners,
                  mingled without difference together.
               It proved a lucky chance for us that we were directly behind the procession, for a
                  path was thus opened, which would otherwise have been entirely blocked up by the
                  immense crowd, which swayed to and fro like waves under contrary winds,—a
                  Neapolitan crowd too, that never budges but for a procession and a saint.
               As we wound slowly up the mountain road, the view grew more glorious in beauty.
                  The sun was setting; the surface of the bay sparkled brilliantly; the beautiful
                  city rose gracefully up out of the swelling waters, and her Sorrentine and
                  Mysentine promontories stretched out like graceful arms embracing the eager but
                  fast-fleeing sea. The volcanic islands Capri, Ischia, and Procida were bathed in
                  the golden purple of the sunlight; and, far off in the distance, spurs of the
                  Apennines stretched along the dazzling west, whose summits glowed as with living
                  fire; while level clouds were spread on the brilliant horizon, looking like
                  heavenly floors for angels, such as can be seen in the works of the early
                  painters.
               The rose and the golden struggled together in the atmosphere. All the local colors
                  of vegetation seemed to have disappeared. In some places the ruddy hue prevailed,
                  making crimson the paler greens; while mingling with every shade was a sparkle
                  like delicate golden dust. A landscape painter might have studied there curious
                  effects produced by the light on the various tints of the scenery; but to have
                  given the truthful tone, it would have been necessary for the artist to use gold
                  itself for the highest lights, as did those old painters, Perugino and others, who
                  sometimes gilded their distant trees, and the glorified threads of hair in their
                  saints and singularly lovely Madonnas.
               It was a glorious piece of harmony, like some of Beethoven's instrumentation or
                  Chopin's mysterious melodic weavings. We were on a sufficiently high elevation to
                  see the extent of Nature's marvellous power. The range of a magnificent orchestra
                  of color was attained. There was the rich hue of the setting sun on one side, and
                  the mellow light of Vesuvius on the other. Every variety of cloud was spread over
                  the sky, from the level ones of the horizon to the dropping flaky bits near the
                  zenith, that melted off and were "gathered up like young souls into heaven." The
                  upper strata of clouds had a different tone from the lower, yet they all blended
                  in perfect harmony, and seemed like many "golden aisles penetrating through angelic chapels to the Shekinah
                  of the blue."
               Even now as I write these words, striving to weave together, as in the sacred
                  chord, the names of colors, in order to paint in language, as it were, my memory
                  of this sunset, the whole rises up in that mysterious chamber of the mind called
                  imagination, which is "tessellated with floating fancies of the blue shadow and
                  burning gold," and 
                     
                        "With dreamful eyes,
                        My spirit lies,
                        Under the walls of Paradise."
                     
                   But to feel the full meaning of these faint words, one must have seen such a
                  sunset, on such a night, from the side of this famous old altar mountain, on the
                  lovely shores of the Vesuvian Bay.
               About nightfall we reached the Hermitage, where we supped; then proceeded with
                  guides, torches, and our own servants up the mountain footpaths, in order to
                  approach as near the lava streams and craters as was prudent. The stream of lava
                  that is now coursing through the Atrio del Cavallo—the valley or gorge that lies
                  between Monte Somma and Vesuvius—is the larger of the two which flow down the
                  south side of the mountain. This stream is fed by an immense crater on the
                  northeast. Of course this fiery spring was worth seeing; but we had to mount some
                  eminence, from the top of which we could look over into the crater, and this was
                  no easy task.
               The only available heights were heaps or hillocks of old lava, standing on the
                  edge of the crater, and through the bases of which the treacherous flood was
                  beginning to creep. Notwithstanding this, we selected one which looked blacker and
                  therefore safer than the others, and commenced the scramble up.
               The surface of the lava hillock was almost as hot and steaming as a covering of
                  wet ashes spread over a coal fire. At every step the lava gave way and crumbled
                  under us, scorching our boots and crisping our gloves; for we had to clamber up on
                  all fours, each one for himself or herself. At last, breathless and trembling, we
                  reached the summit, which we found harder and cooler for our feet than the sides
                  had been, and the view it commanded well repaid us for the labor.
               We leaned over and looked down into the crater beneath, whose red-hot fluid came
                  pouring out of the mountain's side like molten iron in a huge puddling furnace: 
                     
                        "So fell the eternal fiery flood, wherewith
                        The marl glowed underneath."
                     
                  
               
               It was a veritable lake or gulf of fire, and vividly recalled Dante's fearful
                  descriptions in the Inferno of the horrible gulfs in
                  the Eighth Circle. While I was looking earnestly and in silence down into the
                  crater, Janet, who was near by, asked me in a low voice if I felt like leaping
                  over.
               "I never stand on the brinks of precipices or great heights," I replied, "without
                  recalling a constant dream possession or power I have,—flying. In my dreams,—and I
                  never sleep without dreaming,—I do not seem to be walking, but always balancing in
                  the air pleasantly, or soaring off gloriously, and so strong is the impression it
                  leaves upon me, that sometimes in my waking moments I almost fancy I possess this
                  impossible power."
               "Well, my dear Ottilie, there is one thing certain, if you feel disposed to try
                  your dream-wings in this place, it would not be many moments before you would
                     know the great secret. All our
                  mysterious life-problems, my friend, would be quickly resolved for you, and the
                  'distorted wills' that give so much trouble here on earth would soon be made
                  wondrous straight after such a leap."
               We were surrounded by a crowd, for we had found that little hillock swarming with
                  human beings as venturous as ourselves; therefore we had to talk almost in a
                  whisper. After a few half-playful, half-serious remarks, we concluded wisely not
                  to leap over, but to stay and enjoy the gradual severing of life's hard knots, and
                  the curious beautiful straightening of crooked human designs, which are sure to be
                  made all in good time by God's own handiwork; for had not Janet, at least, seen
                  these marvellous things down in her own past? This subject ended, I quoted, in
                  halting lines, passages from Dante, of the place 
                     
                        "within the depth of Hell
                        Called Malebolge";
                     
                   and as the flames of the fresh lava glided slowly up and around huge bits of
                  stone or "glowing marl,"—the oily character of the fluid showing itself
                  everywhere,—we imagined the flaming feet of the poor wretches the Italian poet
                  described as plunged headforemost into those fearful gulfs of fire.
               The night was comparatively dark, for the moon had not yet risen. The whole
                  mountain was alive with people, who were scattered over its sides. In every
                  direction we could see the torchlights of different parties, but not the people
                  themselves, and once in a while, in order to make a torch burn brighter, a guide
                  would knock its end on the ground or against a stone, sending out myriads of
                  sparks.
               I looked up to the quiet star-lit sky, and then down the mountain-side on these
                  thousands of torchlights. It seemed like a vast ocean lying beneath my feet,
                  reflecting on its throbbing bosom the stars above, while around me rose up, in the
                  place of ocean roar and rushing wave sweep, the hum of human voices and the
                  muffled crackle of the lava flood.
               We stayed on our perilous height as long as we dared. It was only when we saw
                  through its fissures the red fire sparkle, felt the heat through our heavy-soled
                  boots, and were assured by the timid Neapolitan guides that the mass was actually
                  beginning to move, that we had power to break through the fascination which the
                  glorious sight exercised over us.
               The descent was as difficult, and to me more so, than the ascent. I looked with
                  envy at Mrs. Rochester and Janet, who went bounding down lightly like little kids.
                  My ankles trembled under me; and but for Mr. Rochester and his valet Domenico, I
                  do not know how I should have accomplished the task. They lifted me from one
                  slippery, sinking foothold to another too quickly to allow my feet to sink into
                  the steaming crevices.
               It was the work of only a few instants, but one of great excitement. After we had
                  reached the ground we turned to look at the hillock, and could see the lava
                  current sparkling through all its little openings. Before we left the mountain
                  last night, that whole hillock was incorporated with the main stream and was one
                  mass of flaming fluid.
               After the bustle of descent was over, we seated ourselves on the banks of the
                  Atrio del Cavallo, to rest our bruised, blistered limbs on the dry, scorched
                  ferns, and also to enjoy the grand view laid out before us.
               
               The forms into which the lava flood falls are beautiful. In its descent I watched
                  its action, when it encountered heaps of earth, or stone, or mounds of old lava;
                  the fire stream would seem to halt, as if accumulating its gathering forces, which
                  were rushing army-like out of the crater above, and the fluid would creep around,
                  under, and even through the obstructing mass, looking then like some Alpine
                  cascades I have seen, where the intervening rock is formed of regular and
                  horizontal strata, through which the water forces its way, spouting out in
                  exquisite little jets; this would last a few moments, then the flood, receding for
                  an instant, would come rolling over in one grand sheet of fire, with all the
                  abandonment of a great cataract, then surge on in a quiet, flaming torrent.
               Dante came again to our memories, as he does at every step in Southern Italy.
                  Janet and I pictured, in the strange, weird forms of the lava flood, "the fell
                  monster who taints all the world," Geryon, on whose serpent-back Virgil and Dante
                  descended to the fearful Eighth Circle, and as the fire-fall poured on, we
                  repeated with more intense interest than we had ever felt before,— 
                     
                        "Naught but the beast was possible to view:
                        He slowly, slowly wound in many a curve;
                        Though only from a wind, which upward blew
                        Against my face, his course I could observe.
                        Down on the right, I heard the whirlpool seethe,
                        Where splashing fell the horrible cascade;
                        And, straining forth my neck to gaze beneath,
                        At the dread plunge I grew still more afraid,
                        Such groans I heard, and saw such glare of fires,
                        Whereat I shrunk, all quivering with affright;
                        And marked his manner of descent, in spires,
                        Which until now the darkness kept from sight."*
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  *Dr. Parsons's Dante, Canto 17.
               
               Gradually we both stopped talking, and as we leaned back against the ferny bank,
                  enjoying that singular luxury of a fatigue which arises from labor which has
                  gratified the mind while it has wearied the body, we listened to the remarks of
                  the others around us. They were talking of the appearance of the lava. Some
                  compared it to melted gold (which not many of us had ever seen, I fancy); others
                  quoted from Mrs. Jameson the word she applied to it,—"trickling"; to me it looked
                  like molten iron, it poured on with the same oily, smooth sweep. Another
                  peculiarity I noticed in this lava fire,—its slowness and stillness. It seemed
                  like a furious torrent which was too far off for us to distinguish its rapidity or
                  noise; and yet we were within a few feet of the fiery stream.
               At last Mr. Rochester sounded the prudent signal of retreat, which I, for one,
                  most unwillingly obeyed. With lingering steps, looking back all the while, we
                  returned to the Hermitage of San Salvadore, where we re-entered our carriages and
                  proceeded homewards.
               Soon after we started, the moon rose on the opposite side of the mountain,—the
                  Mediterranean side,—filling to the very "beaded brim" this chalice of beauty. The
                  vapor rising from the mountain and lava streams was rosy, and the rocks and trees
                  had a soft, delicate light thrown over them, like an early twilight. I have never
                  seen the Vesuvius light accurately represented in any picture. Painters make it
                  too fiery; on the contrary, there is in the light of burning lava a mellow, rich
                  hue, which is soft and brilliant, with more carmine in its red than vermilion, and
                  golden or rose-colored in its high light, not yellow or orange.
               The whole scene was unearthly in its loveliness, and it exercised over my feelings
                  the most beneficent influence. There seemed to be no past or future, no memory of
                     sorrow row. Life's hopes and cares
                  and questionings were suspended, and for a brief season my spirit was lifted, as
                  it were, into a higher range of being, where only the memories of the great and
                  good things of this world existed,—into a region of eternal beauty,—for even the
                  ruin and desolation of parts of the country through which we were passing were
                  annihilated by the magical effects of that heavenly light.
               
                  
                     "And thou didst shine, thou rolling moon, upon
                     All this, and cast a wide and tender light,
                     Which softened down the hoar austerity
                     Of rugged desolation, and filled up,
                     As 't were anew, the gaps of centuries;
                     Leaving that beautiful which still was so,
                     And making that which was not, till the place
                     Became religion, and the heart ran o'er
                     With silent worship of the great and old,—
                     The dead, but sceptred sovereigns, who still rule
                     Our spirits from their urns."
                  
               
               A complete silence reigned in our carriage. Not until we rolled into Resina did we
                  break the stillness; even then, we said but a few words, and, without apology,
                  each one fell back into that "serene and blessed mood" which the beautiful night
                  had created.
               My pleasant dreamings were a little disturbed by entering the dark city, which was
                  as still as if hushed by enchantment; and as the carriages rumbled over the stone
                  flags of the Largo del Mercato, and the Largo del Palazzo Reale, where the gas
                  seemed to burn with a weird and ghostly light, I shivered. It seemed like
                  Nouronihar's and Vathek's descent into the fearful hall of Eblis by huge marble
                  stairs, on each one of which "were planted two large torches." But suddenly we
                  came out on the Santa Lucia, where the whole glorious sight of flaming mountain,
                  rosy light, silvery moonbeams, and glittering waters burst on me again, and broke
                  most pleasantly this transient illusion, which had been thrown over my excited
                  imagination by the dimly-lighted, gloomy streets.
               We swept around the Chiatamone into the stately, calm Chiaja, and on up to the
                  Mergellina, where, at three o'clock of this lovely moonlight morning, we routed up
                  our pretty, good-natured portière, feeling very
                  willing, not only to rest our weary bodies, but repose our brains, which had been
                  so stimulated by the sublime sight as to be overcharged with nervous fluid even to
                  painfulness.
            
            
               
               THREE DEAD CITIES.
               I NOTICE, on looking over my journal, that I have not recorded one half of the
                  wonderful things which I have been seeing and learning. On first arriving I gave
                  conscientiously the history of everything which I saw; but this industrious spirit
                  has left me. Churches, cities of the dead, ruins, all the marvellous spots which
                  then stood out so boldly to be noticed, have fallen back under the haze of
                  enjoyment which envelops everything in this lovely place,—one's self, one's
                  actions, and one's associates.
               Goethe said well of Naples: "You forget yourself and the world here, in going
                  about with persons who think of nothing but of being happy." In Italy we soon grow
                  acclimated in spirit as well as in body, and learn to prefer, as the Italian does,
                  this life of sensation, ease, and pleasure to one of thought and mental labor.
               Every cause of annoyance, too, appears to be with drawn from me; it is as if I
                  stood on charmed ground. Even the dreaded letters do not arrive, and I have not
                  felt for months that sharp heart-click which the sight of home writing causes me.
                  Home! what bitter irony and sorrow there is sometimes in that little word. Yes, I
                  seem protected, as by some sweet enchantment, from the power of the dread angel
                  Ahrim, whose triple scourge of Darkness, Misery, and Death I have so often felt. I
                  "hide my life" in a luxurious, happy dream.
               Philip also repeats Goethe: "Naples is a paradise; in it every one lives in a sort
                  of self-forgetfulness. I scarcely know myself; I seem quite an altered being; and
                  I say, 'Either I have always been mad or I am so now.'"
               Lately I have been visiting various celebrated places in the neighborhood of
                  Naples, making short excursions which have taken only a day for the jaunt. One of
                  these pleasant journeys was to Amalfi. We went by rail to La Cava; there we took
                  carriages and drove to Amalfi. This drive made a strong impression on me, for
                  Nature showed itself so luxuriant and lovely in the foliage of the trees, the vast
                  quantities of beautiful flowers, and the enchanting coloring of the mountains and
                  sea; then the picturesque character of the villages scattered about added a great
                  deal to the peculiar charm of the landscape.
               The mountains were covered with chestnuts and oaks to their very summits, and were
                  fronted by a secondary line of hills, on which rose up orange- and olive-trees;
                  sometimes these hills were terraced, and bore various kinds of grain, whose
                  different shades made them look like strips of brilliant-hued cloth or velvet
                  rolled out on the hill summits. Garlands of the vine, laden with clusters of young
                  grapes, hung in graceful festoons from the branches of the filbert, fig, and other
                  fruit- and nut-trees. Then came a succession of cool-looking recesses in these
                  luxuriant hills, little dells intersected by deep ravines, which were covered with
                  rich foliage close down to the margin of a hurrying stream, or the garden edge of
                  a peasant's home, clusters of picturesque houses, while here and there peeped out
                  a delizia, or villa, as if to look us a welcome.
                  Now all this scene must be colored with the entrancing atmospheric hue which is only to be
                  found in Southern Italy, and the flashing sea introduced to give life to its
                  loveliness.
               It was quite late in the morning when our carriages approached Amalfi. There lay
                  the beautiful gulf with the mountains rising up, shutting off the snow-white town
                  from the interior; and as I noticed this, I remembered what I had read long ago in
                  Mitford's Greece, that "Amalfi had always been subjected to the local
                  disadvantages of being situated so as to be excluded from the neighboring country
                  by a range of very difficult mountains." But its situation is fine for landscape
                  beauty; there is a deep mountain gorge, a torrent dashing into the gulf, and the
                  old dowager duchess of a city lies there mouldering on the coast.
               Amalfi! I looked at the poor little ruined place while our donkeys clambered up
                  and down the streets, which are forever mounting and descending, and it seemed
                  hardly possible to me that this dilapidated collection of strange looking old
                  houses could ever have been a great seaport,—the Athens of the Middle Ages, the
                  rival of Venice!
               It was once a successful republic which coined its own money; had extensive
                  commerce; owned streets and quarters in far-off great cities, factories in
                  Constantinople and Bagdad, and before the time of the Crusaders had a church and
                  convent in Jerusalem for pilgrims: but it went to sleep many hundred years ago.
                  Magnetica Amalfi! It gave to the world the mariner's compass, and during the
                  Crusading wars the proud Amalfitan standard was emblazoned with the compass
                  cross.
               At last, man and the sea overpowered this bold, busy little republic. Bloody
                  battles and fearful engulfings laid it low; and now nothing remains, not even
                  ruins, of the once crowded quays and arsenals: for the plashing waters of the gulf
                  ride as proudly over them as Amalfitan navies once did on the haughty and
                  destroying breast of the glittering, treacherous sea.
               I had not as much satisfaction as usual in the Almafi visit; the party was too
                  large and gay, and Philip and Luigi were not with us. The whole affair was
                  confused and bustling. We were a merry, noisy set, with more curiosity than
                  reverence, and more quick-witted cleverness than information; but I will not be
                  ungracious, for a great deal of care and indeed expense was generously given and
                  incurred by the hospitable planners of the jaunt.
               We first visited the Cathedral, a Saracenic building, with a joyful looking
                  campanile, and gay-tiled cupolas and domes. St. Andrew the Apostle is buried in
                  the crypt. Once this cathedral was a favorite resort for pilgrims; St. Francis of
                  Assisium visited it, and many other holy persons; a wonderful miracle was here
                  vouchsafed to the faithful in those believing days, but it is still and dead
                  now!
               Some members of our gay party hunted up two famous sarcophagi, one of which was
                  found built into the wall of the church; and they traced with great interest in
                  the fine bas-relief adorning it a classic legend, the Rape of Proserpine. Others
                  gathered admiringly around the great bronze doors of the cathedral, which are over
                  a thousand years old; they were made by some Byzantine artist, when Amalfi was
                  still young and powerful; they have Latin inscriptions in silver letters, telling
                  that one Panteleone di Maura erected them in honor of St. Andrew and for his own
                  soul's salvation.
               
               While the rest were loitering over some of the cathedral wonders, I stood alone on
                  the top of the high broad stone steps, and gazed dreamily down into the square or
                  piazza beneath; the elevation was so great that I seemed to be standing on the
                  first platform of a mountain. I thought of those wonderful old Catholic days in
                  800 and 900 A. D., the first period of Amalfi's greatness. Then my memory swept on
                  to 1200, 1300, and 1400, when the town was a place of holy pilgrimage for great
                  saints and sovereigns. My busy fancy filled the spacious flight of stone steps and
                  the broad piazza with stately processions, banners, incense, and all the superb
                  adornments of grand religious ceremonies. Nothing for a little while interfered
                  with my vision, which grew very vivid. The square was quite empty; a few idlers
                  had collected there to look at the donkeys waiting for our party. The water of the
                  piazza fountain spouted out from the stone statues grouped around it, and plashed
                  refreshingly in the huge basins. Suddenly our whole party came out of the
                  cathedral, eager for a new sight; the donkey-drivers gave shrill cries; some
                  pretty girls of our company laughed merrily over the ragged trappings of the poor
                  beasts, and my day-dream of the Middle Ages faded away in the bright noonday
                  light. 
                     
                        "No voice, no lute, no pipe, no incense sweet
                        From chain-swung censer teeming;
                        No shrine, no grove, no oracle, no heat
                        Of pale-mouthed prophet dreaming."
                     
                  
               
               First, the donkeys took us to the Convent of the Capuchins, at the west end of the
                  coast opposite the town, to reach which we had to ascend the steepest of rocky
                  paths. Even those of us who had never visited Italy before knew this place better
                  than any other spot in or around Amalfi. Years ago, when I was a girl, I sketched
                  the beautiful cloisters of this convent as a drawing-lesson, and on their
                  dwarf-coupled columns and lancet arches I had received my first impressions of
                  Christian architectural symbolism; and after many long years, here I was standing,
                  looking at the cloisters, the very stones!
               I rubbed my eyes and wondered if it was not some fine dream; then in order to get
                  rid of the people, who were talking busily, I left the cloisters and returned to a
                  picturesque grotto at the head of the rock, near which we had alighted from our
                  donkeys on first reaching the summit; there I stayed alone until the rest of the
                  party were ready to descend.
               I found some thoughtless young girls and youths in the grotto laughing, innocently
                  though irreverently, at a rude representation of the Passion in wooden life-size
                  figures. As I entered, they passed on and were soon out of sight. I knelt down on
                  the stones outside of this wild place, and gazed off on the beautiful sea. Amalfi
                  lay on the mountain slope to the left of me, and on the beach beneath were some
                  Moorish looking persons,—fishermen,—and groups of children rolling over and
                  playing with the sand, pebbles, and waves.
               There was a wonderful loveliness in the sea, sky, and land, and, added to the
                  beauty of nature, swift crowding memories of the great old past came flashing like
                  lightning before me, hovering and vanishing just as I would try to dwell on some
                  single one.
               A boat put off from shore; its graceful undulating motion was like a satisfactory
                  time-beat, or well-accented rhythm in a great symphony, after a passage of
                  perplexed harmonies. A wandering stream of wind came from the west, sweeping like
                  a pleasant wave over me, bringing an
                  echo of the murmuring mountain woods, where it had been toying with 
                     "Meeting boughs and implicated leaves."
                   Presently I saw it catch the lateen sails of the bark; they expanded, and as
                  the boat sailed off it looked like a huge nautilus floating just for beauty's
                  sake. I wished to be in it, for it was speeding fast towards that famous colony of
                  the Sybarites, now lying dead on the distant shore of the gulf, and whose
                  mysterious ruins I am longing to see,—Pæstum.
               The sea washed up with "hollow harmony" on the polished pebbles, which shone like
                  gems in the sun, giving the beach a glorious brilliancy. It made me very happy to
                  look at this wide expanse of rich-hued sky, the soft lines of the distant
                  mountains faint and aerial as rosy melting clouds, the bold, beautiful Amalfi
                  slope sweeping gracefully down to the beach, and the broad stretch of dazzling
                  waters; to breathe the sweet fragrance of the foliage, and listen to the faint
                  melody that surrounded me. 
                     
                        "Delicious sounds! those little bright-eyed things
                        That float about the air on azure wings."
                     
                   To see and feel all this loveliness was such a pleasure, that for a while I
                  forgot the perilous heights of pain I had had to scale in order to reach this
                  point of my existence, I thought of nothing but the simple joy of living.
               My pleasant solitude was soon disturbed by our noisy party assembling on the
                  height behind me, ready to descend the hill. There is this advantage in large
                  parties of well-bred society folk,—each one is taken up with his or her impressions du voyage, and so occupied with expressing
                  them, that the doings of a silent recreant like myself pass unnoticed.
               The brave little donkeys carried us pell-mell down the steep descent, urged by the
                  laughs of the riders and cries of the drivers. It seemed very dangerous, and I
                  have no doubt our high gale of frolicsome mirth made it perilous; but who ever
                  takes heed of risk on a journey? There is a strange sense of security, which
                  almost every one feels, and which is without reasonable foundation, I know; for,
                  what merit or virtue lies in the responsibility of directors of either donkeys or
                  rail-cars, after one's limbs are broken or life lost? But this sense is a lucky
                  possession, and every traveller should cultivate it, in order to be free from all
                  drawbacks of timid apprehensions.
               We made a gay flight of it down that precipitous steep. Young girls, who rarely
                  spoke in loud, natural voices in drawing-rooms, pealed out merry rings of the
                  joyfulest laughter; the young men forgot their Sir Charles Cold-stream
                  indifference and society accent, and mingled their frank, manly ejaculations of
                  frolic-fun with the shrill cries of the drivers: for there is something in
                  nature's influence, if there is nothing in society; while the dear little serious
                  donkeys trotted swiftly and safely from one rocky step to the other, seeming to
                  pay no attention to us foolish human beings.
               We did not dismount when we reached the town, but crossed the Cathedral square
                  again, and went, in the opposite direction, to the Vallee di Molino, Valley of the
                  Mills, where we were to dine al fresco. This
                  short donkey-ride to the valley was one of the most remarkable features of the
                  day, the road was so curious.
               We first went through a dark passage, in which was a Moorish archway, with a
                  shrine that had a flickering lamp and a vase of fresh flowers before the
                  Greek-looking Madonna. The place grew more and more obscure, the air was filled with moisture, and we heard rushing,
                  falling waters around us; but we could see nothing distinctly. The pretty, girlish
                  laughs were stilled, and the young Coldstreams of our party grew courageous and
                  protecting in their assurances of "no danger whatever."
               This lasted but a few moments, when we came out into all the daylight to be found
                  in narrow streets bordered by high houses. The little hoofs of the donkeys
                  pattered up and down the rugged paths, which were like stone staircases. We were
                  so close to the houses, that it seemed more like going through them than beside
                  them. The inhabitants of the dwellings, some of whom were busy making the macaroni
                  for which the town is now noted, left their work, and leaned listlessly out of the
                  windows and over the terrace rails to look at our laughing cavalcade.
               Arches and staircase-streets followed in succession, the donkeys trotting
                  skilfully along; presently we came out on a mountain gorge, through which dashed a
                  little glancing torrent. It was the Valle del Molino, Valley of the Paper Mills.
                  High mountains rose up around us, and the foaming stream went leaping over the
                  jagged, rocky bed, making beautiful cascades in its hurry; the shivering
                  aspen-trees on the borders bent their branches down, as if to catch a sight of
                  their trembling forms in the broken surface of the waters, and seemed to grow more
                  quivering as the shattered reflection was cast up to them with the spray.
               Along the sides of the gorge were ruins of the Middle Ages, which have since been
                  used as paper mills, but are now deserted. The walls were covered with maiden-hair
                  fern, and all the climbing bind-weeds and club-mosses peculiar to this luxuriant
                  climate, whose soft, serrated leaves waved to and fro in the breeze. We went to
                  the highest plateau of this lovely spot, where we found a low, picturesque wall,
                  and some broken marble columns, which served for seats and tables. Here we dined
                  or lunched. Champagne corks snapped; pâtes de foie
                     gras and other delicious dishes were taken from the well-stocked
                  hampers, and eaten with fine appetite,—indeed, with a hunger that is rarely given
                  to such luxurious food; peals of laughter rung out; snatches of opera melodies and
                  barcarolles were trilled; pretty words of society compliment talked: it was a true
                  Boccaccio fête, and, as I looked at the white walls overrun with verdure, and the
                  branches of orange- and myrtle-trees leaning against the building, I recalled that
                  poet's admiration of Amalfi. Some day our own little family party must go to Valle
                  di Molino; the four lovers will be very happy there.
               The drive home did not seem a repetition of the morning's pleasure; it was like
                  something new. I noticed more carefully the beautiful route. All the way from
                  Amalfi to Vietri the road lies along the coast and winds around the bend of land
                  which forms the western shore of the Gulf of Salerno, doubling and redoubling as
                  it follows the irregularites of outline.
               The superb scenery looked even more attractive in the late afternoon glow than it
                  had in the morning light, and I understood better its geographical position. I
                  traced with my eye the high mountainous country of the Sorrentine promontory,
                  which lies on the west side of the Gulf, the Apennine offsets; and then, turning,
                  gazed down the eastern shore, which stretches out to Pæstum's coast, far off in
                  the almost invisible distance.
               Close at hand new points of scenery opened on us, and we noticed fresh beauties.
                  The golden, poetic fruit and snowy
                  bridal blossoms of the orange and lemon scattered perfume around us. Every little
                  while we saw groups of olive-trees, standing midway up a hill, their dull leaves
                  turned gently back by the western breeze, which was dying away; and as their gray
                  masses rested against the dark foliage of the chestnuts and oaks above and around
                  them, they looked like soft 
                     "Clouds suspended in an emerald sky."
                   Undine waterfalls tumbled down the numberless ravines, and sung their sunset
                  song, as they danced gayly on to the Gulf. That beautiful Gulf! Not a zephyr
                  ruffled its surface, and it was 
                     
                        "Filled with the face of heaven, which, from afar,
                        Comes down upon the waters."
                     
                   Amethystine blue lay near the shore, while farther out it looked like broad
                  plains of malachite and gold. There was not a cloud in the heavens, and all the
                  various colors seemed indeed to be 
                     
                        "Melted into one vast Iris of the west,
                        Where the day joins the past eternity."
                     
                  
               
               After we left the coast-road and turned in towards La Cava, our attention was
                  attracted by the numberless wild-flowers which were spread in lavish profusion
                  over the banks, on either side of the road. We stopped the carriages, and gathered
                  huge bunches of cowslips, daisies, musky wood-violets, and blood-red anemones. At
                  La Cava we again took the rail-cars, as we had in the morning, and crossed this
                  little point of land, which forms the left side of the Bay of Naples,—the same
                  Sorrentine promontory over whose western shore, on the Salerno Gulf side, we had
                  just been travelling. When we reached Pompeii, we found our carriages waiting for
                  us, as we had ordered they should in the morning. We could have gone all the way
                  to Naples by rail, but we wished to enjoy the evening drive on this lovely
                  Mediterranean shore, of which we never grow weary.
               We visited Herculaneum and Pompeii a few days ago, and I brought back only a few
                  pleasant memories. As I walked through the confined streets, and looked at the
                  little houses of Pompeii, it was difficult for me to realize that living people
                  had ever inhabited them. The place seemed less like a real town than a collection
                  of models, made to show in miniature the way the ancients lived.
               There are in my memory two separate and distinct images of these exhumed places.
                  One, the more agreeable of the two, was gained by looking at the curious and
                  interesting things taken from these towns, which are collected together in the
                  Musée Bourbonique; the other, and totally different one, was produced by the visit
                  I paid to the towns themselves. The first fills me with wonder and admiration; the
                  last with disagreeable disappointment: moreover, I can never connect the two.
               It is incomprehensible to me how a people who displayed such perfect artistic
                  taste in all the appointments of domestic life should have put up with such
                  contracted accommodations. The mere door-latches, bolts, handles, locks, and keys
                  were of bronze, and richly worked, showing that the Pompeiians possessed a
                  microscopic eye for ornamental detail, but no refined need for home space and
                  personal comfort. Shop weights, braziers for boiling water, portable stoves, made
                  also of bronze, graceful in form, of exquisite workmanship, small and elegant
                  enough to set on a table as ornaments, were used daily by these people, who had
                  not even comfortable sleeping apartments, whose home rooms were mere side-closets,
                     and whose largest dining and
                  reception-halls were only twenty feet square.
               Rich decorations, however, were lavished on these little rooms. The floors were
                  covered with costly mosaics; the ceilings and walls with frescoes; while columns,
                  hung with rich tapestry, bordered the inner courts, in the centre of which were
                  always little gardens and fountains.
               The men lived abroad in the superb public buildings, the temples, forum, and
                  luxurious baths; as for the women, life was not equally shared with them, nor
                  arranged for their comfort, as in these pleasant days; for in this good nineteenth
                  century, though there may be instances of old heathen injustice and selfish
                  disregard of women's real rights, they are rare and individual ones,—exceptions,
                  really, to the general spirit, which is disposed to be honest, and give us a
                  fairer portion in life than has ever before been granted.
               The solemn, dark labyrinthine passages of Herculaneum were more attractive to me
                  than the baby-house appearance of Pompeii; there was at least the mystery of
                  darkness hanging over them. Luigi told me that one of these galleries in
                  Herculaneum led to the villa in which were found the beautiful sitting statue of
                  Agrippina mourning Germanicus, the divine Plato head, the dreamy Scipio, and the
                  troubled, perplexed Seneca.
               Whose villa was this? What an abode of luxury, refinement, and pleasure was
                  darkened in one single night,—a night, too, that was to last for centuries.
               Notwithstanding the little disappointment which is first experienced on seeing
                  these diminutive houses, it is impossible to stand in the streets of these buried
                  towns without feeling deep emotions, and such, too, as no other place in the world
                  can create.
               The busy waves of life were surging as roughly and rolling on as swiftly in those
                  buried towns as in our crowded cities of to-day. Human beings were gathered
                  together, each one of whom had his or her own secret history. Hopes, fears, and
                  ambitions choked the life current, and caused the same faintness with
                  apprehension, the same exaltation with fast-fading success, which we suffer.
                  Existence was glorious to some; others carried hopelessly aching hearts, or secret
                  sins, hidden, like the man's viper hand in the legend, in the discreet folds of
                  life's mantle, which devoured noiselessly to the heart-core. Vigorous life, feeble
                  health, each were alike suddenly suspended; and here beneath these ruins they have
                  mouldered and mingled, with lava and dust, for nearly two thousand years.
               The situation of the Tragic Theatre at Pompeii pleased us very much. The building
                  was above the general level of the city; it stood on the southern slope of a hill,
                  was semicircular, and every part was lined with Parian marble. The seats faced the
                  Mediterranean; and as the Theatre was open to the air, the audience commanded two
                  luxuries at once: while enjoying the play, they could lean back and gaze over the
                  beautiful free sea.
               We imagined them listening to the words of womanly sympathy, chanted by the tender
                  Sea Nymphs to Prometheus Bound, as they sat there looking out on the fast-speeding
                  waters of the Crater Bay, while old Typhon's resentful roar made a murmuring
                  accompaniment to the sad words of the poor chained Titan,— 
                     
                        "for grief walks the earth
                        And sits down at the foot of each by turns."
                     
                   And if they felt terror-stricken when they heard the mountain's sullen moans,
                  while watching the sparkling waves
                  dashing myriads of gems on high, and hearing the 
                     
                        "multitudinous laughter
                        Of the ocean billows,"
                     
                   they could find the answer to their fears in the response of the rock-chained
                  enemy of Zeus to Oceanus,— 
                     
                        "Chorus.
                        —How didst thou medicine the plague fear of Death?
                     
                     
                        Prometheus.
                        —I set blind Hopes to inhabit in their houses.
                     
                     
                        Chorus.
                        —By that gift thou didst help thy mortals well."
                     
                  
               
               The Pompeiian visit, though pleasant, wanted the élan of our usual family excursions. In the first place, Luigi, who
                  is not well yet, was spiritless and sad; even Venitia seemed in a "sweet trouble."
                  Then Florence Folham met some young English naval officers among the ruins, one of
                  whom was her cousin, young Milnes, a handsome youth, and very devoted to her; of
                  course they joined our party, and were quite in Philip's way, as can readily be
                  understood; this put him out of humor, and made him silent and moody to the rest
                  of us. Thus Janet and I had all the classical talk to ourselves,—and not much
                  either,—for in the presence of strangers it sounds a little pedantic to indulge
                  freely in conversation on the subjects suggested by these places.
               We are not as united as we have been, it seems to me. There is some little tangle
                  in our golden chain; but it will soon unknot. I fancy our two lovers are
                  discovering that they are not mere admirers of these pretty young girls. The
                  affair for both of them is in a troubled state, like some perplexed music which
                  works itself out, through strange resolutions into perfect peace and security.
               So must it ever be in this life. The fullest joy is often born out of the throes
                  of a great sorrow. He said well who wrote, "Without a basis of the dreadful, there
                  is no perfect rapture." Life's jewel must be set in jet to display its fullest
                  radiance; and even these innocent lovers must have their tender trouble to make
                  the bliss all the more perfect.
               The closing of the day at Pompeii, however, was satisfactory. The young officers
                  had to leave early, in order to join their ship before nightfall; thus we were
                  left to ourselves for a little while. Luigi and I went to the Amphitheatre to look
                  at the sunset, which was peculiarly glowing and gorgeous. While we sat there, we
                  talked, not of these "mummied cities," but of musical coloring in Nature. This was
                  suggested to us by the exquisite shades which the enchanting atmosphere was
                  throwing over the landscape. The rest of the party were loitering idly near us,
                  and joined us just as I was saying,—
               "Flowers and leaves of trees are forever modulating; they are true living
                  harmonies; they strike one key of melody in their youth, then modulate and resolve
                  through series and series of tones, in every phase of their short existence, but
                  always breathe their last in the minor; it may be a grand, full, high-sounding
                  chord, like the red, orange, and purple of autumn foliage, still it is the solemn
                  minor of death."
               "That is all very pretty, but fanciful, Ottilie," said Philip, laughing, as he
                  took a seat beside me. "That theory of classing musical tones and harmonies in
                  colors is impossible; every sensible musician will say so; and for this reason, my
                  friend: color has not, like music, a gamut of harmony, nor certain tones which
                  serve as data, from which shades and combinations can be formed by divisions of
                  tones into semitones, then woven into subtle expressive forms. The Tone tongue is
                  vague enough, heaven knows, but not so vague as Color."
               
               "You are right," I answered, "in saying musical tones and harmonies should not be
                  literally classed in colors; nor did I mean that. Each form of art-beauty has its
                  separate and distinct individuality; but one form can very properly suggest to the
                  observing and imaginative spectator or hearer other art manifestations. It is
                  difficult to express in words clear descriptions of either music or color, without
                  borrowing technical terms from one for the other; for music and painting are
                  nearer akin than poetry or any word form. Indeed, I never look at the works of
                  great colorists, without thinking what fine musicians they would have made."
               "That gifted man Alfred Tonnellé," said Luigi, "made a beautiful observation,
                  which is apropos to your remarks: 'If the lips
                  of the young man of Urbino could have opened to music, they would have sung the
                  melodies of the young man of Salzburg.'"
               "Charmingly true. Mozart was indeed the Raphael of music!" I exclaimed.
               In all the short arguments which Philip playfully provokes, Luigi if possible
                  helps me, partly for the reason that we think alike on most subjects, but chiefly
                  because he sees, what is really the truth, I am not a fair match for Philip; so on
                  this occasion he came as usual to my rescue.
               "You are right also, Ottilie, about the fitness of drawing comparisons between
                  color and music; and, as you say, using the technical terms of one in describing
                  the other often helps two cultured artists to understand each other. Thus, for
                  example, when Euler said the strength and intensity of a color depended on the
                  vibrations of light, he compared the sun to an immense clock, whose movements,
                  transmitted by ether, acted on the optic nerve in the same manner as the
                  vibrations of the air act upon the nerve of the ear in producing sound.
               "Yes," I said, "it is in these vibrations of light that the great melodic secret
                  of color lies, just as in the vibrations of sound skilfully arranged agreeable
                  harmonies exist."
               "Exactly so. The science of color consists in producing equal vibrations, and the
                  great skill of the colorist is shown in making tones which are wide apart
                  harmonize together and produce an equal vibration on the eye: but the variable
                  fashion in which ether vibrates makes it difficult of command; the colorist has
                  not the same degree of power over it that the harmonist has over sound. This very
                  variability of vibration, however, enables us to regard in Nature the marvellous
                  and complicated assemblages of colors without confusion and fatigue. Nature is
                  always perfect in color as in design."
               Janet added her information to this pleasant sunset talk, and told us of the gamut
                  of harmony which M. Chevreul, the director of the Gobelin and Beauvais
                  manufactories, has given to color. He produces ten chromatic circles from the
                  three primitive colors; these ten circles make thirty series; each tint has its
                  gamut of twenty-four tones; thus over fourteen thousand tones are produced, all of
                  which are said to be needed for the "chromatic arsenal" of the Gobelin and
                  Beauvais works. We talked afterwards of the wonderful variety of colors which the
                  skill of chemists is now producing.
               "But the cleverness of chemists," said Philip, "is destroying the power of the eye
                  for delicate effects of color, just as the so-called improvements in brass
                  instruments is destroying the ear for subtle effects in orchestration. The purple
                  shadows accompanying chemical reds, blues, and greens are totally deficient in transparency,
                  and are quite unlike those suggested by the clear cochineal red, the carnation of
                  Adrinople, the soft China indigo, or the tender azure of lapis lazuli and cobalt. Shadows no longer resemble nature, nor do
                  they fulfil the meaning of their name, for they have become opaque and
                  unvarying."
               With something of a woman's obstinacy I added, as we arose to leave the ruins,
                  "These modern chemical colors have been justly styled, 'false harmonies in the
                  place of resolving discords.'"
               And thus ended our day at Pompeii.
            
            
               A MUSICAL EVENING.
               LAST night the Folhams and Rochesters called to see us, on their way home from a
                  fine dinner-party. Luigi also came in, and we had a charming evening without
                  ruffle or tangle. Philip and Florence sang together, which they do very cleverly,
                  and their voices harmonize nicely. I had been riding with Philip in the afternoon,
                  and had the excuse of fatigue for my silence; so without much interference from
                  loquacious Mrs. Folham, I rested on one of the window lounges, listened to the
                  music, looked at the happy young people, and felt so comfortable that I found
                  myself wondering if there was any real trouble in the world. 
                     
                        "What pang
                        Is permanent with man? From the highest
                        As from the vilest thing of every day,
                        He learns to wean himself. For the strong hours
                        
                        
                           Conquer him."
                     
                  
               
               But the sweet and happy hours are conquering me. Last evening a powerful charm was
                  worked on every one, however, by that subtle and delicate interpreter of hidden
                  emotions and inexpressible thoughts,—music. Some one has said finely, "Music's
                  form, composed of vibrations of the air, lives in space and gives form and shape
                  to the impalpable." Indeed, the most impressive, direct, and irresistible language for the ideal is
                  the Tone tongue; it is a much more powerful expression of feeling than any other
                  art form.
               I watched its effect with great interest last night. Our lovers are just at the
                  most difficult point of their intercourse; their love is unacknowledged, even half
                  unknown to themselves. It is without speech, words have not given it tangible
                  form, therefore music is a pleasant relief to their full hearts; it produces the
                  happiest harmony of feeling. Last evening Venitia and Luigi stood near each other
                  in tender, gentle silence, and during some passages in the singing I observed
                  their eyes meeting without startle in long, quiet looks.
               The merry conversational intercourse between Philip and Florence formed a pleasing
                  contrast. He complimented her gayly on the success of her toilette, making her
                  blush bewitchingly; and she tinkled out her pretty foam-bell laugh, which always
                  reminds me of dancing waters rippling over pebbles. These blondes are truly "the
                  stars of the earth."
               She was dressed in exquisite taste; the texture of her robe was as delicate as
                  gossamer; its flounces and light ornaments were in perfect keeping, and she moved
                  gracefully about in a half gliding step. I fancy a Parisian modiste would have
                  thought her an exact representation of an Aphrodite rising from the foam of the
                  sea.
               Her beautiful hair seemed more radiant than usual; it was turned off from the
                  blue-veined temples, and rolled back in that style called "L'Impératrice," which suits so well a blonde like Florence. The hue
                  of the roots of the hair and the skin is so nearly the same as scarcely to show
                  the line of separation, and both seem to have gold-dust mingled in their precious
                  compound. The rich mass rose in ripples all over her head as if lifted by little
                  waves of wind, and made me think of Chaucer's Queen of Love,— 
                     
                        "It shone as gold, so fine,
                        Dishevel, crisp."
                     
                  
               
               Florence sings the Sonnambula music better than any
                  other,—that is, for my taste. It may be because her fresh young beauty seems so
                  well suited to the charming pastoral story of this opera,—"this true Bucolic of
                  the country of Virgil and Theocritus," as Scudo calls it. It is indeed a delicious
                  creation, full of the freshness and perfume of spring; its sadness is only a short
                  shower at sunset, refreshing the young, springing herbage which was a little bent
                  down by the rays of an over ardent noonday sun; then, after the little shadow of
                  trouble is over, the air is filled with resonance, and the young rising moon of
                  love is greeted with the delicate notes of Arcadian reeds, piping sweetly and
                  tenderly a ravishing epithalamium.
               She sang last evening the aria in the first act, "Come per
                     me sereno," in the most winning manner; and in the ensuing allegro,
                     "Sovra il seno la man mi posa," her high notes
                  were thrilling, and filled with that mysterious, invisible fluid which escapes
                  from a fast throbbing soul. I think I liked her execution of this passage better
                  than the finale, "Ah non giunge," although she
                  did throw into that an éclat, a bounding girlish
                  joy, which was delicious.
               Philip sang with her the duos following the arias, and his ruby-hued voice mingled
                  with hers delightfully. They gave us almost the illusion of the opera; for added
                  to their very clever singing was an unconscious display of deep emotion, which was
                  equal to the finest acting. The two lovers were evidently speeding off just as
                  fast as the swift locomotive of a mutual infatuation could carry them.
               
               During the little dialogue in "Prendi l'annel ti
                     dono," Janet glanced at me once or twice, and she had to check a
                  merry quivering of her expressive lips, and drop her eyelids quickly to hide the
                  frolicsome dancing of the eyes. Florence's reply to "Sposi
                     or noi siamo" was very naive. She had yielded up her whole being
                  unconsciously to the new element which music and love combined had created, and on
                  its tender pulsating waves her spirit floated happily. Her violet-hued eyes were
                  full of sweet meditation when she sang, sotto voce,
                     "Sposi"; then she struck the E flat, and the sound was fruity.
                  Although it is a head-note, the sudden gush of deep feeling made it
                  "full-throated" like the nightingale's tone. A soft swell followed, the voice
                  floated down on the A with the most ravishing little turns soft and silvery, and
                     "Tenera parola" lay on the air like little
                  swaying flower petals.
               Philip, I knew, was thrilled by it; for his reply, "Cara,
                     cara nel senti posi questa gentil viola," was so full of emotion it
                  almost choked him. Florence's response was sung as if she were unconsciously
                  uttering aloud the sweet echo his "gentil viola"
                  had left in her love-touched soul, "Pura innocenta
                     fiora,"—it was inimitable!
               Luigi stood near Venitia; his long dark eyes were half closed, and rested on her;
                  he seemed lost in a sweet dream. Dear Mrs. Folham, delightfully innocent of
                  Italian, sat bolt upright, looking on the whole affair in the most practical
                  English mamma manner; but Janet and I were "the chiels amang 'em takin'
                  notes."
               When it was over, the young people gathered around the piano, and tried to cover
                  their real feelings by earnest talk about nothing. Wenzel, a music teacher, who
                  plays accompaniments for them, preluded softly; the rippling arpeggio passages he
                  played were not meant to attract attention; the discreet Italian only wished to
                  fill up a gap. Janet stood a few moments by the piano, then went to Mrs. Folham,
                  who was talking with Mr. and Mrs. Rochester. After saying a few words to them, she
                  came to the lounge where I was lying in a true hypnotic state.
               "This music makes me think of a passage I read in Scudo to-day," she said, leaning
                  over me. "'It is not high art producing a grand dramatic emotion; it is a delicate
                  pleasure, a sensuality of the ear tempered by a light moral feeling, which sweetly
                  penetrates the heart, per aures pectus
                     irrigatur, as a Latin poet has said so happily.'"
               I could not reply to her; to be spoken to by any one gave me a keen sensation,
                  which was almost like pain. After a glorious flight on "music's mighty wings," it
                  is impossible to return to ordinary mortal means of communication; the soul has
                  been soaring off in its own ether, and comes back as folâtre and rebellious as an Ariel; the poor body seems like a
                  prison, and it beats the bars of the cage mercilessly. The body, too, becomes
                  impregnatic, as it were, with some of the same emotion, and a vertigo and
                  irritability result which few know how to control; so I only smiled back an
                  answering assent, and leaning my head on the cushions closed my eyes. Janet sat
                  near me in silence; she rested her little hands on my head, and kindly smoothed
                  down the hair bands; her soft magnetic touch was very soothing, and gave me great
                  comfort.
               Venitia finished the evening by playing that Polonaise of Weber in E major, which
                  Liszt calls dithyrambic; in it life, warmth, and passion glitter on the wave
                  crests without disturbing the grand ebb and flow of the majestic ocean of deep
                  feeling. I listened, still in my raptus state,
                  and whispered to the beat of the measure,—
                  
                     
                        "Thou art the wine whose drunkenness is all
                        We can desire, O Love! and happy souls,
                        Ere from thy vine the leaves of autumn fall,
                     
                     
                        "Catch thee, and feed from their o'erflowing bowls
                        Thousands who thirst for thy ambrosial dew;
                        Thou art the radiance which here ocean rolls
                     
                     
                        "Investest it; and when the heavens are blue
                        Thou fillest them; and when the earth is fair,
                        The shadow of thy moving wings imbue
                     
                     
                        "Its deserts and its mountains, till they wear
                        Beauty like some bright robe;—thou ever soarest
                        Among the towers of men, and as soft air
                     
                     
                        "In spring, which moves the unawakened forest,
                        Clothing with leaves its branches bare and bleak,
                        Thou floatest among men; and aye implorest
                     
                     
                        "That which from thee they should implore; the weak
                        
                        
                           Alone kneel to thee, offering up the hearts
                        
                        
                           The strong have broken,—yet where shall any seek
                        A garment whom thou clothest not?"
                     
                  
               
            
            
               MRS. ROCHESTER'S BALL.
               IT is a glorious night,—or morning, as it is after two o'clock. I have been out on
                  the terrace; I cannot sleep; my heart is too full of tender inquietude about a
                  strangely-lagging happiness I would fain hurry on, if I knew how, for those who
                  are very dear to me. Every one else is asleep; stillness reigns in this vast
                  palazzo, and even the great city is quiet. The season is just on the verge of
                  June; the moon is at the full, and its sharp, clear light lies on the "straight-up
                  tufa rock" behind the terrace, pointing out 
                     
                        "Where lichens mock
                        The marks on a moth, and small ferns fit
                        Their teeth to the polished block."
                     
                  
               
               A "love-lorn nightingale," hidden in the dark foliage of the orange-trees which
                  are in that garden on the terraced hill, pours out a perfect flood of song. What a
                  delicious note! It is as if the rich odor of the starry fruit-blossom had become a
                  voice. At first, the bird trilled a little faintly, then the notes fell into a
                  heavy gurgle, and she stopped, as if frightened at her own voice, recalling to me
                  Chaucer's 
                     
                        "New abashéd nightingale,
                        That stinteth first when she beginneth sing";
                     
                  
                   but now she utters a peal of glad
                  music, and "showers a rain of melody," without stint or limit, 
                     
                        "Like a poet hidden
                        In the light of thought,
                        Singing hymns unbidden
                        Till the world is wrought
                        To sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not."
                     
                  
               
               But why is the nightingale called "love-lorn"? That song is full of joy and
                  rapture. I know Shakespeare says, 
                     "The nightingale's complaining notes,"
                   and the ancient poets gave the same description. Sophocles calls the bird
                  "lamenting Itys," and likens her to Electra. Homer, too, in the Odyssey, compares
                  Penelope's restlessness to the nightingale; but, while listening to that gush of
                  gay melody,—there, it bursts out afresh!—I cannot agree with these great
                  authorities, but rather side with jovial Chaucer, who, in his Flower and Leaf,
                  calls the nightingale's song "a merry note."
               Beyond the broad Mergellina the sea sparkles like cloven gems, and off in the
                  distance Vesuvius glows. It is indeed a glorious night; and this loveliness of
                  nature and my tender thoughts make "civil wars within my brain," as Sir Philip
                  Sidney says. Like him, I have 
                     
                        "Smooth pillows, sweetest bed,
                        A chamber deaf to noise and blind to light,
                        A rosy garland, and a weary head."
                     
                  
               
               For if the garland on my head this evening was of rich lace, instead of rosy
                  flowers, it was none the less a festal one. Mrs. Rochester gave a ball to-night,
                  and it was a very brilliant affair; "a success," as Mrs. Folham reiterated, "yes,
                  my dear, a positive success."
               Our two beauties looked well. I love the detail of dress, and have a true feminine
                  weakness for all those delicious nothings which go towards the making up of a
                  beautiful woman into a charming Watteau or gorgeous Titian picture; and Florence
                  and Venitia were to-night the living counterparts of those two masters' creations.
                  Florence's toilette was one of those indescribable but veritable inspirations of
                  the French modiste; and its delicate pink hue,
                  with puffings and flounces of airy tulle, and all the accessories of rose-buds and
                  light ornaments, suited well her dainty little person.
               Venitia's fine, large form needs something more exact in costume than the pretty
                  blonde does; her dress tonight was a rich, heavy silk; its color was that lovely
                  Venetian green; and the haze of soft, costly lace which fell over it made it look
                  like sea-foam. The drapery of the robe was fastened on her superb shoulders, and
                  over the breast, with large onyxes, set around with fine-sized pearls; the
                  head-dress and armlets were adorned with the same gems. There are nine of these
                  finely-sculptured stones, which Janet has owned for years, unset,—Paul's gift. A
                  few weeks ago we were admiring them, and Luigi suggested the setting of them as a
                  costume decoration, very well suited for Venitia's style in full dress. Janet took
                  to the idea, and had them arranged by a jeweller, under his supervision. They were
                  only completed a few days since, and to-night Venitia wore them all.
               A sleeping Medusa forms the girdle-clasp. A Psyche gathers the drapery across the
                  bosom, while an Iris and Hebe fasten the shoulder-bands. The armlets are formed of
                  a broad, fine network of gold, clasped with Egyptian Bacchantes. The head-dress is
                  composed of fillets of gold network, something in the style of the Sappho
                     bands; three or four of these are
                  plaited in a caul, in which the rich braids of Venitia's hair are gathered, and
                  this rests on the back of her finely-shaped head; another band, set with large,
                  oblong pearls, is clasped, at each ear, to the caul by small, exquisitely-cut
                  butterflies; this band passes across the front of the head, rising in a diadem
                  shape, after the fashion of that on the brow of the Ludovisian Juno, and in the
                  centre of this diadem of gold and pearls is placed the largest and finest onyx of
                  the collection; its subject is a sleeping Psyche, with a butterfly hovering over
                  the temple and another nestling into the breast,—sad emblem of the double
                  awakening love causes in brain and heart.
               Janet and I served as foils to these two pretty girls. We were in the orthodox
                  costumes of our age. She wore a queen's-gray moiré, and I a Parma violet silk, both gowns shaded becomingly with
                  rich black lace, accompanied with a discreet sprinkling of diamonds. When we all
                  met in our drawing-room to drink tea together, before going to the ball, Philip
                  and Luigi talked of coloring and artistic grouping.
               "But the fine effect of this beautiful dressing," I said, "will be ruined by the
                  bad taste one is apt to meet with at an evening party. Just think of the discords
                  that will be made by some horrid chemical-blue gown passing near Venitia's
                  delicate sea-foam, or Pompadour pink clashing against Florence's rose-bud
                  hue."
               "Like a public picture-gallery," replied Philip; "but Luini and I will appoint
                  ourselves hanging committee, and give you all the best lights."
               Soon after we arrived, Venitia was taken to the music-room by Mr. Rochester, to
                  play for him and a small circle of friends a lovely Ghazel, to which he has lately
                  taken a great fancy. Luigi, of course, followed her, attending on Janet and Mrs.
                  Folham. At the other end of the fine suite of apartments was a large,
                  brilliantly-lighted ball-room; a band of music was playing there, and, as Florence
                  and I stood talking to Philip in the centre drawing-room, we could see the
                  resolving forms the dancers made in a Lancer quadrille.
               A group of young men came out of the ball-room, and looked about as if searching
                  for some one. They were the English midshipmen we had met at Pompeii, and it was
                  Florence for whom they were looking. They saw her almost immediately, and, coming
                  up, shook hands cordially with us all, even with stately Philip, whose coldness
                  did not affect these brave, happy young fellows in the least. Just then, that
                  beautiful Galop from the Vêpres Siciliennes
                  poured like a rich topaz-hued current on the air, and swiftly-gliding and whirling
                  couples flashed before the broad, open doorway.
               "Florence, the Galop!" cried her handsome young cousin, hurriedly. "Come, you have
                  missed one already, for I have been waiting nearly an hour for you."
               "Miss Folham, Miss Folham!" exclaimed the others, eagerly, all talking together,
                  "do not forget I am on your tablets for the first Lancers after"——"And I for the
                  second"——"And I for the next Galop"——"And I——."
               She turned to us, hesitatingly, and, with an attractive thoughtfulness not very
                  common in a young, admired girl at a ball, surrounded by gay officer-partners,
                  said, "Neither of you dance, I believe; and yet—" She stopped, as if not knowing
                  what to say, while young Milnes tapped his foot, impatiently, and Philip looked
                  haughty and indifferent. I replied, with a laugh, "And yet you do. I am sure, my dear, it is very natural you
                  should; so hurry off with Mr. Milnes, who is quite out of patience with us all. We
                  shall follow you, for I shall like to look at you very much."
               Philip and I walked slowly into the ball-room; he was very sullen, said not a
                  word, and I rather enjoyed his annoyance. He needs a little contradiction once in
                  a while; and, moreover, I fear he will never see his way clear with Florence,
                  unless some younger rival shows it to him. Florence looked very lovely, as she
                  floated by in the dance; her light form rested gracefully on young Milnes's firm
                  hand, and, as he is a skilful waltzer, he bore her along swiftly and beautifully;
                  more than one person stopped to admire the two handsome cousins.
               "I never liked to dance," I remarked; "and yet it is a pretty sight, especially
                  when the dancers are such graceful young creatures as Florence and that
                  fine-looking lad, Milnes. Is she not charming?"
               Philip did not deign to reply to my question, but said, in a low, angry voice:
                  "Few sensible women, Ottilie, express such contradictory and inconsistent opinions
                  as you indulge in constantly. Often I have heard you say you thought society
                  dancing absurd, and all kinds of waltzing, without exception, unladylike, and
                  worse,—immodest."
               Of course I made no more remarks. After a few moments' silence he asked: "How long
                  do you intend staying in this noisy ball-room? I wish you had not taken the office
                  of chaperone on you. All dancing young ladies should hunt up their mammas, and not
                  bore mere acquaintances in this way."
               "Florence a mere acquaintance!" I thought, with a repressed smile. Poor Esau! I am
                  sure he was willing at that moment to barter his glorious birthright of genius for
                  a mess of the sweet savory pottage of gay youth. No wonder he was cross, for 
                     
                        "'T is a bitter thing
                        To see our lady above all need of us;
                        Yet so we look ere we will love."
                     
                  
               
               "I do not see that it is necessary for me to chaperone Miss Folham here," I
                  replied, "although I am quite willing to do so on our riding parties; her mother
                  will soon hunt her up. Suppose we go into the music-room and listen to
                  Venitia."
               On going there, we found that Venitia had only just commenced. Some gentleman was
                  at the piano when she came, and he had finished but a little while before we
                  entered. She was playing the Ghazel, which is a curious little creation. The
                  composer of it has made his music-poem correspond to the rule of the mental
                  word-lyric; there is in it one positive, well-expressed thought, reiterated in
                  various keys; the modulations are close and intricate; the accentuation strongly
                  marked and skilful. Venitia executed it not only with the dexterity it required,
                  but threw into it that delicacy and poetry of feeling which the composer had left
                  to the executante to supply.
               Of course it was received with great applause, and many earnest requests were made
                  for "something more." Venitia remained at the piano, as if she intended complying
                  with these requests. While she was listening to the pleasing compliments of Mr.
                  Rochester and some other persons, I saw her eyes fall under a glance from Luigi.
                  This look of his acted like a magnetic touch on her imagination; straightway
                  sprang up within her that subtle emotion which the true artist feels at the moment
                  of creation, and which spreads throughout the thoughts, enabling them to transform
                  themselves into vivid, graphic
                  pictures, adorned with rich coloring, so warm and glowing that they enchain not
                  only the senses, but the mind and will.
               Her fingers commenced slowly threading together some full chords, stringing them
                  in groups, which reminded me of brilliant-hued gems, well contrasted. While she
                  did so, her eyes wandered slowly over the room, with that calm expression of
                  magnetic subtleness which they now possess at times; she seemed to be weighing and
                  measuring her little audience. The compliments she had just received had been
                  those of taste and discernment, of the very nature to encourage an executante; there was not one breath of petty jealousy
                  near her, but a great deal of high, artistic culture and good breeding.
               I felt sure she meant to improvise, and I was right. It is only lately that she
                  has ventured on doing this in society; Luigi's encouragement, as well as capable,
                  friendly criticism, have been of much help to her. Few who were present this
                  evening knew what she intended doing; thus she was spared the embarrassment of an
                  announced improvisation. The conversation ceased, and every one listened. Luigi
                  caught her resolve with the instinct of a lover. He stationed himself near the end
                  of the grand piano, with folded arms, and brow a little bent, as if listening with
                  the critical but appreciative ear of an artist.
               Venitia shows in her improvisings the promptness she has in her character. She has
                  a great deal of decision and common sense,—two qualities particularly needed, and
                  often found lacking in the artist; these enable her to make a rapid choice of the
                  thousand and one suggestions which crowd in with perplexing confusion on the
                  instant of conception. Her subjects too are always simple,— like herself, open and
                  candid,—sweet succeeding harmonies, and resolutions whose tangles are intricate,
                  but not thorny; she manages them also with a freedom that is remarkable in one so
                  young; she has good breadth of handling, as a painter would say,—a quality that
                  partly arises from her close, rigid practice of many years which makes mechanical
                  difficulties of little moment, and also the strict scholarly culture she has
                  received, which removes from her all the embarrassment of raw, newly acquired
                  information.
               But on this occasion, I noticed much variation from her usual style,—the girl's
                  genius is developing under the influence of love. After the resolving chords of
                  the short interlude were over, and the spirited melodic thought well defined, the
                  beautiful image was suddenly disturbed, as a swift wind ruffles a streamlet's
                  mirror; weird chords, so combined as to sound like questions, fell in syncopation,
                  leaving the response mute in the measure; little bits of the motivo mingled in producing a curious effect, and some
                  vague but soft and pleasing passages flitted about, reminding me of the
                  pearly-gray shadows which creep out of dingles and wood hollows.
               Venitia uses the chromatic gamut in her rêveries
                  as a skilful singer employs it, pointing it with a trill; she also controls the
                  pedals with nice art, thus giving her melodic phrases the necessary
                  sweep,—horizon, as it would be called in painting. This clever pedalling enables
                  her to produce as fine contrasts in Tone distance as her melodic chord groupings
                  give of Tone coloring. After a powerful assertion of the Tone thought, she often
                  follows it with a passage con sourdine, as a
                  violin player would say. This dexterous combining of the soft and loud pedals does
                  not change the timbre of the sounds, but throws over them a haze,—an atmosphere of space and distance. This
                  obtained she advances the retreating sounds by adroitly removing the sourdine effect of the soft pedal, then her vigorous
                  trill, which is like the shrill throat-beatings of a lark, comes pouring down,
                  bringing out the foreground firmly and clearly. Her improvising this evening
                  possessed all these characteristics, and she carried us along with her so forcibly
                  that we forgot to criticise.
               Her admirable self-possession adds very much to the effect of everything she does.
                  Her execution is never flurried; her hands always retain their position. A French
                  gentleman said to-night they reminded him of Mme. Pleyel's hands; "Si bien posées,—elles ne grimacent jamais," was his
                  remark ("so well placed,—they never make grimaces or affected movements"). No
                  matter what may be the difficulties she encounters, the general position is never
                  lost. This good command of her hands is like a firm seat in the saddle, and it
                  makes her execution clear and flowing, every note coming out with satisfactory
                  roundness. The divisions of time, too, are accurately marked, which produce that
                  delicate shading and undisturbed rhythm so necessary to true musical expression.
                  Her manner in everything is a little measured, like the time in a fugue, and this
                  precision shows itself in her music, but the frankness of her nature allows the
                  warm breath of love which is now affecting her, to flow over her creations,
                  bestowing on them a freshness and vitality which is like the expression given to a
                  great fugue by a passionate and poetical executante.
               
               Through all the mysterious windings of her improvising this evening, not one of us
                  felt for an instant a shadow of anxiety; our faith in her power and ability was
                  not only unshaken, but it received a deeper hold; as I have said, we forgot to
                  criticise, and followed her lead obediently. The description I have given is long,
                  but her improvising was short, and yet so complete, so full of suggestive thought
                  and deep feeling, as to feed and occupy the minds of her listeners, without
                  wearying them.
               Presently the dark commingling harmonies grew clearer; the sorrowful questionings
                  ceased, as if the cause of doubt had been forgotten; no dissonances were heard;
                  the resolutions mounted joyfully; the broken bits of the motivo blended cunningly together, ruling with rejoicing triumph as
                  it were over the whole; and the improvising closed with one of her best executed
                  chromatic gamuts, on which sparkled here and there beautiful trills, as bright,
                  Philip said, as small diamonds, but they reminded me of pulsing auroras.
               The sensation which was produced by this display of poetical power in the person
                  of so young and beautiful a woman was very great; and it might be injurious, but
                  for the sweet balancing power of love. I am sure Venitia cared little for the
                  compliments paid by the crowd of notabilities who thronged around her. Luigi's few
                  words of praise, and the superb look of exaltation which sat upon his fine brow,
                  gave her all the satisfaction she desired. He seemed to forget his late reserve,
                  and during the rest of the evening was lifted up on this mighty wave of love-music
                  as on a throne. He took possession of Venitia without hesitation as if she
                  belonged to him, and she looked like a happy young queen who would fain put diadem
                  and kingdom down, and be a humble handmaiden to her beloved.
               But my old friend Philip was not so happily affected by the music; indeed, he was
                  very wretched I could see. He stood in
                  a corner silent and moody, and I looked about for something to divert him.
               "There is the great encyclopedist going into the library," I said.
               "What, L——!" cried Philip, arousing himself. "He is the very person I wish to see.
                  I was not at home when he called this morning. Let us go to him; if it will not be
                  a bore to you, I should like to have a little talk with him."
               I was only too happy to find my bait successful. We went into the library, and
                  Philip buried his chagrin in the pleasing excitement of a conversation with Dr.
                  L—— and two or three other agreeable men; but I could see that he had not overcome
                  his discomfort, and his annoyance served as a sharp sting to his conversation,
                  giving it pungency and point.
               I began to wonder in that way we women have of blending our sentiments and
                  intellects together,—driving four in hand as it were,—listening to cultivated
                  manly conversation, and all the while weaving our own little web of romance and
                  sweet folly;—I began to wonder, I say, how this affair of Florence and Philip was
                  going to develop, and all this I worked at while listening admiringly and
                  understandingly to a masterly description Philip was giving me of a subject which
                  is deeply interesting the learned encyclopedist.
               "You see, the thing is simply this, Ottilie," and he explained to me with some
                  little help from Dr. L—— and the other gentlemen, the plan of that famous tunnel
                  under the Straits of Dover, which the first Napoleon conceived, and the third
                  Emperor dreams of completing.
               "The bare idea is an epic!" exclaimed Philip.
               After Dr. L—— had pointed out to me the plan of the tunnel on a beautiful little
                  map or chart he had with him, Philip threw off, in his bold, impassioned style, a
                  description of the descent of the cars from the high land, glowing with sunlight,
                  to darkness far below the bed of the ocean; the roar and whirl of the
                  steam-engines, united to the dull din of the sea waves dashing imperiously against
                  that cuirass of rocks which shall separate the wild waste of waters above from
                  this world below; and then the sweeping grand ascent upward of the cars in the
                  middle of the Straits, to that Pharos of nations standing out in the sea on the
                  coast of the Bank of Warne.
               "Imagine," he said, "this subterranean road; a locomotive comes rushing along,
                  vomiting flame and fiery vapor; it ascends a vast well-like tower, and finds
                  itself on an island in the wide ocean. This island-port of Warne, as Lemoine says,
                  will be the most complete representation of cosmopolitanism and fusion of people
                  ever dreamed of, even by that great half-unknown French Franklin, Abbé de St.
                  Pierre. Ships from every nation, with the produce and people from all parts of the
                  globe, will assemble at this vast bureau of universal correspondence and
                  intercourse; at midnight, as vessels come sailing by on the open sea, the great
                  ocean light-house will beam on them, and its immense quays, lighted up by huge
                  reflectors, shall point out one neutral spot of land, ruling over two seas, a star
                  of hope and faith to peaceful nations."
               All this he sketched out with a graphic force and energy which set my blood to
                  tingling. While he was making one of his finest points, I saw his eye sparkle, lip
                  quiver, and I fancied I noticed a slight waver in the voice, as if some sharp,
                  sudden emotion had stung him: at the same time I felt a soft hand creep around
                     my waist. I turned, and there was
                  pretty Florence, looking almost penitent and entreating.
               Philip never noticed her, never stopped the shadow of an instant, but poured on
                  his fine eloquence as if unconscious of the sweet flattery her coming displayed;
                  and yet I knew that the haughty creature was feeling it in every bounding pulse of
                  his body. I drew the darling girl quietly down beside me, making room for her on
                  the large sofa, held her soft little hand with its pretty pink finger tips
                  tenderly in mine; and while Philip's lava current of description poured on, I
                  thought how lovely and refreshing youth is.
               The dear child sat looking up with rapt, half-conscious admiration of the
                  brilliant man. She, who had been a few moments before the little queen of the
                  ball-room, had thrown aside her rank and station and admirers, drawn by the
                  subtle, strange, but sweet magnetism of love to his side. How dreamy and happy I
                  felt as I looked at the two. I wished to say to him, Strange Philip! 
                     
                        "Look at the woman here with the new soul,
                        Like my own Psyche's; fresh upon her lips
                        Alit, the visionary butterfly,
                        Waiting thy word to enter and make bright,
                        Or flutter off and leave all blank as first.
                        This body had no soul before, but slept:
                        Now it will wake, feel, live—or die again!
                        Shall to produce form out of unshaped stuff
                        Be art,—and further to evoke a soul
                        From form be nothing?—This new soul is thine!"*

               CONSEQUENCES OF THE BALL.
               I WAS up so late last night, that when my maid came at the usual hour this morning
                  I dismissed her, and slept until ten o'clock. After I had breakfasted, I learned
                  that both Janet and Venitia had gone driving. Feeling as if I needed some pleasant
                  occupation out doors, I sent for a carriage, intending to drive to the Church of
                  L' Incoronata. I wished to be alone in the gallery of that old building, and dream
                  my waking visions beside those ceiling frescos of Giotto, which are so suggestive
                  to me of pleasing memories both in history and art; for if, as old Montaigne says,
                     "les historiens sont ma droicte balle," the
                  early artists are also "le vray gibier de mon
                     estude." 
                     
                        "At any rate, I love the season
                        Of Art's spring-birth so dim and dewy."
                     
                  
               
               While looking at Giotto's pictures, after studying those of the Byzantine school,
                  I understand well what F. Schlegel meant when he wrote, "Where clear intelligence
                  is combined with an instinctive power over the mechanism of a work, the glowing
                  apparition called Art, which we venerate and welcome as a stranger visitant
                  descending from loftier regions, springs at once into existence."
               Giotto! With that name what rich associations are connected. The friend of Dante, Petrarch, and
                  Boccaccio. The popular artist of one of the most brilliant and luxurious courts
                  ever known, where beauty and genius, and, alas! sin and sorrow also, dwelt. From
                  this painter's pencil has come to us, in the ceiling frescos of L' Incoronata, the
                  face of that lovely, hapless queen, Joanna. In this portrait she looks
                  pleasure-loving and insouciante; her long,
                  almond-shaped eyes ask only tenderness and ease; her full lips, soft cheeks, and
                  beautiful head, which bears the crown with sweet dignity, all express love and joy
                  more than pride and ambition.
               The haughty beauties standing behind her in this fresco picture of her
                  marriage—her cousins, Boccaccio's Fiammetta, and the Countess Durazzo—have enough
                  of these dangerous passions in their faces; but the countenance of this calm,
                  happy-looking woman is free from all harsh emotions. 
                     
                        "E tu madre d' amor, col tuo giocondo
                        E lieto aspetto."
                     
                  
               
               Pretty creature! She and her gay, pleasure-loving cousins had great poets for
                  lovers; world-poems to fetch down their names to us; and Giotto, "the lord of
                  painting's field," to give us their delicious forms; but alas! they had history,
                  also, to stand grimly by, and point with red, dripping finger to their poison
                  bowls and headsman's block and axe! 
                     
                        "merely born to bloom and drop,
                        Here on earth they bore their fruitage, mirth and folly were the
                           crop;
                        What of soul was left, I wonder, when the kissing had to stop?
                     
                     
                        'Dust and ashes'! so you creak it, and I want the heart to scold.
                        Dear dead women, with such hair, too,—what's become of all the gold
                        Used to hang and brush their bosoms? I feel chilly and grown old."*
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     *Browning's "Toccata of Galuppi."
                  
               
               When the servant brought me word the carriage was ready, I stepped out of my
                  window on the terrace, and found Philip there reading.
               "I thought I smelled your cigar. Why did you not announce yourself?"
               "I have been waiting patiently for you ever since Mrs. Dale went out," he said.
                  "You are going out also. May I accompany you?"
               "Certainly, if you wish to."
               "Where are you going?"
               "I intended driving to L' Incoronata; but as you doubt the verity of my beloved
                  Giotto frescos, you would be bored. Therefore we may go somewhere else, and I can
                  visit the old ceiling another time."
               "Of course," he said, in a gentle tone; "you allow me to be bored, and you yield
                  to instead of controlling me, and making me more amiable. Dear Ottilie, you are an
                  angel!"
               "Not quite, Philip. But say, where shall we go?"
               "To L' Incoronata, my friend; and I will promise not to utter one slighting word
                  against the objects of your sweet faith. Where is San Lorenzo? I wish to visit it
                  some time, for it is the church in which Boccaccio first met his Fiammetta."
               Love is making Philip heavenly, I thought. I let him lift me into the carriage,
                  arrange the cushions and footstool, and do everything for my comfort he could,
                  while I directed the coachman to drive to the Largo de San Lorenzo. While we were
                  driving there he said: "Ottilie, you and I should have been lovers. You understand
                  me so well. I wonder if any other woman could now be as patient and forbearing
                  with me as you are?"
               "If you loved her, Philip, she would not have the need; and as to understanding you, the knowledge I
                  have a wife should not wish,—indeed, would be better without."
               "Why, fair Portia?"
               "Because a wife does not need to understand her husband as I do you. Sweet love
                  and faith are her best gifts."
               "And have you not love for and faith in me?"
               "Yes, both; but, with them, a deeper knowledge of you, which places us abreast. I
                  am not the sort of wife you should have."
               "What sort of wife should I have, Ottilie?"
               "Some one to love you trustingly, confidingly, adoringly, with a young, fresh,
                  happy heart; just as I could and ought to have loved your father, Philip."
               Philip remained silent, but he held my hand in his kindly, and once in a while
                  grasped it with a firmer clasp. We reached the Franciscan church of San Lorenzo.
                  As we looked up at the great marble doorway, which is one of the last remains of
                  its original Gothic glory, and then stood under the vast stone arch, which spans
                  the interior with stern beauty, we helped each other's memory in running back over
                  the famous history of this great old church.
               Every stone we stepped on had a legend or commemorated a great name. The very
                  ground on which the church stands is classic. Here was the Forum, the Augustinian
                  Basilica, and near it a temple of Castor and Pollux, in old Roman days.
               The church was built by Charles of Anjou, that warlike, adventuring brother of St.
                  Louis, to commemorate his victory over the "flaxen-haired Manfred," at Benevento
                  (1266). Robert the Good and Wise, his grandson, finished it. Good and Wise! How
                  sad those titles make us feel; for when this good and wise king died, all those
                  virtues seemed to be buried with him.
               "Heavens!" wrote Petrarch to Cardinal Colonna, after his arrival in Naples, when
                  sent there on an embassy to the new government succeeding good old King Robert's
                  death,—"Heavens! what a change has the death of one man produced in this place. No
                  one would know it now. Religion, justice, and truth are banished. I think I am at
                  Memphis, Babylon, or Mecca."
               On entering the church, our first footsteps fell upon the tombstone of
                  Giambattista della Porta, that friend of all hasty, eager, nineteenth-century
                  students, who have so much to learn; for Time's book has grown very ponderous, and
                  life has not one day more added to its length, nor is its strength any
                  greater.
               "Blessings on the memory of the old Italian!" I said, as we stooped to read his
                  name chiselled in the stone, and the date of his death, 1515. "From his plan came
                  all these great digests of knowledge, called encyclopaedias, which has formed a
                  true community system for the mind, more successful than those which political
                  dreamers have attempted for governments."
               Then Philip hunted up the tomb of Tasso's enthusiastic friend and biographer, the
                  young Neapolitan nobleman Manso. After that we groped back in the old
                  Chapter-house, where we admired a remarkable window, and the vaulted halls, now in
                  ruins, which retain the original Gothic form of the church. As it was very dusty
                  and close there, we returned to the front and sat down in one of the polygonal
                  chapels, near the tribune or choir, where we talked over the Petrarch and
                  Boccaccio history of the building. It was in the monastery of this church Petrarch
                  resided during the period of his embassy from Rome to the court of the ill-wedded sovereigns, Queen
                  Joanna I, and her cousin-husband King Andrew.
               "Do you remember, Philip, the account Petrarch gives of the great storm which took
                  place while he was here, 25th November, 1343?" I asked. "Just fancy this church at
                  midnight, with the raging tempest outside and the poet Petrarch prostrate before
                  that pulpit; the friars and prior of the convent holding crucifixes aloft,
                  chanting litanies and prayers and burning incense, while the great body of this
                  church was filled with the shrieking people. Then the lightning flashing in at the
                  Gothic windows, and peals of thunder shaking the building 'from turret to
                  foundation-stone.' And as day dawned, the holy service of the mass commencing;
                  'but though the priests chanted Kyrie eleison, Christe
                     eleison, the rest of us,' says Petrarch, devoutly, 'did not dare lift
                  our eyes to heaven, but remained prostrate on the ground.'"
               "The closing of that famous letter," said Philip, "has the best part of the story,
                  and shows the courage of the poet as well as his piety. After mass was over, and
                  day had fairly dawned, he writes: 'Despair inspired us with courage. We mounted
                  our horses and arrived at the port. What a scene was there!' They found the shore
                  strewn with shipwrecked bodies, and a thousand Neapolitan horsemen assisting in
                  the burial of the poor mangled bodies. 'I caught from them a spirit of
                  resolution,' writes the poet, naively, 'and was less afraid of death from the
                  consideration that we should all perish together.'"
               "O yes, Philip, and when the sea sapped the foundations of the ground on which
                  they stood, and they rushed to a higher point of land, what a touching scene they
                  saw! The young Queen Joanna, with naked feet and dishevelled hair,—those beautiful
                  feet and that amber flood of hair, Philip!—attended by a number of her ladies,
                  rushing to the Church of the Virgin, crying out for mercy and help,—that very
                  Church of L' Incoronata we are going to presently, which is not far from the port,
                  you know. Poor young queen! Very blessed instead of fearful would death have
                  seemed to her then, could she have only known her dreadful future. Why do not
                  mortals accept death willingly when it first comes? Averted by prayers, it always
                  takes a more frightful form in the end, which end must come some time. Better
                  would it have been for her to have been swept out of existence by the fury of the
                  elements, than to live as she did through years of black, bitter shame, and then
                  have her sweet loveliness mangled by man's rage and brutality."
               "The Fiammetta must have been in that group of beautiful, frightened women," said
                  Philip. "Let us leave that sorrowful memory, and recall the gay Easter-eve a few
                  years before this terrific storm took place, when Boccaccio saw for the first
                  time, in this very church,—probably by this very column,—who can deny it?—the
                  Princess Maria, whom he made known to fame by the name of Fiammetta, forming thus
                  a quartette of beautiful women in the poetic diadem of Italy,—Beatrice, Laura,
                  Fiammetta, and Leonora."
               "Yes, Philip, but we shall put the gay, naughty Fiammetta in the back part of the
                  diadem. Beatrice shall be the centre gem, with the cold, chaste Laura and the
                  suffering Leonora on either side of her. Fiammetta must be content to shine alone,
                  and in the background; she is not worthy of being placed in any closer
                  companionship with these pure, good women, though a great poet did immortalize
                  her."
               
               Philip shrugged his shoulders saucily, and said, as we left the chapel and church,
                  "Commend me to a woman's charitable judgment of her sex."
               We drove to the Strada Medina, in which is the Church of the Virgin, of which
                  Petrarch speaks,—L' Incoronata,—near the street or Vica delle Corregge
                  (Corteregia). It is a small, unpretending building. On entering it there is a
                  descent of several steps, which De Reumont says is in consequence of the elevation
                  of the ground which has taken place since the sixteenth century. The exterior is
                  unsightly; and the crowding in of more recent buildings makes the place more
                  difficult to find. I remember I spent two or three mornings hunting L' Incoronata,
                  when I first came to Naples, never thinking it could be this insignificant-looking
                  chapel.
               We stopped, before entering, to look at the sculptures over one of the
                  portals,—the arms of the Neapolitan princes of the house of Anjou. On the right is
                  the red cross of Jerusalem, on the left the golden fleur
                     de lis of France, with the border of difference, and near these arms
                  are little angels holding up a crown of thorns. Poor Joanna! It was indeed a crown
                  of thorns thy wise and good grandfather placed on that golden head which he loved
                  so fondly.
               The famous frescos are in the choir of this church, which choir was formerly the
                  Capella Regis, or Royal Chapel, of King Robert's Palace of Justice. In this chapel
                  Joanna was married, when a girl, by her grandfather, to her cousin, Andrew of
                  Hungary, who proved to be not only a bad husband, but a wicked sovereign. He was
                  poisoned some time after his accession to the throne; the queen was accused of
                  being privy to the act, just as Mary of Scotland was charged with a similar crime
                  two centuries after, and for the same reason,—an ambitious cousin coveted her
                  crown.
               In 1352 Joanna married another cousin, Louis of Tarento, and built this church, L'
                  Incoronata, in commemoration of her second marriage, and also in honor of the
                  sacred crown of thorns of our blessed Lord. She incorporated in her new building
                  the little Capella Regis, making it the choir; for on its vaulted ceiling were the
                  fresco gems Giotto had painted for her grandfather, and they were a desirable
                  possession for the new church.
               This little bit of history is very precious to me, for it settles the doubts
                  against the authenticity of these beautiful frescos; which doubts were founded on
                  the anachronism that Giotto was dead fifteen years before L' Incoronata was built.
                  To be sure; but this little Royal Chapel of the Palace of Justice, the scene of
                  Joanna's first marriage, was decorated by this great painter when she was a girl,
                  many years before its annexation to her new church. Her grandfather was alive and
                  on the throne when Giotto painted the frescos on the Capella Regis. When L'
                  Incoronata was built King Robert and his painter friend were both dead, and had
                  been many long, sad years, and the girl-bride had grown to be a woman, was a
                  queen, had been an unhappy wife, a widow, and was dreaming of new happiness in a
                  second marriage.
               The authority for this opinion is Chevalier Stanislas D' Aloë, the distinguished
                  Secretary of the Musée; he has written a fine and exhaustive work on the subject,
                  which sets at rest all doubts.*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *Les Peintures de Giotto dans l' Eglise de L'Incoronata, à Naples. Berlin,
                     1848.
               
               The vaulted ceiling of the chapel, or choir, is divided into eight compartments,
                  on which are these great old frescos;
                  seven represent the seven Sacraments of the Church; the eighth contains the
                  Triumph of Religion, an allegorical picture, in which King Robert and his son
                  Charles the Illustrious (Joanna's father) appear carrying royal banners sown with
                     fleur de lis. In the Sacrament of Baptism the
                  portraits of Petrarch and Laura are supposed to be; and in the Sacrament of
                  Marriage (the one containing Joanna's portrait), Dante is pointed out. To see
                  these frescos to advantage, it is necessary to go into the gallery of the choir;
                  to reach this a narrow, dirty staircase and then a steep, unsafe ladder have to be
                  clambered up; but they are worth that or any trouble to me.
               On reaching this gallery of the choir, we sat and gazed up at these strange and
                  beautiful old creations. We traced out the fabled portraits of Petrarch and Laura;
                  then looked at the golden, gay wedding,—that sorrowful, ill-starred marriage of
                  Joanna to her cousin Andrew, commemorated by Giotto so gloriously; and we hunted
                  out in it a stern, hook-nosed, long-visaged face for Dante.
               "That face, Philip," I said, "whether it be Dante or not, is harsh enough looking
                  to be one of those wretched beings, in the existence of whom Italy believes
                  yet,—the jetatori,—they who have power through
                  their eyes to cast an evil fate over those they look upon. That man is the
                     jetatore of the picture. His priestly mantle
                  and cowl hang meekly enough, but that stern face sees farther into futurity than
                  the rest; and while all are gazing at the ceremony and the soft, voluptuous beauty
                  of the girl-bride, and the gay, imperious princesses behind her,—some tenderly,
                  some rejoicingly,—he averts his look, as if loath to cast his jetatura there. He need not fear his own sad power,
                  for Fate has been beforehand with him, and already cast her evil destiny in the
                  forms of unbridled licentiousness, strong will, and freely indulged passions. What
                  a sermon that Dante face preaches, however!"
               "I had rather hunt up the brilliant Fiammetta," replied Philip, laughing, "than
                  let those sorrowful events 'cast their shadows before.' On the whole, I think King
                  Andrew quite ugly and silly enough to be put an end to in any way. That fat,
                  leering priest beside him, looking like such a sycophant, is doubtless the wretch
                  Petrarch hated so bitterly, of whom he wrote with droll pedantry, 'In vice and
                  cruelty he was a Dionysius, an Agathocles, or a Phalaris.' But help me with your
                  woman-wit, Ottilie. Which one of those imperious-looking princesses is
                  Fiammetta?"
               "She who is standing to the right, directly back of Joanna; you can only see her
                  face and head. The pretty chin is raised, the full nostril dilated, and her superb
                  brow a little bent, as if looking at some one in the distance. She surely spies
                  her lover, Boccaccio, in that gay crowd of knights and ladies."
               "The outline of her face is beautiful," said Philip.
               "Yes, but it is not a face or a style of beauty I like. It is sensual, haughty,
                  and reckless."
               "She should have been queen," remarked Philip, "in the place of that luxurious
                  creature. Joanna should have had more firmness and less heart, if she intended to
                  be wicked."
               "No, Philip; if she was wicked, as you say, I like the way history gives it best.
                  Had either of those two imperious women stood in her place, the story would have
                  been revolting. The sweet, womanly touches of tender weakness, which we see in the
                  sad history of poor Joanna's regal sorrow and shame, give a soft haze to the
                     crimson flood of sin and grief that
                  flowed around the beautiful motherless girl as impetuously as love and pleasure
                  coursed through her veins. But look at that violin-player, Philip! how tenderly he
                  rests his cheek on his instrument! He seems to have forgotten the gay crowd, the
                  royal pageant, the courtly dance, everything, to listen to the sweet tone he is
                  drawing from his instrument: surely it is the voice of his ideal speaking to him.
                  Look, he has just caught it! Poor fellow, when you were alive, you lost it the
                  next instant; but Giotto seized you and it, and put you both there forever."
               It was a pleasant hour we spent in that old choir gallery; at last we rose to
                  go.
               "It is not yet three o'clock," said Philip, looking at his watch; "have you not
                  another church to show me, Ottilie?"
               "Yes; Monte Oliveto."
               And there we went. This church is a perfect gallery of monumental sculpture, as
                  well as of exquisite inlaid work of precious marbles. While we were admiring the
                  high altar, with its gay flowers and strange birds formed of malachite,
                  lapis-lazuli, verd-antique, and mother-of-pearl, skilfully blended, some clergymen
                  entered, and an afternoon service commenced. We withdrew into the beautiful
                  Piccolomini chapel, at the lower end of the building, to the left of the entrance.
                  This little chapel is the crowning jewel of the church. Over its altar is a famous
                  "marble picture, in relief," of the Presepio, or Nativity, by the Florentine
                  Antonio Rossellino. Vasari gives a glowing description of this work. There is a
                  great deal of tender life in this sculptured picture; as Vasari says, the little
                  band of angels hovering in the air over the Holy Infant, their lips parted,
                  chanting the Gloria in Excelsis, seem almost to breathe. The Virgin Mother looks
                  like a young, innocent girl; she has a round, immature forehead, with soft hollows
                  on the temples, which give the brow an infantile expression, and childlike
                  features; innocence, calmness, and simplicity characterize the whole creation.
               But the finest thing in the chapel is the tomb of the Duchess of Amalfi, to the
                  left of the altar when standing in front of it. This tomb is by Rossellino also,
                  and an exact copy of one he made for the Cardinal of Portugal, in the Church of
                  San Miniato, near Florence. When the Duke of Amalfi buried in this chapel his
                  young, lovely princess-bride, and with her his ambitions and hopes, he ordered
                  Rossellino to erect over her a counterpart of the Florentine tomb. She was the
                  daughter of a king. Her father was the unfortunate Ferdinand of Aragon, whose
                  ancestors' ashes rest in the velvet-covered chests in the sacristy of San Domenico
                  Maggiore, and who was so sorrowfully betrayed by the Great Captain, Gonsalvo de
                  Cordova, to that other Ferdinand of Aragon, Charles the Fifth's grandfather and
                  Isabella of Castile's husband.
               Duke Amalfi had also good lineage to boast of. He was a Piccolomini, and nephew to
                  a great Pope. His uncle was the celebrated Eneas Sylvius Piccolomini, Pope Pius
                  II., the learned secretary of the Council of Basil, and one of the finest scholars
                  that ever wore the triple crown, but who died of disappointment and mortification,
                  because, when he summoned all the princes of Christendom to go fight the heathen,
                  he found only a few pious old men ready to embark with him.
               Five years before this last crusade, projected against "Paynim dog," the beautiful
                  young Duchess of Amalfi lay down to sleep under this superb sarcophagus,
                  surrounded by worldly prosperity. Death must have sounded an unwelcome summons to her, and yet it was a
                  friendly, tender withdrawal from approaching sorrow; a few years after, her royal
                  father was wandering about, a deposed king, seeking a home and a grave in an
                  enemy's land.
               The fine tomb raised to her memory by her husband occupies the whole of one side
                  of the chapel. There is a large marble chest, of beautiful form and workmanship;
                  above this is a stone couch, and at each end a young child holds back the head and
                  foot drapery, showing the sculptured marble form of the Duchess, who lies in the
                  dreamless sleep of death; floating above her are two angels, and in the centre of
                  the panel behind her is a medallion, containing a Madonna and an infant Christ. A
                  finely-sculptured arch rises above the whole composition, and from this arch falls
                  a marble curtain, which is drawn and looped back on either side, knotted up in
                  light, graceful folds.
               After we entered the chapel, we sat still for some time on a high marble seat,
                  which runs along the wall opposite the tomb. There was some fine music being
                  played for the service at the high altar, and heavy, rolling pedal-notes from the
                  great double diapasons of the organ were filling the air with glorious sounds.
               I looked at the lovely marble effigy of the Duchess, and framed fanciful notions
                  about the invisible music-current, which like a subtle, permeating fluid was
                  making its way into recesses and around columns, in a manner very different from
                  light; it came pouring down from that great organ, like the rays of light from the
                  bull's-eye of a lantern, travelling forwards and sideways, upwards and downwards,
                  spreading as it proceeded; yet, from being more reflexible than light, it was able
                  to make its way around solid interpositions such as columns and walls, instead of
                  lying against them as light does, and casting heavy shadows.
               Sweet philosophy of sound! So should we wind around our pillars and columns of
                  grief. But we stand under the glorious arch of Divine Wisdom; we are as little
                  children; we cannot take in its perfect proportions nor see its sublime intention;
                  we can only sit down and mourn sadly in its shadow.
               The music filled the little chapel with its rich golden and purple tones; chords
                  and harmonies seemed to blend like curious broiderings on a fine tapestry. The
                  full, sonorous sound of the open diapason formed a solid groundwork. The music was
                  slow, the harmony dispersed, and many suspensions occurred in the progress of the
                  piece. Once in a while the stopped diapason was added, giving body to the pure
                  sounds of the open pipes; then the dulcinea was drawn, adding a haze or
                  atmosphere.
               Philip, who had been wrapt in meditation, suddenly started, and, leaning towards
                  me, said in a low voice: "Ottilie, there is a fine passage in De Quincey's
                  Suspiria which tells just the effect this music has had upon me: 'This harmony has
                  displayed before me, as in a piece of arras-work, the whole of my past life; not
                  as if recalled by an act of memory, but as if present and incarnated in the music;
                  no longer painful to dwell upon, but the detail of its incidents removed or
                  blended in some hazy abstraction, and its passions exalted, spiritualized, and
                  sublimed.'"
               He fell into a still deeper meditation, and gazed with glowing eyes at the richly
                  sculptured tomb raised by a husband's love over his young wife's dead beauty;
                  presently he turned to me, and said to me in a hoarse whisper: "That Duke of
                  Amalfi loved his wife, Ottilie, did he not? Tell me, what does the legend say? Did
                  he ever love another? Or had he enough
                  cold firmness to go through life without the warmth of a living love beside him?
                  Tell me."
               "I do not know, Philip. But he could have loved another and not wronged her; do
                  you not think so?"
               Philip looked at me keenly, and I returned his look with steadiness. I understood
                  the meaning of his strange talk, but I could not venture on such a sacred subject
                  unbidden. It was but an instant I had to wait, however, and then it came,—the
                  whole full tide of confidence. He loves Florence Folham with all the force and
                  strength of his matured nature, of his "old sorrow put to new uses."
               "Yes, Ottilie," he said, with deep feeling, "I, who had given up all hope of ever
                  loving again, and should have condemned myself for even thinking of such a
                  possibility, am out in that old whirlpool of doubt and fear and hope."
               "And why not, Philip? It is very right and natural."
               "You do not condemn me, then? You do not call it perfidy to the past?"
               I knew what he meant: he was thinking of Ellen; but we could not either of us
                  speak of her, and yet we were both true to her dear memory. I remained silent a
                  few moments; then taking his hand I said, 
                     
                        "'Because we love instead of sorrowing,
                        When life is shriven,
                        And death's full joy is given
                        Of those who sit and love us up in heaven,
                        Say not we "loved them once"!'"
                     
                  
               
               The organ ceased; after the benediction the high-altar service ended, and we left
                  the chapel. We drove along in silence for a while, I thinking much of Philip and
                  Florence. The love for her is beautiful, and comes most graciously in season. His
                  affection for Ellen was different ent: it began in his boyhood; there was no
                  doubt, or fear, or sweet, wild delirium about it,—a quiet, sweet blossom of the
                  spring-time of his life, which, if death had not intervened, would have ripened
                  into golden fruit. Just before we reached home, he turned half playfully to me and
                  said with a laugh, which was intended to hide his real feeling, "She may not love
                  me after all, Ottilie, for I have not asked her; and upon my soul when I think of
                  doing so, I wonder at my presumption in supposing such a blessed possibility."
               "How can you doubt it, Philip? Why, her love is as plain to be seen as yours;
                  clear as the sun at noonday. She reminds me of Coleridge's Genevieve. Go tell her
                  some tender love-tale; she would forget and fling herself into your arms as
                  naively as the poet's pretty maiden did."
               He shook his head doubtingly, and began to look very solemn. As he lifted me from
                  the carriage, when we reached our, own court-yard, I whispered to him gayly, "Have
                  courage, and, like Montrose, 
                     
                        "'put it to the touch,
                        And win or lose it all.'"
                     
                  
               
               He did straightway. This evening he came to me triumphant. When he told the dear
                  girl of his love and asked her to be his wife, she rose from her seat, stood
                  frankly before him, rested her two little hands in his, and when he put his arms
                  around her, she buried her glowing face on his shoulder and wept like a little
                  child.
            
            
               
               BEGINNING OF THE END.
               I HAVE been neglecting my journal for quite two weeks; and now I have so much on
                  my heart, that, woman-like, I wish to begin at the end, and tell that which is
                  troubling me most, instead of that which makes me happy. But, soberly and in
                  order.
               Philip is married! Yes, married and off. A few days after his pleasant and
                  gratifying acceptance by the Folhams,—who showed a very frank satisfaction at
                  having their daughter so "nicely established," as Mrs. Folham said,—he received
                  news of the death of an uncle in Germany, his father's eldest brother.
               The death of this uncle brings a great deal of business on Philip. He has to go
                  immediately to his father's old home in Saxony, to attend to the family affairs;
                  thence to America, to settle up the business interest which his uncle and father
                  had for many years together there, and which has been hanging half unravelled
                  since the death of Philip's father, owing to the age and ill-health of this uncle.
                  All the heirs look to Philip to settle matters; and he feels himself responsible,
                  as his father's representative, to have the business arranged promptly and
                  advantageously for all parties. But to do this might require a year's absence; and
                  to be separated from Florence ence such an age seemed to him an impossibility; yet
                  go he must.
               "Why separate at all?" asked the practical, straightforward Janet. "Why not marry
                  at once? You are no stranger to the Folhams, so far as name and position are
                  concerned; nor are they,—to me at least. And as for qu'en
                     dira-t-on, why need any of you care?"
               Common sense carried the day, especially as common sense and inclination went hand
                  in hand. Mrs. Folham, to do her justice, demurred a little, very properly; but the
                  approval of such persons as the American Ambassador and his wife, and Mrs. Dale,
                  also Philip's distinguished position, had great weight with her, and overcame her
                  "natural scruples," as she called them. Such scruples, arising from that sort of
                  delicacy which is the growth of society, not nature, generally seem satisfied with
                  a mere announcement of their existence; and as they are convenient mythical
                  feelings, perfectly innocent, on which society's proprieties can be hung, they
                  surely may be treated respectfully, as, half the time, they only ask to be
                  acknowledged, not yielded to.
               Florence behaved beautifully. The good, sweet girl, without any boldness or
                  forwardness, said frankly and trustingly, "I should rather be married at once, if
                  Philip wishes it, than wait for his return."
               So the affair was settled; and yesterday morning,—as midday is called, in such
                  matters,—they were married in full and proper state. I cannot stop to give all the
                  details, which at any other time would be so agreeable for me to dwell on,—the
                  costly gifts, the ravishing toilet of the bride, the touching, impressive
                  ceremony;—no, I must hurry on to that other romance, which has been blending its
                  scarlet and purple threads in with this lovely golden one, making up the sacred life-chord of joy
                  and sorrow. At the breakfast yesterday Luigi and I stood beside each other.
               "Now Edelhertz is off your hands, Ottilie," he said, with an attempt at
                  playfulness, "you can have a little time for me; shall you not?"
               I have been neglecting Luigi lately; but, to tell the truth, I have thought he
                  showed a disposition to avoid me. He has seemed for several weeks indisposed for
                  any companionship except that which we could have when all together. He has
                  excused himself from our rides, preferring to drive with Janet and Venitia. Our
                  little family circle has thus divided off during the daily pursuits of pleasant
                  occupation; uniting, however, always in the evenings over the music, or in
                  conversation with visitors on the terrace.
               But I have willingly yielded him up to Venitia, hoping that his love for her,
                  which has seemed to have an unaccountable tangle in it, might announce itself in
                  some way. I could not see how I was able to help him in the matter; and his
                  seeking Venitia's and Janet's society instead of mine appeared the most natural
                  path to the conclusion, which I had convinced myself, from outward appearances,
                  must come sooner or later.
               And it has come; but Heaven knows in a form and shape I little anticipated! Eager
                  and hasty as I was, a few pages before, to begin at the end, my pen falters as I
                  approach it. O, to shut up Life's book once in a while, and not open it again
                  until all the sad pages are passed over!
               I was very gay yesterday, as I always am when under the high-pressure of memory.
                  Philip's marriage could not be a true merry-making to me. It struck on the hundred
                  portals of the past; and there came thronging out around me the invisible
                  presences of the lost and gone, holding to my lips the weird goblet filled with
                  that rare wine of Cyprus, whose draught 
                     "Stirs the Hades of the heart,"
                   and gives an intoxication to the laugh and looks and manner, more subtle and
                  brain-wildering than any grape-juice of this earth's vintage can cause. So I
                  laughed sharply, and wore my gay face-mask bravely; but Janet, who knows me so
                  well, came silently and tenderly to me every little while, resting her hands on me
                  with sweet looks of sympathy and love. Luigi, too, who looked very pale and
                  haggard, kept close by me, and gazed wistfully at the scarlet hue which the secret
                  dripping of the old heart-wound sent glowingly up into my cheeks. After we had
                  seen Philip and Florence off in the steamer, and had returned home, I was standing
                  in the late twilight on the terrace with Luigi alone. He said, "I wish to have a
                  long ride with you, Ottilie. Can you give me to-morrow?"
               "Certainly. I shall need some pleasure of that sort badly. You know I believe in
                  appeasing the tumult of the heart by rapid movements of the body, my friend; so it
                  is very kind of you to think of it. But you are not going! Stay and drink tea with
                  us."
               "No, do not urge me. I cannot. I shall be here early in the morning. Say seven
                  o'clock, that we may go to Lago d' Agnano before it grows warm. We shall be gone
                  all day, remember; and—" he hesitated, then added hurriedly, "Ottilie, I wish to
                  have you all to myself to-morrow; so, let us be entirely alone."
               At seven o'clock this morning, therefore, before Janet or Venitia were awake, we
                  were trotting out of the courtyard yard
                  gate, on to the broad, lava-paved Mergellina. The morning was glorious, and we
                  cantered nearly the whole route, for both of us felt an indescribable
                  embarrassment. We soon arrived at our old haunt of Lago d' Agnano, and rode around
                  it, and through the neighboring paths, until we felt tired of the saddle and
                  wished to break-fast.
               We found the lovely lake as still and delightful as it had been in early spring,
                  when we used to go there in the commencement of our pleasant friendship. The woody
                  hills which surround it closed in more shadily than then, and the soft, grassy
                  banks we found not yet touched with the heat, which is growing so oppressive in
                  Naples as to make us talk of the necessity of seeking some Capri or Sorrento
                  retreat for the midsummer months.
               We rode up to the trattoria, where we
                  dismounted, left our horses, and ordered refreshments for the day. The beautiful
                  Roman woman Delaïta, who keeps this Lake inn, gave us a friendly greeting. She
                  helped me off my horse, and took me from the saddle in her strong, beautiful arms
                  as if I had been no heavier than one of her own "iron-jointed, supple-sinewed,"
                  dusky babies who rolled jollily about on the ground, almost under the horses'
                  heels.
               Luigi and I had a pleasant chat with her; then as we walked slowly off from the
                     trattoria to go into the woods, we talked of
                  her beauty as if we had not observed it a hundred times before. We stopped a
                  little way from the house, and noticed her fine points as she moved gravely
                  around, with the slow, dignified step of a Roman matron of antiquity.
               Delaita indeed seemed more beautiful than usual this morning, giving us a good
                  excuse for growing enthusiastic astic over her. She stood sideways for a while,
                  affording us a chance of observing the simple but powerful outline of her person,
                  the fine poise of her head and neck, and the richness and quantity of her glossy
                  black hair. The form of the necks and shoulders of these Roman women is
                  bewitching. Some one has said that the graceful lines formed by the movements of
                  their heads and throats recall those of swans and doves; and it is so.
               We admired the gay yellow and green of her dress, the rich knot of hair fastened
                  at the back of her head by a long gilt bodkin, and the bewitching little curls
                  that strayed rebelliously out of the pin-fastening and clung as caressingly around
                  the broad, firm base of the head as that brown boy of hers who clambered up at her
                  feet.
               We noticed her self-possession and tranquillity with the restless children, the
                  screaming donkey-boys, and the passing travellers, the calmness with which she
                  responded to the thousand and one demands made on her by babies, boys, and people,
                  and her still dark eyes gazing on everything quietly. Those eyes of Delaïta have a
                  rich, full look, such as may be seen in those of some fine cow, or beautiful dog,
                  or horse; and when we see this look in them we say, "How human!" Yet, again, when
                  we see it in human beings, the animal look, free from coarseness, just in its
                  simple, true nature, is always suggested to us.
               This subject thoroughly discussed and the pleasant little savory breakfast Delaïta
                  had sent us—of fruit and curds, delicious bread, and really good black
                  coffee—finished, we took a leisurely stroll among the hills. We walked along in a
                  silence which was only broken by some vague, half-understood, indeed only
                  half-uttered, remarks on the beauty of the landscape. We had chosen the side of
                  the lake to the west of the trattoria, on a
                     beautiful slope, where, under the
                  shade of the trees, we could loiter or ramble at will.
               Each was full of an unexplained anxiety. I knew Luigi had asked me to take this
                  ride purposely to give himself a chance of relieving his mind of some annoyance.
                  To request me to be his intercessor with Venitia seemed absurd; the girl's frank
                  acceptance of his attentions, and innocent, unconscious admiration of him, his
                  superiority in her eyes over all other persons, surely must have made him certain
                  of her love already.
               No, there must be some other obstacle than doubt as to her feelings I was certain.
                  His restlessness and unhappiness at times, his fits of "frolic grief" after these
                  sombre moments had passed, all proved to me that there was some impediment to a
                  disclosure of his love; an imaginary one I felt sure, heightened by the
                  exaggerated apprehensions of a young man in love; such as comparative poverty, or
                  the fear of inflicting on his beloved the troubles and privations of exile, which
                  to him, an Italian of high rank, brought up without a profession or positive means
                  of support, might seem terrific. But although I thought whatever obstacles the
                  young man's delicacy had conjured up could be readily dispersed by the plain light
                  of a friendly talk, there was a silent anguish about him which made me feel—I did
                  not know why—uneasy.
               A shady, solitary part of the woods attracted us, and I sat down on a rustic seat
                  under some trees, while Luigi walked leisurely up and down, trying evidently to
                  appear occupied with the enchanting scene around him. How I pitied him, and yet I
                  could not help him. For is not Venitia almost like a young sister to me? Therefore
                  I could not urge him to an avowal of what should be voluntary tary. He turned
                  suddenly and looked at me. I suppose my face must have expressed very strongly my
                  perplexed feelings of sympathy and anxiety.
               He came to me as if intending to speak, then sat down on the ground near me in
                  silence. Luigi is never melodramatic; his Saxon blood tempers the Italian
                  fire,—indeed, the southern current seems to make him languid under intense
                  excitement, where a northerner might show something like emotion. He has always
                  about him a refreshing repose of feeling as well as physical quiet, which is so
                  very attractive in a person who possesses as he does capability of passion and
                  energy. It is this self-control which gives him an unconscious air of superiority,
                  and has made me feel from the beginning, he could do nothing ignoble. He gathered
                  some delicious violets that grew within a hand's grasp of him, put them in my lap,
                  and then looked earnestly up in my face.
               "We plighted brother-and-sister faith, Luigi, soon after we met," I said, half
                  playfully; "let me claim a sister's privilege in entreating you to tell me if I
                  can help you in any difficulty you may have."
               I could not endure silently the appealing look of this usually self-sufficing man
                  any longer.
               "I do not wish to intrude on your confidence, my friend," I continued; "but
                  intrusion or not, however it may be, I do wish to relieve your mind, if possible,
                  of this unspoken trouble which is making you so very miserable."
               "Ottilie," he said abruptly, "after all, I think the expansive confidence of some
                  natures, like yours for example, is far better, nay, wiser and safer, than the
                  prudent reserve of mine. Now, of your whole life I know, and also of Mrs. Dale,
                  and—"he stopped as if he had touched a nerve, then he continued: "But how
                     little you know of mine. Fear of
                  intrusion keeps me silent; then the reserve which is taught us early in life, here
                  in Europe,—where concealment of one's personal matters is regarded, if not exactly
                  a virtue, certainly a mark of refinement,—acts upon me. But"—here he sprang to his
                  feet, and stood erect before me—"no matter what may have been the reason for my
                  yielding insanely to a wildering temptation, you, you, Ottilie, will surely do me
                  justice,—you never will accuse me of meaning anything dishonorable by this
                  reserve."
               "Never, Luigi,"I answered promptly. "I would trust you, my friend, as I should
                  Janet or Philip, and I have felt so from the first."
               I held out my hand to him, for he was looking intensely sad; he took it, and as he
                  sat down on the bank again he pressed it to his lips with the graceful courtesy of
                  an Italian.
               "But, Ottilie," he said in a low voice, the anguish of which I shall never forget,
                  "this reserve is now becoming dishonorable."
               He trembled with emotion, and remained silent, as if not daring to trust his
                  voice, and I felt a hot tear fall on my hand. I was perplexed and distressed. I
                  rested my other hand on his head as if he were a boy whose young heart had been
                  wounded bitterly by some injury or insult; but I could not say anything, except a
                  tender, soothing reiteration of his soft Italian name, "Luigi, Luigi."
               Then followed a sad story, which put us both in a woful tangle. An obstacle to his
                  love for Venitia! I should think there was. And this obstacle is nothing more or
                  less than a wife.
               He had married very early in life one to whom he had been betrothed by his parents
                  in infancy; it was a mariage de convenance, so
                  common, as we all know, in Europe. Soon after, he discovered that his wife was no
                  companion for his heart, head, or life. She was wealthy and high-born like
                  himself, but ignorant,—and worse,—vain and impure. When Luigi made himself
                  obnoxious to the government and had to leave Milan she gladly returned to her
                  mother's house, where, under the protecting shelter of her roof, she could lead,
                  as a married woman, the life she best liked,—a life of veiled impurity, shrouded
                  by all decent attentions to the outward proprieties of social life. They luckily
                  never had children, and their separation, so agreeable to both, had continued for
                  years, indeed would last for life.
               "Indeed," said Luigi, "I was beginning to forget I had ever been married. My
                  immediate kindred having all died, my associations lying far, far away from the
                  social circle in which my wife moves, and this for so many years, I have had
                  nothing to recall to me that which was for a short time the misery of my
                  existence. I do not suppose any friend or acquaintance I have in Paris, Rome, or
                  Naples, except his Eminence, know of my former real position or marriage; the name
                  I bear is an obsolete one of my family, quite forgotten. I have always known that
                  my wife and her relatives would be only too happy if they never heard of me again,
                  and I—I embraced willingly the life of freedom which a humbler and unknown station
                  afforded me.
               "When I met you and your friends, I entered frankly and without scruple into the
                  pleasant, friendly commerce which an acquaintanceship with you offered me. Had you
                  belonged to the ordinary class of women, having a daughter or sister to marry of,
                  I should have avoided you; but we met
                  as intelligent, thinking, active-minded people; we had no thought of marrying or
                  giving in marriage. For a while I imagined our happy intercourse might last
                  forever. Some nights, after leaving you, I have sat in my library and lived over,
                  in fancy, a future spent with you as your brother, travelling, studying, living
                  real life with you. But now," and the young man looked hopelessly up at me,—"now,
                  my dear, dear friend, it is at an end,—all this future; for I love Venitia. Love!
                  my God, I adore her!"
               There was no reason for condemning the young man. My straightforward woman's wit
                  saw that. There had been no perfidy meant. Had he intended to be dishonorable, he
                  would never have disclosed his real situation, but gratified his love by marrying
                  Venitia. We had been completely in his power.
               This young man had met with us, liked us, visited us. We were three women, as he
                  said, who had no thought of hunting up husbands, and were quite as ready to enjoy
                  a frank, honorable friendship with a good, intelligent man as with a pleasant,
                  honest woman.
               Thus I rapidly reasoned on the subject; consequently, there was no mute reproach
                  in my manner, but a freely expressed sympathy. Venitia has drawn a prize of
                  passionate true love in her life-lottery; the prize simply cannot be made
                  available. I think I felt all the time more sorrow for Luigi than for her. He will
                  be so hopelessly lonely in the future. Self-sufficing as men are, their loneliness
                  is more withering and desolate than ours.
               We spent the whole day wandering about on the banks of that beautiful lake,
                  talking of Luigi's past life. During all this long conversation, I gathered that
                  which I have been able to put into immediate information, for he was loath to
                  condemn his wife when he first told me his story.
               Sunset came, beautiful, golden, gorgeous. It had been a glorious day; but we had
                  not enjoyed as much as we usually do this lovely place,—the overarching trees, the
                  soft, half-sleeping winds, the buoyant clouds, and the deep pulsating blue of the
                  sky. But the fever and torment of acknowledgment was over; a generous, just
                  sympathy had been given; and now, as evening approached, we both felt calmer.
                  Before leaving the lake, we sat down again to enjoy as much as possible the
                  beautiful close of the day.
               All the tumult of life seemed to me to be suspended. The wind rose up as if it had
                  been reposing on the broad bosom of mother earth, and commenced toying with the
                  branches and leaves of the trees on the other side of the lake; then it came
                  frolicking over the water, breaking it into a million of sparkling ripples, while
                  the tops of the trees on our side bent down to meet its passionate grasp. I grew
                  reconciled with life and its shortcomings. A superb balance appeared to be
                  established before me, as I thought of the "mighty and equal antagonisms" of
                  grief, which are rolling up forever like waves, making broader and deeper our
                  capabilities of feeling for each other's sorrows.
               But Luigi, though calmer, seemed more sad than he had in the morning. Then,
                  something remained to do; now, it was done, and the certainty of his fate stood
                  sternly before him. There was a quiet melancholy on his face, which was very
                  sorrowful to see. We returned home as silently and rapidly as we came, and parted
                  in the court-yard with yearning looks for a hope and a help which neither of us
                  dare give to the other.
            
            
               
               A NOCTURNE.
               ALL day Venitia has been so constantly with us, I have had no chance to talk to
                  Janet alone. However, after tea this evening she went into the salon to the piano, and Janet and I remained out on
                  the terrace.
               Where a deep feeling or an urgent necessity imposes explanation, the words come
                  naturally if we will only let them. I never trouble myself about preparing what I
                  shall say or do in an emergency; the power that permits the difficulty will supply
                  means of supporting or extricating us, if we only trust firmly; and so it was in
                  this case.
               I told Janet, as soon as we were left alone, all that had passed between Luigi and
                  myself yesterday; and the just, generous-hearted woman received the sorrowful
                  information as I knew she would. I felt instinctively, without his telling me,
                  that Luigi dreaded Janet's first hearing of his position. He could not comprehend
                  her as I did, of course.
               There is in Janet's character a clearness of mental sight, a strength I love to
                  call manly, and a nobility of feeling, which, with a little more demonstration, a
                  little more show of tenderness, would make the life-harmony sound exact to
                  unskilled ears. She is so just in her judgments, and so charitable and indulgent
                  withal, that she has taught me many a lesson of true love; and yet our ordinary
                  friends would much sooner come to me, in a questionable difficulty, than to
                  her.
               But I am more expansive, more demonstrative, although not naturally so free from
                  prejudice or so capable of generous judgment as she. She is cold in manner, and so
                  strict in judging of her own actions, as to leave the impression she would also be
                  of others; and this debars many from seeking and receiving her truly valuable
                  counsel and sympathy.
               She has a way of knitting her fine broad brow and pressing the forefinger against
                  the firmly compressed lips, on approaching a subject, which somehow, I don't know
                  why, arouses antagonism, and makes those who do not know her shrink from baring
                  their wounds; while probably all the time she is interrogating or giving herself a
                  rigid self-rebuking, not judging unjustly her opponent or companion.
               The broad brow grew terribly tangled, and, as she leaned on the railing of the
                  terrace, listening to my low, rapid, earnest words, her finger pressed like a
                  wedge of iron on the lips, which seemed to rebel in an eager pout against
                  restraint. I fancy Luigi would have shrunk in pain had he seen her then, fearing
                  the cold, worldly judgment of a selfish woman, who intended obstinately to see
                  nothing but the falseness of his position towards us, in the inevitable trouble it
                  would bring to her. But I knew her better. I had not one instant of doubt as to
                  how she would receive it; only I could not help thinking of all this. She spoke
                  not a word, but sat for some time in deep thought. At last she turned towards me
                  and said, in a voice of deep emotion, which she tried, in her usual way, to veil
                  with a little laugh,—
               
               "What mad people we have all been, to be sure! Poor Venitia, Cleopatra-like, she
                  has melted a priceless pearl in the cruel acid of an impossible love."
               I made no answer; I had nothing to say.
               "Come, Ottilie," she continued, "you must not sit so silent, so dreamy. I do not
                  often want word-comfort, you know, but I do now. Can you not tell me some of your
                  satisfying philosophy about art's needing trials, and artists requiring the
                  heat-of disappointment to ripen them?"
               This forced lightness could not last; she came towards me with a curious look of
                  mingled appeal and distress, and as she rested her forehead on my neck, this
                  self-sufficing woman said, in the most tender and touching tone of voice: "Am I
                  not almost the girl's mother? Tell me, Ottilie, what am I to do when she hears
                  this solemn hour of renunciation striking?"
               I knew it was not counsel my strong friend wanted; it was words only,—words which
                  might give her something on which to hold as human, in this first wildering moment
                  of a kind of trouble she, so experienced in all such lore, had never encountered.
                  And I had so little to say to that, which I thought would be most fitting. Indeed,
                  to the clear, crystal tone of that heart note, what mortal words would not sound
                  dull? But she was out on the waves of a wild ocean, and, as I said, any human
                  voice of tenderness and sympathy was something to hold to, to help her to think
                  and grow him. So I did as we always do in such cases,—I talked platitudes.
               "Dear Janet," I said, "I think a love which is prevented by oppositions of some
                  kind from becoming tangible, from taking positive form and shape, is to a highly
                  intellectual creature the most perfect incarnation of love. Love that reaches its
                  consummation in this state of being is apt not to survive its own peculiar season;
                  but love which is altogether pure and holy, such as this of Venitia and Luigi,
                  which angels might witness and feel, and which is free from all mortal soil, is
                  immortal; and if those to whom is given this divine grace remain true to the gift,
                  they will already have in their possession a sweet, mysterious blossom, which has
                  come trembling down into their hearts from a purer sphere, in whose celestial soil
                  they shall find the roots of that delightful tree which bears fruit and flower,
                  and no thorn."
               We sat in silence on the balcony; the undemonstrative Janet leaned her head on my
                  shoulder, and allowed my hands and lips to rest caressingly on her soft cheek.
                  Venitia was alone in the drawing-room, improvising, as she loves to do at this
                  twilight hour. She enveloped us in her harmonies. A broad, grand musical thought
                  lay superbly sketched out before us in the moonlight. Then she wove around and out
                  from it a curious musical web of involved modulations, and as De Quincey, in his
                  enchanting description of the Palimpsest, says of the pursuit of the various lost
                  handwritings, she "hunted back the chords through all their doubles, and as the
                  chorus of the Athenian stage unwove through the antistrophe every step that had
                  been mystically woven by the strophe," so she chased back in a chorus-like chain
                  all these tangled suspensions and modulations until she reached the glorious
                  starting-point, and her original motivo rang out
                  supreme.
               "Talk to me, Ottilie," whispered Janet; "your words comfort me. But do not tell me
                  you have no belief in the perfect, purple fulness of wedded love; for, my friend,
                  I have seen and known it, even though for so short a season, still it was a
                  reality and must also be immortal. The
                  appointed and peculiar season of Paul's love and mine will be eternity."
               Venitia's vague, questioning improvisings wound around us like graceful, weird
                  arabesques.
               "The love of husband and wife," I said, "when the holy sacrament of Love is
                  partaken by both, the sacred chrism anointing both brows, and the Real Presence in
                  their hearts, is rare and almost too great a happiness for mere mortals."
               Step by step Venitia's modulations mounted to dizzy heights, reminding me of poor
                  Piranesi's aerial dream flights of stairs, forever ascending, forever overhanging
                  perilous abysses, and he forever standing on their highest rounds.
               "But," I continued, and my words, said to the measure and beat of that wondrous
                  music,—unwritten language of the newly-awakened Psyche in the girl's passionate
                  soul,—sounded more effective than these poor written ones,—"but, Janet, beautiful
                  as such love is, 
                     'With darkness and the death-hour rounding it,'
                   there is much more attraction to me in an unavowed or unaccomplished
                  love,—one which is set to that divinest key of life, the minor key of
                  renunciation, and which gives rise to the most wildering soul-harmonies.
               "Love, struggle, suffer,—then comes the true harvest of the soul; and such a love
                  and such a fate has tragic beauty and sublimity, far exceeding those which are
                  called happy loves, for there is shown an exercise of power, the overcoming of
                  some great contending force, all telling an exultant tale of a moral combat and a
                  moral victory."
               Venitia commenced weaving in skilfully with her own thoughts chords which were
                  leading to the solemn portals of Beethoven's Marche
                     Funèbre (Funeral March on the death of a hero, Op. 26). The grand
                  drapery of purple and gold seemed to envelope us, and give even a tinge to the
                  moonlighted air, which was heavy with the odor of orange-blossoms; and the fair
                  starry flowers turned up to the cool night as if asking also for tenderness.
               "Such loves," I said, drawing my friend closer to me,—"such loves, Janet, have
                  carved great statues, painted glorious pictures, and written grand poems. Vittoria
                  Colonna put life into stone; and she, with the two Beatrices,—one with the myriads
                  of Madonnas surrounding her, like the palpitating fond of angel's heads in her Sanzio's pictures, and the other with
                  the 'Divina Commedia' encircling her heavenly brow as with a halo,—shall tell age
                  after age how Angelo, Raphael, and Dante loved."
               The solemn chords of this sublime March tramped with majestic step on the air, and
                  we listened in silence to Venitia's touching execution of this creation, which
                  tells of death, not in its sorrow, or its despair, but in all its pomp and
                  glory.
            
            
               
               WANLUCK.
               HOW prompt Janet is. This morning while I was at breakfast she came into my room
                  to show me a note she had just written Luigi, It was this:—
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "DEAR LUIGI,—We know all. We must part, my friend. Do not let us drive
                              you from Naples, however; for we shall make our arrangements to leave
                              immediately. Before we go, of course you will come to see us. Venitia
                              wishes to say good by, and I a God-speed to you.
                           "Keep up heart, my poor friend. How many of us live over the
                              separation caused by death, and are able to do our duty; and so must
                              you in this trial. I cannot ever write or speak half I feel,
                              especially when my heart is fullest; so do not think my note cold. You
                              have no warmer, more sympathizing friend than
                           
                              "JANET DALE."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               The note was sent to his apartments, and I was certain he would reply to it
                  immediately in person; so I dressed quickly and went out. I thought it wisest to
                  be absent during their interview. I knew Venitia and Janet could manage their
                  trouble best alone.
               We do not need our friends in the first moment of sorrow. When all is over, and
                  the new grief and old way of life meet,—ragged, rough, obstinate selvages, that
                  must be fitted and adapted together patiently,—then those who love us can help
                  us.
               I spent the morning at the Church L' Incoronata, studying the Giotto frescos; for
                  if we leave Naples so soon, these are among the things I shall wish to keep
                  freshest in my memory. In the afternoon I stopped at the nice cake-shop in the
                  Strada Chiaja, near the Toledo, and took dinner. That over, I lounged in at
                  Detken's awhile, looked over their new books, and selected some fine large
                  photographs, which they have just received, of the surrounding places. One, of our
                  glorious, mysterious Temple of Serapis, took my fancy,—it was so finely executed.
                  We must have it, and indeed all the others, to take with us as pleasant
                  mementos.
               Leave Naples! It makes me very sad to think of doing so. I am not half or quarter
                  through. There are the old palaces with their pictures, and Pæstum unvisited;
                  and—O, so many places! But some time in the future I may return. However that may
                  be, I shall not separate myself from Janet in her sorrow. Italy is full of
                  delightful abodes for persons who have our tastes and pursuits, so one place is as
                  agreeable as another. At all events, I must try, in my little way, to make a new
                  resting-place pleasant to them.
               Near sundown I drove into the court-yard, and found Luigi's carriage there. As I
                  entered the anteroom of the salon, I was witness
                  to a touching little scene. Near the door were Luigi and Venitia. Neither of them
                  saw me, for I was hidden by the muslin curtains and drapery which hang over the
                  archway between the two rooms. She stood facing me, calm, pale, and still. He had
                  hold of her hand, and was just bidding adieu. His back was towards me, and I could
                  not see his face.
               
               "Grant me one favor, Venitia," he said.
               "Certainly," answered the girl, frankly.
               "Let me kiss that pure, clear forehead of yours, which will always rest in my
                  memory as the brow of an angel."
               Without hesitation she leaned forward to him and received the kiss. Then resting
                  her strong, beautiful hands on the young man's shoulders, she looked earnestly in
                  his face for a moment, drew him close to her, put her arms tenderly around him,
                  and, with a faint little sob, kissed him on his lips.
               "Now go," she said in a broken voice, "and may God help us both!"
               She left the room without looking at him again, and he tottered by me, never
                  noticing my presence, blind and deaf with his great sorrow; for the parting was as
                  hopeless as death to both.
               Luckily the Rochesters came in this evening, and several other visitors. I say
                  "luckily," because it broke up the gêne of our
                  trouble. Venitia was excused from receiving them on the plea of a headache,—that
                  convenient, available indisposition for a woman. Janet and I talked to them all
                  the evening composedly, and I even sang a few ballads; but we both felt as if
                  acting in a dream.
               Before parting for the night, Janet and I had a little talk on the terrace. She
                  told me that Luigi came immediately on receiving her note this morning. He leaves
                  to-night for Paris. We shall go to the Baths of Lucca for the summer, and decide
                  there where we shall spend the coming winter.
               Janet says he spent the whole day with them, talking tranquilly, and was more
                  self-possessed even than she had dared to hope. She bade him good by a little
                  while before he left, in order that he and Venitia might be together alone. I did
                  not tell her what I had seen. Some day I shall give her this journal to read; then
                  she will know what was too sacred to be put in spoken words, even to her.
               When I came to my bedroom, I found on my table a short note from Luigi, bidding me
                  good by, enclosing his banker's address in Paris, reminding me affectionately of
                  our brother-and-sister troth-plight, asking me to write to him, and signing
                  himself my "brother Luigi."
               God bless and help him in his sorrowful future, which will be very lonely. Now, if
                  I were a man, I could go and be a brother to him, and make life much more easy and
                  bearable. And if life in this social world was as pure as it should be, I, a
                  woman, could be his true sister-companion. But there is no use in trying to alter
                  the prejudices of the world by fretting at or acting contrary to them. It is much
                  wiser to adapt ourselves as patiently as possible to these judgments and rules,
                  unjust and petty as they may seem to us; for, on the whole, they are right, and we
                  find them safest in the end.
               It is now full time for letters from America. Even supposing the missing mail
                  should be lost, which I fancy is so, a second one is due, and from it I must hear
                  the worst or the best. I look for these letters anxiously; in the centre, as I am,
                  of all this joy and sorrow of those I love, I cannot forget my own causes of
                  inquietude. Happiness is, after all, comparative. For instance, I, who have so
                  little in a worldly or social point of view to make me happy, and not at all
                  likely ever to possess any more, should feel something akin to happiness if I
                  could see the time when the arrival of home-letters would cease to be a cause of
                  anguish to me.
               O for a draught of Lethe! O that the separation between us and the living dead might be as silent
                  and impassable as the grave! The powerlessness of the dead to wrong the living is
                  a merciful limitation. But man governs this life, God the other; and knowing this,
                  why do we not, the little time we live here, submit more patiently to a power
                  which we know is a fleeting usurpation? The old Greek gave wise counsel:— 
                     
                        "Do not spurn against the pricks,
                        Seeing that he who reigns, reigns by cruelty,
                        And not by right."
                     
                  
               
               Good old John Newton said that he worked at the crosses and difficulties of this
                  life until his knuckles were sore; then he gave up and left them all for the Lord,
                  and straightway they were righted and removed. How I wish I could rest mine fully
                  in his all-powerful hands! But this capability of yielding up one's anxieties is a
                  grace in itself, for which we must also wait patiently. So many of us, when
                  shouldering weighty burdens of grief, feel like poor Constance,— 
                     
                        "That faith would live again by death of need;
                        O, then, tread down my need, and faith mounts up;
                        Keep my need up, and faith is trodden down."
                     
                  
               
               
               Venitia has been very ill. To my surprise, she gave up immediately after the
                  separation from Luigi. I should have fancied, from my previous knowledge of her,
                  that she could have borne, almost stoically, any amount of grief; but this subtle
                  power of love has changed her whole nature. She is out of danger now, and as soon
                  as she is able to travel we shall leave here.
               
               My American mail has come, and with it a wilderness of woe.
               
               A sudden shock of grief takes away the moral strength, and leaves scars behind
                  that open and ache with every breath. Such sorrows as these are the real diseases
                  that make both body and mind aged, even more than those fierce physical attacks
                  which leave the body broken and infirm.
               
               The cold-hearted calumny, the pitiless persecution, the cruel laugh and sneer, the
                  torrent of bitterness poured into a heart which God has already bruised, is a
                  woful human work. And when is the anguish ever to end? For, alas! there are some
                  natures who, while they tread down a falsehood and walk boldly, proudly, yes, even
                  highly and holily over it, apparently unharmed by the adder, feel a fang which
                  strikes in at their hearts, and leaves a mortal misery gnawing there forever.
               O for a vigorous, well-educated will that is able, like Janet's, to mount to the
                  level of any summit of emergency, and bear unflinchingly the fierce storms of
                  trial. Very beautiful is her character; its material was firm enough in the
                  beginning to bear the sharpest instruments of sorrow, and the master hand of
                  discipline has sculptured it into a lovely shape. Then her will, instead of being
                  warped and weakened under the fierce heat of trial, has grown into crystalline
                  firmness.
               Such beings remind me of what I have read about the formation of mighty mountains;
                  some fiery process compressed together their atoms, and the sharp cuttings of
                  Heaven's storms chiselled out their fair outlines; thus purified and formed, they
                  lift up their lofty peaks in serene, majestic silence, piercing the great
                  empyrean.
               But there are volcanic hills as well as granite heights, alas! and as I look over
                  on Vesuvius weeping its fiery rain,
                  bathing its sides with a hot, angry flood, I cannot help murmuring,— 
                     
                        "Great Architect of all!
                        When Thou didst build the fire-devoted hill,
                        Thou gav'st it but the semblance of a life!
                        Say, was it merciful to frame man's heart—
                        So finely fibred—on the selfsame plan?"
                     
                  
               
               
               Several days have passed in consulting, arriving at conclusions, and making
                  arrangements. The mind becomes fearfully bewildered when a wave of sudden sorrow
                  first breaks over it; but if one waits patiently, this wretched indecision passes
                  away, and the confusion takes manageable form and shape.
               I have resolved to return to America and face full front this shameful grief. I
                  have written to Philip that I shall meet him there; I shall need his presence and
                  protection. Nor shall I be left alone in the mean while. Dear Janet and Venitia
                  instantly decided on accompanying me,—kind friends! And Janet makes light of their
                  generosity.
               "Why, you know," she says, cheerily, "it will be of infinite service to Venitia,
                  such a total and complete change for her in every way will be obtained by it."
               Venitia, too, takes great interest in the proposed journey. It seems to give her a
                  fresh impulse. When the news of my trouble came, it was the first thing that
                  aroused her and brought back her natural self. The resenting of my wrongs by
                  indignant words of sympathy appeared to be a relief for her,—a vent for her own
                  unuttered suffering.
               We have had in view many ways of returning. As Philip cannot be in America until
                  autumn, I do not care to arrive there before he does, nor do I wish to remain in
                  Europe; therefore we have plenty of time before us, and Janet proposes we should
                  return by a sailing vessel. We have often longed for the chance or opportunity of
                  taking a slow, leisurely voyage on the ocean; and as Venitia is still feeble from
                  her severe illness, it will be better for her.
               Janet thinks that the monotony and stillness of such a voyage will be beneficial
                  mentally to us, as well as physically; quiet down the fever and fret, cause the
                  fierce vibration of feeling to fall back into a steady pulsation, give me courage
                  for the coming struggle, and Venitia strength to accept with woman's endurance the
                  new life.
               So we have concluded to take the sea-voyage. Mr. Rochester and our banker have
                  kindly undertaken to charter for us a nice, safe fruit-ship on a return voyage.
                  They have in view a pretty little clipper, now at Constantinople, but which will
                  be in Palermo in a fortnight.
               And now it is not a mere partial farewell to Naples I am taking, with the prospect
                  of a fair journeying to some other delightful place, but probably an eternal
                  farewell to Europe,—a sight of the Promised Land from Mount Pisgah and then a
                  mournful turning back into the old Wilderness. A mysterious, wayward destiny
                  controls some lives.
            
            
               
               LEAVING NAPLES.
               OUR last night in Naples. Dolce Napoli! We sail to-morrow afternoon in the steamer
                  which runs between this city and Palermo. There we shall join our little clipper,
                  which boasts the fanciful name of "Zephyr." It was originally a war-steamer, built
                  with great care for Santa Anna of Mexico; but the news of his downfall came just
                  as the little naval toy was completed, then it was altered into a sailing vessel,
                  and put on the Mediterranean and Levant fruit service.
               Every arrangement has been made for our comfort. Janet, whose easy means enable
                  her to indulge in extravagant luxuries when she wishes,—and this she loves to do
                  for the pleasure of others,—has had a good cabinet piano fitted into the cabin.
                  She has also had strong water-proof cases made, and had them lashed to the
                  quarter-deck; in these have been placed a small, well-selected collection of
                  books. The preparing for this voyage has given her infinite satisfaction, and she
                  has not forgotten even such pleasant and palatable luxuries as wines, fruits, and
                  the like. She came to me yesterday holding up triumphantly a peculiar looking tin
                  box; it had a curious arrangement for the lid, which I did not comprehend.
               "It is a water-proof case, and can be closed hermetically," said Venitia,
                  examining it. "What is it for?"
               Janet enjoyed our surprise a little while, then going to my desk, took this
                  journal, clasped it, and laid it in the box.
               "For Ottilie's journal!" exclaimed Venitia.
               "Yes, she is the only member of our family who keeps one; and if any accident
                  should happen to us during the voyage, I should not like to have the book lost. We
                  shall not be sunk at sea any the sooner for making preparations for such an
                  event," said Janet, coolly.
               So nightly I am to shut up this precious volume in the box.
               To-day I heard from Luigi. He wrote to me immediately on receiving my letter which
                  informed him of our intended return to America. He begs of me to keep him always
                  advised of our movements, and to do as he shall,—write at stated times unfailingly
                  and trustingly, even though we may sometimes miss hearing from each other. He
                  makes no allusion to his late trouble, mentions Janet and Venitia naturally, sends
                  his remembrances to them; altogether the letter is just such a one as he might
                  have written two months ago, before he and Venitia had gathered the sad fruit of
                  knowledge, which has driven them from their paradise.
               I knew that from his writing thus, he wished his letter to be seen by them, so I
                  handed it to Janet. She gave the letter to Venitia without any remark. When it was
                  returned to me I found pencilled on the margin, in Venitia's handwriting, "Dear
                  Ottilie, remember me affectionately always to Luigi whenever you write to
                  him."
               Jean Paul somewhere speaks of "concluding a great past with a little present";
                  such has been our farewell night in
                  Naples. We have had a crowded, talkative evening; all our friends calling to say
                  good by. We shall miss many of them a great deal, for our social surroundings here
                  have been very agreeable. The Rochesters, who have been our most pleasant
                  acquaintances, we hope to meet again in America, and keep up unbroken the
                  intercourse which has ripened an acquaintanceship into a very deep feeling of
                  regard.
               But we shall miss most of all our beautiful surroundings,—this lovely home,—for
                  home it has been,—a home that has seen the birth and growth of pure, deep love, a
                  strong temptation resisted, the brave facing of bitter sorrow, and the triumph of
                  honor and true feeling.
               Beautiful, golden, glorious Naples! with thy rich sunlight, pure moonbeams,
                  pulsating blue sky, and atmosphere filled with delicious life-drops and exquisite
                  odors. Often in the future, while far off in my American home, my heart shall
                  stretch out tender, yearning memories to this enchanting place.
               Angelini the sculptor, who also called to bid us good by to-night, said to me, in
                  his soft, melodious Italian voice, "Ah, in Naples one needs so little. The simple
                  act of living, the breath Nature gives us here, is a priceless luxury in itself.
                  Here sight and sense are fed most gloriously by the good God."
               They have all left, and I have come to my room to be alone with my fast-rushing
                  thoughts. Janet and I have been walking up and down the terrace silently together,
                  looking over at Vesuvius, whose lava streams still flow, though sluggishly. The
                  beautiful lichen-hung hill above the terrace is buried in sombre shadows, although
                  the sky is glowing with stars,—the hundred-eyed Argus watching for the lost
                  Io,—for the moon is gone. It is near midnight, and this living whirlpool, this
                  noisy, shrieking Naples, is comparatively quiet; around us all is still, but from
                  the more densely inhabited part of the town arises a hum and beat like the roar of
                  a distant ocean or the fevered throb of a factory.
               Venitia is in the drawing-room, "holding commune sad and sweet" with her lovely
                  Erard, from which she is to be parted forever. Now her hands sweep voluptuously
                  over the ivory rocks, like the grand swell of some shining wave holding aloft on
                  its dashing crest a divine sea-nymph. That most delicious of all nocturnes,
                  Chopin's "Murmurs of the Seine," floats on the air,—a true music mist and spray.
                  The plaint and descending gamut in the motivo,
                  sparkle just as I have seen the shafts of moonlight, when standing out on the
                  terrace in the Villa Reale, fling themselves passionately down on the innocent
                  bosom of the sea, and break into golden spears and arrows of light, while the
                  waters washed up against the stone foundations of the terrace, as if in sweet pain
                  and sorrow.
               Venitia is in a true playing mood to-night. Now she is improvising. She seizes the
                  music-grapes, and, Bacchus-like, crushes out the purple and golden flood of
                  music-wine. Her fingers seem dripping with the rare, priceless juice; and as they
                  rise and fall on the keys the rich, invisible liquid sounds gather around me like
                  a delicious flood of many waters, and bathe my suffering senses in the sweet
                  intoxication of 
                     
                        "Desires and Adoration,
                        Winged Persuasions, and veiled Destinies,
                        Splendors and Glooms, and glimmering Incarnations
                        Of hopes and fears, and twilight fantasies,
                        And Sorrow with her family of sighs,
                        And Pleasure blind with tears, led by the gleam
                        Of her own dying smile instead of eyes."
                     
                  
               
               
               O, this potent rhetoric of music that stealeth away all weapons of pain and
                  steepeth the whole being in a wave of exquisite rapture, soothing the sting of
                  "wounds that will never heal, and silencing the pangs that tempt the spirit to
                  rebel"!
               But, alas! just as this gloomy pageantry of "Winged Persuasions" had quieted all
                  unrest with their Lotus draught, there comes creeping on the ear a despairing
                  interrogatory,—solemn, dumb, questioning chords, followed with wildering,
                  maddening doubt,—pure Wan-hope! And with these sorrowful chords the music ceases.
                  Poor Venitia!
               And now to bed and to sleep, but not to partake of sleep's sweet refreshment; for
                  it spreads no banquet for the heavily laden, but sits down a solemn veiled ghost
                  beside the sepulchre of our buried hopes, like Buonarotti's spectre, watching over
                  the dead Duke Lorenzo. 
                     
                        "In our hearts
                        There is a vigil, and these eyes but close
                        To look within."
                     
                  
               
            
            
               "CONCA D' ORO."
               WE arrived quite early at Palermo yesterday morning. On approaching the town we
                  were charmed with its loveliness. Putting Vesuvius out of the question, it is as
                  beautiful as Naples in its ravishing surroundings. It rests on the bosom of a
                  sloping plain, which plain is called, on account of its luxuriance and fine
                  situation, Conca d' Oro,—Shell of Gold.
               First, the city spreads graciously out; back of it are rich forests of orange and
                  lemon trees, and here and there the curious nut-tree with tufted top;—these form a
                  rich framework; then around and above this foliage arise sloping mountains,
                  ascending in terraces four thousand feet high, whose bold edges lie clear against
                  the soft blue of the heavens.
               This lovely island was the home of ancient mythology, the throne of the gods of
                  Hellas. Jupiter reigned on Etna, and held chained under its fiery feet the giant
                  Enceladus. On its plains of Enna, Proserpine was roaming, when Pluto carried her
                  off to his dread abode. The whole land was Ceres' kingdom. In its forests, Diana
                  and Minerva rambled in their girlhood. Here Vulcan forged his thunderbolts,—hence
                  the name of the island Vulcania Tellus; and here also the terrible Cyclops lived. The story of Acis and Galatea,
                  the myth of Polyphemus, with old Homer's songs, all bubbled up in our memories, as
                  we fell stormily into port under the raging, shrieking sound of our steamer. 
                     
                        "Arethusa arose
                        From her couch of snows
                        In the Acroceraunian mountains,"
                     
                   I chanted half to myself and half to Janet as we stood in the end of the boat
                  looking with eager eyes on this island, which spoke like a huge, many-leaved
                  illuminated book to us.
               "You are thinking of that delicious story and poem of Alpheus's pursuit of
                  Arethusa, which the poet Read has painted with as much inspiration and beauty as
                  Shelley's verse tells it," said Janet; "but the memory roused in me is a more
                  strange, mysterious one. The shrieking noise of this steamer, the various things
                  around me which tell of man's strength, remind me of that weird myth of
                  Polyphemus. Do you remember, or did you never hear, the old Norwegian version of
                  this Polyphemus myth?"
               I nodded my head affirmatively, and she continued:—
               "The child, through adroitness, not strength, you know, deprived the Trold,—the
                  northern Polyphemus,—of his eye, and thus not only took from him a divine power,
                  but held him in subjection. He made the Trold give him gold and silver, and also
                  two bows, the arrows of which were unfailing in their aim and flight.
               "So it is with man the pygmy. He has cunningly seized on the eye of Nature, and is
                  wresting from her all her secrets. She gives him the treasures of the earth, the
                  steel bows of lightning, and that unknown power called magnetism, on whose
                  viewless current fly with unerring aim the swift arrows of intercourse. Then the
                  relation between Man and Nature, how like to the legend also.
               "After the Trold granted the child's requests, he and his brothers retired sternly
                  and quietly into darkness, leaving the boy in ignorance of their greatest
                  secret,—who and what they were! All he knew was, that they represented a vast,
                  mysterious, giant power, which could be governed only through adroitness and
                  skill.
               "So Nature acts with man. He may wrest marvellous gifts and secrets from her, but
                  after a sullen and unwilling bestowal of them, the great Cause of all these
                  wonders recedes into the darkness of silence and mystery."
               Just then the current of passengers ebbed back against us; there was a dragging of
                  luggage, and a bustle which interrupted our pleasant talk. The steamer struck the
                  wharf, and people sprang eagerly ashore and aboard; among those who came on the
                  boat were the courteous American Consul, Mr. B., and our captain, who were in
                  search of us.
               We went with them directly to our vessel, and were much pleased with it. This
                  beautiful little sea toy, which is to be our home for so long a time, the
                  gentlemen tell us is a safe, swift sailer. The appointments of the clipper are
                  very satisfactory; there are three nice state-rooms, small, but prettily finished,
                  as indeed the whole vessel is, with mahogany; then there are berths back of the
                  cabin for our two maids. The piano fills up most of the space to be sure, but we
                  do not intend using the cabin as a dining-room. We shall take our meals on the
                  quarter-deck, where a low awning can be stretched to protect us from sun and
                  rain.
               After establishing ourselves aboard, seeing that all the trunks, boxes, provisions, etc. were arranged
                  properly, and dining comfortably, we accepted the kind invitation of the Consul to
                  drive through Palermo, and drink tea with his family.
               "You have arrived just at the luckiest time," he said. "To-night is the vigil of
                  our great fête of Santa Rosalie."
               The first thing we did was to drive out the Palermo Toledo, to see a colossal
                  statue of the saint, which we found in a huge pavilion, mounted on a car or
                  chariot, that is to be drawn by over fifty oxen. It was a curious compound of
                  stucco ornaments, gay flags, plaster statues of various saints and flying cherubs,
                  with our old Neapolitan friends, the little colored glass cups and tapers,
                  arranged in all manner of forms, so that when the whole structure shall be
                  illuminated, which is to be every evening of the fête, it will produce a superb effect.
               The fête continues five days, and we wished we
                  could stay to see the whole of it, but the captain was anxious to sail with the
                  first fair wind; the illuminating of the cathedral dome with twenty thousand
                  lights was in itself a sufficiently strong temptation to us, but such experienced
                  travellers as ourselves know we cannot see everything that is attractive.
               On our drive through the town we found them decorating the houses and stores with
                  the inevitable glass cups; strings of them were suspended in every direction,
                  forming stars, crosses, monograms of "Mary" and "Our Lord," and every other
                  religious device and shape that could be thought of. We were glad to see one more
                  illumination before we left Italy.
               First, we drove out on the fine old promenade of Palermo, the Marina, or Cours de
                  Bourbon, which used to be the fashionable drive. It commences at the Porte
                  Felice,—the entrance to the Toledo, where the statue and car stand,—and extends
                  along the bay shore to a public garden called the Flora, with its beautiful Villa
                  Julia, which was built nearly a century ago in honor of a viceroy's wife, Julia
                  Guevara Colonna. The Marina is also adorned with fine statues by various Italian
                  sculptors and costly buildings, but its most striking adornments yesterday were
                  the large transparencies and preparations for the evening's illumination and
                  to-day's procession.
               After leaving the Marina we returned to the Toledo and drove out its full mile
                  length. This Toledo, when it reaches the centre of the city, is crossed at right
                  angles by the Strada Nuova, another grand avenue or city artery like the Toledo.
                  The square or place where the two streets intersect each other is an octagon
                  called the Villena, beautifully decorated with fountains, statues, and fine
                  buildings. These two great streets of Palermo divide the city into four equal
                  quarters, the Loggia, the Kalsa, the Albergaria, and Siricaldi. Very Moorish
                  sounding are these names; the old name of the Toledo, too, was Al Kassar. Indeed,
                  I noticed on driving through the town the Saracenic and Moresco style of its
                  architecture. Some of the houses have high, large, iron balconies to the second
                  floor, like those in Spanish towns, recalling to me what Philip had said of
                  Palermo, "that it should be the city of iced sherbets, serenades, and silken
                  ladders." The convents have grated fronts to their balconies. The whole appearance
                  of the city is pleasure-loving and luxurious. Palms and cacti on the surrounding
                  hills and by the roadside Moorish buildings, Saracenic names,—we felt as if
                  transported by some enchantment suddenly into the Oriental atmosphere of an
                  Arabian tale.
               We did not visit any churches or interiors of public buildings, as we had only enough time to drive
                  through the town to its most prominent points; for, beside supping with the
                  Consul, we wished to see the Marina illumination, and our captain looked for a
                  favorable wind at midnight. When we passed the Cathedral Santa Rosalie, the sight
                  of it deepened the Moorish impression which the other buildings had already made
                  on us. It is half Norman, half Moresco in its architecture; for in Saracenic days
                  it was a mosque.
               It dates back to the twelfth century; but the delicious climate of this fabled
                  home of the gods has not blackened or injured the stone. The indentations of the
                  festoons and other carvings which run around its margins and domes lay against the
                  sky clear, fresh, and golden-hued, adorned with the gift of eternal youth. We were
                  told that the interior would disappoint us; but we knew it contained some tombs we
                  should have liked to have had time to look at.
               The tomb of Roger—the great Roger, who was father to Tasso's Tancred—is there;
                  also his daughter's, that "mighty Constance" whom Dante's "gentle Beatrice"
                  unwillingly condemns; and her son's, the gallant Frederick II., "the third and
                  last great Suabian blast," as Dante sings; these three famous old tombs still
                  stand in that Cathedral, though the world has swung around with many fierce
                  plunges during the long six hundred years' sleep of their famous occupants (Roger
                  II., 1154; Constance, 1198; Frederick, 1250). Janet caught my eye as the carriage
                  rolled slowly by the handsome old building, and heard me saying to myself, 
                     
                        "This is the luminary
                        Of mighty Constance, who from that loud blast
                        Which blew the second over Suabia's realm,
                        That power produced, which was the third and last."
                     
                  
               
               "Yes," she said, "it is a pity we cannot see her tomb. I, too, should like to
                  stand beside the resting-place of that woman, who 'held affection to the veil,'
                  even after she was wife and mother; and, to uphold her son's rights, 'did what she
                  would gladly have left undone,' as 'gentle Beatrice' says."
               "I always thought Beatrice made a delicate 'distinction without a difference' on
                  that point," I replied. "Divine judgment did not agree with her also, for the
                  great Nun-Empress had a pleasant place allotted her in Paradise: Piccarda's
                  glowing description proves this. She describes her as 
                     
                        'This other splendid shape which thou behold'st
                        At my right side, burning with all the light
                        Of this our orb.'"
                     
                  
               
               It was useless to lament over the pleasant talk we might have had beside that
                  "single slab of precious porphyry, and the superb canopy of six columns of white
                  marble," which are said to mark the resting-place of this wedded nun, who at fifty
                  years of age left her convent, where she had lived from early youth, to become an
                  empress, and mother to one of the greatest monarchs history has chronicled.
               "At an age when a woman has few hopes left of obtaining a brilliant
                  establishment," Janet drolly remarked, as we lost sight of the church, "this
                  cloistered Princess became the bride of the handsome young son of the mighty
                  Barbarossa, and mother of that imperial warrior, philosopher, and graceful
                  troubadour-poet, Frederick II. During the reign of this great son of Constance,
                  Palermo was one of the most polished cities of Europe; and it was in her father's
                  reign, King Roger II., that the first Italian verses were written."
               
               We drove out to the extremity of the Strada Nuova (also Macqueda and Favorita, as
                  this other great street has been called at different periods; for, like the
                  Spaniards who built it, it carries a legion of names). There we found what
                  Europeans call "an English garden"; a sort of park, with fine walks shaded with
                  trees and shrubbery, and pleasant drives. This place is now the popular promenade
                  of Palermo; that capricious authority, Fashion, bids "everybody" to come here,
                  instead of going to the old and much more lovely resort on the Bay, the Marina,
                  with its superb sea-view, fine Flora garden, and pretty Villa Julia.
               We left the carriage and walked through some of the paths. The whole fashionable
                  world was there. It was at the hour of sunset; and the rich dark foliage of the
                  orange and lemon trees, the livelier greens of the other shrubs and trees, the
                  sweet odors, golden sun-beams breaking in between the branches, and gay world
                  around, made us also forget the Marina and its deserted loveliness.
               The fashionables were in every variety of modish costume,—gay walking, dinner, and
                  even light gossamer evening dress, as can be seen in all Spanish and Italian
                  summer-evening promenades; and they displayed also every style of equipage that
                  could be thought of. A dashy little affair flew by us several times; it was
                  something like an English drag, painted in gay colors, and "picked out" in gilt,
                  looking like a royal state-coach; it had four horses, two abreast, and two
                  jockey-like postilions; the livery and mountings were brilliant, and it did not
                  appear so gaudy as one might suppose, under the glowing sky and fine Vanity Fair
                  surroundings. We were told that the young gentleman who was in it, its master, was
                  the Duke of Monte Leone, whose mother is a woman of immense fortune and curious
                  reputation. We remembered, then, having seen this Duchess and suite on board the
                  steamer which brought us to Palermo, and observing that she was a bold,
                  handsome-looking woman.
               The whole scene was Parisian, a bit of Bois de Boulogne. It was strange to be thus
                  suddenly jostled against modern artificial life, after driving through those old
                  Saracenic streets, our memories filled with Middle-Age legend and poem, and those
                  old legends too seeming new, alongside of the myths we had recalled when first
                  landing on this "happy island of the gods, these eternally classic heights of the
                  ancient world."
               After leaving this gay throng, we drove to the Palazzo in which the Consul lives.
                  Its court-yard, stairways, corridors, and rooms made me think of old Moorish
                  tales. We supped with the Consul and his family, and then re-entered the carriage,
                  which was waiting in the court-yard, and drove through the streets, blazing with
                  illuminations, to the crowded Marina.
               We drew up in front of a large marble building, designed by King Ferdinand II. as
                  a shelter for an orchestra,—a costly, unsuitable place; for the columns and
                  architectural construction cause the greater part of the music to be lost, or to
                  fall upon the ear with muffled sounds; but on this evening I rather liked the
                  effect.
               Our barouche was on the outside of a throng of fine equipages, and very near the
                  sea. The Marina was superbly lighted. Near our carriages were some large
                  transparencies, which made the place look like a grand picture gallery. They
                  represented, in glowing colors, various incidents in the life of the famous
                  Sicilian Saint whose fête was being so superbly
                  celebrated.
               
               This Princess Rosalie was the niece of the Empress Constance. When she was a young
                  girl, she was so saddened with man's doings that she left palace, court, and
                  knightly lover, and went clambering up, all alone, the rugged, thorny sides of
                  Monte Pellegrini, 
                     "To liberty and not to banishment."
                   There on this lonely mountain the pious maiden lived out her innocent
                  existence, far removed from the storms which the fierce Barbarossa and haughty
                  Hildebrand, the struggling races and faiths, were making together out in the
                  world. But she was safer in those dripping mountain caverns, with the thorny
                  cactus fortifications and in far-off, forgotten loneliness, than if, like her
                  brilliant aunt, she had chosen one of the gay new convents in the royal city of
                  her grandfather, Roger.
               In this abode, rude and harsh for one so tenderly reared, she lived and died in
                  sweet ignorance, I will dare vow, of all the vivid stories her "exalted mount"
                  could read to me; her saintly thoughts were never disturbed by the gorgeously
                  illuminated myths, which would dance before my eyes, from every island point, as
                  brilliant as some of the rare, gay-colored leaves in one of her own curiously
                  painted Missals or Hour Books.
               Blessed ignorance, and thrice-blessed faith! The gentle maiden soon slept a quiet
                  sleep; "in the flower of her youth and beauty she died,"—so the legend says; and
                  her long slumber was undisturbed by the clashing of arms, the swaying to and fro
                  of the Christian and Paynim world; for five stormy centuries she rested there
                  quite, quite forgotten.
               Then a fearful pestilence raged in the island; and holy men were directed, in
                  sacred visions, to go to a lonely cavern on that grand old headland for relief.
                  They went in solemn procession, holding the Cross aloft, with banners swaying to
                  and fro, and clouds of incense arising; priests and peasants clambered up the
                  rugged, zig-zag paths, to whose rocky sides the moss scarcely clings, and in a
                  dark, dripping cavern, near one of its highest points, they found the remains of
                  the fair maiden. They gathered together these sacred relics with pious reverence,
                  and carried them to the suffering world. Wherever the procession moved, sickness
                  ceased; and the grateful Sicilians made the saintly girl their Lady Patroness. For
                  over two hundred years her memory has been lovingly preserved.
               The bleak, bare cavern in which she wept tears of anguish for that poor father
                  whose name has come down to us laden with the sorrowful title of "Bad," and where
                  she sighed out in solemn solitude her last gentle breath, has been adorned with
                  all the costly decorations the loving Catholic faith so tenderly hangs around its
                  beloved sanctuaries. A monastery and a church spring finely out from the side of
                  the mountain-height, and cathedrals and churches are raised to her memory in every
                  Sicilian town.
               I thought pleasantly of all this old history and legend while I sat leaning back
                  in one corner of the barouche, looking out on the dim outline of the coast towards
                  Cape Zaffarina, which stretched off its picturesque indentations of bays,
                  isthmuses, and headlands, with the starry heavens above and sparkling waters
                  beneath.
               The dull plash of the waves against the shore mingled curiously with the heavy,
                  muffled sound of the Overture to Sicilian Vespers. The undulating rhythm of the
                  opening movement in the Overture, and the clarinet solo, sounded like the
                  mysterious beat of muffled oars in bright waters, and the violoncello passage was as dark and sombre as these very waves
                  of the Palermo bay are said to look even at the brightest noonday, for the shores
                  and mountains hem them in so jealously that they keep every ray of sun-glitter off
                  from their pure crests. We did not talk,—not a word was spoken,—each one sat
                  still, enjoying the pleasant sights and sounds.
               Midnight struck, and we drove along the Marina to the vessel, which we found ready
                  to sail. We bade our kind, gay entertainers, good-by, and after the little
                  rocking, dancing boat had carried us to the ship's side, and we had clambered up
                  the ladder, we settled ourselves in the hammocks, which are slung on the
                  quarter-deck, and there watched in silence the starting of the vessel. The
                  beautiful outlines of Monte Pellegrini lay sharply cut against the clear sky,
                  which was crowded with thickly studded stars, while Palermo, with its many lights
                  growing a little dim, looked like some half-extinguished meteor dying out on the
                  bosom of the valley.
               On leaving the harbor, we sailed towards Cape Zaffarina, at the eastern arm of the
                  bay. This movement gave us a fine view of Santa Rosalie's home, Monte Pellegrini:
                  it is one of the boldest mountain headlands in Southern Europe, and said to
                  resemble Gibraltar, being nearly as high.
               The scene produced a delightful effect upon me. I listened to the plash of the
                  black water against the vessel's side, breathed the novel and peculiar odor of the
                  sea, noticed the graceful outlines of the mountains, the bright, starry heavens,
                  whose fire-points seemed to throb and scintillate like pulses and sparks, while
                  quick-changing memories pursued each other with shadowy haste through my mind. The
                  surging of the vessel rocked all sights, sounds, and thoughts into a curious
                  compound, from which arose a succession of strange, grotesque forms, created by
                  that mysterious "chemistry of sleep called dreams" and the opium-like power of the
                  sea.
               Solemn processions seemed to wind up the mountain-paths, contending armies
                  thronged the coast, and gay pageantries filled the ocean. The various epochs of
                  the past presented themselves before me, and these shores gave up their dead in a
                  brilliant, curious phantasmagoria.
               There was the magnificence of Tyre and Sidon blending with mediæval splendors; the
                  fierce conflicts of Punic wars, raging beside crusading knights, when 
                     "Christian swords with Persian blood were dyed."
                   Romans, Northmen, Saracens, and Christians all mingling in one wild, hot
                  contest; while floating over the whole changing vision, as a brilliant sun-lighted
                  mist, was the faint memory of strange myths glowing with the far-off light of
                  ancient poesy,—fleeing nymphs and pursuing gods, quick-leaping fountains holding
                  aloft exquisite forms of beauty, cresting waves bearing divine shapes,— 
                     
                        "The feast of Neptune, and the cereal games,
                        With images and crowns and empty cars;
                        The dancing Salii, on the shield of Mars,
                        Smiting with fury, and a deeper dread
                        Scattered on all sides by the hideous jars
                        Of Corybantian cymbals, while the head
                        Of Cybelé was seen sublimely turreted."*

               IBERIAN COASTS.
               JULY 13.—On land I rarely date my journal; here on the sea I must hold fast to
                  dates; having no busy world around to do it for me, I shall forget how time passes
                  in this "cycle of Cathay." Yesterday we did nothing but lie in the hammocks on the
                  quarter-deck; for although we do not suffer from actual sea-sickness, we feel a
                  delightful, indolent languor and an unwillingness to commence any regular
                  occupation.
               Janet laughingly reminds us of Novalis's saying, "Rest is peculiar to the spirit.
                  Life is a disease of the spirit, a working incited by passion." From this she
                  concludes that we are in a more healthy spiritual state while feeling this
                  enchanting indolence. I must confess my usual restlessness is quieted, and a sweet
                  peace, which must come from mental health, fills my whole being.
               Sicily is still in sight, with its bold, beautiful coast. Last night we passed
                  three islands, Ustica, Alicuri, and Felicuri. The blue of the sea is of the
                  deepest hue, but the sky is clear light blue, and yet the most perfect harmony
                  exists; there is not a shadow of a discord between the two shades. Nature is
                  unerring; and he said well who told us that "Art is a prudent steward that lives
                  on managing Nature's riches."
               The haze and atmosphere over the mountainous coast of Sicily are very soft, and
                  the heavens are filled with light floating clouds, that dissolve into the blue as
                  the white crests of the waves do into the sea. The sharp cutting which the prow of
                  our swift little ship makes through the waters dresses up the waves with glorious
                  white crests.
               15th.—We are all doing very well. We have commenced our regular
                  employments. As we have no sight-seeing or land-journeying to keep us occupied
                  together, we separate immediately after breakfast, each to her own pursuit.
                  Venitia goes to her music, the theory of which she is examining very closely.
                  Janet studies languages; and two hours daily I join her in French, German, and
                  Italian. After that, I lie in the hammock and read, or dream waking-visions while
                  listening to Venitia's earnest study of modulations and intricate tone-webs woven
                  from curiously blended chords; sometimes I talk and walk the deck with Janet or
                  read aloud to her.
               16th.—We are having glorious sunsets, beautiful moonlight, and
                  glassy seas. There is very little wind, and the sails flap lazily to and fro in
                  this July calm. Ah, how charming is this life! Not luxurious like that Neapolitan
                  existence of two baths, five repasts, and three sleeps in the twenty-four hours,
                  but possessing its own peculiar pleasure. Out on the broad sea we are cut off from
                  all provocations to anxiety, and, such as we are, enjoy this calm episode to the
                  very full. On land, humanity and humanity's cares, hopes, ambitions, likings and
                  dislikings, press in upon us, and disturb our tranquillity; here all is divinely
                  still.
               At sunset this evening the scene was what might be truly called "fairy-like." The
                  whole horizon opposite the sun reminded
                  me of Shelley's "dissolved opal." The sky had the delicate pink
                  hue of a conch-shell, then it melted itself into a soft blue, wedding itself to
                  the ocean without a line of separation, while over the mysterious union of sea and
                  sky flitted fitfully faint but exquisite shades of color; here a blue, there a
                  rose, and then a green, while the soft west-wind hovered over the waters, rippling
                  them prettily together.
               On the other side of the heavens hung the "infantine Moon, with her attendant
                  star." As the twilight darkened and the moonbeams shone down, we leaned over the
                  guards and watched the fiery line made by the sharp cleaving of our quick little
                  vessel through the brilliant phosphorescent waves; small diamond-like sparkles
                  danced and trembled over the waters. While noticing this phosphorescing of the
                  sea, Janet's classical memories were quickened, and she rhapsodized playfully,
                  with "divine frivolity," about the Nereid Mera, who, according to Hesiod, was the
                  one to whom these mysterious ocean beams belonged.
               These medusidans give the sapphire-hued sea a metallic lustre in the daytime; at
                  night, sweeping by in huge shoals, they look like smothered flames; and when the
                  vessel strikes them, they emit sharp electric sparks.
               In the morning the waves are adorned with dozens of baby nautili sailing gayly
                  along like fairy fleets, with their tiny sails erect. Venitia caught one on the
                  handle of my riding-whip to-day. I fastened it to this page of my journal, but it
                  was like a delicate flower-petal from poor Kilmeny's fairy-garden; it faded and
                  crumbled away in our mortal atmosphere; and yet I wished to preserve the pretty
                  thing, for the deep blue base and transparent lilac and pink sail were
                  bewitching.
               The veriest trifles on shipboard possess interest. We are like children in
                  watching them, and find not only quiet as children do, but food for thought and
                  fancy in our observations. This morning the captain and his men amused themselves
                  by catching turtles. The lowering of the boats, the going to and fro of the men up
                  and down the vessel-side, the rowing off, the silent, stealthy approach to the
                  poor, silly, sleeping things, and the shouts made over their capture, gave rise to
                  more entertainment for us than one might fancy.
               Then we leaned over the side of the vessel and watched the playing of a rope in
                  the water while a boat was lowered and drawn up. As it caught the sun's rays, it
                  looked as if made of molten gold; and the most fantastic lines and traceries were
                  formed, every change brilliantly beautiful, offering studies of divine shapes for
                  arabesque ornaments.
               To-day has been very calm. At times we did not seem to stir. The whole image of
                  the vessel, sails, cordage, and masts, lay reflected on the truly glass-like bosom
                  of the sea with startling clearness, like the ancient mariner's 
                     "Painted ship upon a painted ocean."
                  
               
               I try to grow learned over the various sails, and to distinguish them by their
                  different names, but in vain; that which is apparently so easy to these uneducated
                  sailors is grimoire to me. Our ship carries a
                  great number; yesterday I counted thirty-three at one time, spreading out their
                  white wings and making the little vessel skim over the waters as swiftly and
                  lightly as a true zephyr. But a good deal of skill, and of watchfulness too, is
                  needed in using them, for an unlucky squall of wind might make us pay dearly for our top-heavy
                  finery, by giving us an unexpected capsize.
               21st.—There is a brisk wind, and the pretty little clipper cuts
                  sharply through the waves. We are now passing Fromantera, one of the Balearic
                  Islands. A little while ago, we were close to Majorca; its sharp cut coast lay
                  clear against the purply blue sky, with beautiful leafy indentations running along
                  its edges, formed by the aloes and palms.
               I leaned on the chain of the quarter-deck watching the island as long as I could
                  see it, and recalled Chopin's sufferings. I thought of the desolate winter he
                  spent there, the intense loneliness and sadness he felt, when the cry of the
                  hungry eagle, the wail of the north-wind, and the sight of the desolate yews
                  covered with snow, united to the heart-weariness of the woman he loved, wrung from
                  his soul those divine cries of music sorrow.
               Venitia evidently had the same memories awakened, for she also gazed intently at
                  the island.
               I looked at her and observed how much her face has altered in the past month. The
                  arch of her brow is, as I have said, a shadow too prominent, and formerly the
                  expression was hard; now it is stern and reflective. There is also a sombre and
                  mysterious look in her eyes, which is like distant thunder and far-off lightning,
                  making me think of the flashing of a storm through the painted windows of a
                  chapel.
               The same smile has settled on her face which rests forever on Janet's, and which
                  first attracted me to her. This smile has a pitiful meaning, is sadder looking
                  than tears, and both mouth and eyes rebel; it can be seen on the face of every
                  proud, self-contained person in a season of fearful uncertainty, or after some
                  great loss has been experienced.
               To-day Venitia's deep prophetic eyes had an expression that was too intense for
                  one so young; and the blue-veined eyelid drooped with a tender weight over them,
                  as if heavy with unshed tears. The thin, flexible nostrils dilated with the
                  passionate memories that were agitating her. Her beautiful mouth had lost the
                  bewitching childlike pout of the under lip, the short Greek cut of the upper one
                  grew thinner, and both became like two trembling crimson lines, under the
                  influence of the quick quiverings of emotion excited by the sight of these
                  Majorcan rocks.
               After the island was quite out of sight, she went down to the piano and played, as
                  if improvising them, those great Majorcan preludes of this master, which make "a
                  single instrument speak the language of the infinite, and where in ten lines of
                  music are enclosed poems of the highest emotions, and dramas of unequalled
                     energy."*

               23d.—The coast of Spain is still in sight. The graceful outlines of
                  its mountains and hills are beautifully traced out against the sky in the morning
                  sunlight. We have just passed Cape di Gata, and the captain has pointed out where
                  Almeria should be. Now we are sailing in front of a beautiful plain, to which
                  slope down laughing hills, bathed in a "leafy tide of greenery," rippling in the
                  shadowy wind; and equally charming ones wrapped in a soft green misty haze, make a
                  lovely background.
               Farther along toward the southwest, high mountains can be seen, topped with
                  dazzling snow. Soon we shall be coasting in front of old Granada, so rich in
                     Moorish legend. We are going very
                  fast,—ten miles an hour. If we continue making this good time, we shall be at
                  Gibraltar before this hour to-morrow.
               
                  Night, Velez Malaga.—The fine sail of to-day from Cape Gata to this
                  point has been charming. The mountainous coast was enveloped during midday with a
                  soft, peach-colored haze; the hills rose up, one above another, amphitheatre like;
                  and the distant ones were topped and dashed along their sides with glittering
                  white snow.
               This Iberian peninsula has a garden-like coast; vines cluster around precipices,
                  and here and there little chapels peep out from the rich groves of orange, lemon,
                  myrtle, and cypress trees that wind around, or sweep across the mountain sides in
                  graceful ascending terraces. We have coasted quite close to shore; moreover, we
                  have fine spyglasses, which give us a full view of the distant part of the
                  country.
               24th.—Becalmed off Velez Malaga. The sails hang as if wearied with
                  their swift run of yesterday. Now one flaps lasily as a teasing little breeze
                  steals over and under it. The vessel sways dreamily to and fro on the water,
                  giving a true opium feeling to the brain. The sun has a white hot beam, and its
                  rays pour down like a molten silver stream, bathing sea and sky, and even the
                  whole landscape, in its dazzling atmosphere.
            
            
               THE GADITANIAN GATES.
               JULY 27.—Last night we remained awake until after midnight, watching the vessel as
                  it passed around the Gibraltar Rock, and entered the Gulf of this Calpe of the
                  ancients. We had a very rough sea yesterday, with strong head winds; but this ship
                  lies the closest to the wind that is possible, and the captain, by dint of tacking
                  and patient going to and fro, managed to arrive here notwithstanding the
                  difficulties.
               The sun went down behind the purple hills of Spain slowly and languidly, enveloped
                  in rich golden and yellow clouds. About ten o'clock the moon arose full and clear,
                  and poured down upon the waters a flood-like stream of silver light. As we
                  approached the Rock, the sight was superb; the moon shone upon the gray old
                  height, the light-house on the point burned brilliantly, and over on the African
                  coast the revolving light of Ceuta by turns flashed out sharply, then died
                  away.
               We could not help thinking of the effect produced on ancient voyagers by the sight
                  of these high headlands which terminate the two continents, standing like pillars
                  of boundary to their own world, or grand gates of entrance to a new one. The
                  Iberian Calpe and Libyan Abilyx are no longer such imposing places. Men are too busily employed in rearing invisible
                  Babel towers of lightning and magnetism to be awed now by such tangible forms as
                  Pillars of Hercules or Gaditanian Gates.
               This morning we went ashore to visit Gibraltar town. After landing, we took an
                  open carriage, and spent an hour or two in driving around the Rock beyond Europa
                  point and the light-house, to the Mediterranean beach. We passed the
                  Governor-General's gardens, and saw his Excellency sitting in the balcony of his
                  summer villa, reading very comfortably behind a bamboo shade, which was propped
                  out as a blind. During the drive we observed some exceedingly pretty cottage
                  homes, snug and English looking, evidently officers' residences; one was a
                  charming place buried in shrubbery, and over its partially hidden front clambered
                  vines with luxuriant clusters of white and purple flowers.
               The fig-trees on the roadside were in full fruit; the aspens trembled in the west
                  wind, showing their white-lined leaves, reminding me of the silver poplar. There
                  were several other shade-trees, the names of which I did not know. One was
                  particularly beautiful; it waved long golden-hued, feathery blossoms in the air,
                  which looked something like the acacia flowers at a distance. The roads were
                  bordered with blood-red wall-flowers, scarlet geranium, and brilliant cacti, just
                  as at Naples; indeed, many things reminded me of our sweet Italian home,
                  especially the houses clambering up and clinging to the rocks and the terraces, or
                  hanging gardens to the residences, filled with beautiful flowers and
                  shrubbery.
               After our drive we walked through the town; did some "shopping," as women do
                  everywhere, and hunted up a piano-tuner. The streets are very clean,—a strong
                  evidence of that "well-regulated family," England having ing the control. The
                  population is of the most curiously mixed character. We saw Barbary Jews with
                  black skull-caps, flowing robes, and red scarfs knotted around them for girdles;
                  Moors in white turbans, full drawers, and yellow slippers; Spaniards with their
                  peculiar padded brimmed hats, braided jackets, and velvet breeches, tinsel trimmed
                  on the seams, slashed at the knees, and hanging full of tags; Spanish women with
                  rebosas, high combs, dark skins, white teeth, sparkling eyes, short petticoats,
                  trim feet and ankles; and among them all, fresh, hearty-looking English men and
                  women went striding about as perfectly unconcerned and at home as if walking on
                  the banks of the Thames.
               The stores gave us infinite pleasure. There were Persian leather cushions, covered
                  with curious embroidery; Gibraltar black lace, recalling the Havana blonde; and a
                  variety of rare ornaments. The bracelets were wildering: strings of strange golden
                  coins, looking as if they had been gathered from a Haidee's brow; amber beads
                  curiously carved, each one holding a god and a charm; different kinds of small,
                  rich-colored seeds, strung with gold in pretty forms. The fans, too, were of
                  course beautiful, and had a cunning, coquettish air, as if they almost knew how to
                  carry on a flirtation by themselves.
               We shall stay here a day or two, to have the piano tuned thoroughly, ramble about
                  the place, and get a little change off shipboard. We have concluded to sleep
                  aboard the vessel, as we shall find ourselves cooler by doing so; for the town is
                  now intensely hot, suffering from a long drought. But if the town were never so
                  cool, our ship-home is preferable; for it gives us a perfect rest and freedom in
                  the evening, which we find very refreshing after the day's ramble; then the rowing
                  back and forth in the boat is agreeable.
               
               What could be more pleasant than the laissez
                     aller of our ship-life? This evening, for example, is a fair specimen
                  picture. Janet is lounging in her hammock; Venitia in hers; I am writing by the
                  carcel lamp, the base of which is clamped to the table-top of the little
                  bookcases; but its works are skilfully arranged in a swinging globe, so as to
                  adapt them to the swaying of the vessel. It is near midnight, and sea and land are
                  still.
               All the evening we could hear plainly the music from the public grounds of the
                  town. At sunset, the Rock gun was discharged, and then we watched the gradual
                  lighting-up of the town and the vivid sparkle of the lamps. The different
                  light-houses shone out brightly; and the green, blue, and red lamps of the
                  steamers in the harbor made them seem, in the twilight and night, like some huge,
                  panting animals with fierce, staring eyes.
               Above the hills, over on the African shore, glowed a fierce red light of some
                  inland fire,—bushwood burning, or something like that. After the sun went down and
                  the night darkened, this fire reminded us of Vesuvius: tongues of flame darted up,
                  and, as they crept around the edges of the mountain, they resembled a little the
                  lava-light, only the smoke was more dense and black than lava-smoke, and the
                  forked, sharp forms of the flames told they came from blazing wood.
               Gibraltar is a free port, and thus offers great facilities, and indeed
                  temptations, for smugglers. About sunset, a little boat rowed up to us and lay
                  under our stern. It had in it about a half-dozen Spaniards, with some parcels and
                  packages. They were a merry, white-teethed, brown-skinned set of rogues, looking
                  as picturesque in their Spanish costume as a set of operatic heroes.
               Janet amused herself by "airing" her Spanish on them. When she asked their
                  business, they replied candidly that they were smugglers, and told her with
                  amusing frankness that they were only lying around our ship under pretence of
                  business with us; at nightfall they should row off to Spain and smuggle in their
                  contraband goods.
               While Janet was talking to them, Venitia was swaying indolently to and fro in the
                  hammock, singing in an undertone a little Spanish melody she had picked up among
                  some music at a music-store to-day. One of the smugglers overhearing her, drew out
                  a guitar, and began singing it gayly to sparkling, rattling words. She left the
                  hammock and came to the guards to listen to him. When the men saw her beautiful
                  face, and large, languid, well-shaped form, which looked very lovely in the soft,
                  white mull robe, and purply, golden atmosphere that surrounded everything, they
                  grew enthusiastic, and burst out into a chorus which had a glorious fulness. They
                  also sang us an Ave Maria, that reminded me of Gordigiano, and they accompanied it
                  with a pretty plash of the oar, which had an enchanting effect.
               28th.—Our poor, poor smugglers! They were seized and shot last
                  night. They hung around our vessel until just before moon-rising at midnight,
                  singing, talking, and making themselves very agreeable, poor fellows! They were
                  perfectly proper and respectful in their deportment. Venitia's beauty evidently
                  delighted them: she sat nearly all the evening, leaning over the guards, talking
                  in her captivating, indolent way, which is as unconscious as bewitching. The men
                  looked at her as if she was some beautiful saint. She took their guitar and sang
                  Neapolitan boat-songs-and Venetian barcarolles in her soft, low voice and clear
                  articulation, which are peculiarly adapted to ballads, making them sound like
                  sweet talking. About half past eleven
                  they asked us the hour, seemed startled, said they were very late, bade us good
                  night hurriedly, and rowed off in great haste.
               We watched the moon rising, which was superb; it came slowly up over the centre
                  fortification, and the high, firm chiselling of the Rock was set off finely by its
                  clear light. While we were looking at this lovely sight, and expressing a little
                  fear about our smuggler friends having overstayed their time, we heard a distant
                  report of firearms, that came booming across the waters. We did not associate the
                  sound with them, but fancied it was a signal from a vessel in the distance; and I
                  remember, just as the shot came echoing around the hills, Janet answered our fears
                  about their safety in her ready, healthy tone, that will not admit trouble of any
                  kind in advance: "O, do not feel uneasy about them; they rowed back to Gibraltar;
                  they did not attempt their perilous trade to-night."
               But this morning the captain brought us the sad news. We feel very mournful about
                  it. They were so merry and full of life, poor fellows! And now all is over with
                  them for this world!
               30th.—Last night, our captain looked for a suitable wind to make the
                  passage of the Straits, and we sat up until after midnight, not wishing to lose
                  the fine sight of leaving the harbor; but it proved a hopeless affair, and we went
                  to our state-rooms. At four o'clock this morning we were awakened by the noise on
                  deck. We hurried up, and found all the ship's crew and captain making preparations
                  to beat through the Straits against the head-winds and contrary currents.
               All day the good little vessel has labored industriously against wind and waves.
                  It was very exciting; for the ship had to tack to and fro, first approaching the
                  coast of Africa, then the Spanish shore, so close at times that we could
                  distinguish the fields covered with grain, the various trees, and even people and
                  houses. Africa showed some curiously shaped hills, bluffs, and rugged peaks. The
                  Spanish hills were rolling, and tufted as if covered with purplish-green velvet.
                  Some one has said prettily of this passage through the Straits, that Europe and
                  Africa look at themselves in the same Mediterranean mirror, and seem to struggle
                  for the palm of beauty.
               A schooner from Valencia to Boston was trying also to make the passage through.
                  Several times, when tacking, we crossed each other's paths; once we were
                  alarmingly near. Every one on both vessels expected a collision, and the fierce
                  thrill that passed through us was like a magnetic current. The danger over, we
                  drew a long breath; it was almost a luxurious feeling: the excitement had been so
                  keen, so sudden, as to be free from pain,—Saladin's scymitar cutting the velvet
                  without ravel.
               It has been a glorious day. The little slender ship, as she tacked about, careened
                  first on one side, then on the other. The waves danced madly; and they were as
                  fiercely obstinate in their opposition to our purpose as if they had been living
                  things. The wind was fresh, and we inhaled fine draughts of the invigorating
                  breeze. There was no reading or writing, or indeed much talking, done; for the
                  motion of the ship was too great; and the noise and dash of the opposing waves,
                  united to the beating of the wind, sounded like roaring thunder. This motion of
                  the vessel we all compared to the sensation felt on a fast-galloping horse,—the
                  bounding, free feeling which fills the rider with enthusiasm, making, as that fine
                  line says, 
                     "All the queen in one's nature put on her crown."
                  
               
               
               After all the toil, at nightfall the vessel had made but four miles in the whole
                  day's sailing; so the captain wisely determined to give up the present attempt,
                  and in one short half-hour we were back at Gibraltar, in front of this old Rock,
                  which towered up, gray and grim, against the mellow sky.
               As we neared the point, the Rock gun fired, an eagle swept grandly around the
                  cliff, and soared off into midair. Janet and I quoted impulsively, and in one
                  breath almost, as if we had been thinking with one mind, 
                     
                        "Thou winged and cloud-cleaving minister,
                        Whose happy flight is highest into heaven."
                     
                  
               
               Since our return, we have each withdrawn into ourselves, as it were. I am filling
                  up journal; Janet is lying in her hammock, gazing silently up at the starry sky
                  and the Rock, which looks as unflinching as she sometimes does. Once in a while
                  she stretches out her hand and rests it tenderly on my shoulder, for she never
                  likes me to be far off from her; I turn to give back the caress, and see her dear,
                  true eyes looking at me with an expression full of firm, unchanging, mother,
                  sister, and friend love.
               Venitia is in the cabin, improvising. Most mysterious is this power to me, this
                  capability of expressing passing thoughts and feelings by quick-succeeding and
                  blending harmonies. I have spoken before of Venitia's remarkable possession of
                  this gift; but since her separation from Luigi her improvisations have taken a
                  deeper tone; they are very often now what the Germans call subjective, and are a
                  true tone-language; not a fiction of art, but a lovely, mystical, cipher-tongue,
                  telling her heart and soul history.
               She never names them, never writes them off, never talks of them, and only plays
                  them when she is alone. Sometimes they are so masterly, I cannot resist calling
                  out to her; but though I veil my admiration or interpretation of her musical
                  thoughts under technicalities, my remarks check her on the instant, and she breaks
                  off into vague chords, simple pursuits of harmonies and dry reasonings.
               But if, like to-night, they are objective and descriptive, then my comprehensions
                  and remarks stimulate her, and make her develop her musical thoughts more
                  brilliantly. Now, as the music rises up from the cabin, I notice its spirituality;
                  image after image is summoned, and yet only a gentle hovering over each, for the
                  fancy roused by the scene of to-day is so rich in such descriptive wealth as to
                  silence thought. Curious inharmonious dissonances are wedded so skilfully as to
                  make perfect concord; indeed, the chords proceed rapidly, without reflection; they
                  fall instantaneously from each hand, dissimilar as possible, and yet their union
                  is divinely complete. This is not the result of mere "grammar rules." The study
                  and knowledge of theory may, does, help the improvising artist; but the power or
                  gift which Venitia possesses to so high a degree arises from some subtle,
                  spiritual influence, which is exercised over the mind, and the best name to give
                  it is inspiration.
               It resembles the divine harmony of nature, where each sound in itself, like these
                  chords, if taken separately, may be unmusical; such as the hot, grating chirrup of
                  the grasshopper, so fretful and petulant; the crackling of dried leaves; the
                  rustle and tumult of the winds among the branches of the trees; the regular rise
                  and fall of an oar, the drip of the water from its blade, with the complaining
                  creak of the thole-pin; and sweeping along, upon the surrounding air, from the
                  distance, a hum and throb like a sad
                  minor undertone, telling the sorrowful tale of human labor, toil, and pain. But
                  Nature never errs; these sounds are all blended harmoniously, and lull to rest,
                  with vague, delicious fancies, the happy dreamer, who, resting under the trees by
                  the shore of "sweet running waters, with a soft south-wind blowing over them,"
                  listens with gentle rapture to the divine symphonique whole.
               And the improvising artist, to produce a similar effect, must possess that power
                  which has been happily called "prophetic action of the mind," which bestows this
                  marvellous and inexplicable ability to seize on the instant, without taking time
                  for reflection, upon the best out of a throng of fast-crowding fancies, and
                  create, from this little pallet of twenty-four gamuts, things of beauty.
            
            
               TEMPTING FATE.
               JULY 31.—We are again trying to beat out. The captain proposed we should have the
                  vessel towed through by a steamer, but we refused simultaneously: it shocked all
                  our poetical fancies.
               "Just like an omnibus to cross the Desert," cried Venitia, half indignant.
               Even the practical Janet said, "O no, that would never answer"; and then, as we
                  walked the deck together, she quoted Humboldt about these "Pillars of Hercules at
                  the west margin of the earth, on the road to Elysium and the Hesperides, beyond
                  which were first seen the primeval waters of the circling Oceanus, in which the
                  source of all rivers was then sought."
               "And here was the fabled margin of the earth," she continued. "Now, according to
                  these wise men of old, we should be sailing towards, not from, Elysium. We are
                  striving to enter these 'primeval waters of the circling Oceanus,' and probably,
                  my dear," she added, putting her arm tenderly around my waist, "we are approaching
                  a true elysium, not the sorrow you dread so much. Your troubles at this very
                  moment may be graciously righting themselves,—some happy influences working, like
                  sweet Ellie's Knight, to 
                     'Make straight distorted wills.
                  
                   When we reach home, darling friend, we
                  may all find peace and pleasure instead of trouble and trial."
               "Home!" I replied, sadly; "it has been some time, Janet, since I have regarded
                  that word as representing a reality for me. My home, henceforth, will only be a
                  country,—a wide space, a land, not a fireside with sweet possessions."
               We paced the deck silently for some time with quick, elastic tread, as if our
                  wills intended to control the feelings through the physical motions, and Janet's
                  only answer was a firmer grasp around my waist.
               
                  Evening, off Al-Kazar Point.—The sun has just set beautifully, but
                  now a dull, heavy cloud hangs around the horizon, like a curtain partly drawn up.
                  Cape Trafalgar stretches out in the distance golden and glorious as a "heavenly
                  hill," and Cape Espartel, the northwest point of Africa, also catches a gleam of
                  the radiant light.
               Behind us lies Gibraltar, just faintly seen, for a misty cloud hangs over it; but
                  the last rays of sunlight give us a sight of its stone walls and houses clambering
                  up against the rugged old Rock. Opposite to us is a beautiful bit of landscape;
                  Al-Kazar Point, a rugged, sharp, gray bluff runs out into the sea, forming a bay;
                  behind it are several hills, each covered with a different shade of green, and the
                  atmosphere which hangs over them is deliciously soft. One catches the sunlight,
                  which throws a silvery sheen over its verdure; another has a clear, open hue, like
                  Shakespeare's "lush and lusty grass, with an eye of green in it"; and beyond there
                  is yet another, wrapped in a semi-opaque greenish haze. Meadows stretch out, and
                  there are clumps of trees, which tell of sweet shady woods that must now, at this
                  hour of nightfall, be full of all manner of solemn sounds, and where
                     
                        "the silent air
                        Lays her soft ear close to the green earth."
                     
                  
               
               To-day the Spanish coast presented a curious sight; trees stood in closer and more
                  regular groups than nature arranges them; then there were rows forming belts or
                  boundary lines around large tracts of land, which land was yellow as if covered
                  with grain stubble, and some looked like pasture which had been cropped off by
                  cattle.
               The western horizon is glorious just at this instant. Cape Trafalgar and its
                  surrounding hills are covered with a dissolving green haze, which has "an eye of
                  fire in it" like the opal. Tarifa light-house gleams out fitfully on the Spanish
                  shore, and the opposing currents of the Straits beat noisily through. We have been
                  talking of those early voyages of the ancients, their earnest attempts to advance
                  beyond the Mediterranean shores; of the old tale of the Argonauts, which is
                  enveloped as thickly in poetical myths as these beautiful mountains are with the
                  glowing haze.
               No wonder those early voyagers clothed their adventures with legends, for when
                  they reached these pillar-like mountains and saw such a dark unknown expanse of
                  waters stretching out beyond, they must have felt startled and awed; then the
                  aerial perspective of time gathered gradually around their expeditions, and
                  naturally gave them poetic, mystic forms. Like us, these early adventurers must
                  have had fitful, capricious winds, and listened with terror to this thundering
                  roar of the contending currents in these Straits, forbidding them to advance—as
                  they seem to do us—towards Elysium.
               How curious these water currents are to the unlearned, such as I am. I traced
                  to-day upon the globe the course of that mysterious Gulf Stream, which sweeps
                     river-like across the ocean, flowing
                  past the opposing and circling waves as if they were simple earth-banks;
                  retaining, it is said, forever unchanged its own high temperature through all its
                  intercourse with other waters.
               The captain, who is an intelligent man in his business, told me that the ocean
                  current propelled by this gulf current, which flows from the Azores towards the
                  Straits of Gibraltar and the Canary Isles, drives round the waters of the Atlantic
                  Ocean in a continual circular course of three thousand eight hundred miles!
               The night thickens, the wind changes, and the sea is treacherous. The captain and
                  men look anxious, but we three women, who carry such heavy loads chained fast to
                  our hearts,—one a grave, the other a hopeless love, and the third a living
                  death,—are not appalled by the presence of mere physical danger; indeed,
                  presenting itself in this sublime form, it possesses a strange attraction, to me
                  at least.
               "I should feel loath to risk the lives of these men," said Janet just now, "but
                  there are boats enough to save them, and despite all the fine stories told of
                  disinterestedness and generous self-sacrifice at such fearful times, I know, in
                  such an event, these sailors would take good care of themselves, no matter what
                  became of us and our poor maids. But we shall get through safely"; and she added
                  in an undertone, as if to herself, turning away from me, "I fancy death is too
                  great a blessing to come to us just yet."
               A perfect fleet of vessels set out with us this morning,—over two hundred; it was
                  a fine sight to see them stretch out their huge wings against the morning sky,
                  looking like so many gigantic birds. Some of them have sailed steadily on like us,
                  contending bravely with wind and current, but most of them have fallen back. We
                  have concluded to stay in our hammocks all night on deck, to see the termination
                  of this attempt.
               
                  Midnight.—We have drifted back in spite of all our trouble to
                  Gibraltar again, just outside the grim old Rock! Janet, who is swaying to and fro
                  in her hammock, quoted gayly just now,—
               "'Ever striving to pass onwards, Phoenicians, Greeks, Arabs, Catalans, Majorcans,
                  Frenchmen from Dieppe and La Rochelle, Genoese, Venetians, Portuguese, and
                  Spaniards, in turns attempted to advance across this ocean, this dark and misty
                     sea,—mare tenebrosum,—until proceeding from
                  station to station as it were, they finally came to the New Continent,'—and so
                  shall we, notwithstanding all this contradiction."
               We have been talking of the fabled Continent of Atlantis.
               "It must have been here," said Janet, "just in front of these Gibraltar Straits,
                  that it lay. I have heard famous hydrographers speculate beautifully on the
                  mysterious tradition. Homer and Hesiod mention it; and Plato, in his Timæus and
                  Critias, designates this very spot. He says in the Timæus, 'There was in front of
                  the Straits which you call Columns of Hercules an island greater than Libya and
                  Asia.'
               "On this great island reigned famous kings, and brave warriors lived. In one fatal
                  night and day there came a fearful earthquake and heavy flood, when this wondrous
                  island with its mighty men disappeared. Ever since, the solemn, voiceless ocean
                  has swept over its face, obliterating its great cities, fertile countries,
                  innumerable animals, and all its marvellous beauty of landscape,—vast plains and
                  high mountains, which in extent and beauty surpassed all we possess.
               
               "I have heard very learned men say that they did not regard this legend as a
                  poetic fiction or allegory; that the configuration of the ocean just here accords
                  strangely with the ancient tradition, and that the accidental elevations which
                  occur on the bosom of the Atlantic, which have made hydrographers despair, can
                  thus be cleared up, for the Archipelagos of the Azores, Madeira, the Canaries, and
                  Cape Verd, can be regarded as the high table-lands and mountain-summits of this
                  lost continent."
               We are still working out, notwithstanding our rebuff. It is now two o'clock in the
                  morning, and the whole vessel is alive. The good, energetic captain and his brave
                  men seem to have caught our adventurous spirit; a pride has taken possession of
                  them, and they have determined to make this passage unaided. I do not believe they
                  would now consent to employ a steamer, even if we should urge it.
               
                  Sunday Morning, August 1.—Safely through the Straits at last, and
                  fairly out on the broad ocean. At four o'clock this morning we had worked out to
                  Tarifa again. The rising of the sun was very, very curious; coming up above the
                  horizon without any dazzling rays, round and red as a full moon, it seemed to sway
                  to and fro like a ball of liquid flame.
               At ten o'clock we were once more in front of Capes Trafalgar and Espartel; when we
                  were lunching at two o'clock, we had reached the open sea. We have just enough
                  wind against us to make fine work with the waves. Venitia and Janet seem fatigued
                  and sleepy. They are lying in their hammocks, enjoying the swift sweep of the
                  graceful little ship, the mad dash of the waves as they come rolling by, carrying
                  proudly their white-crested crowns, and the far-off dome of the sky. A fine
                  salt-bath has refreshed us after our days' and nights' watch, but we all feel too
                  weary even to talk, and I think I shall find it pleasant to doze, awaken and enjoy
                  with dreamy pleasure this "fine fluent motion," as Janet called it just now.
               "Ottilie, stop writing, and come to your hammock. Do you remember De Quincey's
                  speaking somewhere of 'the fine fluent motion of a mail-coach'? The expression is
                  very descriptive; and the dash and sweep of this clipper over the fast-rushing
                  waves may readily return to the memory some time when we are rolling along a
                  superb road in a swift-going, well-balanced coach."
            
            
               
               MARE TENEBROSUM.
               AUGUST 9.—The sea is very rough, and the ship rolls tremendously. If I did not
                  know how to write in any position I should not be able to manage my pen. The waves
                  dash up feathery spray, which catches the sunbeams, making rainbows play and dance
                  over every crested billow.
               The grand ocean swallows all our little chagrins and complaints. Its superb
                  symphony sweeps up and on, drowning all human moans and griefs, and the sorrows of
                  humanity seem as the veriest trifles in the presence of its sublime terrors and
                  divine beauty.
               Humboldt says, whoever builds his own world within himself must be excited by the
                  view of the free, open sea, the majestic picture of boundlessness it presents; but
                  he speaks of "a shade of melancholy longing" mingling with the enjoyment. And this
                  is so. Not that we are sad outwardly,—indeed, the captain says we are "a cheery
                  set of passengers"; I know, too, that we are happier here than we should be on
                  shore, or probably ever shall be again,—but there is at bottom an intense
                  melancholy, and it is soothed by finding itself in perfect unison with the ocean
                  diapason.
               The simple-minded captain doubtless thinks us a gay, happy trio; he knows of no
                  other merriment than that proceeding from animal spirits. Ours, which results from
                  mental excitement, deceives him, as it does nine out of ten in the world, who take
                  it for real mirth and true humor, and do not see that it is simply a pleasant
                  garment with which we clothe ourselves to hide even from our own eyes the unseemly
                  rags and rents made by sorrow.
               15th.—Our sunsets continue to be glorious. The clouds this evening
                  formed veritable landscapes, in which there were mountains of silver, and lakes,
                  rivers, and waterfalls of gold. Then followed a brilliant, sparkling night, when
                  the starry vault of the heavens rested the edges of its superb dome on the
                  profound ocean base.
               We enjoy very much the various changes of the ocean and sky. In the heavens the
                  pale green modulates by ascending full harmonies into brilliant carmine and gold,
                  just as some glorious music; then in the finest weather, when the sky is clear and
                  a steady blue, the sea will vacillate and waver from one shade to another,—from
                  dark indigo to deep green, and sometimes a dull, solemn gray.
               22d.—We are having fine weather, fair winds, and smooth seas. These
                  "primeval waters of the circling Oceanus," after battling against us, have
                  generously extended their huge arms and laid us on the broad, palpitating bosom of
                  the sea. Not a storm, or anything that could throw the faintest shadow of danger
                  over us, has occurred. Just three weeks to-day since we left Gibraltar.
               The ocean is enchantingly beautiful this morning. A fine fresh north wind is
                  blowing, and the sea is with us. We ride gracefully over the waters, and the waves
                  rise and fall with gracious dignity and beauty. Now a slight breath trembles above
                  the sea, breaking it into delicate ripples, which spread along in silvery radiance
                  under the sun sheen; but soon a fresh
                  swell or white-crested wave comes sweeping along, and the surface is again calm
                  and smooth. As I lean against the bulwarks, looking at these changes, all manner
                  of pretty poetical conceits are suggested to me.
               Venitia's comparison which she made just now, when observing with me this ripple
                  and wave break, pleases me. She says it is like some music, in which the melody
                  goes trembling along with a half-trilling sound, then comes a grand chord, or
                  brilliant modulation, or noisy resolution, which dissolves and annihilates the
                  whole pretty trilling motivo.Janet says we
                  remind her of good old Jeremy Taylor in our disposition for making comparisons,
                  therefore I shall not write mine.
               Venitia has gone down to the music. We are in good luck about this piano. At
                  Gibraltar we discovered that one of the crew, a Sicilian, who had admired
                  Venitia's music very much, knew something about tuning. She made the piano-tuner
                  at Gibraltar give him some counsel, and go over the instrument several times; now
                  he keeps her piano in capital order, examining it every morning. She provided
                  fresh strings in hermetic cases before leaving Naples; and no one could imagine,
                  from its pure and beautiful sounds, that the instrument was in so trying an
                  atmosphere as the ocean. The chords and harmonies blend most mysteriously, too,
                  with the ocean's roar: no matter what key Venitia opens in, the wave tone-pitch
                  seems always to adapt itself, and we never have enjoyed music so much.
               Venitia has just been playing her favorite Sonate of Beethoven,—the one in D (Re).
                  (Opus 31, No. 2.) The glasses of the cabin skylight are raised, and I am resting
                  against the casement, listening.
               "A charming and accomplished friend of mine," said Janet, as Venitia concluded it,
                  "used to compare this Sonate to trackless paths in a wild primeval forest."
               "Yes," murmured Venitia, in a low tone, as if to herself, "but a forest of one's
                  own passions, in which one follows the trackless paths of bewildering, hopeless
                  desires."
               Dear girl! this love-sorrow has ripened rapidly her heart-fruit. I once said she
                  was as brilliant as a diamond, and almost as hard; now she is as tender as an
                  "awakened Psyche." She turned over the leaves of her Beethoven volume, and said,
                  looking up at me, "Listen to the Adagio of this Third Sonate, dedicated to
                  Haydn."
               She played it over several times, then added: "This Adagio contains the very
                  essence of unbelief, it is so rebellious. A little light beams out toward the
                  close, reminding me of the last scene of Manfred with the Abbot, for a
                  reconciliation with lost faiths and hopes is almost reached; but this F double
                  sharp destroys the promise, and the C which follows confirms the sad truth. I tell
                  you, Ottilie, there is in this Adagio the positive expression of a confirmed,
                  almost maddening despair; it does not even contain so much hope as Manfred's last
                  words,— 
                     'Old man! 't is not so difficult to die.'"
                  
               
               I did not answer her, and she continued playing; but I thought of the marvellous
                  and weird power contained in this vague, beautiful Tone-tongue, the suggestions it
                  makes to us of life experiences; as Spohr said, "It is the sole expression of some
                  complicated feelings and struggles in the human breast." Janet was lying in her
                  hammock, reading, and did not hear Venitia's remark; but the music had its effect
                  on her, for she looked towards me and said, "While I was listening to that Adagio,
                  Ottilie, a tender and touching remark
                  of Mrs. Jameson came to my memory,—'In this life there is always something to be
                  done or suffered, when there is no longer anything to be desired or
                  attained.'"
               25th.—We are still on the beautiful wide ocean, and it is very calm
                  and tranquil, so unlike the sullen repulse it gave us when we entered its
                  inhospitable gates. We shall be very sorry when this voyage is ended. It is quite
                  late in the evening. Janet is pacing the quarter-deck, and only the man at the
                  wheel and the first mate are on watch. A little while ago, Venitia and I were
                  walking the main-deck together, talking of the pleasant voyage we had had thus
                  far, and she exclaimed: "O, to go on always thus! To live forever, Ottilie, in
                  this way, would it not be Elysium?"
               "Like the Phantom Vessel," I replied.
               We were near the cabin door; she left me and went down to the piano, and soon rose
                  up on our ears the strange harmonies of that curious composition, Wagner's "Flying
                  Dutchman."
            
            
               FUGUE IN E MINOR.
               AUGUST 28.—I do not write very regularly now in my journal, my life is so vague
                  and dreamy. I read a little, talk a little, but most of all lie in my hammock and
                  listen to Venitia's music; or give up my whole being to the delicious influence of
                  the sea, when I forget all "the before and after," and am so still and happy in
                  this state of simply existing without the torture of thought or memory, that I
                  feel 
                     "Like an unbodied joy, whose race is just begun."
                  
               
               We are six hundred miles from America yet, and to-night will make it seven weeks
                  since we left Palermo. We are sailing at a fine speed,—ten miles an hour. There is
                  a superb sky, brilliant sun, fine fresh wind, and sublime ocean. The rolling,
                  dashing waves ring out grand harmonies in full, open diapason, and the
                  white-crested billows dance madly on in a wild, gay leap, and throw aloft their
                  snowy foam as if they felt the same glorious exultation their sweep and dash
                  create in me.
               I have been sitting in the forward part of the vessel alone. I clambered up to the
                  very end of the ship, that I might be able to watch the various changes of the
                  waves. The prow cut through the waters sharply, throwing myriads of sparkling gems
                  up and around. Whole clusters of wave-diamonds would be flung out on the sea,
                     and mingle so quickly with it as to
                  produce the effect of being caught back by invisible hands. The waves dashed along
                  madly, smoking like ice; and, as the sun arose towards the zenith, and the short
                  perpendicular spar under the bowsprit end, called the martingale, dipped into the
                  rising waves, numberless segments of rainbows flitted over the racing waters. I
                  thought of the Harpy Podargy in the Iliad, the white-footed nymph who slid before
                  the tempests and made the crests of the waves foam as she tore them up while
                  passing over them.
               A troop of porpoises came rolling along,—a mournful sight to superstitious
                  sailors, for they betoken a storm; but our voyage has a fair white star on its
                  front, and its end shall be peace. Some dolphins bounded over the
                  martingale-chains, and little flying-fish, about a hand in length, flitted in and
                  out of the sea, as white as the wave-crests on which they sported.
               31st.—A bright and sunny day, with a gentle wind. The sea seems full
                  of floating amethysts and emeralds, the mollusca are so plentiful; at night, huge
                  floats of them pass near us, glittering like lightning half hidden by clouds.
                  Beautiful nautili sail by the ship, nearly as large as my hand. Janet had a boat
                  lowered to catch some, and we have dried them very successfully; their sails look
                  like large flower-leaves,—lilac rayed with black and tipped with a rich rose-pink,
                  thin as gauze and frail-looking as a convolvulus-petal.
               
                  Midnight.—My journal seems very fragmentary to me, and yet Janet
                  likes it. She has been reading it the past few days, and said yesterday, on
                  returning the volume to me: "Why, Ottilie, it reads like a story. Suppose you give
                  it a name, write a preface, and publish it. I wonder if persons would take it for
                  a fiction, and not 'an ower-true tale'? Alas! if there was not so much
                  heart-aching truth in your journal, my friend, it would not be amiss to publish
                  it."
               Then we talked playfully about working it up into book form, and speculated on its
                  title. This led us to thinking of the difficulty some great authors have had in
                  finding suitable names for their literary offspring. We recalled the story of
                  Ariosto, who, after seeking a long while in his brain for a title to his famous
                  poem, arose one midnight, awakened his retainers, and had the great bell of the
                  fortress, of which he was governor, rung in grand rejoicing. His poem was
                  named!
               The stately, grave poet must have felt very proud while he listened to the loud
                  pealings of his castle bell, as it rung out in the dark night over the Apennine
                  solitudes, telling Nature that a great poem had been born from the invisible world
                  of romance into the visible one of language.
               To-day I have amused myself by giving headings to the various divisions of my
                  journal, hunting up a title, and writing a preface, all of which work Janet has
                  super-intended with an approving pleasure almost as grave as Aristo's. "Some day,"
                  she said, "Venitia, poor child! will also enjoy reading this book. You must give
                  it to me, my friend, when we reach America. There this volume shall end, and a new
                  journal, and a new life indeed, begin for us all."
               The new life has commenced for Venitia. But, alas! this new existence, the
                  mysterious emotional life from which spring Art's most luscious fruits of tone and
                  word-poesy, is, like all mortal things, born of pain, Novalis's "disease of the
                  spirit," or that human-like gem, the pearl, created by a wound! And yet it is
                  happiness and gladness ness, not pain
                  and sorrow, that make the blessed birds break out into song.
               This strange emotion, love, too, in what different forms it presents itself: to
                  Philip it has always been a joy and a blessing, while to others it is a tragedy;
                  and to Venitia, what is it to be? It must be her inspiration, the keynote of a
                  higher life. Now she suffers and struggles, but the pure pearl of peace must come;
                  for both she and Luigi are loyal and true in their natures, not fitful and
                  wavering, like some poor feeble hearts. The perfect faith which will be
                  established between them shall sustain her yet; though she may never see him
                  again, this one thing will not fade away from her mind,—the memory of his firm,
                  quiet repose of heart. It will be to her 
                     
                        "An ever-fixed mark,
                        That looks on tempests and is never shaken."
                     
                  
               
               But I would fain have her a word-poet instead of a tone Sappho. Music, alas! is
                  only "known through gradations of joy and sorrow," listened to and uttered with an
                  emotion that is sharp as pain; and leaves behind it a regret. The ivresse of the executante, too, is as exhausting as the intoxication of the earthly
                  grape; and the wildering sounds so full of beauty, which are poured forth "from
                  the voice and the instrument," are restless waves of the great heart-ocean,
                  speeding along under the fierce storm of sorrow, and breaking against the sharp
                  reefs and desolate shores of longing and memory.
               I remember saying once that Venitia could not play fugues, and also that one must
                  be far out on the deep waters of trial to comprehend fully the real meaning of a
                  great fugue. Now she has attained this sorrowful comprehension. To-night she
                  played the fine Handel fugue in E minor, and I listened with surprise to her
                  different rendering of it: it throbbed with a life-pulse. After she had finished
                  it, she said: "I am so glad that at last I really love fugues. I used to play them
                  as a duty; but now they are a pleasure, and they sound like solemn, inspired poems
                  to my ears. This fugue of Handel, I never tire of reading it. Bach's fugues are
                  more severe, but this is full of melodic sublimity. Listen to these three warning
                  notes in this passage."
               And she played over the three following measures, which are the fourth, fifth, and
                  sixth ones of the fugue:— 
               
               "These three notes," she continued, "must be martelé, that is, struck persistently, in order to usher in fitly
                  the melodic ripple which follows. One hand teaches the other the strange story in
                  many keys; it comes and goes; it sways and surges like a river widening in its
                  course. You used to compare it to the roll of mid-ocean, Ottilie, and now I feel
                  the truth of your comparison. Yes, it leads to a wide, boundless ocean of thought;
                  but through all its changes you still hear these three mysterious warning
                     notes.
                  
                     
                        'Weird sisters hand in hand,
                        Posters of the sea and land,
                        Thus do go about, about.'
                     
                   Sometimes they carry me, indeed, to Hecate's Cave, and I hear the solemn,
                  thrice-reiterated 'Show!' 
                     
                        'Show his eyes and grieve his heart,
                        Come like shadows, so depart.'"
                     
                  
               
               "Venitia, a dear friend once said to me, with all the eloquence of sadness, that
                  'Belief plays at hide-and-seek with disappointment in life, like the first voice
                  in a fugue.'"
               "That is beautiful!" she exclaimed, and she repeated it over. "And so true! But,
                  Ottilie, it is very long before we see the truth. We believe and hope so blindly,
                  then comes the solemn resolution of the minor chord, and that is the end of the
                  believing life."
               "The end?" repeated Janet, stepping up quietly behind us and putting her hands on
                  our shoulders. "The end? O no, my friends; not the end while life lasts. We women
                  never lose hope; we always 'attend' the coming of our vision in some form, as the
                  Jews forever expect the Messiah."
               "Attend a delusion," I replied, with some little bitterness.
               "So be it," answered Janet, calmly; "but let us respect this 'delusion,' as you
                  call it,—I call it the ideal, and so do you, Ottilie, in your better moods. Come;
                  both of you must walk with me on the quarter-deck; the moon is glorious, and the
                  waves are trembling like a young Endymion,— 
                     
                        'A symbol of immensity,
                        A firmament reflected in a sea,
                        An element filling the space between
                        An unknown—'
                     
                   and mysterious spirit of beauty, which your marvellous Tone-tongue describes
                  better than the word-poems do. Let us go breathe and feel it, for its influences
                  will be healthful for us all."
               We walked, with Janet between us, up and down the quarter-deck till near midnight,
                  and her good, wise words at last brought a calm, trustful feeling into our hearts.
                  We talked indirectly of the past, present, and future, and Venitia and I were at
                  first not a little stiff-necked.
               "Janet," said Venitia, with an attempt at playfulness, "when I was a child you
                  should have given me elementary thinking-lessons."
               "It takes the whole experience of life to give us the power of thought, Venitia.
                  We are only learning to think here. First we feel, then we suffer, then we
                     know; and with this beginning of knowledge comes the dawning of
                  true thought,—then for hereafter the wisdom."
               "But after all, Janet," I said, "how few of us really wish this knowledge; it is
                  almost always forced on us. We enjoy the delicious sense of feeling, and are even
                  willing to take the suffering which follows if it will only come blind and deaf,
                  and not leave with us the fearful responsibility gained from experience, whose
                  painful fruit is thought and knowledge."
               "Ah, but it is like Ruskin's hawthorn, my dear Ottilie, which must grow with the
                  spirit of the triangle in it. When we have a stern necessity put upon us,—whether
                  of duty, performance, or self-abnegation,—awful as it may be, we grow stronger and
                  better for facing and accepting it. We may transgress,—we may reach forth
                  longingly to some other more delightful end which we see sweeping swiftly and
                  temptingly by us,—we may even feel other needs pressing in on us and demanding
                  food; it is all useless,—the 'triangular necessity' is on us, and towards that form must be our souls' growth, if
                  we have any power of growth in us."
               "A soul-growth is it, my dear?" I replied, obstinately; "I can tell you that one
                  of the severest purgatories which can be inflicted on a proud spirit is the
                  acceptance of this 'triangular necessity,' as you call it. You are right, however;
                  my own experience has proved it, for I have often seen myself doing quietly, and
                  sometimes even with a strange sense of willingness, the very things I had fought
                  furiously against in the beginning; but I have never yielded without a keen sense
                  of mortification."
               They laughed, and Janet said she fancied, if the truth were known, this confession
                  I had just made had been one of these purgatories to me. Gradually we shifted our
                  talk to other and gayer subjects, and before parting for the night had some very
                  merry laughs. They are both asleep now, and I am sitting on the quarter-deck
                  alone. It is nearly three o'clock in the morning. The weather has changed and
                  grown chilly. Dark clouds hang around the horizon, and a fitful, angry wind is
                  beginning to agitate the sea.
               The man on watch shivers, walks up and down the deck, and looks inquiringly around
                  on the sky. He has gone down now to the captain, and I hear them talking earnestly
                  in low voices. The captain is preparing to come up on deck. I will close my book,
                  and look out hopefully toward the west as I go once more to sleep upon the
                  treacherous sea.
