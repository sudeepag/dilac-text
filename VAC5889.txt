            Preface.
            MR. LEGH RICHMOND'S Tract of "The Collier Boy and his Candle-box," contains an
               account of the destruction of seventy-five persons in the Heaton Main Colliery, near
               Newcastle-upon-Tyne, on the 3d of May, 1815. Of these sufferers, a portion remained
               alive for a time after the occurrence of the accident. But of their experiences
               during that interval, no record remains save the Candle-box of William Thew, on which
               were found scratched these interesting words: "Fret not dear Mother For we were
               singing while we had time and praising God Mother Folow God more than ever i
               did."
            "It is probable, however," adds Mr. Richmond, in speculating upon the occupations of
               these imprisoned souls, "that the pious men would employ their time in exhorting
               those who were irreligious, to repentance and faith in Christ."
            What in that instance was considered probable, we shall find in the event here
               related to have actually occurred; for here the sufferers, after thirty-six hours'
               burial in the bowels of the earth, were delivered from that death of which they had
               been, during this long period, in continual
               expectation, and their actual experiences are accurately known and set down. Peter
               Hay, one of their own number, and the leader of their religious exercises, has given
               an account of them, which is verified by all the rest. He still lives in the village
               of Millerhill, where he is now an elder of the Kirk; and it is interesting to add,
               that, by the choice of the people, he has recently been set apart as Catechist of
               that village and the adjoining ones of Adams' Row and Old and New Craighall, the
               residences of the colliers in the employment of Sir John Hope, of Pinkie, Bart.,
               M.P.
            Should this record of his subterraneous teachings prove useful to any one suffering
               under affliction, or exposed to danger, the Collier will be recompensed for his
               hardships, and the Editor for his trouble.

               The Collier's Tale.
               ON a rising ground near the junction of the Musselburgh and Dalkeith Railways
                  leading into Edinburgh, there stood, some years ago, a Steam-engine house attached
                  to a Coal-pit on the farm of Whitehill Mains, called the High Pressure pit.
               On the morning of Sunday the 9th of March 1839, a crowd of people were seen
                  gathered round the mouth of this pit busily engaged, and all in a state of
                  apparent anxiety and alarm. It turned out, that the night before, thirteen
                  colliers, men, women, and children, had gone down for their ordinary work; but had
                  not been long below, when a loud and hollow rumbling noise was heard; the sides of
                  the pit appeared to be giving way; and in a
                  short while, first one, and then another, fearful shoot of earth, rubbish, and
                  stones, from about midway, came thundering down.
               The mass fell to the bottom; the pit became choked up to within thirty fathoms of
                  the surface; and the colliers above became aware that thirteen of their comrades,
                  kinsfolk, and friends, were buried three hundred and sixty feet down in the bowels
                  of the earth.
               The alarm quickly spread over the countryside; the tidings flew from village to
                  village; and speedily numbers came in from Millerhill and Hungrymouth, Craighall
                  and Adam's Row, as well as from Wanton-Walls, the Muckletts, Drythrapple, the
                  Cowpits, and, indeed, from the whole neighborhood, all animated with a desire to
                  exert themselves to the uttermost for the deliverance of the imprisoned sufferers.
                  It was believed that these were still alive, for the pit was old, and the workings
                  below were extensive. There would, therefore, it was supposed, be a considerable
                  temporary supply of air; and this possibly might be more or less renewed from a
                  pit lying in a beautiful sequestered questered dell between Whitehill and
                  Shaw-fair in the neighborhood, called the Back Dean, which had been for a good
                  while abandoned, but which was known to communicate with the other by a long
                  narrow passage or Air-gate,*
                   as it is called, of nearly a mile in length. One detachment of laborers
                  forthwith descended, in order to set about clearing out the rubbish from the
                  choked pit, and another went to the Back Dean, to establish, if possible, an
                  under-ground communication between the two pits. These last went forward as far as
                  they could; but the roof of the Air-gate had in various places sitten down. The
                  water also had risen upon it, and they were forced to abandon their purpose; for
                  so foul was the air, that no man descending from the upper air, or rather, it may
                  be said, no man whatever, could breathe it. They called aloud, and listened
                  carefully for the voices of their friends; but no returning sound broke the dead
                  silence around. The others, who were clearing out
                     
                     *Gate, in Scotch, signifies Way.
                   the choked pit from above, were placed in
                  unexpected difficulties, by the danger of new shoots, which now became apparent;
                  and, therefore, measures were taken to construct a Crib, or large wooden drum-like
                  instrument, fitting closely to the shape of the pit, to be let down, and
                  lengthened as it descended, so as to fortify the sides of the pit, and make the
                  descent of the workmen safe.
               Here again, however, difficulties increased; for the enormous quantity of the
                  rubbish, and the great depth of it, rendered its removal, in time to be beneficial
                  to the prisoners below, almost hopeless. The closeness, also, of the Air-gate, at
                  the Back Dean end, proved that no external supply of air could reach them at its
                  other and distant extremity. But in such circumstances, to hope against hope, and
                  to labor in the face of difficulties, or even supposed impossibilities, became
                  duty. The owners of the pit, also, Messrs. Stenhouse, were indefatigable in their
                  exertions, and abounded in kindness and encouragement to the laborers, who all
                  combined to work with energy.
               
               
                  
                     
                  
               
               How, meanwhile, fared it with the wives, and the husbands, and the children, and
                  the fathers, and the mothers, and the brothers, and the sisters, and the kinsfolk,
                  and the friends and acquaintances of the thirteen sufferers? Their houses lay in
                  the adjoining villages of Millerhill and Adam's Row; and in these, indeed, "was
                  there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning." In the first
                  house which the writer of this notice visited on that dismal forenoon, a house
                  tidy and well swept, with a good fire within, and clear sunshine gleaming in
                  through the little casement from without, and with an air of comfort contrasting
                  strangely with the distress that reigned around, sat an aged man and woman, some
                  of whose younger relatives were among the buried, quiet, steady, and collected,
                  but with a settled expression of grief resting on their faces. Into this house had
                  also come some of the neighbors, to discourse concerning the common calamity;
                  particularly one or two younger lads who had relations among the buried. And when
                  the friend that called had sat awhile
                  comforting them out of the Bible, others, hearing of this, dropped in; and all
                  seemed earnest to betake themselves to God, who alone, it was felt, could help in
                  this hour of their extremity. Whether it arose from the familiar hazards of a
                  collier's life, known and experienced in that company, or from any other cause
                  better or worse, there was no violence in the grief that abounded; but what their
                  grief wanted in animation and words, it probably possessed in depth and intensity;
                  and, accordingly, there was a disposition to listen with earnestness to the
                  dealings of God in his people's extremities, as these were expounded to them in
                  the cases of Daniel in the lions' den, and Jonah in the belly of the whale, and as
                  they were exhibited in the 130th and 69th Psalms; portions of Scripture which, it
                  will be seen, were at the very same instant being used for the like ends at the
                  bottom of the pit.
               The other houses of the sufferers and their friends in the villages all more or
                  less resembled that which has been described, and it is needless to describe them.
                  One only shall be mentioned. It was a remarkably neat and well-conditioned
                  cottage, consisting of a single apartment, with its nice new bed, chest of drawers
                  and eight-day clock, and its homely glazed prints of Thomson's Seasons, and the
                  Prodigal Son, hung around. Here on that nice bed, lay stretched at full length, in
                  a state of utter insensibility, a young woman recently married to one of the
                  unhappy men below, from whom she had parted but the night before, in his usual
                  health. To her neither the words of Divine truth nor of worldly comfort obtained
                  any access. She was stupefied by the blow, and insensible, and time alone, under
                  Divine Providence, could restore her.
               By this time, the day being far advanced, the hope of the sufferers' safety had
                  greatly diminished among the parties engaged at the pit mouth, and, in some cases,
                  had given place to despair, because it was believed that the air below must now be
                  too foul to sustain either light or life. But among the people of the coal
                  villages there was more hope; and all
                  agreed that, at any rate, it was the business of those on the surface of the earth
                  to pray to God, and to wrestle with him for the preservation of those below.
                  Accordingly, it is believed, that in very many houses there, Bible reading,
                  praise, and prayer, were much resorted to throughout the whole of that eventful
                  day.
               The day rolled on, night came, and no appearance of deliverance came with it. Many
                  speculations were afloat as to the condition of those below. Some pictured them
                  dead in each other's arms, or gasping for breath amidst the coal wastes to which
                  they had crept in their vain search for air. Some saw them sunk in the depths of
                  passive despondency, or cursing their lot in the paroxysms of their violent
                  despair. All yielded more or less to fears for the issue of the dreadful
                  adventure. Not a few, however, mingled or overcame their fears with the hope,
                  that, through the mercy of God, more or less of their number might yet, after all,
                  be spared. But more indulged in this expectation from a desire, than from a
                  belief, that it might be so. All felt, that every hour, as it passed along, shut
                  up the door of hope more firmly against the buried.
               What, then, was the state of these prisoners themselves during this long period of
                  alternate fear and hope, and exertion and suspense above? The question shall be
                  answered in the words of one of their own number, Peter Hay of Millerhill, a man
                  whose character shall be left to be inferred from what he is now to be brought
                  forward to relate of the adventures of these two awful nights and awful day. His
                  account was taken down in short-hand from his own lips soon after the date of the
                  occurrence, by the Editor of this tract, who desires to adhere to Peter's own
                  words, rather than garnish his tale with finer expressions; believing that the
                  simplicity of nature, and the raciness of the primitive vernacular, will prove
                  more effective than the arts of rhetoric, or decorations of a purer dialect. He
                  would only call attention, before relating Peter's words, to that worthy person's
                  modesty, who, avoiding the vain-glorious "I," in the account he gives of his addresses to his fellow-sufferers, prefaces
                  them with the more humble "It was observed," instead.
               "Our pit," says Peter Hay, "was called the High Pressure pit; and according to the
                  regulations, we went down about eight o'clock at night, on that awful Friday, to
                  engage in our lawful employment, which was that of preparing roads for carrying
                  the coals to the pit bottom. There were of Adam's Row men, John Nicolson, the
                  gatesman, whose business was to see that the work was done to his mind, and he
                  makes every one do as he thinks proper; George Campbell; Thomas Reid; Jamieson
                  Bennett; James Reid; George Pride; and Betsy Campbell, George's wife. And of
                  Millerhill there were myself; John Reid; Ellen Reid, his daughter, aged 15; Janet
                  Shaw, 30; James Reid, of the old engine at Hungrymouth; and Margaret Adam, his
                  daughter, aged about 12."
               It may not be inappropriate here so far to interrupt the narrative as to say, that
                  had the accident happened the preceding day, there would have been twenty-three
                  sufferers instead of thirteen. Two, also, it may be mentioned of the thirteen
                  (Bennett and James Reid), had been sent down out of their regular course to
                  perform a particular work that night, and so seemed specially appointed to what
                  ensued. But it was well they were there; for they both, Bennett in particular,
                  materially helped in the rescue.
               "The four women," Peter went on to say, "were carrying the rubbish. I was taking
                  it from them, and putting it in the waste; that is, filling up the vacancies where
                  coals have been taken away before. The men were building biggings for holding back
                  the road, saving two, who were cutting down stone to make the road higher. George
                  Pride was filling water, of which there were about two feet at the foot of the
                  pit. Now, while we were all thus engaged in our lawful employment, as I said,
                  between nine and ten at night, George Pride arrived among us from the pit bottom
                  in great agony, with the fearful tidings that our pit was giving way!"
               
               A slight dropping, it may be mentioned, of loose earth and stones, had taken
                  place, which was repeated increasingly at intervals, and caused the alarm.
               "John Nicolson would not at first believe that the thing was so disastrous, and
                  continued at his work for a little; but at length he went to see, and took with
                  him George Pride, Jamieson Bennett, and James Reid. To our awful dismay, the pit
                  at that time gave way with three fearful claps, which exactly closed up every
                  avenue whatever at the pit bottom; threw John Reid against the wall, cutting his
                  face much, and knocked down one or two more against the wall and into the water. I
                  ran to them, and keppit John [caught him in my arms], his face streaming with
                  blood. Says he, 'Peter, Peter, what is to become of us now! We'll never see our
                  wives and bairns mair!' Says I, 'John, there is no fear, I hope we shall see them
                  yet.' But truly, I must say, we all felt consternation on coming to think that we
                  were just buried three hundred and sixty feet down in the earth, and seemed as if
                  shut up to a certain death.
               "We resolved, however, to go away to the Back Dean Air-gate, thinking to ourselves
                  that if we could not make our escape there, we were indeed completely gone!"
               This Air-gate was a long crooked drain-like passage, about three quarters of a
                  mile in length, cut through the rock and coal from the High Pressure pit to the
                  Back Dean. It was in most places only two or three feet high, though in some as
                  high as five or six; and it was generally between two and four feet wide. It was
                  merely for the passage of air, and was closed in by a strong door near the place
                  where the colliers were sitting at the bottom of the High Pressure pit. The Back
                  Dean pit had, for a considerable time, been abandoned, and at the period in
                  question, it was in contemplation to abandon also the High Pressure pit workings,
                  the coal being very much exhausted; a circumstance that explains the state of
                  disrepair in which the Air-gate was found to be.
               "The door of the Air-gate," said Peter,
                  "was soon broken open, and we travelled into that old Air-gate. But we had not
                  advanced far, when a mass of rubbish stopped our progress. We commenced to get it
                  cleared; and this occupied may-be four or five of our men for three or four hours.
                  Some of us got wedges, and a punch and mell; but we had to cut a foot off the mell
                  shaft, the working place was so small.
               "I had remained behind; but after a time going to see how they were getting on,
                  John Nicolson said to me, 'Go away and tell the men to yoke to the pit bottom, and
                  see and get it cleared, for this place is completely choked up. It will never do.
                  There's no air here.' 'Oh!' said I, 'is there no appearance of any opening?' 'No,
                  Peter,' said he, 'it is as close as the wall face!' We therefore commenced on the
                  pit bottom, and continued till word was brought that they had got an opening in
                  the Air-gate.
               "This was glad news, and by this opening (a little one it was), we proceeded,
                  creeping and groping our way, till we came to water. John Reid went in, but soon
                  went to the chin in it; and the air became exceeding bad. It put out four or five
                  of our lamps; and we could scarcely breathe in it. It was necessary, therefore, to
                  leave it. Those behind were told to move back, taking good care of their lights.
                  So we all returned to the High Pressure pit bottom, and began again to work at the
                  stuff there; and here we continued till the bad air extinguished every light we
                  had at the pit bottom. Still, however, we had light out o'er at the place we
                  originally were working at, and that was some comfort to us. We called this our
                  head-quarters, for we always returned to it."
               And here let the reader pause and reflect for a moment on the situation of these
                  thirteen persons buried alive. The world, in thinking of a coal-pit, is apt to
                  liken it in imagination to the great mines of story, deep down in the earth it may
                  be, but roomy, and with their vaulted roofs rising high over head. But different
                  is the coal-pit of the period now in question. Imagine yourself four hundred feet down in the depths of the earth, in
                  a low, close, irregular driftway, the roof supported by fir staves, called pit
                  stobs, which alone seem to prevent the impending mass from precipitating itself on
                  you. Imagine a set of men, and poor unhappy women, dirtily clad, if clad they can
                  be called, their little oil lamps fixed on their foreheads, yielding the only
                  light which the place affords; all generally in a stooping posture, because rarely
                  overhead is there space to stand upright; some laid at full length on their sides,
                  wielding the pickaxe against the coal, is the only attitude practicable; and
                  others, the women not excepted, chained with harness to their wagons, dragging
                  these on all-fours; while here and there is a man cutting a passage for the
                  trickling water that bedews them on every side; all oppressed with the close heat
                  of the place, which is perpetual, and pursuing their daily and nightly task in a
                  dull silence congenial to the scene. Here is matter enough for anxious feeling to
                  any inhabitant of the upper world, whom business or curiosity may have brought
                  down to this lower region. But let any such person figure to himself his own
                  state, if, while there, he should hear a roar like thunder, and a mighty rush of
                  mixed stones, rubbish, and coal pouring down like a cataract, and blocking up his
                  only way of escape! Such was the state of these poor colliers on the night of the
                  accident; differing, to be sure, in so far, from that of the stranger, that they
                  were inured from infancy to hardship and danger, but similar to his, inasmuch as
                  they were, like him, accessible to fear for themselves, and to sorrow for dear
                  relatives whom a few hours before they had left in health and prosperity, in their
                  cottages at home.
               Let us follow them, then, throughout the varying circumstances of the night, and
                  resume our fellowship with them seated in silence in their dismal
                  "head-quarters."
               "Well," said Peter, "the women were sitting here, for they did not engage in the
                  clearing of the rubbish; the men only did that. Here we all gathered together, and
                  this place became a kind of Bethel *
                   to us; for after we had sat down and become composed, John Nicolson
                  proposed that prayer should be offered up, for they saw nothing but evidently
                  death before them; and he fixed on me to pray. We placed ourselves all down in a
                  composed manner, for I asked them all to be sedate; and so they were, you may
                  believe. There were some among them, indeed, who knew the Scriptures. Jamieson
                  Bennett, in particular, showed great faith, and was full of the promises. Poor
                  Betsy Campbell was very composed too, but whiles broke out into raptures, saying,
                  'she would never see her twa bairns mair.'
               
                  
                  *This Bethel was about eight feet by fourteen in size, and only three feet
                     and a half high; so that standing erect was out of the question in it.
               
               "All then being quiet and composed, we sung the first four verses of the 20th
                  Psalm, and I prayed: 
                     
                        'Jehovah hear thee in the day
                        When trouble he doth send.
                        And let the name of Jacob's God
                        Thee from all ill defend.
                     
                     
                        O let him help send from above,
                        Out of his sanctuary;
                        From Sion, his own holy hill,
                        Let him give help to thee.
                     
                     
                        Let him remember all thy gifts,
                        Accept thy sacrifice:
                        Grant thee thy heart's wish, and fulfil
                        Thy thoughts and counsel wise.
                     
                     
                        In thy salvation we will joy;
                        In our God's name we will
                        Display our banners: and the Lord
                        Thy prayers all fulfil.'
                     
                  
               
               "We then sat and crackit [conversed freely together] awhile, and afterwards sent a
                  deputation to the Back Dean pit, to see if there was any relief coming from that
                  quarter, for we thought they might get down from above there and work their way
                  towards us by the auld Air-gate. But they returned and said they had gone as far
                  as they could for the air, and hallooed and shouted to see if there was anybody
                  coming, but they heard no sound; and it was concluded that we certainly must die,
                  for we thought the High Pressure pit was filled to the daylight, and the Air-gate
                  close, and hence that there was no hope for us.
               
               "A great deal of us were in highly low spirits at this time, because we saw
                  nothing but death evidently before us. We fell a-cracking, however; and it was
                  observed, 'That while there was life there was hope. Let us rejoice that we have a
                  God that can hear and answer prayer wherever his people are; for though we are
                  shut up in the bowels of the earth, yet he is able to hear us, and he can both
                  hear us and deliver us. He is the same God yesterday, to-day, and forever, without
                  variableness or shadow of turning. Let us remember the wonderful deliverance he
                  wrought for the Israelites, when, for their escape from the land of Egypt to
                  Canaan, he opened a way for them in the Red Sea; and when there was nothing but
                  insurmountable mountains on both hands, the roaring ocean before, and the enemy
                  pursuing behindâ€”when all refuge seemed to have failed, and they thought, many of
                  them, that nothing could deliver them, then it was that the very next thing they
                  heard was the Lord speaking to Moses, and saying "Speak unto the people that they
                  go forward." Man's extremity is God's opportunity. Let us not despair. Let us
                  resign ourselves entirely to his will and pleasure. Let us be putting ourselves in
                  a posture fit for death, and, with the highest resignation, submit ourselves to
                  whatever seems to him best for us.'
               "Now, you must know, that by this time our lights were altogether gone out. The
                  air was too bad to support them. So we were left quite in the dark; and I must
                  tell you that this turned out, as you will see, a happy thing for us, though we
                  liked it not at the time.
               "It was then observed, and it is interesting to mark how the observation flows out
                  of the loss of their lights, evidently leading to the thought, 'That though we
                  should never behold each other in the face on this side of time, we hoped the next
                  time we met would be in the light of the New Jerusalem, where the sun should never
                  go down, nor the moon withdraw her shining.' It was observed of this glorious
                     place,
                  
                     
                        'No darkness now, no dismal night,
                        No vapor intercepts the light;
                        We see forever face to face
                        The highest Prince in highest place.
                     
                     
                        This, this does heaven enough afford,
                        We are forever with the Lord;
                        We want no more, for all is givenâ€”
                        His presence is the heart of heaven.'*
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  *Erskine's Gospel Sonnets.
               
               "We then crackit in respect of our families. It was observed, 'That desperate as
                  our case was, though they were above, they were much to be pitied; for no doubt
                  they were bewailing us, and thinking of the loss of friendsâ€ 
                   they were about to suffer. And this made us think that there should be
                  more prayer and praise. So the 121st Psalm was sung, because that was good for
                  all, whether on the earth or under the earth. 
                     
                        'I to the hills will lift mine eyes,
                        From whence doth come mine aid;
                        My safety cometh from the Lord
                        Who heaven and earth hath made.
                     
                     
                        Thy foot he'll not let slide, nor will
                        He slumber that thee keeps,
                        Behold he that keeps Israel
                        He slumbers not, nor sleeps.
                     
                     
                        The Lord thee keeps, the Lord thy shade
                        On thy right hand doth stay;
                        The moon by night thee shall not smite,
                        Nor yet the sun by day.
                     
                     
                        The Lord shall keep thy soul, he shall
                        Preserve thee from all ill;
                        Henceforth thy going out and in
                        God keep for ever will.'
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  â€ In Scotland, "friends" includes, if it do not specially mean, "relations;" a
                     curious enough philological indication, by-the-bye, of the national clanish
                     characteristic.
               
               "Prayer was then offered a second time; after which the next topic conversed on
                  was the three Children in the fiery furnace. The might of that God was observed
                  upon, who changed the element of fire, that it had no power on these three
                  children when they believed and called on his name; and it was concluded, that if
                  he was able to qualify the element of fire, so that the smell of fire did not pass
                  on them, and not so much as an hair of their heads was singed, he was surely able
                  to make a way of escape for us, dark as our case was.
               "Let me here tell you that the girls at first cried for hunger; but the hunger wore off. Hunger
                  never touched any of the older ones. We had plenty of water; and it was observed,
                  'That the Lord had once made water into wine, and if it was so ordered, he could
                  make that water support us, the same as if it was flesh.'"
               Before proceeding with the narrative, it may be useful to call attention to one
                  circumstance, that whereas hitherto, and in the earlier stages, while hope may
                  have been more buoyant, 
                     the the
                     the
                   addresses refer leadingly to the miraculous agency of God in the
                  deliverances of his people; now when death came into more close contact with them,
                  there is more of Christ by degrees, and of his saving graceâ€”an unintentional
                  evidence of the power and value of the Cross whensoever death, judgment, and
                  eternity become, not vague generalities, but practical realities in the mind.
               "Some of the company then," said Peter, "began to think, indeed all of us did,
                  that we had not lived lives corresponding to the light that we had enjoyed, the
                  light of the precious Gospel shining in its brightness amongst us. One of them,
                  James Reid of the Old Engine, said, 'Surely if I escape, it will become me to turn
                  over a new leaf!' and every one seemed to feel his own deficiency, and his need of
                  a Saviour."
               Such were the feelings and resolutions of these people while under the pressure of
                  distress; and it will be seen in the sequel that, as they were incited to serious
                  thoughts by impending danger, so they were afterwards called on, by gratitude for
                  a very marvellous deliverance, to fulfil every vow they had made; for not one of
                  them suffered any hurt, but all were restored to their friends in health, and they
                  are all yet alive. The whole thirteen lately paid a visit to the present recorder
                  of their adventure, at his house at Belfield; the older parties bent down with
                  advancing years, and the younger risen into manhood and womanhood, but all in good
                  health and spirits. Have their vows then been remembered? Have the serious
                  impressions and the deep convictions of the hour of trouble retained their power? Let them, and let all who have
                  experienced the softening power of affliction while it lasts, put these questions
                  to their hearts and consciences with earnestness and with anxiety; for nothing is
                  more certain than that mere external influences, however fearful, or at the moment
                  influential, will never of themselves produce a saving change on any man: though
                  when real at the time, and cherished afterwards, they may be the means employed by
                  the Spirit for effecting that saving change.
               "During the night, when we were getting low, 'My friends,' said I, 'to divert you
                  and strengthen you as much as possible, I will repeat a hymn to you: 
                     
                        'Happy the company that's gone
                        From cross to crown, from thrall to throne.
                        How loud they sing upon the shore
                        To which they sailed in heart before!
                     
                     
                        "Bless'd are the dead," yea, saith the Word,
                        "That die in Christ," the living God,
                        And on the other side of death
                        Thus joyful spend their parting breath:
                     
                     
                        "Death from all death hath set us free,
                        And will our gain forever be;
                        Death loosed the massy chains of woe,
                        To let the mournful captives go.
                     
                     
                        Death is to us a sweet repose;

                        The cage was broke to let us fly,
                        And build our happy nest on high.
                     
                     
                        Faith once stole down a distant kiss,
                        Now Love cleaves to the cheek of Bliss;
                        Beyond the fear of more mishap,
                        We gladly rest in Glory's lap.
                     
                     
                        Earth was to us a seat of warâ€”
                        On thrones of triumph now we are;
                        We longed to see our Jesus dear,
                        And sought him there, but find him here.
                     
                     
                        We see him at the table head
                        With living water, living bread,
                        His cheerful guests incessant load,
                        With all the plenitude of God.
                     
                     
                        We see the holy flaming fires,
                        Cherubic and seraphic choirs,
                        And gladly join with those on high
                        To warble praise eternally.
                     
                     
                        Glory to God that here we came,
                        And glory to the glorious Lamb;
                        Our light, our life, our joy, our all
                        Is in our arms, and ever shall.
                     
                     
                        Our Lord is ours, and we are his,
                        Yea, now we see him as he is;
                        And hence we like unto him are,
                        And full his glorious image share."
                     
                     
                     
                        While thus I laid my listening ear
                        Close to the door of heaven to hear,
                        And then the sacred page did view
                        Which told me all I heard was true;
                     
                     
                        Yet show'd me that the heavenly song
                        Surpasses every mortal tongue,
                        With such unutterable strains
                        As none in fett'ring flesh attains;
                     
                     
                        Then said I, "O to mount away,
                        And leave this log of heavy clay;
                        Let wings of time more hasty fly,
                        That I may join the songs on high!"'*
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  *Erskine's Gospel Sonnets, part v., sect. 6, p. 191.
               
               "This hymn was a great consolation, both to myself, and to them who heard it.
                  Indeed, I must just say to you at once, that this, after all, was one of the
                  sweetest and shortest Saturday nights I ever passed, and I daresay there never was
                  a more solemn church on the earth, than was that night at the pit-bottom in the
                  heart of the earth.
               "After the hymn, the wives and families were the next subject resumed, every one
                  lamenting and mourning for his own. I repeated several times, that it seemed to be
                  a dear High Pressure pit to me, for only nine months before, I had lost a
                  beautiful daughter there,*
                   and now to all appearance, I was to fall a sacrifice in the same place
                   myself!
               
                  
                  *This young girl was working at the foot of the pit, when a lump of coal fell
                     from the ascending bucket, then at a great height, on her head, and felled
                     her to the ground. Thanks to Lord Ashley, no collier's daughter can now so
                     die!
               
               "About this time, another detachment was sent to see if there was any relief
                  coming from the Back Dean pit. But they returned with the former sad tidings, that
                  they heard nobody coming, and that the air was closer than ever.
               "It was then agreed that prayer and praise should be offered once more, and we
                  sung the 130th Psalm, and I prayed: 
                     
                        'Lord, from the depths to thee I cried,
                        My voice, Lord, do thou hear;
                        Unto my supplication's voice
                        Give an attentive ear.
                     
                     
                        Lord, who shall stand, if thou, O Lord,
                        Shouldst mark iniquity?
                        But yet with thee forgiveness is,
                        That feared thou mayest be.
                     
                     
                        I wait for God, my soul doth wait,
                        My hope is in his word;
                        
                        More than they that for morning watch
                        My soul waits for the Lord.
                     
                     
                        I say more than they that do watch
                        The morning light to see;
                        Let Israel hope in the Lord,
                        For with him mercies be:
                     
                     
                        And plenteous redemption
                        Is ever found with him,
                        And from all his iniquities
                        He Israel shall redeem.'
                     
                  
               
               "The subject of Jonah in the whale's belly came then under our view. It was
                  observed, 'That Jonah from the bottom of the mountains had prayed and cried to
                  God, and that, awful as his case was, this God, who filled the immensity of space
                  with his presence, heard that prayer and spoke to that fish, so that it threw him
                  out on the dry ground;' and from this it was observed that we should encourage
                  ourselves, because that same God, who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in
                  working, could open up a way of recovery for us, desperate as our case seemed to
                  be. We remembered Daniel also in the lions' den. For all the enemies he had, none
                  could find any fault
                     
                  
                   in Daniel, except his worshipping his God.
                  Yet, like God's people in all ages, he was persecuted. But he placed his
                  confidence in God. As Joshua had done before him, he determined, whatsoever others
                  did, to serve the Lord; and so in his extremity the Lord heard his cry and
                  answered his prayer, and sent his angel and delivered him from all his powerful
                  enemies. And why not us also? said we. While there was life there was hope; and we
                  ought to evince energy in such a case, and console and strengthen each other."
               This effort of faith with the hope springing out of it may, not unnaturally, have
                  led the mind of Peter, by contrast, back to the subject of death; and then of
                  course came the Gospel, the one resource in real extremities. For, said he,
               "It was then observed, 'That it was a grand thing to be preparing for death,
                  whatever might be the event of the providence that had befallen us; for that we
                  never could be losers by preparing to appear before the judgment-seat of Christ.
                  And with respect to the efficacy cacy and
                  sufficiency of Christ's atonement for sinners, it was certain that "He was able to
                  save unto the very uttermost all that come unto God by him; for he is exalted at
                  the right hand of the Majesty on high, a Prince and a Saviour for to give
                  repentance unto Israel and the remission of sins." And it was observed, 'That with
                  respect to prayer, none need to be at a loss; for do you not remember the Pharisee
                  and the Publican? The one had a long prayer; the other a short one. The Publican
                  smote on his breast, and just said, "God be merciful to me a sinner;" and that
                  prayer, which was heard and answered, any one can use.'
               "Much was also spoken out of the 1st chapter of Isaiah, and chiefly from this
                  passage, 'Come, now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins
                  be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson,
                  they shall be as wool.' This they are to be through the blood and the
                  righteousness of Christ, freely offered to the worst of sinners.
               "About this time a part of the 51st Psalm was sung. 
                     
                        'Of gladness and of joyfulness,
                        Make me to hear the voice,
                        That so these very bones which thou
                        Hast broken may rejoice.
                     
                     
                        All mine iniquities blot out,
                        Thy face hide from my sin;
                        Create a clean heart, Lord, renew
                        A right sp'rit me within.
                     
                     
                        Cast me not from thy sight, nor take
                        Thy Holy Sp'rit away.
                        Restore me thy salvation's joy;
                        With thy free Sp'rit me stay.'"
                     
                  
               
               It is singular to observe the care about the disposal of the body, which will
                  creep in even where that might seem the least part of a present and deep
                  suffering. These men were not unawake to this point, and they began to think of
                  the sort of burial that awaited their bodies. "Prayer," said Peter, "was now
                  offered again; and it was observed, 'That if we died there, it would be long
                  before they came to our bodies, if ever they did. But with respect to our bodies,
                  we need not be careful; for if we were
                  mindful of our precious souls, and were putting them into the hands of our
                  merciful Creator, he was able to save both soul and body, no matter where the
                  bodies were mouldering, or whether they had burial or not.'
               "I should have mentioned, that about six o'clock at night, as we thought, it was
                  resolved to write our names on a stone, and say on it that we were alive at that
                  hour, so that friends might know something about us when they come to find our
                  bodies, if ever they found them. And I began to write accordingly; but just at
                  this time, after I had written one or two names, the lights went out, we were left
                  in utter darkness, and I could write no more! Our comfort on this head was that
                  God would know where our bodies were.
               "After this, the passage from 1st Thessalonians, iv. 14, was observed on, 'For if
                  we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus
                  will God bring with him.' Verses 17 and 18 of Revelation chapter i., were also
                  repeated, 'And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead, and he laid his hand
                  upon me, saying unto me, Fear not, I am the first and the last; I am he that
                  liveth and was dead, and behold I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys
                  of hell and of death.' Revelation, xiv. 13, was likewise very precious to us, 'And
                  I heard a voice from heaven, saying, Write, Blessed are the dead that die in the
                  Lord; yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors, and their works
                  do follow them.'
               "Various hymns were repeated, as also the 58th Paraphrase, beginning, 
                     
                        'Where high the heav'nly temple stands,
                        The house of God not made with hands,
                        A great High Priest our nature wears,
                        The guardian of mankind appears.
                     
                     
                        He who for men their Surety stood,
                        And pour'd on earth his precious blood,
                        Pursues in heav'n his mighty plan,
                        The Saviour and the Friend of man.
                     
                     
                        Though now ascended up on high,
                        He bends on earth a Brother's eye;
                        Partaker of the human name,
                        He knows the frailty of our frame.
                     
                     
                        Our fellow-suff'rer yet retains
                        A fellow-feeling of our pains;
                        
                        And still remembers in the skies
                        His tears, his agonies, and cries.
                     
                     
                        In ev'ry pang that rends the heart,
                        The Man of Sorrows had a part;
                        He sympathizes with our grief,
                        And to the suff'rer sends relief.
                     
                     
                        With boldness, therefore, at the throne,
                        Let us make all our sorrows known;
                        And ask the aids of heav'nly pow'r
                        To help us in the evil hour.'
                     
                  
               
               "We also sung a part of the 30th Paraphrase. 
                     
                        'Come let us to the Lord our God
                        With contrite hearts return;
                        Our God is gracious, nor will leave
                        The desolate to mourn.
                     
                     
                        Long hath the night of sorrow reign'd,
                        The dawn shall bring us light;
                        God shall appear, and we shall rise
                        With gladness in his sight.
                     
                     
                        Our hearts, if God we seek to know,
                        Shall know him and rejoice;
                        His coming like the morn shall be,
                        Like morning songs his voice.'
                     
                  
               
               "A conversation then ensued, and Thomas Reid requested me if I would pray the
                  Lord's Prayer. His request was granted. Then the first four verses of the 103d
                  Psalm were repeated, and likewise Psalm 137th: on which it was observed, that the
                  Jew's captivity might be spoken of as resembling our own. Surely we all at this
                  time preferred Jerusalem above our chiefest joy!
               "At one time when we were sitting close togetherâ€”it was a long time to converse,
                  and we were all in the darkâ€”our company became very melancholy. Some thought that
                  every avenue for our escape was shut up; others thought something might yet be
                  done. At length it was agreed that another deputation should be sent to see if any
                  relief was coming from the Back Dean pit. They returned with the same melancholy
                  news that none appeared, and the place was as close as before. This no doubt
                  increased the alarm among us; on which it was observed: 'Let us not fear, but put
                  our implicit confidence in that God who rides on the whirlwind and directs the
                  storm, whose way is in the sea and his path in the mighty waters, and whose
                  footsteps are not known. Trust in the all-powerful Jehovah, who weighs the mountains in scales, and taketh up
                  the isles as a very little thing, who measureth the waters in the hollow of his
                  hand, who is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working. His ways are not as
                  our ways, for he could even yet make a way of escape for us, dark, dreary, and
                  dismal as our case seemed to be.'
               "With respect to death, our words turned on the topic of our families, and we
                  thought that we should never more see our dwellings. But we then remembered the
                  sufficiency of the Redeemer to answer every one of our cases, how diversified
                  soever they might; and it was nothing beyond his power to make us meet our
                  families again, if not in the present world, certainly in another world, by making
                  us all meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light. But nothing
                  could redeem a soul but Christ; and it was evidently pointed out to the company,
                  that they must put their whole dependence on Him, for there was 'none other name
                  under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. For no sinner could find
                  acceptance with God, saving in and through the Lord Jesus Christ; for out of
                  Christ he is a consuming fire, but in and through Jesus Christ, a reconciled
                  Father. No other sacrifice could satisfy the Divine law, no, not even the cattle
                  on a thousand hills; nor could the brightest intelligence that circles the throne
                  above, pay a ransom for man's transgressions: but Christ has done this. Let us
                  then, as it is said in the Epistle to the Hebrews, 'draw near with a true heart,
                  that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help us in the time of need.'
               "And truly this was a time of need with us!
               "This made them think of hearing another hymn; and this was repeated:*
                  
                  
                     
                        'In heavenly choirs a question rose
                        That stirred up strife will never closeâ€”
                        What rank of all the ransomed race
                        Owes highest praise to sov'reign Grace?
                     
                     
                        Babes thither caught from womb and breast
                        Claim'd right to sing above the rest,
                        Because they found the happy shore
                        They never saw nor sought before.
                     
                     
                     
                        Those that arrived at riper age
                        Before they left the dusky stage
                        Thought Grace deserved yet higher praise
                        That wash'd the blood of num'rous days.
                     
                     
                        Anon the war more close began
                        What praising harp should lead the van?
                        And which of Grace's heavenly peers
                        Was deepest run in her arrears?
                     
                     
                        "'Tis I," (said one) "'bove all my race
                        Am debtor chief to glorious Grace;"
                        "Nay," (said another) "hark, I trow
                        I'm more obliged to Grace than you."
                     
                     
                        "Stay," (said a third) "I deepest share
                        In owing praise beyond compare;
                        The chief of sinners, you'll allow,
                        Must be the chief of singers now."
                     
                     
                        "Hold," (said a fourth) "I here protest
                        My praises must outvie the best,
                        For I'm, of all the human race,
                        The highest miracle of Grace."
                     
                     
                        "Stop," (said a fifth) "these notes forbear,
                        Lo! I 'm the greatest wonder here,
                        For I of all the race that fell
                        Deserved the lowest place in hell."
                     
                     
                        A soul that higher yet aspired,
                        With equal love to Jesus fired,
                        "'Tis mine to sing the highest notes
                        To love that washed the foulest blots."
                     
                     
                        "Ho," (cried a mate) "'tis mine, I'll prove,
                        Who sinned in spite of light and love.
                        To sound his praise with loudest bell
                        That saved me from the lowest hell."
                     
                     
                        "Come, come," (said one) "I'll hold the plea,
                        That highest praise is due by me,
                        For mine, of all the saved by Grace,
                        Was the most dreadful, desperate case."
                     
                     
                        Another, rising at his side,
                        As fond to praise and free of pride,
                        Cried, "Pray give place, for I defy
                        That you should owe more praise than I.
                     
                     
                        I'll yield to none in this debate
                        I'm run so deep in Grace's debt,
                        That sure I am, I boldly can
                        Compare with all the heavenly clan."
                     
                     
                        Thus in sweet, holy, humble strife,
                        Along their endless, joyful life,
                        Of Jesus all the harpers rove,
                        And sing the wonders of his love.'
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  *Erskine's Gospel Sonnets, chap. v., sect. 1, p. 251.
               
               "From the view of these different characters it was observed, 'That none need
                  despair, since Christ had made atonement for the vilest of the vile. Accordingly,
                  that in the regions of glory there would be found divers characters, from all
                  nations, people, kindreds, and tongues upon earth; and it was good for us to put
                  ourselves under his care and protection, and to resign all to his holy will and
                     pleasure, dreadful as it was to dwell
                  on a certain death and day of judgment.' For, no doubt, thought we, we must all
                  appear shortly before the God that made us, to answer for the deeds done in the
                  body, whether they were good or evil."
               Let it be observed here how these people mixed the use of means with their
                  prayers. There was equally the life and the sobriety of faith among men. Said
                  Peter, "By this time we were beginning again to consider about making another
                  trial, and seeing whether any relief was coming to us from above by the Back Dean
                  pit. Three, accordingly, were sent out, myself, Jamieson Bennett, and James Reid.
                  I went first, till we came to the water's edge, and there we sat down and
                  consulted; when it was agreed among us all that we thought the air was better, and
                  indeed that it was tolerably good. We had no lights to prove it, but judged only
                  from our breathing, and we were all of this opinion."
               This is an interesting circumstance. These men were habituated to nice
                  observation, particularly in regard to air, in their subterraneous neous
                  occupations: and on the present occasion, their perception was as correct as it
                  was nice. Previously they had found the air very bad, and judged it insupportable.
                  They were right. On these occasions, the water rose nearly to the rubbish
                  overhead, very much excluding all communication of air from without. But in the
                  interval, a change, though unknown to them, had taken place. The Back Dean
                  Air-gate had, in fact, during their confinement, become more freely ventilated
                  than at first. This was effected through the prompt and considerate measures taken
                  in the course of the day by Messrs. Stenhouse and Sir John Hope of Pinkie, who had
                  set on their engines at the different water-pits in the neighborhood with
                  redoubled power, and by the general draught thereby caused, had lowered the water
                  in the Air-gate the necessary number of inches to admit of a flux of air, and of
                  the narrow and precarious passage through it, to be now described.
               "Feeling the improvement," says Peter, "we all agreed to return with the tidings,
                     that there was no relief appearing
                  from the Back Dean pit; but that the air was better in the Air-gate, and that we
                  proposed to make a trial of it, if they all were agreeable.
               "So we returned and told them. But they were refractory and unbelieving. One
                  indeed said, he had made up his mind to die where he was, and if any of us escaped
                  with life, we might give intimation to his friends where they would find his body.
                  It was replied, 'That, to be sure, if we sat there, it was inevitable death; but
                  here the story of the four lepers occurred to be spoken to. If they stood where
                  they were, it was death; if they entered into the city, it was still death; if
                  they entered into the camp of the Assyrians, it was but death. Therefore they
                  entered. We were bound to use every energy while we had breath, for rescuing our
                  lives from destruction, and then to leave the event with God. To sit still there,
                  was little else than suicide. If we wished to die, it was our part to buy death at
                  the dearest rate; and we had some prospect of life at the end of the proposed
                  trial.'
               "It was no wonder, after all, that there was some difficulty about trying; for
                  since then I have seen the place again, and I can truly say, that if we had had
                  light at the time, to see the holes into which we had to creep, I scarcely think
                  we would have ventured to go. But see how good God was! We grieved when our lights
                  went out; but God put them out in mercy, that we might not fear to enter into the
                  narrow places for our life. The loss of our light was just the means of our
                  life.
               "So it was agreed that three should make a trial, and the rest follow half an hour
                  afterwards. The three appointed to go were, Jamieson Bennett, John Reid, and
                  George Pride. But they would not go without me; so of course four were sent away.
                  Half an hour was allowed for removing the obstacles in the way, and making a clear
                  passage. So we four went on till we came to the water's edge. Then we sat down,
                  and prayer was offered to the prayer-hearing God.
               "After this, we went into the water. At our very first entrance, we crept on our
                  bellies for perhaps four or five yards;
                  so low was the roof, and all in the dark. The roof had sitten down where we crept,
                  and the water was floating round our mouths; so that we had to turn the backs of
                  our heads round, to keep our mouths out of the water. We pressed on and on,
                  however, and with a little more comfort, occasionally being able, with tolerable
                  ease, to keep our feet. But soon we came to a broad flag-stone. On this, Bennett
                  and Reid called back, that if they did not get picks, they could proceed no
                  farther, for they had got a stone here which lay across the whole way."
               And now, let the reader pause an instant for reflection. Here were thirteen human
                  beings buried deep down in the earth, preparing to work their way in the dark,
                  burrowing, like moles, through nearly a mile of a close, narrow, winding, and old
                  deserted passage, known to be in disrepair throughout, who were met on their very
                  entrance, and by way of earnest of what might be to follow, by a fallen rock
                  blocking up their way in front. What ground for apprehension and fear was there
                  not here! How many similar obstructions, might they not think, lay before them,
                  after it should be removed! What falls of rubbish were not to take place by the
                  way, caused by the very rustling of their onward advance! How might not the roof
                  have somewhere or other so sitten down as to meet with the water, instead of being
                  near it, and so effectually stop their progress! Or, might not the air become so
                  vitiated by their own breathing, as to fail for the support of life! How many
                  other undefinable alarms might not the closeness and darkness of the place, and
                  their six-and-thirty hours' exhaustion have conjured up, to make them despond or
                  despair, and, with their reckless comrade, abandon effort and lie down and die!
                  But, in the season of their extremity, they were sustained by an Invisible Power.
                  Their prayers were heard. As their day, so their strength was. Let others, then,
                  taking example from them, and seeking refuge in the midst of difficulties, where
                  succor is alone and is ever to be found, wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and
                  he will strengthen their heart. The
                  journey of life, in many respects, bears resemblance to the Colliers' Air-gate.
                  There are dark passages before, and obstructing rocks around: there are impending
                  cliffs above, and swelling waters beneath. Life, as well as collieries, has its
                  tortuous and torturing ways; and none of us knows, at any time, what crosses lie
                  in his path, what breakers are ahead, and shoals below. But there is a good Guide
                  ever at handâ€”a Leader and Commander of his peopleâ€”who will neither suffer us
                  irrecoverably to stray, nor permit to be laid upon us more than we are able to
                  bear, but will, with the temptation, also make a way to escape, that we may be
                  able to bear it. There is, then, in all situations of life, and in all its varying
                  circumstances, that prudent preparation for coming troubles, which strengthens for
                  the trial and qualifies for successful conflict with it. There is also that
                  nervous apprehension of the evil, which only weakens and unfits for the struggle.
                  Let every one dismiss the nervous fear; and nerved by faith, let him send back,
                  like our colliers, for his pick-axe, or grasp in his hand his staff, when met by
                  his obstructing rock or his swelling stream, and, vigorously assaulting the one,
                  or firmly stemming the other, press on towards the mark, assured of final victory,
                  whether it be in life, or whether it be in death. Through Christ which
                  strengtheneth him, the Christian can do all things.
               But to return to our Collier:â€”"Well," said he, "we had the good presence of mind
                  the day before to leave two picks on the dry ground, a little distant from the
                  water. So George Pride and I returned and found them, and carried them to Bennett
                  and Reid, and they were enabled to remove the flag in a very short time. Just as
                  they got the flag removed, the back parties were making an advance; but they had
                  to stop a little 'till we were ready. So, all things being clear for the march, we
                  proceeded onward, every one following the other, and aye [always] naming each
                  other aloud as we marched on in our journey, to see if all were on the move. We
                  continued thus on our march, till we met with another disagreeable bit; but it was soon overcome.
                  The rubbish had fallen down, and was raised above the level of the water; and the
                  passage was very laigh. We soon surmounted it, however, creeping on our hands and
                  feet. There was no water here, and we got through the rubbish, and marched on.
                  After this we came to a place where we walked on our feet; but the water was very
                  highâ€”in some places higher, in some lower. It was sometimes up to our waists, at
                  other times to our shoulders, touching even our chins; and the women had to hing
                  to [hang by] our necks, and just float and swim as they best might, for it would
                  have drowned them, the young ones at least, to walk. We carried on, however, the
                  best way we could, getting through the water: 'till we observed that we had left
                  some of the party behind, and I waited till the last came forward.
               "By this time I thought that George Pride had found the dry ground, and had
                  escaped away with great joy to the pit mouth; for I cried several times to him,
                  but received no answer swer. So when the rest came up, and were following me, as I
                  thought, I moved up a road or avenue. But I soon found, to my dismay, that I was
                  alone, and that I had gone wrong! I went over a mass of rubbish just twofold; the
                  road became impassible with rubbish, and the air so extremely bad, that one of my
                  ears gave a loud crack and a ring, and the streamers flew from my eyes, and there
                  was excessive heat. Then, thought I, I am certainly wrong here! However, I must be
                  as cool as possible, for I know there are two ways backâ€”a right and a wrong; and I
                  have heard of people's brains turning in such situations! So if my brain were to
                  turn, and I took the one road instead of the other, I might just go back the way I
                  had come, and be lost! With as much coolness of mind, then, as possible, I
                  returned backward, and, turning to the right hand, I again went to the shoulder in
                  water; but at last I reached the dry ground. Then I began to feel the smell of
                  sulphur and reek [smoke]; and as I knew that a lamp hung constantly burning in the
                  Back Dean pit to help the purity of the
                  air, I thought it must be this that was causing the reek and smell, and that I now
                  was indeed in the right way. This was the case: and so I immediately found myself
                  just where we had so long desired to beâ€”hard by the bottom of the Back Dean pit!
                  And that you may believe, was no small comfort unto me!
               "To my great joy, the rest were all safe arrived before myself, nor had they
                  missed me at the time; every one was so excited with his own case. For my own
                  part, before I went up the Air-gate, I was like a lion for strength; but after I
                  came out, I was weak enough. We found the air extremely bad; our sides blew the
                  same as if we had been running a race, for want of breath; and that made us
                  weak.
               "However, we shouted up from the bottom of the pit, and to our great joy we were
                  quickly heard and answered. A bucket was sent down; but, as we were so weakly, a
                  man was sent down with it to help us. So the man descended about half way down the
                  pit. To use his own words, however, he soon did not know whether he was coming
                  down or going up, and he called on them to take him up, for he was not able to
                  live in the air of the place. We who had come from the pit were able to stand it;
                  but the man that had come from the fresh air was not able. So the bucket was again
                  let down, and we were drawn up in the following order: Ellen Reid, James Reid,
                  Janet Shaw, first; then, Jamieson Bennett, John Reid, and Margaret Adam; then,
                  George Campbell, James Reid, and John Nicolson; and Thomas Reid, George Pride, and
                  Betsy Campbell, and myself.
               "So we reached the Back Dean pit head, and again saw the pleasant light of day,
                  about eight o'clock on the Sabbath morning, and my first words were, 'Glory to God
                  in the highest, that I am once more on the earth safe alive.' And glory be to his
                  name I now say, and shall say to the end of my life!"
               Such was the simple narrative of Peter Hay, and such the issue of the fearful
                  adventure which befell him. When it is borne in mind that he was a common working
                  collier at the time, this history will be
                  felt as a new proof of the truth of the Scripture declaration regarding spiritual
                  things, that "A good understanding have all they that observe these
                  things." The man who has received the truth in demonstration of the Spirit and of
                  power, has indeed a fund of judgment and firmness of purpose, which philosophy
                  strives in vain to impart. This was shown in the case of the colliers, by the wise
                  and vigorous measures which, under circumstances of extraordinary difficulty, and
                  with exemplary patience and a courageous dependence on the God of grace and of
                  providence, they took for effecting their passage through the Back Dean
                  Air-gate.
               The whole case ought to be peculiarly gratifying to Lord Ashley, as showing what
                  actually exists already among the unprotected class for whose relief he has so
                  successfully contended, and what will still more largely prevail when the change
                  now happily begun shall have taken full effect on its objects. Let Lord Ashley be
                  assured that even now, among all the better classes of our colliers, the sentiment
                  expressed to the Editor, by the humble individual who is the hero of this tract,
                  is a very general one: "He must be a good man, that Lord Ashley, who delivered the
                  women from going down to the pits."*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *Such as wish to realize Peter's living talk, must pronounce these words,
                     "maun" and "Aushley."
               
               A hundred years ago the colliers of Scotland were by law serfs, adstricti glebÃ¦, attached to the soil and transferred
                  with the property; and though then emancipated, they have not even yet recovered
                  fully the spring and bearing of free men. But their progress will doubtless be
                  accelerated, when the females, instead of being basely harnessed to carts under
                  ground, and habituated to the brutalities of the rudest of their comrades, shall
                  be sent out to service in families, and there learning housewifery, will gradually
                  become "keepers at home," devoting themselves to the proper object of their being,
                  in the care and upbringing of their families. "In another generation," as Peter
                  lately said, "the morals of the colliers will be much refined by the services of
                     the women among the children." But,
                  indeed, it is not necessary in this district to wait the lapse of a generation.
                  Already, through the blessing of God upon the labors of the Rev. Mr. Glass, of
                  Musselburgh, a reformation, if not a revival, has taken place among the collier
                  population of these quarters: where, to a large extent, the Sabbath is sanctified
                  by prayer and church-going, instead of being profaned, as before, by sloth and
                  drunkenness; where the working days see many busily providing for their families
                  by industry, who formerly ruined them by dissipation; and where, let the Editor
                  add, he can boast of having four worthy brother-elders of the Church, common
                  working colliers of Millerhill, Adam's Row, and Craighall.*
                   Not that things are yet as they ought to be. The colliers have long been
                  in a sort of pupilage, breaking out, like children, into play many a time when
                  they ought to work, and particularly liable to this folly when a neighboring fair
                  or horse-race seduces them from their propriety. It is too true yet, for example,
                  that Dalkeith Fair witnesses a week of idleness in this quarter, where there
                  should not be even a day. But the fearful length of the hours of underground
                  workâ€”twelve, thirteen, and even fourteen or more, sometimes on a stretch, a length
                  of labor, to which no human being, even in the most airy work places, should be
                  subjectedâ€”does afford some apology for their otherwise indefensible escapades into
                  play. It is pleasing also to feel assured on this whole matter that, with the
                     progress
                  
                     
                     *Most needful are the services of Lord Ashley and Mr. Glass, in a quarter
                        hard by the scene of this tract; where are to be found another set of
                        females and families, still persisting in a vicious old custom, which ought
                        instantly to be put an end to. The fishwomen of Fisherrow quit their homes
                        every morning with loads on their backs for the markets of Edinburgh, and
                        not returning till nightfall, leave their children meanwhile either to roam
                        about neglected, or intrusted to the care of hirelings incapable of doing
                        them real good. Thirteen sea-captains, it is said, not long ago had risen
                        from being fisher-boys in Cellardyke, where the women are "keepers at home."
                        We doubt if, at the present moment, there be one such from Fisherrow, where
                        the women, though not "idle," which indeed they are not, for they are active
                        and industrious, are, at all events, to be found, in their industry,
                        "wandering about from house to house;" and not only so, "but tattlers also,"
                        "speaking things which they ought not."
                  
                   gress of heavenly wisdom, in
                  which they are undoubtedly growing, a right worldly wisdom will likewise grow; and
                  this, kept in its proper place, and begetting habits of patient industry, will
                  reward them for any present self-denial which it may demand.
               A practical remark of some value is forcibly suggested by one circumstance of this
                  story, viz., the existence of an Air-gate between the two pits forming its scene,
                  which became the means, and was the only means, of the escape of the colliers
                  buried, while busied in their ordinary work. Would it not be well if, for
                  protection against accidents, every coal district throughout the land were
                  provided with similar openings? ifâ€”not between the pits of the same proprietor,
                  but among the pits of the whole proprietors of a coal countryâ€”underground passages
                  were established, that might, in every emergency, become places of refuge? if the
                  mining regions below should everywhere be reticulated with intercommunications
                  connecting with one another, and, at intervals, with the surface of the ground?
                  Surely it would. But if such an arrangement would be good even for its remedial
                  effect on occasions of comparatively rare occurrence, how infinitely greater would
                  its value be in regard to the every day and every night concern of fresh air?
                  Ventilation is a thing just about as important as it is little understood, in
                  regard to our houses and public places above ground: but under ground, it is the
                  very life of the people who there ply their unintermitting daily and nightly
                  tasks. That it is little attended to in these regions, the statistics of collier
                  life, with its "black spit" and its narrow span, but too fatally prove. In many
                  collieries, the majority of the workers die of the species of consumption known as
                  the "black spit," and the average of their life is not much above fifty. The
                  continual inhalation of vitiated air, polluted by re-breathing, as well as by the
                  constant gunpowder blastings, which charge it with sulphur,*
                  is the
                     
                     *In no quarter will the successful issue of Professor Schonbein's experiments
                        be more welcome than in the mines. If the use of his gun cotton, exploding
                        without residuum, should be once introduced, it will clear the pits of a
                        great portion of the atmospheric evils under which they now labor. "Shot
                        reek" rests like a gross murky cloud in the workings, and often is not
                        dispelled when the second shot follows.
                   leading cause of this
                  melancholy fact. By means of an extensive system of under-ground communications,
                  spread like a net-work over the buried country below, there might be such an
                  infusion of fresh air as would greatly relieve the evil, if it did not radically
                  cure it. With the progress of science and the growth of a benevolent spirit, it is
                  possible that a systematic regard may yet come to be paid to this. But the
                  colliers are free men: their lives are in jeopardy: they ought to look to their
                  interests. They have done well in recently substituting tallow oil in their lamps,
                  because, though it costs more, it smokes less. But they cannot do everything. They
                  cannot establish a sanatory cordon of air-passages over a coal country.
                  Parliament, however, can, and the doors of Parliament are as open to them as to
                  the wealthiest in the land. Let them use their privilege then, and petition, let
                  them appeal to their tried friend, LORD ASHLEY, who will not reject their
                  addresses, and may yet accomplish for them this territorial reform, in addition to
                  the moral one of which he has been the honored author.
               But we must return from this digression to the more immediate object of our tale,
                  and take leave of the reader with one word more, which shall be this: Surely it
                  was a great blessing, on the occasion forming the subject of this tract, to the
                  people below, that there was a man among them who could lead them to God, and
                  preserve them from that recklessness or despondency, either of which would have
                  been their destruction! Surely to himself and to his comrades it was a blessing
                  indeed, that this man's memory had been stored with Scriptures, becoming to them,
                  in the hour of trial, a light shining in a dark placeâ€”a lamp to their feet, and a
                  light to their paths! Let others, then, be induced, and especially the young, to
                  follow his example; and while sight and light are given, "while the sun, or the
                  light, or the moon, or the stars be not
                  darkened," to store their minds richly with the Word of God. It may not be the lot
                  of many, like these poor people, to be buried alive in the depths of the earth.
                  But it may be the lot of all, and it will be the lot of most, to be stretched on
                  beds of sickness, and to meet "the day when the keepers of the house shall
                  tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because
                  they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened;" and there are
                  none, save the Lord's people at His coming, whose lot it shall not be to "stumble
                  upon the dark mountains," and to "walk through the valley of the shadow of death."
                  Then will the preciousness be felt of a plentiful provision of Scripture promises;
                  enabling the sufferer, under the guidance of the Spirit of God, "to lift up the
                  hands which hand down, and the feeble knees, and make straight paths for the
                  feet;" bringing "the blind by a way that they know not," "and in paths that they
                  have not known;" making "darkness light before them, and crooked things straight;"
                  and causing them, though blind and in darkness, to "to look for a city which hath
                  foundations, whose builder and maker is God," which hath "no need of the sun,
                  neither of the moon, to shine in it; for the glory of God doth lighten it, and the
                  Lamb is the light thereof;" and where "they shall hunger no more, neither thirst
                  any more, neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat," but they shall
                  ceaselessly say, with 
                     a a
                     a
                   loud voice, "Worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power, and
                  riches, and wisdom, and strength, and glory, and blessing." "Blessing, and honor,
                  and glory, and power unto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb
                  forever and ever."
               How truly, to all such, shall the Scriptures, in these trying hours, prove
                  themselves indeed to be a 
                     Light in Darkness.
                  
               
               THE END.
