            PREFACE.
            REMEMBERING in what manner my own young mind was lured to a taste for History—by the enticing garniture of historic romance—and with what eagerness I was led to search for facts, in order to trace a thread or two, of the real, in some darling, gorgeously enwrought fiction, until I became more enamored of the sober face of Truth than of Fancy's painted countenance,—I have prepared these pages, hoping, in like manner, to ensnare other youthful devotees of light literature.
            Regarding Ancient History as a tolerable pattern for guess-work only,—since historians, in the olden time, were, as now, subject to bribe, political bias, personal enmity and favoritism,—there is a wide  margin for fictionists to build upon; especially as  modern compilers, out of so many puzzling contrarieties, know not which to choose as authentic. I have, therefore, seized upon certain doubts and uncertainties  regarding Bernice, and have assumed that there were three, of that name, flourishing in the same era, whose several actions, being ascribed to one, have  ensoiled the name and fame of that Bernice, who, with her brother Agrippa heard Paul's defence before Festus. I have endeavored in these pages, to remove the odium from her characters.
            The project of making the notorious mother of  Nero, eventually, a Christian, needs no apology, since I interfere with no recorded truth—having invested her with an existence, after the historian and the world were done with her, and represented her, crushed into despair and repentance, by ill-sped crimes, until at last, her hands, deeply incarnadine, find "rain enough in the sweet heavens to wash them white as snow."
            These hints are scarcely needed by the thorough reader, as the body of the work contains its own explanation; but they may assist the judgment of those who go through a book with hop, skip, and jump, in utter defeat of the author's object, and frequently to his detriment.
            Here, I cast this first sheaf of my binding into the great heap, hoping it may, alike, escape ill-natured criticism, bigotry's sage rebuke, and the mock-wise censure of primped-lip presumption.

               CHAPTER I.
               THE VOW.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Lift, lift, enduring gates!
                           Or, since no drawbridge spans the moat,
                           To usher back the unreturning Past—
                           Let, through your everlasting bars, the light
                           Upon yon dim abyss—where lie
                           The deeds of other years."
                        
                     
                     —A. M. B.
                  
               
               THE charioteer of King Agrippa would have turned his horses to go into the upper city, but the young Bernice,  who sat by her father in the chariot, sprang up, and seizing the silken reins, suddenly turned the foremost horses square from the way. The charioteer made some show of remonstrance, when the little maiden twisted her fingers into his beard in a threatening manner; so he laughed, and addressed himself to do her bidding.
               "I desire to see the butterflies around the pools of the valley. Now betake thyself thither!" And the wilful little Miss reseated herself for a continuation of her jaunt, thinking it wholly unnecessary to consult her father's wishes in the matter. He only smiled at the imperious ways of his daughter, and called her his King Herod—his true scion of the Asmoneans.
               As the chariot moved slowly along by the beautiful  gardens that made the valley rich with bloom and fragrance, Agrippa was athirst, and called to one of the outriders to bring him a draught from the pool; but Bernice, who had taken a fancy to the looks of a young lad in traveller's garb, watering his horse near by, would not permit the servant to dismount, but bade him tell the young stranger to fill the silver cup she saw banging at his girdle, and bring it to her father.
               The boy looked up at the call, and shook back the long ringlets from his shoulders; for he had laid bare his heated brow to lave it in the coolness of the perfumed air and clear water. He advanced, with his dark looks still uncovered,  which causing some fancy in Agrippa, he addressed him as Ganymede; to which the boy answered,—
               "Thou hast mistaken my office, O King. Ganymede bore nectar to the gods—I do but serve a mortal, being only a tent-maker's son, and thou but a man."
               Now it was well known that Kings Agrippa delighted to be called a god, and the by-standers and the guard looked to see the bold and haughty-looking boy stricken to earth. But the king, whose changing countenance denoted only surprise, ripped at rich jewel from his vesture and dropped it into the cup as he returned it, saying,—
               "Let this reward thy truth; but for the favor of thy  draught what shall bestow?" Seeing the boy's eyes fastened upon Bernice with looks of astonished admiration, he  laughingly concluded,—"Ah, what sayest thou to my little princess? Thou mayest have her for a wife some day—when thou art great enough; for I foresee that only such a haughty spirit as thine can match her own, and bend her tough will. Say! is it a bargain?"
               The boy was blushing, and his eagle eye beat modestly to the ground long before the king had concluded his  flippant address; but urged by the last direct question, he looked up firmly and said,—
               "O King, were I so bold to jest, I might say, yea, and compact to claim thy promise, when I become as great as thou art; and, so incentived—such things have been—I  may wrest my fortunes to something even greater than thine! I will keep this jewel in aid of the remembrance that a king jested with a tent-maker's son."
               Bernice had turned away abashed, to watch the butterflies come and go. Seeing the charioteer's whip lying idle, she seized it, and twirling it about with a sharp report, sent the lash direct into the midst of a cluster of blue and yellow  insects that sucked the moisture beside the curbing of the pool.
               They arose, clouding the air with blue and gold but the horses, startled, whirled, the chariot along, and the boy, only pausing to see the bounding animals controlled  masterly, resumed his turban, mounted his steed, and went, with the rest of the travellers, forth from the city gates; but his heart beat strong with the vow he had put upon his soul,—to make the king's jest real, or consume his  soaring spirit to ashes in the burning beams of his great hope.
               He went his way, whiling himself with dreams that should lead him through crimes, disaster, and death.
               It was high noon in Cæsarea, three years from the time when the tentmaker's son stood by the pools of Jerusalem. The city was astir with tumult. King Agrippa was dead; and the populace, forgetting his kindness, ran wild, and strove to offer indignities to his still unsepulchred remains.
               Their friends, fearing some mischanace, attempted to  convey the young daughters of their king privately out of the city. They were, therefore, placed in common, covered sedans, and sent separately by private ways, as though they were statues intended to adorn the stalls of those who sold merchandise without the gates.
               
               Bernice, aged sixteen, could not control her grief, and her moaning attracted the passes until one, too suspecting, tore aside the curtains and recognized the daughter of Agrippa.
               She was seized and dragged from the vehicle amid jeers, coarse laughter, and obscene abuse. The poor girl became insensible, and did not know when a stout hand laid her insulter dead on the earth; and a strong arm clasping her, fought a way through the rabble to the guard of a caravan that had just entered the city.
               Bernice opened her eyes in a common hostelry of the merchants' quarter. The din and uproar of business alarmed her, and she was about to spring from her couch, when she become conscious of being in a very singular apartment. A small furnace had heated the room uncomfortably,  although the fuel was spent to ashes. Numerous  pots, crucibles, and other vessels of curious make, stood about the room; in the centre of which, a large table  contained maps whereon were drawn figures of strange shape, and just before her, banging on the wall, was a long black gown covered with flame-colored devices.
               Her large black eyes roamed from one object to another until they rested on a pile of bones in one corner—human, certainly! Two skulls glared from the midst, and she felt that she must die with fright, when an old man entered from a door behind the couch and accosted her.
               "Daughter, be of good cheer! we are those who respect thy griefs, and will convey thee to thy friends."
               The face of the old man was of such marble whiteness, and his deep-set eyes so extremely black, that Bernice feared him, although his words were kind, and she could scarcely falter out,—
               "Good father, where am I, and how shall I get to my friends?"
               He was about to reply, when a young man and middle aged matron appeared at the door, and Bernice recognized the tent-maker's son, though his form was expanded, and taller by a head than her own brother Agrippa.
               He did not turn his eyes upon her, but simply said, as he advanced a few steps into the room,—
               "We are ready!"
               The old man and the matron raised her from the  pillows, and bore her between them into a narrow passage, to which the young man had preceded them, and was ready to assist in lifting her up a flight of steps leading to the house-top; where she was placed under an awning upon cushions.
               The cool evening wind revived her; and when the old man and the woman had gone below, and the young stranger approached, she was able to raise herself and look upon him.
               "Dost thou remember me?" he said, dropping on one knee and pressing the hem of her robe to his lips.
               "Thou hast said—I do!" and with the memory of the past bursting over her, she wept and moaned, but could utter nothing more.
               "I desired to know if thou hadst remembered, in that, the good people of this house know not the quality of their guest, and should they suspect, may not be true to thee; therefore have I arranged that my uncle shall take thee on his way into Samaria, whither he goeth to-morrow. I desired to know if thou hadst remembered, in that, I would have thy heart at rest, and doubting not, one who has vowed to serve thee—as thou knowest, by the token I sent thee when thy father was about to give thee in marriage to thine Uncle Herod!"
               "I did, of a surety, receive a message and the token thou hadst of my father, which meant no more, than that thou wouldst serve me with thy life; and I wept, that so bold a hand could not save me, and thy true heart beat not under kingly robes; I wept, until my matron chid me, while she decked me for the bridal."
               "Then—then thy heart was not in the gift! thy hand went alone?"
               "Oh, I think I had no heart; I had wept it away when they told me I must wed Mark, the son of Alexander!"
               "Mark died!" said he, with singular emphasis and  sinister look, which Bernice did not seem to observe, when she answered,—
               "Yea, Mark died; but I was too quickly espoused again; and then I wished that Mark had lived. He, at least, was not mine uncle!"
               "Herod may die!" again suggested the youth, with a hard, impassible countenance.
               Bernice sighed and replied despairingly,—
               "They would have me wed again!"
               "But thou wouldst then be thine own mistress, and might choose a spouse!" and the young man's flashing eyes probed hers in quest of an answer to his thought, rather than his question.
               "Ah, I dare not dream that I might!" and Bernice dropped her face in her hands, weeping. The man again bowed himself, gathered her robe to his lips, and arose to his feet, saying,—
               "Now must I leave thee! See, the sun is low upon the waves!" and the parting sunbeams burned like a glory upon his form and face—fairest of the sons of men.  Folding his arms across his bosom and looking down into the now upraised and glowing face of Bernice—the questioning,  anxious face upraised in the light of the closing day—he said in a voice deeply entoned with suppressed feeling:
               "Thy sisters are safe, and wait for thee. At dawn I will bid thee God-speed. But rest thy heart that thou shalt be guarded; and should danger assail thee, I will be near for thy defence. Whenever thou goest—in the time, when most thou needest me—I will be there for thine aid and protection. My star-mother will not watch so constantly  over her earth-child as I will thee. I would have thee remember,—wilt thou?"
               Bernice stretched her clasped hands toward him as she said appealingly,—
               "Who art thou? and why have I found favor with thee? This three times only have I seen thee, and yet—yet—oh, wilt thou come again?" and Bernice concluded her sentence with a sigh and a blush, without following up her significant yet.
               As if reading the uncovered thoughts that lay upon her expressive face, the great peace that fell upon his heart glowed softly in his eyes as he answered,—
               "Fear not; we will meet again. Have I not told thee?—remember!"
               He stooped, touched his lips to the fair hands extended, still clasped, toward him, turned, and was gone.
               Three years from that time, Herodes, King of Chalcis, lay dead in his pillared halls, and those who shrouded him took no pains to discover two small needle-like  punctures, above his heart. He had died while slumber lay upon him, in the darkness of night.
               The guards about him confessed that they had slept heavily, and had heard no sound of struggle within the dead man's chamber.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER II.
               THE MISSING PRINCESS.
               
                  
                     
                        "She had a mind
                        Deep and immortal; and it would not
                        Feed on pageantry."
                     
                  
               
               A. D. 51. Polemon, King of Pontus and Cilicia, stood at the prow of a Grecian galley, in a most inordinate fury of grief and rage. He cursed the tardiness of the rowers, though the galley spun out a line of light, as the white foam curled about and over her, leaving far in her wake the sharp, whistling concussion with which she ripped open the waters before her.
               His face was wrung with the agony of passion. His eyes protruding, and red with the flames projected from his fiery heart, while they were strained over the sea, toward the north-west, where the Euxine pillowed the heavens, watching a far-receding sail—a mere dot on the blue tapestry of the horizon walls.
               Polemon had but some twelve months before put away his wife—a lady whose pure Grecian beauty had charmed  him, until he met the gorgeous widow of Herodes—Bernice, sister of Agrippa; and now that lessening sail was filled with wind blowing toward the Propontus, bound for the Syrian shore, where Agrippa would receive his sister again to the restored kingdom of their great-grandsire Herod.
               Polemon calculated too widely when he sent the young children of Bernice back to their father's kindred, ere a twelvemonth had made their mother familiar with her new ties—as queen of Pontus.
               Even had the Jewish beauty loved him—as she might have loved some spirit nearer akin to her own—the first indignant spasm that aroused her motherhood would have sent that love forever from her heart.
               Her spirit was rebel to the lightest touch that had the seeming of oppression. Her ear startled at its faintest breathing. What wonder, then, that when its presence was first announced by that fierce clutch upon her heart-fibres, her fiery and outraged spirit sprung to instant action,  inflated with determined resentment—if, indeed, her  emotions did not amount to something fiercer and more  insatiable.
               She had not known of the children's embarkation until the sea from Polemonium to the extreme horizon lay  between them.
               She had been made to feel that her strong love for her boys had an adder's sting for Polemon, simply that they were Herod's children, not his own.
               Bernice veiled the anger of her eye—modulated her voice to indifferent tones, while she matured her plans coolly, perfectly.
               A merchant's ship, that had some months before left the port, was one evening seen lying in the offing. When morning broke through the mists that hung upon the Euxine, Polemon found his wife's indignant adieu lying on the cushion of his throne.
               The sun's reflected arrows darted painfully to his brain from the spread canvas of that same merchantman moving  gracefully, and standing off and on coquettishly, as if inviting pursuit, proud of her out-bound freight.
               Polemon had galleys, Grecian and Roman, swift as the petrel's flight. A dozen were manned, and sprang to the race right eagerly.
               The saucy ship kept almost within hail of the voice for some time; then, as if tired of such insolent child's-play, tacked, and went off like an arrow.
               Polemon, still infuriate, but feeling his impotency, gave the word, and the pursuit was given over.
               As the unwilling galleys drifted back from the chase, threats of invasion, vengeance, and death to the world at large, rung over the sea from where the King sat with his prime confederate, Ahala.
               A renunciation of Judaism, which Polemon had  embraced with Bernice, with many oaths to the gods, and promises of new temples and renewed sacrifices, in some measure quieted the paroxysms of Polemon.
               He returned to his palace, and called for his child—the child of his repudiated wife, torn from its mother's love when that mother's place was filled by another. He went to his child's room hurriedly.
               The little couch was empty—its kermes covering was smooth and unruffled, the heavy fringe of twisted crimson and gold hung evenly to the floor. The curtains were drawn in studied folds from the silver mirrored canopy to the four massive posts of ebony, inlaid with pearl and gold. The white silk pillows, their borders delicately wrought with silk of various hues, lay in their places unpressed.
               He turned to the walls—the crimson hangings were  unstirred between the purple porphyry pillars that supported them. He threw back the curtains from the window, and flung wide the casement that looked toward the east, hoping the light would relieve the distracting stillness of the room. The mid-morning sun streamed in, and the swift breeze that swept through the casement caught and dallied with a loosely coiled scroll that lay on a small ebony table, inlaid to match the bedstead. The table was in the centre of the room, beneath a large lamp that swung from the ceiling from a centre representing the sun, whose rays were gathered ered in golden bunches to meet the springing arches of the porphyry pillars. Polemon caught the scroll from the light fingers of the wind ere it fell to the floor.
               It was the writing of divorcement he had given his Grecian wife. The first words appearing on the otherwise blank reverse were these—"Ask of the sea," and beneath was the name of that wife in her own characters, unsteadily written, as if the soul quivered with its despair while her trembling fingers affixed the seal of separation from earthly ties. "Ask of the sea,"—from these words, united with other circumstances of the morning, Polemon gathered too surely that there was something yet more terrible to learn. Had his forsaken wife cast herself into the sea? Had she written suicide against her name in the book of judgment?
               She had never wilfully given pain to even an insect, and from what now was born the spirit that could wrest from the gods their office? Polemon's conscience answered him, and her wrongs sent Nemesis, with all her terrors, to his affrighted soul when conviction gathered his heart's quivering fibres into certainty, that the mother had drowned herself, and perhaps the child; that the return of the  parchment scroll was a prelude to that last act that in Christian minds would seal the door of mercy to a lost soul.
               Let no one presume to decide as to the judgments of God. All are not born to that high mental heritage that teaches how "to suffer and be strong," to that pride of soul that rises self-poised, and looks down from its elevation on the poor things that aim to torture it. Condemn her not.
               Polemon's wife had been sent to Greece, with a broken spirit, but a true, pure womanhood unstained of the soil which was sought to be put upon her when Polemon found it in his heart to bring another to his throne—another, more brilliant, but less good, perhaps. That other would probably have been crushed in turn had she not been of a race more used to subdue than to be subdued.
               
               In his new agony, awakened by the non-appearance of his little daughter, Polemon called loudly for his Minister of State, and sank prone on the mosaic floor of his child's chamber, with his rich purple robes crushed beneath him, and his hands pressing on the jewelled tiara of his head, as though he would crush the gems into his brain.
               When Ahala entered, he arose to a sitting posture, and, with his face buried on his knees, said,—
               "Ahala, read me the bleared page which the fingers of the morning have turned in the book of fate. My brain is warped with these riddles that twist into my soul, yet find no solution."
               "Gracious King, think not Ahala has been laggard in your service this terrible day,—may the gods deny such another!
               "This morning, when the fishers, that bring fresh spoils for the palace-tables, were spreading nets to dry on the low shrubs by the water's brink, they picked up the plumed turban of our young princess—the same you were pleased to see her wear but yesterday. Lower down, where seaweed  slimes the beach-turf, on a low tongue of land, were prints of small sandalled feet, dotted beside others whose impress bears, the proportions of your sometime queen. Lying near was the wrought mantle I sent you at dawn."
               "Ah, my poor queen's, you said; and she has been here—returned—are you sure of that, Ahala?"
               "I know the mantle well; besides, conjecture was spur to inquiry, and the tale it wound from gossip's tongues is this—this— Art listening, sire?" said Ahala, pausing; for his master seemed busier with his own thoughts than his minister's story.
               "Go on! go on! I hear! Your words are like lead, and weigh my spirit down—but go on," replied Polemon, shuddering. Ahala resumed, slowly, and with the  precision of one who weighs his words.
               "Late, one came to solicit a tirewoman's place to the young princess. Gossips aver that she was none other than your child's own mother, come to steal the sweetness of her daughter's presence at a risk.
               "On last night, we may suppose, she, with the child, passed the sentries in Queen Bernice's train, when she and her women went forth to the synagogue from which they did not return to the palace, but, accompanied by the Jewish knaves of the Queen's guard, took their way toward the pier, by bribes of money, or love,—which is stronger,—for nothing else could have opened the gates at that hour—they went forth, where boats awaited them commanded by—by—"
               "By whom, Ahala? Why should you stammer—pull up—before a name as though that name were a climax to the day's dark ills? Speak it, though it have power to shake the walls of Polemonium! Who commanded them?"
               "Gracious King, I know not; but the name he wears in Polemonium is—Cornelius Celsus."
               The fat minister's round eyes grew rounder and more protruding when he saw the effect produced on his master by the utterance of that name, though his hesitation in the first place evinced incontestably that he expected no  ordinary effect from his announcement.
               Polemon's face was lifted to his minister for a moment, then grew ghastly, and sunk into his clenched hands, whose finger-tips the blood had left as well—summoned to the heart by the hurried telegram of that name.
               Ahala left his master there, and went out of the palace, and forth from the in-walled city, to see how the search sped; for he had given orders for the waters to be dragged as far as the depth would permit. But nothing had answered  the search—nothing more that the soiled hat, the dinted earth, and the gray mantle that was recognized, with tears and signs, by those who had known and loved the gentle Queen of Pontus.
               After many days of unavailing search, during which Polemon had mourned as became him, Despair laid her cold palm on the sickened heart of Hope, and it beat no more.
               Then the King arose, unfolded the sackcloth from his fine limbs, shook the ashes from his brow and his fair locks, and went in to his perfumed bath.
               Polemon was young—handsome as the sweet lyrist—twin-born with the silver-footed queen of night. He had often contemplated his brown and curled locks in the silver mirrors around him, while thoughts of that god fed his vanity.
               When the first paroxysm of grief and the first rage of wounded vanity had subsided, he enrolled the desertion of Bernice with "women's silly freaks," doubting nothing that some concessions would win her to himself again. He therefore turned his thoughts to Jerusalem, whither Bernice's indignant note had said she would go.
               His messenger was met at Berytas by Agrippa with such manifestations of displeasure, that all negotiations ceased at once, and Polemon appeared before his people bowed and miserable.
               He, however, in impotent malice, caused the names of Bernice and Celsus to be linked with dishonor.
               Cornelius Celsus was a name entirely unknown at  Jerusalem, and in Polemonium one that had only a summer fame to the many, while the few spoke it in undertones and with sidelong glances that meant more than was said.
               He had come as the master of a merchant-ship, but left the disposal of his wares and commodities to various  members of his crew, whom no one could entice to intimacy. They sold their stuffs as if under a vow at variance with all sociality. Even in those days the Sicarii, a secret  organization of doubtful character, had appeared throughout the Roman provinces, and there were those who did not hesitate to talk of it in connection with the merchant's crew.
               Cornelius Celsus, in an interview with Polemon,  professing himself acquainted with alchemistic lore, was invited to the laboratory of Bernice, to which at length he learned to resort more frequently and unceremoniously than suited the coarse judgment of sensual, Polemon, who was weak as well as impure, therefore jealous, and particularly so of all whom Bernice deigned to notice with anything like marked regard.
               Had his vanity been less dominant, jealousy would have hurried him into many a rash act, but his good guardian anointed his self-love with such soothing saporifics that complacent politeness took the place of his contemplated thunder-bursts, and he would sit near and watch the  absorbing interest with which Bernice and the stranger  discoursed of higher things than his own mind could  compass. Yet he contemplated uneasily the majesty of the man whose broad brow intellect had polished and veined—in whose eye was tracked the serpent's craft, mingled with the power that knowledge enforces.
               Such a man as Polemon might as well have thought to bring down the galaxy of heaven to make mosaic for his palace-floors with its bright patines, as expect Bernice—the haughty, the cold, the beautiful—to turn from her pursuits to love him—the gay court-reveller.
               The alembic's rim had more for her than the coronet he gave. The small laboratory where she chased the secrets of the alchemist until they were no secrets to her, was wider than the Roman world. The faintest clue to hidden Truth would set ablaze the eye that never lit to adulation's tongue, and yet—she wedded whom her kindred chose, and gave herself a slave to Policy—or—its victim.
               The name of Celsus, uttered that ill-starred morning by Ahala, had suddenly aroused dormant memories that sent sharp arrows to Polemon's heart, like icy ministers of death; but he rallied, still hoping, until the returns from Agrippa gave him nothing to hope. Then he dedicated his life to find the man Celsus—and to vengeance. But weak of mind he was weak of purpose, and the years went by with no tidings of the strange ship that had, after  landing Bernice at Joppa, put out to sea, appearing no more in any port of Pontus or Syria.
               Works on Philosophy and Medicine having appeared from time to time in the Alexandrian Library under the  patronage of Mark the alabarch, claiming Cornelius Celsus as author, Polemon could only learn that the name was fictitious,  that the works in style and doctrine resembled one on Gnostics by Simon Magus, the aged astrologer,  apostate, and heretic.
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               THE TWO SONS.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "A sound is abroad, like the creep sullen roar
                           That tokens the earthquake's unrest;
                           Or the moan of old Ocean lashing the shore,
                           When storm-fiends are goading his breast."
                        
                     
                     —A. M. B.
                  
               
               A. D. 62. In the province of Lucania, where a spur of the Apennines ranges low along the western shore of the Tuscan Sea, was situated a small Roman farm.
               The dwelling was rudely constructed even for those days, such as pertained to the middle classes,—of rough stone bearing but few marks of the hammer, matted with moss, and the ivy of years trailing over its tiled roof.
               It, however, had an air of supreme comfort. Enwrapped in garden and vineyard, where the mountain, opening its arms, bent down to the sea and gathered the fertile valley in loving embrace, the villa's western range of windows looked out on the sea.
               This place was the temporary abode of one of Rome's bravest generals and wisest statesmen. There he left his family secure from the turmoils of Nero's reign, while he prosecuted the tyrant's wars in Britain.
               There the matron Domitia tutored her two sons in the stern lessons of Roman virtue, and there her little daughter  grew up beside her brothers to love their manly sports more than she did the graces of maidenly pursuits.
               Every facility was placed within reach of these  children, which surrounded even the wealthiest patricians, though themselves of plebeian origin, and as yet but  moderate fortune.
               
               The elder son was familiar with every branch of literature  known at that day, and taught in the Elean School of Philosophers. He had sat at the feet of Seneca, and drank philosophy until he was imbued with the pure  principles of his Mentor. The two younger children had as yet shown no very decided points of character, except a tendency to cruelty, which seemed to characterize the younger boy.
               The sun was setting on the scene that opens this chapter.
               Titus, with his mother, sat idling on the highest step at the west end of the long colonnade running in front of the house, and facing the south.
               A brisk south-westerly played with the threads of his dark hair, and lifted it in waves back from his high  student brow. The lightning of free thoughts, and a bold spirit, burst through the moist tenderness that usually  characterized the expression of his exceedingly black eye. He spoke of his father, of himself, and the longing in his bosom to be up and doing; and the near perspective wherein he hoped to match his sword with the bravest, and bandy argument with the wisest.
               His mother turned upon him a misty but proud look. He filled the measure of her highest hope. Noble, generous,  true to every principle of honor, brilliant as a night-born  meteor, but loving, tender as a cooing dove, she worshipped  him, though never unmindful of "the voice once heard in Rama," for he was her first-born.
               The day had been still, sultry,—not a breath had stirred the thick forests on the east. The sun had hung like a ball of fire in the murky heavens, and was then going down to a couch, draperied in sables, behind a troubled sea.
               Sea-mews screamed among the cliffs. A moan came up from the ocean hoarse and awful.
               A mighty mingling of shrieks, groans, and wailing, as it might have been from the lost battle-fields of Lucifer's  aspiring hosts, swelled from the amphitheatre of wooded steeps that embraced the valley.
               The road from Elea was seen winding the high shore, now seen, now lost, behind some intervening wood, then  sweeping boldly around the domain between it and the sea, it curved back along a little bay that ran inland some dozen stadii, then bore northward toward Rome, the great heart that fed the arteries of the then known world.
               This little bay, girdled with high cliffs, gave the  premises somewhat the appearance of a promontory when seen from a northern approach by water.
               In the south side of the cleft, where the bay and sea made a sharp angle, was a cave partly natural, partly by the handicraft of man. Above this cave arose a tower of rocks and earth much higher than the surrounding shores.
               In the cave reclused an old Christian hermit, driven from persecution at home to persecution little less galling abroad; but the peculiar events connected with his exile have nothing to do with this story as yet. He was a firm believer in Providence, and waited in his exile for the work his Master had for him to do, believing that it would be given him.
               It was his fancy to keep a beacon burning on the tower every stormy night. His bent form, bearing his burden of fagots to the rock, was the first indication that aroused Titus and his mother to the realization of a coming  tempest. So absorbed were they in their own emotions, they had not noticed the change that had come over sky and sea within the hour. But now they were fully conscious of the night's promise, and went in to make all secure, pitying the fagot-bearer for his seemingly unprofitable labors.
               
               Some hours after, the indwellers of that Lucanian home were gathered in an ample hall, with ready fuel piled upon the ample hearth; for "the month was the month" of  September, "that month of all months in the year" for  summery days and wintry nights.
               The hall was longer than its width. One entire side was taken up with curtained doorways, leading to the  different bed-chambers, opposite to which a range of windows looked seaward.
               The walls were covered with coarse tapestry, of hues so mingled that the mythic scenes intended to be represented were not recognizable. Around the room were ranged chairs, and couches for sitting or reclining.
               The barred door leading from the front portico was  curtained with heavy green worsted, as were the doorways to the other apartments.
               The walls were ornamented, and somewhat disfigured by pendent shelves, containing coils of manuscripts, relics of the chase, mingled with the sterner accoutrements of war.
               A David's harp and a lady's harpsichord stood in one corner. An embroidery-frame leaned against a couch, of more luxurious finish than the rest, which was drawn to a table beneath a lamp pendent from a beam of the ceiling.
               On the couch reclined the matron Domitia, a fair type of a Roman mother. She was yet young enough to be fresh, and proud, and stately. Her eyes were ever changing  their hue, as thought deepened to intensity, or relaxed to vivacity and mirth, so that you never could determine their color.
               She had had trials in her earlier days that left her a heart teeming with kindness for all, and contempt for most; for we yet can feel sympathy and good will for those who incur our contempt by their folly and weakness.
               Domitia had enveloped her head and shoulders in a gray stole, from which a tress or two of lively brown hair escaped upon her face, as she lay partly listening to the gathering storm, as she looked upon her elder son, sitting on the same couch, at her feet and near the lamp, reading from a Greek manuscript. She, shading her eyes with a still fair and shapely hand, gazed upon her boy, pouring out her heart in libation to his wonderful beauty. Her love was so "like a madness," 
                     
                        "She would have shut the flowers, and called the stars
                        Back to the mountain-tops, and bid the sun
                        Pause at Eve's golden gates to wait for him."
                     
                  
               
               Titus had been that day to a festival, and was still  arrayed in gala-dress. He wore a short tunic of deep blue silk, descending midway to the knees, and bordered with yellow fringe of twisted silk and gilt. His legs and arms were encased in fine skins, delicately tinted with yellow, and fastened up the sides with buttons of a steely lustre. His shoes were of the buskin order, dark purple, with twisted gilt lacings.
               Across his shoulders was a narrow scarf of red silk, knotted under his left arm at the waist.
               The younger boy was sitting on a low stool near the elder, fitting a plume to his cap, or playing with a gladius taken from his brother's sword-belt, that lay on the floor beside him. He wore simply a loose brown and blue shirt, bordered with red fringe, reaching below the knees, and tied about the waist with cord and tassel. He patted his naked foot on the rough reed carpeting with which the floor was covered, and sometimes, in despite of his mother's remonstrance, manifested his sense of the storm's increasing  violence by a shrill whistle, and a toss of his plumed cap toward the ceiling, that extended into the concavity of the slightly sloping roof.
               
               The mother's eye had not the same look of peace in it when she turned toward her younger boy. A mother's love was there, but it savored of disquiet—of unrest born of knowledge that is painful.
               The daughter, Ida Domitia, was "making believe" at her mother's embroidery-frame that leaned against the couch. Her dress differed nothing from her younger brother's, except that it was longer, and of rose-colored woollen. Her dark hair was tied up in a silken cap, that rested on her neck-more to preserve it from tangles than as a fashion, or thing of beauty.
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               THE DEATH OF THE FAWN.
               
                  
                     "Oh Pilot, 'tis a fearful night!"
                  
               
               THE tempest was at its highest revelry. The beacon on the tower burned steadily, shooting a red stream into the pouring clouds. The occupants of the comfortable apartment in the Roman villa had for a time watched the lone hermit moving in the light, piling his fagots beside a shelving rock,—his lonely occupation eliciting  commiseration from the mother and elder boy, and heartless jests from the younger; then the zealous watcher was forgotten, and the voice of the reader went on until the uproar without  culminated to so horrible a din, that the reader paused, and turned his face to his mother. She, although her thoughts had been concentrated on the reader, instead of the subject-matter of the reading, arose and seated herself beside him, her hand upon his shoulder, and her brow bent down upon it also. Then she bade him read on, and his glorious beauty no longer in the line of her vision, her  attention was arrested by the new doctrines she had not dared to allow herself to think of, as among the things worthy of thought. But now she was enchained—enchanted. New thoughts glided into her mind. New  emotions overcame her. New fountains sprung in a heart  already overgushing with streams that had no impurity, though she was a heathen, and knew not even the Hebrew's God. Answers came to her darkened mind's long questioning.  So the storm raged, abated, died unheeded.
               The manuscript was one of the "gospels," obtained from Simon of the cavern,—the work His Master had for him to do was begun.
               
               The second watch of the night had set in when the party was startled by a bound against the casement, and a fawn, trembling with fright, was seen crouched on the wide sill. Titus opening the window, the little animal sprang in, manifesting its sense of security by numerous capers about the room. It was evidently a pet. Around its neck was a narrow golden band intertwined with blue ribbon, now soiled and wet.
               In its exuberance of joy bounding from one to another, the little creature sprang with its forepaws on the knees of the young boy. Before any hindrance could be interposed, he struck his dagger deep into the beautiful throat, with an exclamation of fierce anger.
               Domitia uttered a cry of horror, and as the innocent animal fell back, she caught it on her arms, undid its  collar, and as the blood flowed over her dress, she laid it down  and did what she could to relieve it, until it stretched its limbs, quivered, and its little heart batted its last in view of its cruel murderer.
               "The boy was father to the man." In after-years the same cruel spirit battened on human gore—guzzled to satiety the best blood of the Roman commonwealth—cut into its arteries remorselessly as he had slain the fawn.
               Titus took up the lifeless form tenderly, bore it out, and laid it on the stone flags of the portico; then returning, chided his brother bitterly, and sent him to bed in an inner room.
               The scroll of MS. still lay unfolded at the "Sermon on the Mount." Domitia had resumed her seat, but her brow was corded, and her fine eyes were full of sorrow. She knew the intemperate blood of the Domitii flamed in the veins of her boy.
               Titus fingered with his MS. in an abstracted manner, as if he too were feeding on wormwood thoughts, when the voice of Simon was heard above the wind soughing among the tree-tops, calling for Titus.
               He soon appeared at the back entrance with a torch, saying that a small boat was nearing the shore, and would be in among the rocks unless help could be obtained at once.
               Titus called up the servant and was soon on the narrow beach below the cavern, with ropes and what else might be needed.
               Old Simon embraced the surf like a sea-dog. There was no evidence of age in the firm strokes with which he met the waves.
               Titus lingered but to wind a boat-hook and cable about him, when he too showed himself master of that mad sea. It was the aim to reach the boat in time to turn it into the one safe channel.
               The boat was seen rolling its dark body in the surf like some sea-animal taking its pastime; but Titus and Simon were soon nowhere to be seen in the light which the beacon poured on the lashed waters.
               The mother was there, standing with those who had gone higher up on the cliff. Moments became ages to her, when one dark speck, riding a wave crest, was seen for a moment, then lost again. After a while it was observed nearing the boat—it was alongside—it was in—but who? which of those two had found comparative safety? The waves of the sea could not have full force in that quarter; for an underground island not far from the shore broke the force of old ocean's strokes; yet was it a mad, raging sea where the little boat was trying its cause for life or death.
               The boat, as if moved by some new impulse, turned  northward, then ranged out into the gloom of distance and night.
               The beacon was renewed again and again by order of Domitia. A blood-red banner floated up and hung on the low clouds in crimson folds.
               
               Nature's convulsions had exhausted her. She lay on the lap of night, nerveless and sobbing.
               Ocean, still muttering and moaning hoarsely, seemed crouching to rest; the froth of his terrible anger lay in hillocks of foam upon his bosom, and was piled like  snow-drifts on beach and cliff.
               A mother's love can outwatch all things save the Eternal Eye, whose type is that pale star of the north that never goes down to rest its weariness in ocean's gem-lit caverns—never yields its place beside the slumbering earth, but on a cold, white throne, keeps a lonely, cheerless vigil that never ends.
               Domitia felt that her Jove was strong enough to gird her child with invisible protection, even when he was afar from her, so much faith had she in that holy thing—a mother's love, that was wrested from the habitants of heaven, and  borne by pitying mercy to earth's children, that they might have something to call "the pure, the undefiled."
               Domitia knew at what point the boat would be seen, if ever, and upon that, the northern entrance of the bay, she kept her eye fixed.
               At last an hour's watching enabled her to descry an object moving in the surf. Nearer and larger it grew, until the outline of a boat was defined clearly.
               On it came, curving into the little bay, and making, midway between the shores, for the low, sandy beach that headed the inlet. It was near half a mile away.
               A loud and prolonged cheer arose from the men on shore. It echoed among the cliffs, and died away in the hills. A faint answer came across from the boat, in tones strange and new, but repeated again and again.
               This did not satisfy those on shore. Titus had been with them often in the chase, and they would know his faintest halloo; but they recognized nothing familiar in the hoarse tones that came over the water.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               THE PRISONER.
               
                  
                     
                        "Did'st note the prisoner on yonder ship?"
                        "I did. He came to shore with us;—what of him?"
                     
                  
               
               SILENCE trailed her shadowy skirts through chamber and hall of Valley Villa. The pendent lamp was almost extinguished for want of fuel; yet by its fitful glaring a tall form, wrapped from head to foot in a long, dark stole, might have been seen to enter the hall from one of the curtained doorways, and glide noiselessly to the chamber appropriated to two females, who had been brought from the boat weak and sick from exposure, and who had been embathed in warm wines, and left to rest, and Nature's sweet Nepenthe. No information relating to themselves or their male companions had been elicited or desired.
               Unquestioning hospitality was esteemed a virtue in those days, and a society had been introduced from Greece having it's peculiar signs and badges, and inculcating as one of its cardinal principles, strict hospitality and safe, conduct to strangers.
               A part of the insignia of the brotherhood—an open hand encircled by an olive-wreath—was cut in bas-relief on the wooden entablature of the front entrance. The man who stood in the faint light of the flickering lamp saw and recognized it by crossing his arms upon his breast; then he turned to the door of the chamber, paused, and listening for a moment, cautiously lifted the curtains, and entered.
               
               Beside one of the two couches of the chamber knelt an aged female; her hair unbound and luxuriant, but whiter than the white stole over which it floated. She knelt—daughter of the Cæsars—raised within the shadow of the Pantheon; she knelt to the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob. Unwonted sight out of Jewry at that day.
               The intruder's step was stealthy, as if fearing to disturb the sleeper on the other couch, upon whom his eyes rested with a look of exquisite tenderness, as she lay there in her child-like fairness, her dark Jewish hair coiling over the white pillow, her black lashes curving in feathery tracery on her pure cheek, her breath fluttering the end of a red silken scarf, scarcely dry, that was crushed in one hand beneath the crimson covering of the couch. What did it there, the damp, crumpled thing, that a few hours before had graced the shoulders of Domitia's elder son?
               The man's light tread gave no sound. The devotee must then have felt his presence, for she arose and turned  toward him. Her mild eyes instantly filled with tender recognition, seemingly not otherwise moved, as she seated herself quietly on the couch, motioning him to a heavy wooden chair beside it.
               "Mother Antonia, I did not expect to see thee out of thy couch; I came to satisfy myself if all were well with thee and that gentle child. She seems to breathe evenly, as if no obstruction hindered nature's free course. Why grudge thyself the same needed rest?"
               "I cannot on this spot. Know you upon what part of the coast we are?"
               "I do not. The night hangs so blackly hereabouts, and our perils have made time go by staggering and uncertain, giving no chance to surmise."
               "Night had no curtain thick enough to bide the outlines of these shores from me. We are near Baiæ."
               "Ah! Is it so? then must thou teach thyself unfamiliar ways even here. This family may be of thy foes.  Poppœa's influence pulsates through all Campagnia."
               "I need but small disguise. My hair was black as  yonder maiden's when the scuttled ship that bore poor me went down along these shores by cruel connivance of my own son. I was saved from the awarded death by a faithful  slave, poor Acenonia, who, forcing her own habiliments upon me, herself clad in my royal apparel, met the fate intended for her mistress. When still I was pursued to my  villa on the Lucrine, my brow was smooth as the Parian statuette in that recess; my step springy as Leviathan's ribs. It was only in that hour, when first I learned how deep a child's ingratitude could cut, that my hair put on this frostiness, and my face seamed, in likeness of the furrows gashed into my bleeding heart. My present self am  sufficient disguise to my former state," said the woman,  shaking her head sadly.
               "Put by these irksome remembrances. I have need of your counsel," said the man, anxious to change the theme.
               "Wherefore? Is there danger, or only difficulty?" she replied, looking into his face with eyes into which the  brilliance of youth suddenly flashed.
               "Both, it may be. Didst thou note the prisoner on  yonder ship?"
               "I did. He came to shore with us. He was of noble port; the shackles that hung heavy on his fine limbs had nothing to do with his free soul—that was abroad, holding converse with the Hebrews' God. I saw thus much;—what of him?"
               "He was on his way to Nero's tombs, whose portals never unclose except to gulp up new victims. I knocked off his trammels."
               "That tale had best remain untold. Nero brooks no meddling. He is jealous of all things connected with the Jews;—that man is a Jew."
               "I know: Of late he was brought before me accused of sedition, and of being a follower of the Nazarene. I had wellnigh staggered under his wondrous eloquence, and  become a convert to the new doctrine. There is no fault in the man, and I loosed him to go where he will. Now, it behooves me to clear myself of wrong intent in the eyes of Nero. He may torture it into an act of rebellion. He knows my people are restive against the curb I hold at his will. He half suspects my loyalty to himself is tottering, ready to yield to the best interests of Judea."
               "Then know the prisoner's whole offence. If it cross not the ruling passion of my—of Nero, let him go free; but if it do, pause even then ere you fetter him again. I will take the blame, and risk the assassin's dagger again, or drink the cup Poppœa may fill. Let the Christian Jew go free."
               "Ah! thinkest thou he will await my questioning? Ere now he has advantaged him of his freedom, and is refused deep in the heart of these hills."
               "From which he will not return," she added, "to peril his preserver. Who, then, can rehearse the story? A thousand fathoms down on the ocean's floor are those who adventured to leave the ship in that other boat. They did not reach the shore."
               "No; afraid of the waves that broke upon them at the first launch, they made back to the creaking, crazy ship—  more willing to trust her timbers than we."
               "Then must we hold our plans suspended until the  morning shows us more of our hosts. They may prove friends. Until we know, even you must wear your royal fillet less conspicuously. I saw the eyes of the gray-haired  steersman fixed upon it as if the gems thereon had a language legible to his old eyes, as you stood fair in the light of the beacon that arose over yon bay like Israel's flame pillar in the wilderness. He had not the covert look that might have stamped, "Sicarii" upon his face. These places are sore infested. You would be a prize not often cast at the very feet of these "Forest-monarchs." You had best put on the seeming of poorness, and wear a peasant's  harness until you can send to Rome for guards. You own retinue, floating leagues away in tangled sea-weed shrouds, or rocked deep down in their ocean cradles, forget the duties of their post."
               "Ah!" said the man, with a deep sigh, "my soul was rudely hacked with cutting woe when I saw them swept from my side, and whelmed in the maddened waters. The sun was just sinking, and I thought he had never set on so wide a ruin. Then came the ship from Melita, and but for thee and the child, I had not cared to leave the sinking wreck, and save me, when so many faithful hearts were cold, stirred by no motion but the rocking billows. It is bootless now to grieve—I must look forward. Our kind host will sure extend his hospitalities to aid whom he has rescued. Our boat could not have twisted through the bay's ugly mouth, snarling with huge rocks like monster's teeth, had it not been for his quiet directions."
               "Indeed, I think our direst extremity was when the strong old man, emerging like Triton from the sea-foam, pushed us from those same rocks, against which the tough oar's bent like withes to his strokes."
               "That was as nothing to the young man's peril, when, striking out into the darkness, he scrambled to the slippery peak of a cone-like rock where the water drove furiously landward, and stood ready to throw his grapnel upon the boat, which he did, drawing us away from the sucking channel by no ordinary exertion of strength. None but the practised eye of the watchful old man saw his headlong plunge, with the rebound of that heavy pull, into the black water, that closed above him, and the boat glided over the place where he went down."
               "I saw nothing of that, nor knew why the old steersman plunged so suddenly, until, with the youth's lifeless form. clutched in his arms, you and Alexis drew both in. How fares he now?"
               "He bears it bravely to his mother, who knows nothing of his hurts. His paleness she credits to fatigue. I warn him of serious harm; but his doctor speaks less gravely. I must leave you to repose," continued the man, rising, then, bending upon his knee, kissed the lady's hand  reverently, and arose to retire; but a second thought induced him to turn to the sleeper. He bent above her, listening to her gentle respiration until his eye detected the damp scarf beneath her cheeks. In trying to disengage it from her hand, she was partially aroused, and murmured, "Oh, I found him in the sea! Do not take him away!" Then she slept on, and the scarf was thrown carelessly on the table. The man glided back to his chamber to dream awhile of sinking ships, fettered hands, and floating wrecks; then to sink into dreamless slumber, unbroken until the morning threw "her banner over the hills."
               The lady, adjusting her pillows, wooed rest—but not sleep. She could not, so near Rome. The past had been hers; the future was not. She was one who had ruled  widely in her day. But the towers she had made strong and defensive had turned against her; the being she had almost deified—yea, quite,—for whose sake she had trodden (report said) many paths of crime, dyed in blood, that one had meted to her the fulness she measured to others—o'er-filled, past retributive justice, being done by the hand that should have laid naught crosswise in her path, whatever might have been and still was due to her of Heaven's vengeance.
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               THE RECOGNITION.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "She had a sweet browy with fringed lakes
                           Of an unfathomed darkness couched below;
                           And, parted on that brow in jetty flakes,
                           The raven hair swept back with wavy flow.
                           
                           Love lay in her lips, all hush'd and warm."
                        
                     
                     —Willis.
                  
               
               THE stranger guest of Valley Villa arose when he heard the household astir. His first care was to ascertain  the state of Titus, whom, unexpectedly, he found moving about on the back piazza, pale, suffering, but  determined not to be an invalid. On finding that the man styled a prisoner had domiciled with old Simon, Titus  accompanied his guest to the cave, where they found Simon alone.
               Titus was extremely surprised when the old anchorite threw himself in profound obeisance before the stranger, who appeared no less surprised, and annoyed, as he said,—
               "How! What dost thou, old man? Knowest thou me?" Simon arose, and, with enthusiasm burning in his wild eyes, he crossed his arms upon his bosom and replied,—
               "I have seen the rising sun glinting the towers of Zion. I have bounded along the bills of Judea. Should I not know her princes?" Not heeding the flushed face of his auditor, he continued,—
               "Paul of Tarsus bade me tell thee, thou wouldst meet him at Rome, whither he bent his steps by the first  cock-crow, to resume his bonds, that distrust may not meet the most noble King Agrippa on the threshold of his patron's palace."
               "Then is he great of soul, as I have honored him. But why was he still in bonds? We found no fault in him before Festus."
               "At thy gracious hearing, as thou knowest, he did  appeal to Cæsar, whereupon Festus straightway sent him to Rome. His bonds had been upon him these two years. Felix pandered to the Jews thus wise. Paul will meet his ship's crew at Puteoli, whose boats we saw dotting the  sea-mist upon their way this morning."
               Agrippa was relieved of much anxiety, and, willing to trust the men about him, he proceeded to give an account of his ill-starred voyage.
               He had come from Cæsarea in a private manner, on a private mission to Nero, not willing to let his subjects know of his absence; for his mission might be fruitless, or his absence seized upon by the seditious.
               He had left the port by night with two ships. One had been lost sight of in a dense fog, and the other, on which were himself, niece, and her governess, with their attendants, went to pieces in a storm off the Sicilian coast. He, with his niece, the matron, and a captain of his guard, were taken from the wreck by a ship from Melita. The storm of the previous night coming on, that ship also was run aground on a submarine island not many stadii from the shore. Two boats left her after the storm lulled, hoping to reach the shore seen lined along the horizon at nightfall. Knowing pretty well that they had kept their course until the ship was blown direct toward the land, which they deemed could not be far away, the king and his companions  had given themselves to chance rather than, as they thought, certain destruction on the crippled ship.
               "Owing to banditti that have acquired some fame abroad as infesting these regions, I shall deem it prudent to be known only to thine own family," said Agrippa, turning to Titus.
               Titus had all the while regarded him with peculiar interest, and waited to express the gratification he felt, as he said, in the favor fortune had granted, that he should meet with one of whom he had heard much, one in such high esteem with Rome's Emperor, and of whom he had heard his own father speak with affectionate eulogy.
               "Ah! have I then the good-fortune to be known to thy father? May I know his name and station?" said Agrippa, with much interest.
               "I have but to name his name, and his station is known," Titus said, with a proudly uplift of the face; and then, ashamed of the boast his words and manner conveyed, he looked down modestly, while the warm blood dappled his cheeks.
               "Ah, then am I the gainer, and the more distinguished that I have chanced to be so lodged. Thy father's British laurels are freshly green, and receiving brighter garniture with every post. Ah! there's one up yonder," pointing toward  the house, and then, as if recollecting himself, only added,—"Well, we love and venerate him."
               After some conversation with Simon, who would not be drawn into any discourse regarding himself, except that he was a disciple of the Nazarene, the two men returned to the villa. Titus walked slowly, and with difficulty. He was beginning to feel seriously ill; but his mind was tossed with reflections on the events of the past night. He had lain in the bottom of the boat like one dead, and when he first felt the pulses of life playing healthily, he heard a voice that would not be forgotten; and opened his eyes on other eyes dark as his own, while perfumed tresses, like the wing of an angel, swept to and fro, fanning him. His hands were still crossed on his bosom, as they had been placed when that bosom seemed pulseless. His form was extended,  as if to meet the stiffness of death, and he did not move; though he saw the glad light in the eyes looking down into his, as the boat, turning a point, carried them into the full blaze of the beacon.
               These thoughts dulled the pain of illness as he walked beside his guest, and entered the house. As they passed a casement, Titus saw that his mother was busied, causing the servants to adjust the triclivium of the dining-hall; for she had noticed the apparel of the strangers, and conceiving  them to be of exalted quality, wished to entertain them with Roman luxuriousness. She had already had breakfast  served in the apartment of the females, and was giving orders for the entertainment she designed for her male guests, when Titus, calling her, and making known the wishes of the king, arrangements were made of less  imposing character; the couches were wheeled from the  triclivium, and benches placed instead.
               During the day, the niece of Agrippa and her matron joined the family. Bernice, second of that name, had the peachy ripeness of complexion common to the Jewess, and lustrous eyes, such as some one of modern day describes as "fluid souls in mourning." They were always moist—always bright—always intensely black.
               She wore a dark-blue sleeveless robe, bordered around the bottom with embroidery in silk and gold. Wide sleeves of yellow silk were caught up by jewelled chains to her shoulders.
               The robe was confined about her waist with cord and tassel of linked gold. Yellow buskins, wrought with blue, enclosed her feet, that must have been soft and pretty by the timid, hesitating pressure with which they touched the floor, as she came forward supporting the matron, whom she addressed as mother Antonia.
               A blue silken band passed beneath her curling tresses, and crossed before, where a large topaz ornament  confined it upon her brow. Such was the finishing of the  picture, already in the mind of Titus, mingling with the less tangible visions of delirium. Titas could not conceal his disorder, and while giving his last instructions to a mounted courier ready to set off for Rome, his mother  noticed that he was extremely ill, and had him conveyed to his chamber.
               He was sick for many weeks with a painful pulmonary affection. He had good nursing, for he had a mother; but not always was hers the hand that tended him,—not his mother always, who with echoless footfall ofttimes stole to his couch to see if he slept, or how he slept,—not hers the ear, delicate and rosy, that sometimes lay close to his heart, to hear the play of his laboring lungs.
               Convalescence came, and frightened away the sweet  fancies be imagined had visited him; he could not think them real. But soon health strengthened his pulses, and he found companionship, warm and real, in the society of the lively Bernice—the first maiden with whom he had ever been thrown in social contact.
               Out-door exercises claimed the king and Alexis, the young captain; hence Titus was left to loneliness or the ladies. He chose the latter, of course, and amused them and himself in various ways. Reading and music he dedicated  to his mother and the matron Antonia. Teasing and compliments he seemed to think Bernice's by right, which she appropriated right willingly, and paid back not sparingly,  so that the matron Antonia was sometimes enforced  to remind her that she was born in a palace; and as we of the present day would say, with a golden spoon in her mouth. To which reproof Alexis set his own indorsement, frequent times eliciting the pert rejoinder, that "some who had chanced to ope their eyes first in kings' chambers, were by nature made to serve the hovel-born. She knew some such herself—not farther off than a stone's throw,"—which cutting remark was not difficult of application, since Alexis knew his first breath had been drawn in the Numa Palace at Rome, and that Titus—as he had heard him aver—looked first into his mother's eyes in a rough tenement of Reate. Agrippa only smiled at his niece's eccentricities, and looked approvingly on, when, scouting the etiquette her matron would have enforced, she ended remonstrance by doing just as she pleased.
               Agrippa greatly enjoyed his own freedom from courtly attendance. He had known a score of years, and half again as many, yet—  
                     
                        "Age had not dimmed the open truth,
                        The fiery vehemence of youth."
                     
                  
               
               A life denizen of courts, he scorned the emptiness he had probed, and kept back his heart from the gay beauties thronging his path. He looked upon them as "moths, gilded by the light in which they floated," passing amongst them with his haughtiness unbent, and his cynic lip "guiltless  of flatteries." He loved things natural and real—as he found the refinement of Vespasian's family, and felt himself  no whit greater in essentials than the proud scion of a plebeian race, who did the host in such grand forgetfulness, alike of his guests' nobility and his own humble station. King Agrippa found his thoughts often clustering around the idea of how royally such a free, unbound spirit might sway a world's sceptre. Was thought prophetic?
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               THE MIDNIGHT CONFERENCE.
               
                  
                     "Ha-ha—then I wager he was a maiden mountaineer in disguise. Did it not so turn out?"
                     "No maiden that—unless of the offspring of Anak."
                  
               
               THE same blue skies—clearly, deeply blue, that canopy Italia now, curved above it centuries ago, and drew from the occupants of Valley Villa admiration as  enthusiastic as the ravings of any modern tourist.
               On an evening lovely as any we have seen penpainted by travellers, Bernice sat on the highest step of the  colonnade, winding silks—Titus, near her on the one below, sometimes tangling her skeins, to enjoy her child-like  petulance, or watching the play of her fine countenance as she rehearsed some Jewish legend, or gazed abroad over the panorama of sky, ocean, and forest, remarking features of the beautiful or grand of which there was no dearth in the scene.
               Alexis, with his Grecian face, light-brown hair, and blue eyes,—nothing striking about him except his general ease and good-humor,—stood leaning against a pillar, watching the maiden and the boy. A disagreeable,  uneasy smile flitting over his face, or giving place to a look of profound astonishment, as Titus toyed with her long floating hair, or rapped the roses into her cheek with a branch of evergreen, snatched from her bosom in playful  pleasantry. At length, as Bernice was searching in her basket of embroidery, she found the poor fawn's collar. Regarding it for a moment, a decided pout curved out her under lip, and she said: "Ah, ha, master Titus! is this a fair lady's fair favor? I think if she be as lovely as her sweet name, her gifts merit better than to be cast aside with the tools of woman's handicraft."
               Titus, never having seen the collar since the eventful night of the storm, now descried the name "Alena," graved in a wreath on the inner surface, and in smaller characters beneath, "from her father, Sextus Romanus."
               Titus remembered the name as being the patronymic of a family residing high up on a bench of the mountains that overlooked Lower Campagna—however, disclaiming any further knowledge of them. After Titus had given a  partial account of the advent and death of the fawn, Alexis was delivered of a most novel idea.
               "Titus! what say you?—here's a chance for adventure. Shall we not return the truant collar to its mistress? She is doubtless beautiful as her name, and fresh as the streams that pour from her native rocks. I know something of that—her highland region."
               This idea was submitted to the king, and agreed upon by way of pastime. The three were just as much in love with danger and excitement as youths of eighteen centuries  since, and little heeded the prudent suggestions of Mother Antonia, for the pass that led to their destination was through the wildest gorges of the wild Apennines.
               Slumber stooped above the king's couch, and was about to touch his eyelids with her soporific ointment, when the tapestry was lifted that hung between his chamber and that of Alexis. As it fell to the floor with a sharp rustle,  that young captain stood in the light of the chamber-lamp.
               Agrippa opened his eyes at the intrusion; the look of surprise changed to hearty laughter when he saw the sober visage which always tokened a pregnant brain in Alexis.
               "What has disturbed the flow of thy blood, my captain? Has some wild Alpine gazelle conquered my puissant leader of Cupid's legions?"
               "No, my prince; with better grace, I might taunt you with woodland nymphs—out as you are, brushing the dew from the darkest defiles that cut these mountains; and  lingering, until the thickening twilight causes me to fear some mishap to Judea's king; I would it might please you to observe more caution."
               "And is this thine errand? I would it might please thee to let me sleep."
               "I came with a word of caution—but of more import—our fledgling host—Titus the great, I might say—for he takes upon him the air of a conqueror—I suppose feeling himself to be son of his father—"
               "What! findest thou fault with his grand ways? I like them; he has the elements of a hero—a spirit to make tyrants tremble—but what of this pluming bird thou hast found in the eagle's eyry?"
               "He seems to know little of decorum—less of the humble respect due the lady Bernice."
               "Tut, man, I have eyes too, and have beguiled me often watching their guileless hilarity; it is refreshing to see innocence and purity. Here we are not in princes' thraldom to weigh each act and word in diamond scales hung upon a hair; they do sport as children."
               "Yes, as children; but, to my notion, as children  sporting on the verge of the precipice that juts over the vale of Hinnom. The boy's eye, like the eagle's, gazes sunward.  He longs to grasp that which greater spirits may not dare."
               "So let him; I joy to see his soul pluming. As to the rest, I'll speak to Mother Antonia, that she keep her charge under surveillance—not too strict—the poor child will find the shackles on her all too soon."
               
               "An old beggar, doubled up and palsied, crossed me yesterday;  he was here in the hall to-day," said Alexis, easing himself into a seat near the couch.
               "Well, why should that claim an after-thought?" said Agrippa, laughing.
               "It might not, had I not seen him, an hour after, treading  a steep mountain-path, with form erect and step as firm as mine. He feigns what he is not, most surely. I little like the scrutiny he bent upon your niece. He even paid me particular regard."
               "Ha, ha! then I wager he was a maiden mountaineer in disguise; did it not so turn out?"
               "No maiden that; unless, indeed, some offspring of Anak of old has found means to bribe Charon to return his freight. By a head was that form taller than yours, my King."
               "King! Alexis, I wish thou wouldst teach thy lips some other word, since that title has no substance; it galls, stirs contempt. I cannot lift one single atom's weight of burden from my people—and to be called king! It is more redolent of emptiness than the 'Hail, King!' with which the Jews mocked the Nazarene."
               "The persuasion with which you go freighted to Nero will better that, and the title henceforth will savor of  substance, like the full, ripe melon."
               "The good that may come of my mission is yet  unborn," said Agrippa, musingly.
               "Then may all the gods be propitious, and give your mission good hap," was the energetic reply of Alexis.
               "Which if it do not have, Rome's tyrant may seek another favorite—I should say another tool, for his  oppression—or—or" and Agrippa's face flushed with rising warmth.
               "Or what? I read your thought—alas, a vain one, since no power may contend with Rome's. Submission has a hard sound; but you, my prince, must utter it, even while the heavy heel of failure grinds out your present hope. Strange if Nero do not declare for the Jews, against the Greeks, in this contest for Cæsarea, the city of your great-grandsire; yet, keep hope guarded—pacing side by side with moderate expectation—lest she too far o'erleap the bounds of actual chance, carrying your prudence with her; for I tell you now, however much it galls, it behooves you to temporize, not defy—not now. The wild prophecies of the Christian sect would prove no vain fantasy,—Jerusalem's  snowy diadem, fretted with its golden spires, would be a place for owls and bats, and the very name of Jew among the things that were."
               "Thou sayst temporize! Have I not done so until my people mistrust me? They look upon me with sidelong glances, and turn away their eyes, as if thinking that they would not have me know. As if waiting for some overt act of mine to pour their seething rage upon me. Oh, would they would trust me! There lies the peril! They are restive, and may lose all in their impotent efforts to gain all. But about the old beggar; what wast thou noting of him?"
               "Only that his evident disguise tokens not honesty. Your courier has not returned. There is room to  apprehend mischance. He and his despatches may, either willingly  or perforce, have been handed over to the lord of 'Castle Crag,' of whom such tales are told. Why do these people here seem so secure with Ansermo's very stronghold looking  down upon them? 'Tis not over ten leagues away, and though the common people's tongues are ever clanging the name of the chief, our hosts are reticent, and turn the topic by dexterous wiles, when chance brings in some  mention of Ansermo or his band's exploits. Think you it were possible—?"
               
               "No! no! utter not the unworthy thought. Beware! thy suspicious nature may carry thee beyond my patience—  for shame!" And Agrippa arose from his recumbency, and stamped his naked foot impatiently on the matless floor.
               "'Tis zeal then for my too credulous king's welfare, that stirs suspicion. 'Tis not, in my nature; that he will find," said Alexis, in a hurt, subdued tone, as he arose and passed into his own chamber, holding the curtain uplifted for a moment to hear Agrippa's reply.
               "Misplaced sometimes, my kind friend, but meant truly—oftener hitting the mark than falling wide; for which I am not thankless," said the king, as he resumed his position, and prepared for sleep.
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               THE MOUNTAIN FRAY.
               
                  
                     
                        "Brave Gael, my pass, in danger tried,
                        Hangs in my belt, and by my side."
                     
                  
               
               MOUNTAIN-SHADOWS were laggard, sleeping in coolness  in the valley, where orchard, garden, and vineyard were rich with perfume of fruits and autumn-flowers. Three horsemen picked their way warily along narrow ledges, plunged into deep hollows, or galloped over high ridges from which the view below, seen through the morning haze, looked like beautiful pictures veiled in gauzy fabric. Hamlet,  villa, rivulet, and river were dozing in shadow and mist. Vesuvius had not then shaken himself from the slumber of ages, but light wreaths of smoke, arising from his sides and crest, had floated a little upward to the west, and lay asleep on the still air. The deep green sea and the blue sky met silently, and stretching out their hands, pencilled the horizon there away in the west.
               Our horsemen were not insensible to the splendid panorama  at their feet. Leaping from their horses, they would climb or descend, as the case might be, to enjoy more  ample views than the regular path could command; so, loitering  the day drew near to noontide with not half the journey done. They were still not far from Valley Villa, when the king, who led, reining back in the path suddenly, exclaimed, "By all the gods, Titus, we have started a Satyr!" pointing with his whip toward a ledge that jutted almost over the way, where stood an old man, with long white hair, leaning upon a staff.
               
               "Your Satyr seems in high favor, then, with yon Nereid  just sprung from her fountain," answered Titus, as a woman, rising from beside a spring that headed beneath the  rock, handed a cup of water to the old man above.
               "Satyr or Sylvanus himself, I know not," said Alexis, riding up and halting; "but he is the bold beggar that tasted the wine of your father's vintage, so daintily,  yestereven, while his eyes took in more than his stomach. He regards us earnestly; let us pass on,—or, if you bespeak him, be on your guard, my liege," urged Alexis, reining back his horse, as he saw the king, bent on holding parley with the waysiders, advance, and stop just as the man, assisted by the woman, dropped from the rock and stood in the path before him.
               "Ye are not men of the mountain?" greeted him in simple tones.
               "What stirs thy conjecture, good father?" answered Agrippa, not knowing exactly what to say, or to what the man's question in the shape of an affirmation might lead.
               He was about to answer something, when Alexis, with face averted, brushed his horse rudely past, giving a  peremptory sign to the king to follow, which he did,  wondering, but certain Alexis had some cause for his rudeness. Just then, from the bottom of a deep gorge, down which  the rivulet leaped with peals of merry laughter, the neigh of a horse came clear and ringingly, thrown back in sharp echoes from rock and mountain side. Alexis urged a faster  gate, "else," said he, "we may have more of adventure than we came for; during your colloquy with the old wolf, I  was watching the play of lances in yonder thicket."
               "Why, man! Let us go back and see who holds them!" exclaimed Titus, suddenly drawing his steed across the  path to turn the party back, for he had gone in advance.
               "Not I, young hot-blood! You may enjoy that sport  alone. I'm for the bright eyes of the fair Alena," Alexis said; and the king motioning forward, al three set off at a rapid gallop which soon brought them to the crossing, where several roads met. On the right, down a dismal hollow, at the bottom of which flowed a stream, looking sullen and black as Styx in the deep shadows, was the old road to Bera; straight forward, following the comb of the ridge, was a new way to the same place—better, but farther.
               "My poniard is too rusty, and all unfit, to play with the bright lances behind us, else might I take one of these roads to Bera. I asked of the way thither to mislead him, in my hurried leave-taking of the old goat, back yonder; as it chances, Titus, thou wilt lead on."
               Titus led square to the north, along a smooth shelf at right angles with the course they had left. Riding on  rapidly for perhaps half an hour, one of the party turning to speak to his lagging comrade, saw a horseman advancing on the same road. In the hope of company, they all  slackened for him to come up. He reined up also. On  observing which, the king said impatiently, "So, so, the surly dog wants none of our company; we'll not tarry then for such an unsocial fellow," using his rowels until the little cavalcade went thundering down into the "vilest commixture,"  as Agrippa said, of "mud, fallen timber, and shapeless  rocks, that ever barred a traveller's way," at the bottom  of a huge fissure where a torrent had receded in its bed, until only a mere thread of water reflected the sky, making a line of light, twisting through the black unsightly mud and drift that had accumulated over the road behind  a barricade of fallen trees, since Titus had last trodden  the pass. They had need to retrace their steps, becoming  cognizant that a horseman was quietly watching their manœuvres from the eminence above, just where the road dropped abruptly down into the ugly slough. On retracing their way to the same point, the man was nowhere  to be seen, but a narrow bridge was descried spanning  the abysm from side to side; the party's rapid motion  having prevented it from being observed at first.
               It was a perilous structure, but they dashed across it and were soon cantering along on a wider bench of the hill than any yet attained. To their surprise, on looking back, the same individual they had before seen was keeping  the same distance at a like pace with themselves. They bore this for half an hour longer, when a turn in the road   hid him momentarily. When next seen he had been joined by another. The king and his companions had each his own thoughts. Each rode on without giving them expression  for some time, when Agrippa suddenly drew up,—
               "By the God of Abraham," he exclaimed fiercely, "we are followed! My blood boils to show them whose steps they dare to dog. Follow!" wheeling his horse and drawing  his sword, he shot back like a thunderbolt on his heavy  charger.
               Titus, with the first pause of the king, had jerked his horse upon his haunches and was abreast of him, as the word "follow" left his lips; his lighter barb sped past the king, and he was soon neck and neck with the hindmost horseman, for at the first instant of pursuit the two men had turned and went flying back along the flinty road for dear life. One, being the greater laggard, seeing encounter unavoidable, wheeled square round and faced Titus. Both horses reared at the sudden pull-up; but the riders kept their seats, and without a word, struggled to unhorse each other. Their blades rang sharply. Each tugged for the mastery, becoming convinced of each other's unquestionable prowess by the time Agrippa came up. "Yield, dog of a robber! yield at once," said he lifting his heavy sword ready to full on the man's uncovered head; but as if enraged now in earnest, the man's face grew black with determination  not there before. With his left hand still grasping Titus, he aimed a blow at the king. The king's sword fell crushing upon his arm, sending the man's blade clattering among the rocks of the roadside; at the same moment, he rolled into the dust, drawing Titus down with him.
               Titus was the first to his feet; the man attempted to rise, but paled, and seemed to sicken. He dropped back, fainting, his right arm hanging limp by his side. Titus looked at him a moment, and overcome with pity, examined,  and found his arm broken. The king, seeing nothing of the other horseman, and his anger being appeased, looked with some commiseration on the helplessness of the supposed brigand. Drawing a crystal flask from his vesture, he stooped, and tried to force the wine into the man's mouth, who had recovered sufficiently to swallow. After a few moments he was able to speak, and the king demanded the man's reasons for following them.
               "Ask me no questions. I shall answer none. Kill me, if you will;" and the man looked as if he really did not care whether he lived or died, he was so sick from the effects of his broken limb. Agrippa, smiling scornfully, said, "I do not desire thy blood; I aimed but to  chastise thine insolence."
               Titus, the while had bared the man's arm, and was scanning the chances of finding bandage and splinter, which, with Agrippa's assistance, was at length effected. The arm was set, bound, and placed in a sling, as well as surgeons pro tem, could do it.
               Agrippa and Titus might not have acted so generous a part by the fallen stranger, had they not marked something extremely winning in the man's features. He could be no ordinary brigand. His dress was rich; his face of a high intellectual cast, and his manner, when he recovered  sufficiently, was polished as a courtier's.
               
               Alexis had attempted to follow his madcap companions, but his horse fell and sprained its ankle. He now came limping up, with a world of reproof in his sober face. His services were, however, called into play, to assist in lifting the stranger to his horse, that all the while had stood whinnying near its master. As they were preparing to mount the man, Alexis could not refrain from grumbling at the mischance of his horse, and dilated on the utter impossibility of reaching their destination with him. The stranger, with a bow and smile, and graceful wave of his free hand, said, pleasantly, "Let not that disturb you. You may take mine. Ride him where you will, and turn him loose,—if it be this side of either sea she will come to me again,—and yours, I promise, shall be restored at any  point you may name."
               "But you—you cannot ride mine in your present plight," returned Alexis, rather unable to judge of the quality of his offer, and intensely surprised by it.
               "This is the way I will manage it," replied he, putting a small silver horn to his lips, and blowing a keen blast or two. The sound was heard far down the chasm, for they  were now not many rods from the bridge they had crossed, and could see both up and down the dark hollow. Tops of tall pines, just-visible here and there, were swaying in the breeze each side of the bridge, where the chasm narrowed  so that a few yards, of rough wood-work was made      to span it, which shortened the road by some miles.
               "This is the way I will manage it," and ere the jewelled bauble left his lips, and before our party had time even for thought, two horsemen turned into the road just where the slight bridge, cornered with the abrupt precipice above it, and around which the road partly wound.
               Agrippa braced himself somewhat haughtily, and bent his dusky eyes upon his sometime patient in the slightest degree inquisitively, as the men moved slowly up and  dismounted.
               "Romans! the noble courtesy you have extended to me shall not be forgotten; may our next meeting chance on better times." Turning to Titus, and bowing, he continued, "Had the noble son of the noble Vespasian been sooner recognized,"—here he hesitated, as if not exactly knowing the fitting words for a conclusion, then smiling, merely added, "my poor arm would not so have suffered," showing by his manner that he had not said the thing he wished.
               "Zadoc, this gentle stranger needs Libyan Mira. Lead her up. His own good steed is crippled, and must be your care to quarter; while I—good sirs, your help! My bruised limbs fail me," cried he, as making an effort to mount his comrade's horse, sharp pains warned him of other hurts beside his arm. Titus and Alexis assisted him to the saddle, and placed the bridle in his left hand, while the king with folded arms regarded him earnestly, and for the first time noticed that his whole suit was of foliage green, broidered with gold. His cap and plume, now soiled with the dust of the road, were of the same hue. His eyes were dark violet, while lashes, beard, and hair were intensely black. He will be no stranger for the future.
               The king and his two friends, with right arms flung over their saddles, and bridles clutched in their left hands upon the horses' necks, stood ready to mount, watching the receding strangers moving off slowly toward the bridge. They were anxious to see them safe over,—but no, they turned square to the left, between the corner of the bridge and precipice, where the eyes of our party had failed to see room for even a goat's footing.
               As the rocky angle shut between the observers and the observed, the king and Titus simultaneously felt the ridiculousness of the adventure, and laughed merrily, as each sought the other's eye. They sprang lightly into their seats, but had not turned their horses' heads when a vision of the wounded stranger stood full in the road again. He bowed to his saddle-bow in salutation, and a line of glittering pearl  was visible, parting his thick, black beard. His left waved a sword; a strip of paper floated from its point, fluttered and fell by the wayside. Again bowing until his green plume mingled with his horse's long mane, he turned and was gone.
               "There's a challenge! Wilt thou fetch it, Titus?" said Agrippa. Titus did as he was bid, and soon the missive was in the hands of the king. It ran thus,—"The son of Vespasian may command these hills by order of their lord, Ansermo." Had they then encountered Ansermo? and why should Titus be singled out for special privileges? Alexis thought and pondered, as he sat upon the  proud-stepping, beautiful steed, that he now believed to be  Ansermo's own.
            
            
               CHAPTER IX.
               MOUNTAIN VILLA.
               
                  
                     "It was a weird, wild place."
                  
               
               TWO hours after midday, our Don Quixotes of the first century found themselves riding the clouds.
               The villa of Romanus seemed in mid-air, rather than on terra firma. What it did there among the clouds, with no civilized thing around it, except a sheeting or two hung among the rocks afar down, baffled the acumen of the king and his companions, as their rowels struck along the stone pavement in front of a huge archway which was the entrance to the building.
               They would have indulged themselves in contemplating the wild aspect of the scene some moments longer, had not an uncouth object appeared, in character with the surroundings in the shape of a man, at the open portal. His hair was uncombed and capless. He was loose-robed, without sandals,  or covering of any kind to his feet. He lifted his hand above his eyes to shade them from the sun, and took a calm survey of his self-invited guests. With a better show of urbanity than his appearance promised, he said,—
               "Hail, friends! health and peace!"
               Our party were soon seated in the inner court; although to the travellers the mountain air seemed chilly, and the fountain which played in the centre of the court made the atmosphere still more unsummer-like.
               The host returned to the occupation he had left when informed that men were approaching. A willow basket, containing apple-parings, was placed between his feet. A pile of luscious fruit lay on a mat beside him.
               Having caused his guests to be served in like manner, the rosy pile began to lessen under the sharp requirements of their hunger, when a servant announced that a repast was spread in an inner hall. During the entertainment, and while the wine was flowing freely, old Romanus became facetious and boasted of his daughter's accomplishments, particularly in music and housewifery. Alexis, thinking it a favorable moment, rather challenged an exhibition of her performance, whereupon the old man called to a slave filling a pitcher at the fountain of the court, which was visible to those within, and bid him tell his mistress to come to him.
               In a few moments the shuffling of slippered feet  announced a lady's proximity. Alexis, whose nature was ardent, indulged in the wild dreams usual with such, and had really become smitten with a name; and as he made it a point to reserve all his prudence and caution for his friends, he appropriated his follies to his own use.
               The heart of Alexis gave a succession of wild leaps as he saw the curtains undulate and begin to lift from the doorway. But only a tall, spare woman, of about thirty-five,  entered, and, with a slight salutation to her father's guests, stood as if waiting to be addressed.
               Alexis turned his eyes longingly upon the curtains that had settled to their places without sign or sound of any other comer. He was foolishly mortified, and unthinking of what he did, ejaculated, "By the gods!"—when he should have made the lady some acknowledgment of her presence.
               "Alena, these countrymen desire to test the quality of thy music, since they have had just cause to praise thy housewifery. Come, let a slave bring forth thy harp."
               "Let not my father be offended that I cannot; my harp is unwieldy, and—and—"
               "Go then to thy chamber, and we can hear thee as well, unless thou art afraid the chords will hurt thy fingers, as the girl Claudia pretendeth always. Confusion on such damsels!"
               Romanus allowed his daughter to depart without further remark. It was evidently his hour for indulging in  intoxication, to which he was fast tending, apparently. He had, however, the power of locomotion sufficiently to lead his guests back to their places in the court, beneath a rough balcony that projected over them. Romanus threw himself on a bench, and seizing a cushion near, crammed, rather than placed it under his head, and evidently prepared  for a snooze, as the sound of a harp above announced the lady's intention to comply with her father's bidding. As the music filled the court, Alexis became aware that the old man's pale-blue eyes, drunk as he seemed, were shooting busy and furtive glances between his fingers, and watching every movement of his guests. The woman concluded  her performance by singing, "The Destruction of Troy," in an uncultivated but not unmusical voice. Had it been the destruction of hope, Alexis would have thought it extremely appropriate; but it is to be doubted if he or his companions heard a word or tone of the melody.
               Each felt that he had come on a fool's errand, and cast about for some more plausible pretence than the restoration  of the fawn's collar. At length, the music having ceased, Titus drew the flexible golden circlet from his vest, and stepping from under the balcony, held it to the view of the lady who sat within the window above, and who,  immediately recognizing it, stepped into the balcony, and  bending over, desired to know of Titus what chance had  rendered it to his keeping.
               
               The balcony was not high, being only on the first floor and above the low archway that led from the front of the  building. We will permit Titus to give his own account,  of the fawn's death and obsequies, and proceed to describe the without of the "weird wild place."
               The building, of substantial stone, was built on three sides of a quadrangle, with the windows or casements all opening within the court, the outside of the house looking like a huge wall, cut in two by as huge an archway. Within the court, nature and art had combined to make it perfectly beautiful. The tank that caught the waters of the fountain was lipped with a rim, of exquisite autumn flowers, then in bloom, making the first of a series of  concentric circles filled with shrubs, vines, and every choice flower and tree that the most rare taste could collect, which, with statues of marble and porphyry interspersed, made the place fit to be inhabited by beings of another mould than Romanus and his daughter. So much at variance were these inner arrangements with the outside appearance of the pile, as to suggest the idea of enchantment to one emerging from the rough archway, without a previous knowledge of the place.
               On the east, ah abrupt precipice formed the fourth side of the quadrangle, except where it dropped back in an angle from the south-eastern corners, where a cascade, tumbling, seemingly, from the clouds, fell in a stone tank in a shower of spray, after filling which, the water went  babbling and jumping over the garden terraces on the south, and then passing under the wall, gurgled along until it fell in a narrow sheet by the roadside, where its waters were again husbanded in a stone trough, that wayfarers might drink.
               When the king and his companions came out to  remount, the sun's eye looked ominously sleepy, and he seemed about to wrap himself for repose in his mantle of purple, crimson and gold.
               They were little pleased with the prospect of night, and the Apennines in conjunction.
               The moon would be up; but there were gorges to pass that had never known even the sun's light or warmth. After a stirrup-cup with their host, who had preserved his perpendicular remarkably after his first semblance of inebriation, they set off.
               Along the way, outside the wall, ran a succession of terraces, partly natural, but cultivated as a vineyard up to the crown of rocks jutting above; this on the right, with another gentler, sparsely wooded acclivity on the left, threw the road along a narrow hollow. As the party commenced a rapid canter, the king's horse suddenly veered to the left, and threw him against the wall of the enclosure. He did not rise. The others, alarmed, dismounted hastily, and found him insensible, with the blood spurting from a gash in his head.
               Simultaneously, the cause of the accident became apparent. A young girl, in a short, blue dress, with a crimson cloak thrown lightly back from her shoulders, and a light basket of grapes resting on floating yellow hair, like crimped silk, was standing by the low wall. Frightened by the appearance of strangers, she had caught a pendent vine, and attempted to swing herself up to the lower terrace; which she effected; but the vine becoming dislodged, fell with a loud rustle at the feet of the nearest horse, sweeping the basket from her head, and sprinkling the grapes over steed and rider.
               From her leafy perch, she looked down on the group below until sympathy overmastering fear, she let herself down into the road again, and approached the group, with timidity and commiseration mingling in her soft blue eyes. She faltered a few words of inquiry, and a proffer to send succor from the house, in accents sweet as the "Bul-bul singing to the rose,"—so Alexis had time to think, even in his alarm of the king.
               
               After bringing from the tank before mentioned, which was near by, a wooden cup or bowl of water for the use of the wounded man, she tarried not to see the pale face and  limp hands laved, but tripped off hastily toward the house.
               Titus and Alexis, not unmindful of the maiden's loveliness  and grace, still exerted themselves to restore the king, whose eyes had closed, while yet upon the retina glowed a picture the which Time's effacing besom could not erase; and when, in long after-years, dark Atropos bent above him, the shadow of the same image came between him and death, and he babbled of the beautiful photograph memory had saved during the long years—even at threescore and ten.
               By the time a litter was brought from the house, a faint shiver had passed over the king's frame, and a tremor like the pulsations of a frightened show-bird was felt at his  heart. But the sun went down, leaving a twilight of uncertainty  over anxious hearts assembled there in the gloaming,  at the edge of the forest, through which the night-wind  soughed mournfully, stirring the sparse pines like a dirge. Time's black, tireless pinion bad swept every  vestige of the day into the unreturning, ere the king was  sufficiently restored to bear removal. In the light of time torches glaring around, he turned his eyes from one to another, as if in search of what he did not find, and so was borne to the house, and couched in an inner room.
               On examination, his right side was found contused, and stricter scrutiny developed several ribs broken.
               Every appropriate appliance was made, every comfort administered; yet during the long watches of the night, his pain culminated to feverish delirium. During a lucid moment he said, "My niece: She must not come here. Let her remain with your mother, Titus." Then he went wild, and for many days anarchy held revel over prostrate reason son. His transports were not altogether unhappy. Soothing  moments gave him beautiful visions: sometimes of grapy bowers, with yellow-haired angels floating on azure wings therein, and pressing the purple fruit between white finger-tips, until the red juice fell in cool showers upon his fevered tongue. Then again he would soar away on a white-winged, zephyr-borne cloud, and drink of the cold cisterns of mid-air. Then falling, falling, floating,  sinking, lower and lower, he would lift his eyes and arms to a blue-robed maiden, who, laughing, and nodding her yellow curls, showered baskets of luscious fruit and gay flowers upon him. At other times, he raved of sinking ships, bloody revolts, and uttered fierce denunciations against some one, who, he said, held his hands in bloody iron gauntlets.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER X.
               THE HERMIT.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Waiting for his bounding footsteps,
                           Waiting for his dark-eye glances,
                           Waiting for his loving accents,
                           Waiting for his sweet 'My mother!'"
                        
                     
                     —A. M. B.
                  
               
               SINCE the sea-breeze grew still, Domitia had been a watcher,— 
                     
                        "Waiting for a form that lingered,—
                        List'ning for a voice that came not."
                     
                   She, with the girl Bernice, watched from the viny piazza that commanded the road winding along the base of the mountain-spur, that, not far from the foot of the garden, angled off toward the north-east. Here Bernice had watched the lessening forms of her friends upon that morning, until nearing a pass that cut directly into the   hills some dozen stadii away, one horseman turned, and a red scarf floated out like a flame-tongue lapping the cool  morning air. A white undulating gleam from the portico had sent back the answering and looked-for token, and in another moment rider and horse were swallowed by the  envious gap.
               In quiet country life, few incidents mark the tombstones of the dead hours. Days and months are dreamed away, uncounted as they pass; hence every unusual occurrence assumes importance beyond its worth, and the absence of Titus and his companions was thus made of considerable moment; not that they were not often absent, but it was considered quite out of the order of things to take a trip in that particular direction—a feat sometimes performed safely to those who essayed it, but oftener productive of some startling adventure. Some, it was said, had never returned, and rumor avowed that many a missing one had been found dangling from tall crags, out of all human reach; and that their bleached skeletons, after creaking and rattling for months in wind and tempest, had fallen piece by piece, to be replaced by other bodies warm with life-blood.
               Domitia thought nothing of these stories; she watched for her son—as other mothers have watched—longing to have him with her. But when the round, full moon arose up to the highest peak on the east, and touched the sea with her sceptre, the mother's heart became apprehensive, though she had tried to calm the fears of her guests, and had sat her down in the moonlight, pondering many things.
               The minds of Titus and his mother had wandered long in search of Truth; they had left the system of a plurality of gods, disgusted with its insufficiency. Some conception of the One Supreme had given a clue,—finer than gossamer thread,—but still a clue; and the mother, leading her son through the sinuosities of her own reasoning, had grasped it firmly in her mind's bewilderment. In this vague condition  of mind Simon the Anchorite found them, on a disquiet sea, aiming for an unknown shore, drifting nearer and nearer, in an unseen current, drawn by the invisible—  nearer and nearer the shore—the unknown—the True.
               The matron Antonia, who had become quite interested in Simon of the Cave, spending much time listening to his teachings  whenever she encountered him, proposed sending for him to help cheer the time until the return of their friends. A polite message, therefore, soon brought him to them.
               He was termed "old;" but wherefore? Though his locks were "white as the down of Canna," his frame was like the mountain-oak, his mild gray eye had a fire that could be stirred ablaze at wrong or insult, though to those who honored him it had a winning look—soft as a mother's upon her sleeping child.
               He had eaten his early supper of brown-loaf and fresh fish,and could not be induced to take a morsel more  except a cup of wine tendered by Bernice, to refresh him after his walk.
               The lamps were retrimmed, and the family assembled after their evening meal. Conversation began to flag; and Bernice, struck with the disparity of Simon's manner and apparent poverty, ventured an expression of her thought, adding,—
               "You are of my own land. Many of her people are in exile. Are you of those—the exiled?"
               Smiling sadly, he answered, "Not of my own free will am I a tenant of yon cell, apart from all my kindred."
               Simon had never proffered to tell anything of himself, and Domitia felt it indelicate to pry into what he had  evidently chosen to keep to himself. She therefore arrested anything further by saying,—
               "Father, could you tell us a legend, or sing one of the songs of Zion? I have heard your voice mingled with the sound of the beating surf that ever comes up from that quarter."
               "I can tell many a tale of Jewry; but my voice is  better attuned to the ocean's moan than to the harp, since mine is hung upon the willows by the waters of Babylon."
               Bernice, at the word, had drawn a fine Grecian harp to his feet. So he had nothing to do but begin or utterly refuse. Passing his hands rapidly along the strings, and finding them well strung, he played a short prelude that showed him not unacquainted with its chords; then striking boldly into a psalm of "Praise to the Lord," his voice  filled the lofty arches and floated out on the moonlit air, until every heart felt the influence of the glorious melody. To Domitia it was as a summons to the presence of the adored Uncomprehended. She felt her soul absorbed into the sound—taken from its clay tenement to  companionship with higher spirit essences, undefinable, but never forgotten; for the lady averred, years after, that in that grand melody her soul went from her, and came back at its close laden with infinite peace, recognizing, and bearing the seal of its immortality.
               In all her life, Domitia had known little of Judaism, less of the "new-birth" sect called Christians; now she stood face to face with both under her own roof-tree.
               "Now for a story!" exclaimed Domitian, clapping his hands in glee.
               "Yes, a legend!" said Bernice, as Simon put aside the harp, after one or two songs from herself and hostess.
               "Tell us a legend, good father, do."
               "With some hesitation in his manner, and an earnest look in his face, he said, turning to Bernice,—
               "Thou hast visited Jerusalem. Hast thou seen the  footprints in the rock?"
               "No, nor heard of such, save as a tale that should not be told," said Bernice, opening her wondering eyes at the man's temerity in speaking of things forbidden in her creed.
               "The tale will be told—the impress of those feet will be there when Jerusalem will not have one stone upon another,"  he exclaimed, emphatically. Bernice and her matron bent their heads, for they knew he alluded to the Nazarene's prophecy concerning the destruction of  Jerusalem. They had been taught that it was a crime to hear it even; but Domitia, anxious, urged him to tell her  something of his own knowledge concerning whom he called his Master.
               Simon began with rapid utterance, seeming to fear that he might lose the opportunity of speaking if he faltered:
               
               "Yes, I knew him. Ten times the larches budded, over which his birth-star shone at Bethlehem, ere my own life began. The stream that sang my lullaby had bathed his baby-limbs. I have lain upon his knees, and forgot the fever's burning, looking up into his calm eyes. The touch of his cool palms has driven away the phantoms of delirium, and restored health to my wasted frame; and, more than all, his very presence exorcised the evil that was in my boyhood's spirit as the memory thereof tames my fierce nature now."
               People said he was a strange, mysterious child, wandering  away from boyish frolic to brood in lonely dell or by some woodland stream. No word or look of anger ever took the sweetness from his voice, or ruffled his quiet  features. He never wrangled with his companions; if any smote or did him other wrong, he but turned upon the offender a look;—such I have never seen in other eyes, its chief element being heavenly forgiveness—disarming his antagonist on the instant, and melting him to penitence. He sometimes spoke in language I could not understand. His mother did; she ofttimes questioned him. There seemed a world between them—a link that others knew not of. I have seen her steal aside when she thought none noted, and deemed herself unseen by him, and gaze upon him with eyes dilated and lips apart, her hand upon her heart to still the tumult her own thoughts created, or some mystic knowledge engendered.
               She ever looked upon him with a strange longing—mournfulness and joy, love and fear—as if she had an inkling of the destiny calling him, waiting, awed and  anxious, for some mighty development. So he grew to  manhood—" Simon paused, dropped his head upon his hands in communion with himself, ere he proceeded to narrate that which the "Seventy" had been sent to teach.
            
            
               CHAPTER XI.
               THE GREEN CLOAK.
               
                  
                     
                        "What thing is here?
                        I do not know it!—but this—yes, this
                        
                        I have some knowledge of—"
                     
                  
               
               BEAUTIFUL! yes, beautiful as the look affection makes a loved one wear," answered Simon to Bernice's  question, who in despite of her own and mother Antonia's warnings, found herself more than interested. As the old man's eye sought hers with peculiar meaning, she thought of Titus, and knew he had wittingly chosen the words—words most fitting to portray to her the extreme of manly beauty:—
               "Beautiful as the look affection makes a loved one wear—yea, surpassing all earthly mould of loveliness was he of whom you ask. His large luminous eyes were deeply blue, or violet, as the spirit intensified—the shadow of the bow of God's promise, it might have been. His hair, always parted from the centre, fell away from the pure, fair brow in long loose ringlets over his shoulders—but the color!—that was of a hue that has never come to earth. A golden, filmy network, thrown over the raven's wing, glancing in sunlight, may give a shade of that indescribable  sheen upon his hair—'twas something of the glory that was and is his in his Father's kingdom.
               "When He spoke of sin, his voice had the mournful melody of the wind-harp in its dying fall; but when He pointed heavenward, 'twas cheery as the tones of one  calling to us from the portal with glad tidings.
               
               "Thou askest this, and oh, I feel how poor words are to  describe the awful majesty upon his brow on that day—in that hour! I stood supporting the mother in her agony, pressing close to the cross, when the sun, dim and lustreless,  hung without motion in the thick, dead air; when the hills heaved and staggered as if drunken, and the amazed dead burst their sealed caverns, and swayed, shadowy, to  the mighty hurricane that pressed the dark clouds of night's blackness so close upon the multitude we might have touched them. There was no light of day, or torch, or tempest. The clouds refused to give out their lightnings.  No light, save the stream of pencilled rays, that bathed His head in a soft glory, and in which, invisible to other eyes, the mother saw angels descending, sent of the Father to minister to Him.—
               "When all was finished, the darkness lifted, and the sun smiled down on a world redeemed!"
               This was a fragment of the fragmentary testimony given by Simon before a handful of unbelievers more than eighteen  hundred years ago, on Roman soil. It was broken upon by the sound of horses' feet clattering up to the  portico. Bernice bounded to the door as if her poor strength could lift the heavy bar that fastened it. Simon assisted her, and the door swung open. A scream of surprise from Bernice was herald to a stranger—not their friends—a  servant sent from Mountain Villa—so he announced himself.
               Domitia arose, grasping the high head of the couch, her lips whitened and set firmly, but nothing else of  outward show betrayed the mother's fear, as she stood waiting to hear.
               In a few words the accident to the king was told, and a message from Titus delivered, that he would be home with the morning.
               The messenger had evidently left before Agrippa's state was fully ascertained, and the family, glad that nothing worse had befallen, retired tranquillized.
               Bernice went to her chamber, but having seen the matron comfortable, opened the lattice, and sat down within the broad sill, that was low, and canopied with honeysuckles,  through which the moon sifted on her upturned face—turned to the stars, but seeing them not; then she gazed at the way they went, as if it were some comfort  parting the vines, and straining her eyes toward the dark pass, to recall the vision of the morning; but the way lay in dense shadow; she only saw the white cascade, looking  in its dark setting like a ghost waiting at Pluto's dismal  portal for admittance, hidden as it was, by the bold projecting cliff above it, from the full moon hanging over the topmost crag there-away.
               The maiden's white fingers untwisted from the vines, and she turned her face again to the stars—seeing them not as before. Visions of her uncle's probable suffering  occasionally intruded, but another voice than his echoed in the caverns of her thought, and she did not notice the  list-footed hours.
               The murmur of dashing waters came to aid her musing dreaminess, and she fell asleep, with the dew in her hair, and the shadow of the lacing vines upon her face.
               She had never, in her waking hours, seen the Lucifer-like  grandeur of the face pressed close to hers, nor the black flame eyes scanning her features over and over; nor had she ever heard the rich bass tones of the voice,  suppressed to a whisper—less than a whisper—only a moving of the full lips in soliloquy,—
               "Her brow—her eyes—her hair—except these jet rings. Hers were straight as the hanks of her silken floss with which she wrought tapestry for the hangings of his  couch—I hate him yet! The name too!—Oh, I will not be baffled—the man I saw to-day had the look which none may wear save of blood drawn from her veins, or from the fount that gave her life—ah, her brother!—I   will ferret from Nero if he expects him—the courier tore his despatches, but he was bound to Rome, and to—Nero."
               A portion of this soliloquy was breathed as he bent, parting the vines with his hands, gazing into the sleeper's  face; then closing them—the vines—carefully, that the  rebound of the lithe branches might not strike her face, or  rustle too loudly, he left the window. The next moment a  tall, powerful form, arrayed in forest-green, even to the plumed cap, came out into the moonlight; it glanced  brightly from his burnished armor, among the shrubbery, which encircled this part of the premises in unfading foliage; crossing the stile at the bottom of the garden, the form  disappeared in the shadow of the clifts.
               Persons whose minds are exercised unhappily, rarely sleep soundly. The light tissue with which slumber envelops  their senses yields to the lightest jar, is broken by  mere shadow of sound—faint as the footfall of a winged insect. Antonia awoke without being conscious of any disturbing influence. Her hand, that lay on the bed-covering,  was cold with the night-breeze coming through the open casement. She arose and found Bernice's head resting  on a lap of interlacing trailers, securely covered, even  to the dreaming head, by a cloak—a horseman's cloak! She did not recognize it!
               On awakening Bernice, the girl's surprise was great  that she had slept at all—greater when she found with what manner of care she had been fenced from the night-damps.
               The cloak was of green cloth, bordered with gilt fringe. None of the household wore such, and on inquiry next day,  great was the marvel and shaking of heads, and ominous tones seen and heard in the servants' hall. Tales of brigands ands, that had died out, were renewed, and additions put thereto until Bernice, who sometimes indulged in gossip with the maids, began to think she might have been kissed by the veritable Ansermo.
               The clasp of the cloak was human—that she knew,—  'twas Jewish, moreover. Her mother, Mariamne—wife of Archelaus—had worn such—the mate to one given to a dear friend years before; but so many clasps were alike—so manly like that one—a serpent coiled with glittering emerald eyes, and tongue of pure ruby. The cloak was of gentle make, sure; some neighboring gallant had beguiled him with a moonlight stroll; or some hunter, late from the chase, had chanced by, and seeing the unprotected sleep of thoughtlessness, had followed the suggestions of a kindly heart—perhaps a father or a brother—so conjecture ran on until weary; and ceased for want of sustenance.
               Antonia reprimanded her charge, but kindly. It was not often she could gather her thoughts from the troubles that consumed her to notice much of what Bernice was pleased to do. Domitia thought her remiss in duty, for she recognized her only as Bernice's governess, she being treated as such by the maiden and her uncle—except in private, where alone she received from them marks of profound respect and affection, and was addressed by titles unknown out of palaces.
               Who she was, A. D. 62, it mattered little to know,—who she had been, was for conjecture. Her life—her living,  moving, busy life, was in the past; she had no future, no present, none this side eternity. So she herself thought. The sequel will show if hers was not a redeeming future.
               Once she met Gallio, the brother of Seneca, and he told to her the saying of Paul on Mars Hill,—"The Unknown God whom ye ignorantly worship, Him declare I unto you." She had thought of it; that sentence had rung in her ears in her extreme misery, when years after found her a  fugitive. In her repentance of crimes too dark to name, she had  sacrificed on Roman altars; but could not feel washed by the blood of such sacrifice; and the words of the man on Mars Hill seemed a suggestion, and rung in her ears so continually, that when secure with friends in Jerusalem, coming in contact  with Judaism, she embraced it, thinking she found, in Israel's God, the Unknown. Even then she had heard nothing of Christianity except as a thing anathematized by the priests of the temple, and she feared to learn more than its name, dreading the frown of her new-found God.
               In her walks about Valley Villa, she had been drawn by the sweetness of Simon's psalm-singing, to listen; then she had paused to catch words of his prayer, and on the night of his presence at the Villa she was moved to do more than listen—to wonder and admire,—then yearn to have it all true—the character and mission of the strange one spoken of by Simon. She longed to believe there was efficacy in the blood of the Lamb—to put on sin-washed robes, and lie down in the green pastures by the still waters of peace. These thoughts had haunted her pillow that night, and she went to sleep, thinking of the parable of the pearl-fisher,  and she resolved to become a fisher for life. Simon  was weary—feeling himself a drone—a dull, dead clod—little knowing that the Providence which sent him a fugitive—barred and banned—to that cavern in the clift—sent him there to fill a mission, fore-ordered, sealed and signed, in the courts of Heaven—to plant a seed that should become a tree for the saints to shelter under—a fruit-bearing tree whose seed is in itself;" which fruit, birds of passage would pluck and bear to other lands.  None of us know what tissue walls divide us from the  fruition of hope; nor whereunto we are sent by the force of circumstance; nor from what great error a chance  stumble may save us.
            
            
               CHAPTER XII.
               THE CASCADE.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life
                           As love's young dream."
                        
                     
                     —MOORE.
                  
               
               ABOUT one stadium from the house, and a little beyond the east wall of the garden that fell away in terraces from the steps of the back portico, north and east, angled  the mountain spur, so abruptly, that the sharp corner  jutted in a bold ledge over the road at its base, as if the earth had been purposely scooped away from beneath the projecting shelf, to make a bower for weeping Niobe. The long moss and vines trailed from above, nearly reaching the ground, embowering the cascade that more than  halfway up gushed from a grot in the broad face of a rock, seemingly solid otherwise. After one or two bold leaps over the worn stone, it fell in a long, narrow sheet of light, shivering, to spray in the stone basin; then gathering itself again, its still broken fragments, hand in hand, went  skipping across the road, babbling amongst the verdure,  between field and vineyard—down, down to the bay, where with one wild, uproarious shout of gleeful laughter, it sprung over the cliff, and was lost in the interminable sea.
               To this grot, after the midday meal, Bernice, gathering up her silks and embroidery in a light basket, bent her steps.
               Crossing the low stile, a few steps brought her to the cascade. She climbed with some difficulty to a seat near where the waters first leave the cavern, and which  commanded the road almost to the yawning pass. The face of the grot being somewhat turned from the house, the cascade was only visible from the windows and porch.
               The morning had not brought Titus, as his message promised; and Bernice thought to ply her task, and watch for the coming of her friends where she could be alone—to think, as well as watch. She had thoughts that were pleasant—pleasanter than realities—sweeter than the chewing of confections and fruits, with which her maid had come laden, and had spread upon the turf beside her there. The maid, having no sweet fancies to indulge, took a station below by the roadside, and soon fell asleep by the rippling waters.
               For a while, the beautiful creations of a fine taste fell upon the ends of a paly-blue silk scarf, in many a bud, leaf, and blossom; but soon a half-wrought wreath lay in unfinished beauty beneath listless fingers, while the maiden's musing, dewy eyes saw not what they looked upon.
               She wore a robe of pale-yellow Aleppo silk, bordered with a light fringe of sky-blue; as was the silken sash that confined her waist, and the bands that crossing about her ankles fastened her slipper-sandals; one of which was resting—no, beating measuredly on the moss-tufted stone at her feet.
               One end of the scarf she was braiding was thrown over, but did not half cover her shining rings of dusky hair, which was pushed back from her smooth brow.
               So absorbed was she "chewing the cud of sweet fancy," that, unobserved, a jaded rider, on as jaded a horse, checked his steed at the little branch. Accident, nothing else,  lifting his eyes to the grotto, at smile broke over his weary face, and he slid from his horse, noiselessly, and made his way carefully up to her very feet, when a stone, dislodged  by his stepping, rolled and fell with a splash into the  basin, startling her with a half-frightened cry—to behold  Titus, cap in hand, smiling mischievously in her face.
               Had he looked sober, her fears would have been instantly aroused; for he was alone. Commonplace scenes will occur in despite of the wishes of writers,—the only chance is to get over them with as few touches as possible—so pass we what followed.
               Bernice was alarmed at the report of Titus relative to her uncle's condition; she wept, too, plenteously; but his earnest assurances that proper treatment would insure the king's recovery, soothed her. At Titus' request, she  resumed her seat, while he reposed his weariness near her feet, and told her of his rich adventures of the day before, terminating with the king's accident. When he repeated her uncle's wishes that she should remain with his mother, Titus laughingly said, "Bernice, I cannot take on me so grave an office as to fill thy uncle's place; but I will be a very good brother. Will that suffice?"
               A ringing, joyous peal broke among the rocks around in response. "Yes, and I will be thy sister; so bend that shocking mass of tangles a little this way, and I will teach it a trick of smoothness by virtue of my office."
               Taking a jewelled comb from her hair, she twisted and stroked the jet fringe, that, damp with perspiration, was matted about his temples, until his heart went wild, beating  his bosom like the wings of some prison-bird frantic to escape, until it bubbled over—the heart, not the bird—in words such as these,—
               "Bernice, I love thee better than a legion of brothers could do—so well that, if I were to see Alexis but touch one of thy curls with only the tip of his gloved finger—I would—"
               "Well, what? what wouldest thou do?"
               "I would like to toss him from the great rock that hangs over the Tiber. How much dost thou love him?"
               
               "Then what must he think, when thou wilt not only touch, but pull me over the room by these same danglers as thou didst some eves agone?"
               "Oh, he frets—I can see that—but why should he?—unless—unless— Bernice, answer my question—how much dost thou love him?"
               "How dost thou measure love?" the coquettish sparkle in her merry eye growing brighter, and her fingers  twisting more energetically through his hair. "How dost thou rate the quantity of love?—by extent, capacity, or weight?"
               "Cease teasing, Bernice, and tell me;—I am too weary and sick to be thy sport to-day."
               "Why, Titus, I like Alexis—I do not love him."
               "Love, and like—what's the difference?"
               "Oh, a wide ocean of difference!"
               "Then, I would like to occupy one shore of thy ocean, and have Alexis on the extreme other. Do we stand on the same shore, Bernice?"
               He could not see her face;—a sudden twitch, with her  fingers twisted in his hair, had pulled his face from her, but the pink cheeks grew scarlet, as she began a faltering answer.
               "Son of Vespasian, thou—thou standest here upon the firm shore of the Tuscan Mediterranean."
               "I sit here at thy feet;—that was an ugly pull for an aching head, but go on." A repentant look instantly  tamed the light in her eyes. Impulsively she pressed a soft "down-of-Cana" like hand to his temple, and strove to  press back the blood she saw cording the veins there.
               "Well, go on, Bernice. I am sitting here at thy feet on the shore, or near it—"
               "Where now must I place Alexis, with all my likes for him,—not love, remember?"
               "On the very pillar of Hercules—the extremest west  of thy sea of Mediterranus. No midway island may receive him—art thou willing, Bernice?"
               "Most willing, Titus,"—the blushes dappled face, neck, and bosom, though she kept his face from her, by equalizing the tension she held upon his hair, right and left. The desire to see her face grew so strong at this juncture, that he grasped both her hands in his, and at the expense of some pain, detached, and drew them forward encircling his neck with her arms. The temptation was exquisite, as he held the pink palms near his lips. He was not accustomed to resist impulse when he saw no harm in it; quicker than it can be told, he kissed them once, twice, thrice, until Bernice, pleading piteously, he released one, and turned his face to hers, which was trying its best to look angry, though a soft, tender look was in her eye, in despite, and a tremor on the lip; but a smile went playing with the roses on her cheek and Titus took courage.
               "Bernice, speak earnestly. I fear an uncouth boy,  forever tied to his mother's girdle here in the hills, has little chance for the favor of a proud girl like thee. Thou wilt be a stately princess—while I may be but as I am—a soldier's son, a peasant loon."
               "Then if Titus, the peasant, may not sit in princes' seats, Bernice, the princess, can be a peasant girl, and we will sing our 'harvest-home' together, and tend our flocks in yonder vale."
               "Darling, of all the sweet thoughts that ever covied in thy heart and took wing from thy pretty lips, that is to me the noblest, sweetest, best. But the boy, with his life all  thine, can, must, will be great!"
               "If Titus were less himself, he would still be great—being himself in full measure, he is more than great; he is good, noble—I—"
               
               "Oh, little flatterer! but go on with thy—"
               "I think we had better go to thy mother."
               "Is that the sequel to so fair a beginning?"
               "No, but—"
               "No, but—I interrupted thee, and by way of revenge for my impudence, thou makest me pay a dear penalty, and wilt rob me of sweeter moments than we shall have up yonder. Stay—"
               "I see thy mother crossing the stile—she has seen that horse of thine browsing, and comes impatient to see her son. Let us meet her."
               Very carefully the boy-lover did the gallant, removing  the stones from her descending path, and other obstructions,  as though she had not ascended without his assistance.  At the branch he enlarged on her inability to cross, until he should fix stepping-stones, which she permitted him to do to his contents a sly twinkle in her eye all the while.
               When the work was completed, satisfactorily to himself, he held out his hand to lead her across. What was his chagrin to see her pass him with laugh and skip, clearing the whole with a bound, and dancing off to meet his mother, before he could recover from his amazement.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIII.
               CASTLE CRAG.
               TITUS rode often to visit the king at Mountain Villa. One evening he returned with such accounts of his friend's condition that Bernice vowed she would go to her uncle. To resolve, with her, was to do.
               Mother Antonio being indisposed, Domitia undertook her chaperonage. A guard, which Titus somehow had at his disposal, was ready the next day to escort them. It was impossible to use any kind of vehicle; and the ladies, with their maids, were mounted on palfreys and placed in the middle of the escort.
               Before the day had fairly sprung from its lair and shaken off the dews, the party was in motion; but the ladies were too closely veiled to enjoy the sweetest of all rides—a  gallop while the early morn is balmy with sweet odors, and  all things are fresh and new.
               Bernice had very little idea of submitting to decorum, so far from court society, and did not in the least intend to be deprived of the rich scenery that had given such  delight to Titus and his companions; so she tossed back her veil, and went into raptures over it like any modern  enthusiast. She did not forget either to be exceedingly alarmed occasionally—to play off airs and graces in mounting and dismounting, and tried the dangerous experiment of seeing how much trouble she could be to those who loved her, without giving offence.
               Domitia knew the passes and chose her own dining-camp.  She ordered the procession to halt on the brow of a grassy ledge. Off to the northwest lay the vineyards of Campagna, hazy in the distance. On the right arose a precipice, whose broad gray face was scarred with many a cavernous fissure, from one of which leaped the stream  beside which Domitia caused a collation to be spread.
               October was beginning to mix rose-tint and yellow with the dark-green foliage, which in that region never changed to the brown and bare. Evergreen, hardy as the mountain stone, made the principal feature in the landscape.
               The sky was very clear and blue. The sea afar off was glassy and still. A light cloud lay over Vesuvius, occasionally  shifting its form. The breeze was chambered among the pine-tops below, and did not stir the lightest plume in  Bernice's cap as she and Domitia moved away from the crowd and joined Titus behind an angle of the precipice. Titus led them a few steps, and then began to ascend a rugged and almost perpendicular path, that admitted only one at a time. Winding about and changing their course every few steps, wearied and breathless, they at length arrived at a point far above their little camp.
               The first feature that caught their gaze was what they had come in search of. Far to the northeast, a collection of fortified towers pierced into the clouds—man's addition to God's eternal masonry. There were clouds beneath and above the castellated walls, giving them the appearance of a phantom-structure that might dissolve as one gazed upon it.
               The travellers looked upon Castle Crag. If Bernice had any fears, knowing herself to be among the very scenes to which rumor gave such notoriety, she did not betray any.
               Domitia, too, seemed as free from apprehension of  danger as though she sat on her own home-hearth. She would have trusted herself as well in the far-off walls of Castle Crag. Why?
               Titus and Bernice could have lingered there forever, but their stay must be bounded by one little hour,—the hour given to the cavalcade below for nourishment and rest. It was more than half gone. A few steps farther to the northeast showed them the Villa of Romanus, on a bench of the same ridge, nearer and lower down, and something farther from the sky than Castle Crag. Domitia and Titus had left strict orders for the domestics not to move from the encampment until they returned, but did not permit any of them to know the route they had taken, or its object. They would have been amazed at their mistress' temerity, and when she returned did not dream of the  perilous tour she had made, they deeming safety nowhere in that region but with the guards.
               It was nearly dark when Bernice was ushered into her uncle's presence, and found that he did not know her. Nothing could exorcise the spirit of apprehension that overcame her at this state of things.
               She thought he would die in that wild place, with no kindred to close his eyes but herself, and how could she shroud his face and take him back to his adoring sister with the light gone out of his dark, loving eyes. This was the burden of her moanings; and as Domitia and Titus must return the day next to the morrow of their arrival, she felt even more desolate at the thought until they agreed to stay yet some days longer, and by that time, one fine morning, Claudia, the younger lady of the household, came to her with the joyful tidings of his sanity.
               Domitia and Titus then left for Valley Villa, and  Bernice and Claudia tended the king in his convalescence, until assured of his safety, he reminded her of the  propriety of returning to her matron.
               It was agreed to await the accustomed visit of Titus, and on the evening of his expected arrival the two maidens, who had become fast friends, spent the time together  wandering about the premises with arms interlaced, when it occurred to them to visit the place of the king's catastrophe;  accordingly they strolled through the open portal of the low stone wall overlaced with vines and trees that enclosed garden and yard.
               They went on and perched themselves on the terrace above where the king had fallen, laughing and teasing each other, chattering, as maidens will do, of what they had seen, and heard, and done, indulging in badinage and gossip, until an old woman, chanting a Hebrew melody, came in sight. Claudia calling to her, she came good-naturedly, and humped herself on the wall beside them, resting her sharp bare elbows on her knees and her bronzed face on her long claw-like hands, her keen black eyes flashing from one to the other.
               She wore a short red cloak over a gown of dark blue stuff, scant and short, showing ankles and feet perfectly bare. Across her head was folded a napkin, once white.
               "Mother Hannah, come up to the Villa and read the stars for us to-night," said Claudia.
               "I have no need to wait for night, damsel; the stars are visible to me at noonday as well. They have already spoken of thee and thine."
               "But, good Hannah, thou makest them tell such tales! How am I to believe that I shall wear a queen's diadem, and that, though I am to live long upon the earth, my children will never know my name?—for thou hast promised at least one dusky-eyed nursling," said Claudia, laughing.
               "What I have said the stars will not gainsay. Beware of the last of the Asmoneans!"
               "The Asmoneans? who are they?"
               "A race of kings! Thou shalt not be childless, yet thy Husband shall be the last of his race."
               The old woman's eyes had been playing upon a bracelet that Bernice wore upon her arm above the elbow, and her thought seemed divided as she concluded the last sentence, and, without waiting for reply from Claudia, addressed herself to Bernice.
               "If thou wilt lay that bracelet—that hath a jewel warmed by the blood of thy heart—in my palm, and the while gaze into my eyes, I will read the fates for thee also, damsel!"
               Bernice, heartily amused, complied, but experienced  considerable difficulty in fixings her mirthful eyes on the old crone's.
               The two were motionless for a time, when old Hannah, looking perplexed, but without withdrawing her eyes,  muttered,—"The picture is bleared; the lines tangled."
               Bernice could hold still no longer; nor would she listen to Hannah, who pleaded for another trial.
               "Then tell us what thou didst see, good Hannah," said Claudia; "thou didst surely make out something!"
               "I made out nothing clearly but this, that your fates mingle, and your two crowns were, in glory, different. Thine made obeisance to hers—and hers, that far  outshone thine, lay empty on the seat of a mighty throne where a mighty monarch sat, turning his eyes lovingly on his unthroned queen." The merriment occasioned by this wonderful reading of the fates had not subsided, when Titus flung himself from his panting horse and approached, joining in the laughter when informed of the meaningless answer of the oracle.
               The old lady, highly incensed, left them, and they  returned to the house. When undressing for the night,  Bernice missed her bracelet; the old woman had not returned it to her.
               Claudia assured her that old Hannah was honest, and would account for the bracelet; that she had perhaps  forgotten to return it; she would, at any rate, demand it of her when she came again.
               Bernice said she had no regard for the bracelet; but it contained the seal of her uncle, her aunt's husband, who had charged her to keep it for love of him.
               When Titus was informed of the morrow's programme, his joy overflowed in many extravagances. Claudia was to accompany Bernice with Alena, whom she called aunt.
               On account of certain teasing, owing to Titus's  unsophisticated way of exposing his preferences, Bernice withdrew herself from his society, and paid attention to the regards of a young gallant of the country belonging to Titus's guard, who had occasionally made a visit to Mountain Villa: this evidently threw Titus into a rage of jealousy, and made him very miserable; though he, in turn, managed  to make himself very agreeable to Claudia; and as they were obliged to wait at Mountain Villa until Titus could send for a guard, one day was spent in seeming  hilarity, while, as in many other cases, the flowers were only wreathing thorns. The foolishness of the hearts of these two tore from their lives a day that might have been filled up with the sweets of "love's young dream."
               Bernice found herself so far displeased with flirting that she persisted in being entirely silent during the ride home, and sat her horse as stiffly as though she were the veiled statue of Decorum itself.
               At the halt for the noontide meal, Titus managed to catch her eye, and crowding a world of reproof and love in his glance, her lip quivered, but her veil quickly hid every other emotion, and the ride was completed as it was begun.
               Mother Antonia was the first to meet them at the  portico. With true affection she advanced to Bernice, but something in the appearance of Claudia arrested her, and she stared with wild eyes upon the wondering girl, so that Bernice's embrace was unheeded.
               Bernice and Claudia occupied the chamber with Mother Antonia, for the young friends would not be separated: and while they lay, with arms interlocked, in the sweet sleep of peace and innocence, Antonia stood above them peering into the face of Claudia, occasionally sighing and ejaculating fragments of prayer. She would turn away as if to approach her own couch, and then, seemingly unsatisfied,  return and look again, with a bewildered, musing air, stroking the young girl's hair back from her temples and examining even the "pearl-round ear" with deep scrutiny. What was there about Claudia, the mountain girl, to  interest one of the line of Cæsar? This woman Antonia was the wretched Agrippina, the miserable mother whom Nero supposed he had caused to be murdered two years before. Only three persons in all the wide empire she had once swayed knew that she had escaped death, and that another had suffered in her stead, whose body lay in the Sepulchre of Kings as the mother of Nero.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIV.
               CLAUDIA.
               
                  
                     
                        "'T was only while I slept;
                        The angels did not vanish until now."
                     
                  
               
               EXCUSE us, reader; we must go back a little in the history of the king's convalescence at Mountain Villa. The chamber in which he found himself when awaking from delirium deserves description. It was luxurious in its Grecian finish and appointments. It was hung with silk tapestry the color of amber, and wrought with scenes from heathen myths. The ceiling was of blue silk, drawn from the four sides into a centre of radiating folds, from which a cluster of lamps was suspended, with heavy gold and crystal Pendants. Statuettes filled niches between marble pillars that were statues themselves in bas-relief, figures on high pedestals supporting the hangings. Blue porphyry caryatides upheld the arches over doors and windows.
               Kneeling nymphs, in one corner, stretched out their palms under a marble laver or basin, while silver pitchers for holding water rested on the upturned hand of each. In the same manner was supported a silver table near the lamp, on which were piled MSS. and pictures.
               The canopied couch was covered with a garment of rich. purple silk, heavy with embroidery. The floor was soft with tufted matting of many hues.
               The one door-like casement was curtained with fine white linen drawn back over hooks of silver.
               Outside the casement tumbled the cascade, so near that its spray spurted almost into the room. The casement faced the precipice, and the acclivity of the ground here was so great that the apartments beneath were all underground,  bringing the casement so low that one or two steps sufficed to reach the balustered pave below, and the sward that was always damp from the mist of the broken waters settling upon it like dew.
               When Agrippa awoke from delirium and found all this beauty about him, he thought it another of his wild dreams, and lay a long time musing if it were real. It was early morning, and the king saw a female in light-blue robe, with a yellow scarf thrown over her head, pass the casement, and proceed to fill a basin at the little spout of the tank.
               She turned full round, and Agrippa recognized the face of his dreams. She came, with a free step, and easy grace, up the steps, and crossed the low sill of the lattice.
               He lay still in the shadow of the dark-blue curtains looped about the coach, fearful that the vision would  dissolve like a dream of the morning.
               She came close to him, and bent down to look into his eves, which were closed in a trice as he divined her  intention. Very gently she removed the bandages about his head, dipped a clean white cloth in the pure water, and softly, deftly laved his fevered wounds. Then wiping them dry, she applied ointment from an alabaster box on the table. She swathed his head in clean cloths, went out, refilled the basin, and returned; then dipping her own soft palms in the cool fluid, passed them over his face again and again, until he was almost constrained to open his eyes and bless her. His eyes did open, but, with strong self-control, put on the seeming of unconsciousness and languor, except when in moving about the room her face was turned from him.
               This could not last. She stooped above him to look into his eyes once more, one soft hand nestling upon his temple, while the other swept back a flood of golden light—that had fallen around her own face as she bent—to keep it from shadowing his.
               She started back at the intense consciousness that broke over every lineament of his face.
               He raised his thin hand and laid it upon hers, that had  rested for a moment on his pillow. She withdrew it,  saying,—
               "Thou art better, I am sure; and I will go and bring thee a better nurse."
               "Nay, do not leave me. Where am I?"
               "Be content. Thy friend is out seeking herbs of the mountains for thine ailments, and thy niece is here, who will come to thee."
               Gathering the bandages into a light basket, and replacing  the ointment, she turned, with a smile, to the king, and went out through the door, her faint footfalls pattering softly adown the hall, "like blessings taking their flight;" so, doubtless, thought the king.
               Bernice came soon, with her tender love and new-born joy at finding herself recognized once more.
               Titus and his mother, who were there, were more  cautious, and did not disturb the invalid with their presence until the next day, when he was better able to see them.
               Bernice flitted about her uncle's room, made his  nostrums, but when his wounds needed dressing, she would not dare to touch them with her heedless fingers, and put the task on Claudia. So the king found the dressing of his wounds a most sweet pain—purchasing her presence.
               Bernice took the first moment in which her uncle was strong enough to listen to her prattle, to explain to him the mystery of that chamber and the courtyard—their being so at variance with old Romanus and his surroundings. But Bernice's explanation only mystified the more. She had been told by the domestics that Claudia had a mother or a sister, or somebody that was kin to her, who came there some year or so before to die; that she was the wife of Romanus's  master, or Romanus himself, they did not know which; any way, that Claudia loved her, and that she died and was buried in a sepulchre in the face of the cliff, which had marble statues of Piety and Penitence upholding the entablature  above a plain face of marble, on which was cut the word "Rest," and nothing more.
               Bernice also gathered that Claudia had been at Mountain  Villa about seven years—much longer than the lady who was dead; and that whoever had brought her there had caused the room and the court to be arranged for Claudia's own use and pleasure; that she had had masters  to give her every accomplishment, and an old physician  who loved her better than his life—the same that tended on Agrippa himself.
               Alexis had said that one of the mountaineers had told him that the room and inner court had been constructed to please the young wife of old Romanus, who had come from Greece with all her Grecian tastes about her, and had tortured the rich old fool until he brought about her something of her native surroundings; that he had been forced to fly from the haunts of men on account of some crime committed, and did not wish to immolate her without some recompense.
               There were so many versions of the story, that Agrippa concluded that none of them were intended to be believed, and requested his niece to forbear all questions as to  anything she saw, or in relation to their host, or otherwise.
               Alexis laughed at the bare idea of old Romanus possessing  a wife of any taste. He looked more fit to groom such a lady's horses. She sure had strange fancies, to line her nest with eider-down for such a rook to caw in," said Alexis.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XV.
               THE DECLARATION.
               AGRIPPA found many excuses to prolong his stay at Mountain Villa, but none plausible to a man who had come on an errand of mercy for a nation. He had heard nothing from his courier. Time was pressing. The errand that brought him from Jerusalem was in no wise touched upon. He must be doing. But there, on the low stone wall of the garden, was the one woman who could teach the flower of Eden to bloom for him—Claudia, the waif of the mountain—around whom there was certainly a mystery. He did not care who she was, but the curse of royalty was on himself, and he was not his own master,—what tributary sovereign ever was?
               In Rome it was infamy to wed a Jew, and in Jewry Romish blood was a fester and a sore; but Claudia, sitting  on the low wall sketching a view of the grounds, knew nothing of the thoughts that troubled the king. She had come to love "the stranger within the gates." Her heart's-strung pearls had all found their way into his keeping.
               She had seen the warm outpourings of his heart turned back from his lip by some icy after-thought. His lips did not keep pace with the language of his eye. His lips were non-committal. She resolved that her manner should be so. He had asked for a drawing. She would show him that her affections were given to art.
               Determination is a grand master. She astonished  herself. Her fingers moved carefully, turning the nice points with precision, until she had nearly completed the picture, when her fingers relaxed. Her firmness deserted her, and he let the pencil fall, in profound abandonment to her gloomy thoughts.
               The king saw the attitude of grief from the upper terrace,  where he was walking for exercise, and could not forbear  going to her. She covered her face with her hands to avoid the scrutiny he beat upon her, but did not rise.
               He must have guessed something of what was in her mind, for he stood by her side and said,
               "Am I an unconscious offender?"
               It was well done—that smiling disclaimer, and that  self-possessed air with which she met his questioning. But she did not deceive him; though, to angle for her confidence he continued speaking, saying that his mind was a chaos, and he needed her sympathy and counsel. In a pensive tone she bade him tell her in what way her sympathy could serve him—that she dared not think her counsel could.
               Then, while his lip curved as if in scorn of some vulture at the heart, or of some weakness he meant to control, he sat down beside her and said,—"Maiden, when I depart, will the flow of thy sweet life be as calm as when I found it here—a placid stream in these wilds?"
               She did not answer, and he went on,—"So inconsistent are the elements at war within my own bosom, that while I arm myself against myself, it would be rapture to know that thou wilt not forget me—that thou lovest as I love thee."
               Agrippa had no idea of saying so much, but he had said it, and that hour was given to forgetfulness and love.
               Claudia's face reflected the infinite content and animated joy of his.
               The laughing moments danced by gleefully, showering ineffable joys and glory-lit hopes upon the loving and  beloved. Come away; the lamp of reason must be relit; heedless Love left the door ajar, and it has been  extinguished by Passion's blast.
               
               The man remembered not that he was an empty-titled king, whose least act, or word, or look, wrongly taken, would stir up elements to consume his very throne. The woman remembered not who she was or had been—remembered  nothing of the destiny preparing for her by nearly half an empire.
               In suffering herself to love Marcus Aulus,—the name the king wore at Mountain Villa,—she looked upon the future as too uncertain to interfere with her present, too distant to take it in account.
               Claudia was a sensible woman, no love-sick damsel; and had the stranger left the gates without a word or token of requital, she would have borne it, and passed it as only one of the many joys stricken from her life.
               Gayety was not an element of her nature, or, if it were, a habit of sombre thought had extracted it. She was not gloomy, though she had memories that might have made her so. Young as she was, she had learned to feel that this life, could be only a fragment of existence. She had seen and known such things that she could not view this life, so easily tortured, so frail of tenure, but as a vestibule to the great one she had been taught to believe would be lighted by the smile of the gods. She dreamed by night and day of Elysium. She longed, on glory-flecked pinions, to winnow the happy fields with the freed spirits of those who had gone before.
               Claudia's manners were pensive and quiet—not gloomy. There was no evidence of congenial society about her. She never left the mountain, yet was she polished and refined, easy and graceful, and her costumes were all well adapted to the most exacting rules of dame Fashion.
               "Claudia, hast thou ever thought me other than I have confessed to?" said Agrippa, returning to some thought of what he was doing.
               "I have," answered Claudia, emphatically; "and my silly head many times goes dreaming that I have known thee before; but it goes as it comes, mixed with memories that seem dreams also."
               "Only dreams, damsel; for had I ever met aught like thyself, Time had had no power to wrest it from Memory. But thy home—thou hast not drawn this mountain air always? Ah, it may be—for nowhere else couldst thou have caught such graces, except thus near heaven's  habitants,—such pure, untutored thoughts, as have won me within one little month."
               "I would have no secrets from thee, Marcus; but others have theirs involved with mine. I have not always lived here; but ask me no more of that."
               "It hath no import to me. Purity and innocence are thine, and nothing thou holdest right to conceal may be questioned. But leaving no seal upon my own lips except my own will which chooseth no concealment from thee, I admit that Marcus Aulus is no name of mine, but assumed for present protection against the brigands hereabouts, since Fortune has left me stranded on the Lucanian coast."
               "I thought so much," said Claudia; "it is in nowise uncommon. Names seem now of little use except for mere address."
               Claudia was not unmoved. She did not know what effect a name might have upon her joys newly-born.
               "Claudia, thou hast heard me tell of Agrippa,  empty-titled King of Judea?"
               "Yes; and thou didst slander him, terming him a  dwarfish scion of a goodly race. Other tongues do not speak thuswise of him. Now I know that thou art of Jewry, as I suspected when thou didst refuse to join in libation to the gods when Romanus had finished gathering his vintage. Then is Agrippa thy king, and thou hast seen him?—tell me of him."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVI.
               THE ABDUCTION.
               
                  
                     "What! gone without a word?"
                  
               
               WHY, what wouldst know of him?" exclaimed the king in surprise, looking keenly into her eyes; "who speaketh of him to thee?"
               Claudia seemed startled with some memory, and uttered rapidly, as she gazed into his face,—
               "In truth, I have not dreamed only. Thou art, must be, of his race—thou art so like. In truth, tell me, art thou not of his kindred? Ah, I am sure of thee, now that thou frownest; for I have seen him. Tell me quickly, thou art of his race!"
               "Hast thou indeed ever seen Agrippa?"
               "The name Agrippa is as familiar as my foster-mother's cradle-hymn, loved and kept by memory as a talisman of sweet childhood. I have truly seen him. But it was long ago; and had I not had good reason to remember, might have forgotten even his name, or that his eyes were such as thine—his brow so lowering when anything displeased him, as I but just now noted of thine."
               The king seemed casting in his mind what to say, or trying to recall some memory that would not come at his bidding.
               "Damsel, since thou hast such kindly feelings for the man some call King Agrippa, thou wouldst in nowise  betray him, shouldst thou know that thou hast him here in thy toils—at thy feet!"
               The king slid from the low and broken-down wall as he spoke and dropped on one knee, taking and kissing her hand without raising his eyes.
               Seeing that she made no reply, and feeling that her whole frame trembled, he looked up.
               She was looking at him like one frightened, and turned to marble on the instant.
               "Hast thou nothing to say—no welcome for me,  Claudia? How is this? Can it be that this knowledge affects thy love?" said he, rising to his feet, but not relinquishing her hand.
               She at length found words to say,—
               "Nay, nay indeed! I had not dreamed so wild a dream. Since it is so, permit me time to array my thoughts in  fitting words. O king, emotions are not thoughts, and  pardon that I know not what to say."
               "Say only that the knowledge of my name hath none effect upon thy love, and Agrippa will be content to wait what time thou wilt for compliments."
               "I would be most ingrate to permit the great debt of love I owe to thee, as Agrippa, to wait upon the simple loves of a simple maiden's heart."
               "Speak, damsel! tell me what is this thou owest. Surely, Agrippa never before set eyes on thee, and how canst thou owe him aught, except the sweet love I claim as a man, not as a benefactor."
               "Thou rememberest nothing of by-gones—of the things that my more yielding memory has fixed forever; nothing of a child that might have grown to be myself; sometime companion of thy sports—oftener of thy tender care?"  "Only one—a fragile little blossom, whose life went out almost within my arms. I called her my lily-bell. She was a neglected child of Nicholas, the freedman, dying for the companionship of other children. She had been named by the Empress Missalina for my sister, to please my father, and I loved the child if but for her name, for my sister was afar from me, and I took the little child for my nursling as if it had been Bernice."
               Seemingly borne along the current by sad memories, he continued, after a pause,—
               "Ah! well do I remember the summer eve when last I held her poor wasted frame upon my knees. She begged of me a ring—a curious thing, and valued—yet I placed it—a world too large—upon her thin finger, and left it there. When next I asked for the child she was dead."
               "And did the child love thee?" asked Claudia.
               "She did. The poor thing clung to my love as I to hers, for my timely offices had come in rescue of both child and mother from a brutal father's rage.
               "For months I stood between, until the empress, hearing somewhat of the divisions of the freedman's household, came and quelled it, and ever after bade me guard her little favorite.
               "In sooth, it was a poor return for her kindness to his child, that Nicholas should bestir himself to rob the  empress of her husband's love and crown, and lastly—her life. For thou must know, he, presuming on his influence with the emperor, forged an order for her execution on false charges, and she died without a hearing. Oh, pardon that I have caused thy tears to flow. I have too much played the egotist in prating of memories that have no  interest for thee."
               Claudia was weeping, but Agrippa did not see the  picture his words had repainted on her mind, cut into her heart, which made her unable to reply to his tender  regrets that he had caused her tears to flow.
               "Claudia, damsel, thou art soul of my soul, spirit of my spirit. I would forsake the principalities of my fathers—  lay down the mimic of a crown I wear, for thee. Speak!  thou knowest my heart, maiden!"
               Claudia had ceased sweeping, but could not speak, though she turned her eyes once upon the king and let them fall again, clutching her fingers together until the blood left them.
               Agrippa again spoke:—
               "Come, let us go to thy friends. It were vile to drink the sweetness of thy love like a thief."
               "King Agrippa, thou dost forget thy duties. We must make our wills attendant on thy nation's weal. Leave me to my dangers and my nameless life."
               "Nameless! nameless!—then will I give thee a name," exclaimed Agrippa, at fault as to Claudia's meaning, "I will take thee where none may dare question thy name, or taunt thee with shame."
               "Shame! shame!—I tell thee there is no shame! the name of my house is lawful and true!—great as any of the line of Cæsar!—Nay, not shame! Think not that, King Agrippa!"
               The temper of a terrible race had been stricken upon; the hot blood spurted to Claudia's face; her form dilated, and every nerve quivered with indignation; but then, as softer feeling came over her, tears gushed into her eyes and she said, tremulously,—
               "I am without a name here, and dare not wear the patronymic  of my house, only that I may escape the dangers attendant upon it."
               Agrippa once more sat him down on the wall beside Claudia and took her hand.
               "Thou speakest of danger to thee and thine. Is there not compass in my poor kingdom to shelter thee?"
               "Oh, king, I have been forgetful. It may be that I may some day need both the shelter of thy kingdom and thy kindness, but now, I cannot tell. At present Fate hath an interdict."
               
               "The moment then that Fate lifteth her interdict, oh, Claudia, let a swift messenger post to Agrippa on his lonely waiting throne. Until then, I, poor mariner on a troubled sea, will count the strokes of Time's oars by the messages of love I claim from thee."
               "I know not. These times are evil, and Trust a jewel not to be committed to the keeping of many. I know not as to messages."
               "Leave that to me. I have fast friends in Rome and Brundusium, who will joy to guard my mountain treasure, and transmit the 'life-drops,' which sure thy messages will be to me. If nothing more, scribe, 'Marcus, I love thee,' and send it; for since it must be so, I will be  Marcus until I can be Agrippa. I must leave thee not many days hence, but I will talk to thee again on the morrow; now the sun declineth, and the dew is already in thy hair. Let me take thy forsaken scroll and thine inks, and thou canst finish thy work when the sun is in the south to-morrow,  and his light falleth more directly on the scene. Come."
               Alexis was still absent, having gone over to visit Titus, and the bedtime hour failed to bring his return.
               Agrippa, in the solitude of his chamber, which Claudia had resigned to his use, sat musing by the shut casement through which the moonbeams sifted upon his face. His elbow rested on the caryatid that supported the window's arch. In deep thought he was until a servant entered with his usual night-draught, for he was not yet well enough to resign certain physickings.
               The servant also brought a goblet of wine, and eyed Agrippa enviously while he drank it—insomuch that the king drank only half, offering him the rest; but the a man heartily refused, insisting, that as an invalid he needed the whole, and would not depart until the king finished the goblet.
               Agrippa's mind was rich with delicious dreams,  notwithstanding he had scarcely stretched himself upon his couch when his sweet fancies yielded to most unwonted drowsiness.
               The morning was awake. Agrippa's garments hung on the foot of a tenantless couch. His cap lay on the table. On the outside of the casement were prints of many feet in the damp sward about the cascade. The footprints were around the cascade, and close to the unbroken and perpendicular wall of the precipice, but were not to be seen elsewhere. Where was the king?
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVII.
               SIMON MAGUS.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "There on that throne, to which the blind belief
                           Of millions raised him, sat the Prophet Chief,
                           The great Mokanna."
                        
                     
                     —MOORE.
                  
               
               DURING the reign of Claudius, a strange character appeared in the Roman empire, an astrologer from Samaria, a man of wonderful abilities, who, not rejecting Christ, yet claimed to be something greater, to which Christ was only the shadow. He had numerous followers. Nearly all Samaria turned to him as the Messiah, and the provinces of Italy were filled with his proselytes. He had been a baptized Christian, but apostatized when he could not  purchase from Paul and Peter the power to cast out devils and restore life. He then engaged his sorceries to work for himself a power and reputation that caused him to be looked upon as little less than a god. Whether natural or artificial, he wore long, flowing, white hair, his exceedingly white face at times appearing of porcelain lustre, strangely contrasting with eyes darker than original chaos, sunken and glittering.
               He died at length, leaving a prophecy that he would appear again to men. Accordingly, some time about the fourth year of Nero, he arose from his sepulchre, the same, except that his hair was more silvery and had a sheen upon it.
               In this, his new life, he acquired a strange ascendancy over Nero, exerting his power for good as far as was known, saving much Roman blood destined to flow in the shambles;  but his influence failed to save Agrippina, the tyrant's rant's own mother, from his butchery—came too late to wrest the Empress Octavia from the horrors of  Pandataria.
               Nero feared Magus, and though he thought not of believing  in his pretensions, he gave him a wide berth—permitted  his worship to those who would, and even caused his statue in the Tiber to be respected.
               Magus generally appeared in the principal cities, riding in a canopied chariot overspread with gold, and drawn by a score of coal-black horses, covered with black cloth  emblazed in curious devices. By his side reclined a woman, beautiful as the Orient, whom he declared to be the creation  of his own thought—his first ideal conception—little lower than the angels.
               Sometimes at night he was seen in a phantom-like  chariot or pavilion, floating in the air, seen oftenest by the light of blazing cities. He was everywhere. He penetrated  hall, hovel, and palace at all hours. Bars and bolts were useless things against him. Sentinels met him on their lonely rounds; fair ladies encountered him in their sequestered bowers; solitary students, deeming themselves alone, saw him start up beside them. He glided by sleepless  coaches, seen by the pale, sickly light that encircled his form. Midnight was his favorite hour. Those who sought him, and were permitted an audience, were blind-folded  and carried off, sometimes journeying several nights and days, and on the bandage being removed, a scene of garishness burst in bewildering splendor upon their astonished senses.
               He usually gave audience in a spacious cavern, its walls of pure stalactite pillars standing out in groups like  statuary; the ceiling pendent with the same, whose pointed ends supported lamps, a hundred in number, that lit a blaze on every angle and point of the uneven stalactites around and above.
               
               On a throne of blazing gold appeared Magus, robed in a black gown covered with squares, spheres, crescents, and stars, the color and sheen of yellow flame. On his head a semblance of the sun was made to scintillate. By his side reclined the woman, a shining crescent upon her brow, her long, straight, dark hair sparkling over her shoulders, with tiny brilliants showered upon it thick as hoar-frost, fastened there by some weird spell perhaps. "A sadness  as of the soul's sickness" was couched in the moist light of her hazel eyes. A listlessness hung about her not to be mistaken. She had no joy in the pageantries she graced.
               There spells were cast, and every machinery of the  necromancer's art set in play to dupe and frighten, or force obedience, all tending to increase the magician's influence and power.
               He was permitted by Nero to occupy the underground vaults of the Lupercal. Why he chose to do so was a mystery. There a messenger from Nero found him some weeks after the disappearance of Agrippa from the Villa of Romanus.
               He was accustomed to demand that the emperor should come to him; but in the present instance he sent the  messenger before to announce his own visit to the Imperial Palace, where he appeared near the emperor's private  audience-chamber without usher or herald. Indeed, no one had seen him pass, though the outlets were double-locked and trebly guarded.
               Entering, enveloped in a long black stole, he announced himself, the sentinel being spellbound at the door, or so imagined himself.
               The emperor arose with a profane burst of surprise on his lips, but presented Titus, the only occupant of the room beside himself, to the strange man, whose deep-set eyes and tinselly hair looked most unnatural, most unearthly, under the black cone-shaped cap. The flesh of his face looked hard and cold, protruding over his eyes until nearly all but the glitter was lost in hollow depths.
               Titus had come, after weeks of unavailing search, to lay the matter of the king's disappearance before Nero.
               As may be judged, no courier had ever been to Rome. Alexis had not been seen since he left Valley Villa to join the king on the evening of his disappearance.
               Nero did not know what to do. He sent for Magus, believing that by his powers of magic he might at least ascertain his favorite's whereabouts. He had used him for like purposes before. Without mentioning names, the matter  was unfolded to the astrologer; but he utterly refused to do anything unless the name was confided to him, also the personal appearance of the missing one.
               The emperor and Titus could not know why the old  astrologer's frame quivered so,—quivered, tertian-like, when that name was spoken,—nor why his voice forgot its  hollowness, its sepulchral tones, and put on human tremulousness,  when, rising to retire, he spoke, after many moments of silence—perhaps half an hour—which none had dared break upon:—
               "At the third watch of the morrow's night, send to the tombs beneath the Palatine; I will be there."
               He went as he came, and Nero dismissed Titus for the night. At the time appointed, Titus, alone, went to the tombs at the instigation of Nero. He had no faith himself  in such contemptible trickeries. The scrip he found beneath a lamp in the tomb designated, told him no more than he believed, that Agrippa was in the hands of Ansermo. Magus was not there. The tenor of his note, was, however, sufficient. The astrologer knew what was required. He would manage negotiations for the king's release. Nero had once tried a siege against Castle Crag and failed. He did not care to struggle with a power that sometimes crossed him, but not sufficiently to make it formidable.
               The negotiations, after some days, resulted in a demand for too heavy a ransom, and a consequent refusal outright on the part of Nero; not that he intended to desert his favorite, but he hoped to lessen the demand. He was making additions to his superb country-house to please Poppœa, and he needed already another pressure on the people to meet the expense; but, in the meantime, he sent a strong guard to escort Bernice to Rome. She and her governess had apartments in the Numa Palace assigned them.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               MONA.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Whatsoe'er thy birth,
                           Thou art a beautiful thought,
                           And softly bodied forth."
                        
                     
                     —BYRON.
                  
               
               THE face of Mona—the name itself another name for sweetness—was of such fairness as to recall one's youthful idea of angels.
               Her straight brown hair knew no curl or wave, yet it looked as though it might dissolve in liquid glory about her beautiful head. Her eyes were dark-brown, light hazel-gray,  as the spirit painted them with sorrow, joy, or the brilliance of enthusiasm.
               The first sorrow that frightened joy from her heart and brought unaccustomed sadness into her soft eyes, need not be told as yet. The next was when her mother's face was shut from her eager eyes by the dark pall, and she, even in that hour of bereavement, was led by strange hands from the door of a low cot that had sheltered her and her mother only a few weeks.
               Children's sorrows pass as the fleece-cloud over the moon's face on a fair night. The moment that gave little Mona a playmate in the shape of a chubby boy near her own age, dried her tears and brought smiles to her  child-face.
               The boy Julius was son to her who trained them both—a gentle, passive, neglected, but loving wife to him who was only stepsire to her boy.
               In a lovely region of Samaria, the boy and girl grew in an atmosphere rich with the life-principle. No wonder both developed exceeding beauty.
               Untrammelled as the birds, but not as untaught, they mingled their lives, sympathies, pursuits. If one little head was bowed in sorrow, the other bent near until the boy's dark hair mingled with her light curls. Curls? Yes. 'Twas in after-years that the rings, untwisted, fell in a stream of auburn light, then grew duskier as her form rounded to womanhood.
               She, the pale quiet woman who loved them both, died, and left them to be trained by other hands for life-duties, just as the soft fluxtuous tendrils of their affections and aspirations needed direction and support.
               The children were not separated. The ample means of their stepfather provided facilities for learning as well as the lighter accomplishments of the day; the boy's nature becoming touched with the softer tints that colored the maiden's; while her mind quickened and was invigorated by contact with the manlier graces of his mental action.
               No one knew from whence the man had brought the girl. He claimed her as his own kindred, but people were incredulous—shook their beads, as they do nowadays at such uncertainties. Even the wife went down to the grave believing—ah, it matters not what—since she received and loved her.
               One incident may illustrate the "all in all" which the boy and girl were to each other. Soon after the death of his wife, the father took Julius with him to Jerusalem. At first he enjoyed it as a gala-day, thinking of the wonders he would have to impart to Mona on his return. Then he became restless, longing for that return; but his father heeded not his pleadings, still prolonging his stay  indefinitely. The boy made a desperate resolve to go alone, and started without any warning to his father.
               So long as he kept the high-road, he found it easy enough, begging his way on foot; sometimes so happy as to get a charitable lift on some countryman's plodding donkey. But when he left the main road, he found no one who knew anything of the obscure town of Gittem, in Samaria.
               The setting sun glinted pityingly on the bowed head of a weary child sitting on a stone by the roadside, weeping. He thought of his dead mother, and his sobs broke more wildly, in the lone darkening woods that shut around him. He had not seen house or habitation for miles. What should he do in the woods alone, weary, and sick with gnawing hunger? He could as well go on as find his way back through the devious paths he had trodden.
               A cheerful whistle sounded near him, and a boy driving goats emerged from a by-path. Seeing the lone child weeping as if his heart would break, and vainly wiping his eyes, he went up to him to learn of the poor forlorn's troubles. Upon being told in many a broken sob, he  proffered that Julius should help drive his goats home, and "mother would set the matter right."
               So Julius soon had a shelter, and a warm motherly heart to pour his griefs into; but, to the surprise of her own "hopeful," she knew nothing whatever of Gittem; though she knew a man who did know, if anybody did,—which was taken as a full equivalent for the actual  knowledge by her own admiring son.
               Julius ate his supper of goat's-milk, brown bread, and honey with infinite relish, and soon fell asleep on the bosom of Hope.
               True to her promise, the widow accompanied Julius to the old man's hut under the hill, before the sun had fairly appeared above its crest.
               The eye of every chance visitor to that cot was arrested by a grave on one side, rather back, overhung by a fruit-tree  growing from a fissure in a rock jutting from the hillside side. A white-rose tree stood at the headstone. The whole grave was dotted with star-flowers, whose cups held each a tear shed by some spirit of the night over the lone one sleeping there.
               Julius, in rehearsing his story, mentioned his  foster-sister's name.
               "Mona! Mona!" said the man. "Martha, that minds me of the little cherub we had here once." Then turning to the widow, explained,—
               "Its mother lies outside, poor thing, in the grave yonder. She was on her way to some place I forget; but she could not go on. The man that left her here, it may be, did not think she would die so soon. He left plenty to keep her well until he should come again; but he never came until we had shrouded her. Then he took the child, while its two great brown eyes were streaming upon its pretty  pinafore—such great drops of child-sorrow I never saw.
               Julius remembered well the coming of Mona to his step-father's  roof, and the moaning of the child for its mother; but he somehow chose to keep it to himself. The woman, Martha, rummaging in a chest of drawers, produced a set of shoulder-knots, which, she said, belonged to the lady, "and would have been given to the man, but in his hurry we forgot everything but the child's sorrow," said she,  apologetically.
               "I tell Martha," said the man, "that I never look  outside there but I think about lost jewels—like as if some king had passed by carelessly, and dropped what he, maybe,  misses, but does not know where to find. I wonder whence she came, with her tender bits of hands, and great blue eyes always wet and shady-like. I think of them when I look down in that deep well yonder where the alders grow. The branches part away just above and let in the blue sky; that's why I think of her eyes."
               Julius gathered some of the fresh star-flowers in a posy for Mona, thinking his own thoughts, but giving them no expression. The taunts cast upon Mona by her playmate regarding her origin had sunk into his heart, young as he was, and he would not speak of it to strangers.
               The widow taught him to bind wet earth about the flowers, and gave a tiny twig-basket to carry them in; for the kind man was going to take him home on his own jennet,  and so, provisioned for a couple of days, they set off.
               The sun was yet high, when, reaching a point recognized by Julius, the man let him jump from the jennet, and he went bounding away like a young roe over the hills. Soon he was in his father's grounds.
               He chose to enter by the garden, hoping to find Mona there feeding her birds; but, instead, a loud wailing reached him, coming from an upper room of the dwelling. He went on wings, for he knew Mona's voice. The matron had confined her for misdemeanor, and the servant-maid refusing to yield the key, he planted a couple of sturdy fists in her face that floored her. He took the key, with which he undid the cage and let the bird loose. The two sat that evening on the door-step.
               "Oh, Mona, try to think—remember something—do, Mona."
               And Mona, to oblige him, set her thoughts to running back. Her face lit up gladly.
               "Oh, yes! there was a tree all covered with blossoms on a high rock. I could not forget them—the blossoms; they covered my mother with them."
               "It is there yet, Mona; I have seen it."
               "Oh, Julius! hast thou? and thou hast brought the blossoms! Hast thou been all over the world? It must be a long way to where mamma died. I thought the  journey would never end; I got so hungry and sore."
               For the first time Julius noticed Mona's necklace, and thought it bore resemblance to the shoulder-knots he had seen. The necklace was magnificently rich, and could not have been purchased with less than a princely income.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIX.
               TREACHERY.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Hands clasped, they passed beyond the gate;
                           They parted, at the last, with tears
                           And kisses,—she, to watch and wait,
                           And he, to curse the lingering years."
                        
                     
                     —GARDETTE.
                  
               
               TWO little heads were put together—two hands were clasped—two grieving hearts were planning to avert the consequences of their father's wrath at his stepson's hegira from Jerusalem, as well as his having given the maid-servant's cheek its blue and black rotundity,—he was doomed to receive a flogging on the morrow.
               The twain sat blubbering away the hours, seated on a mat in their study-room, until Mona's eyes brightened through her tears with some happy thought.
               "Julius, we can go to the good people who take care of my mother's grave."
               "What? run away, Mona?"
               "Thou needest not call it that way; but when the nurse sends us to bed, we can slip out. I shall not be afraid in the dark with thee. Couldst thou be sure to find the way, Julius?"
               "Oh, yes; I know the way, and I could carry thee over the rough places," said Julius, fully resolved on the course suggested.
               A little more chat on the subject resulted in a plan that Julius should slip from his window, after the house was still, and come to her lattice, where she would be watching for him, wide awake. This was done, with the exception of finding Mona awake. She had snubbed to sleep, and Julius had much ado to arouse her.
               The orphans went out in the darkness, picking their way warily—a little-bundle of things for both on the boy's arm. It was not the only or last time they were fugitives together, though their wanderings on this night ranged not so  extensively as—But no matter now. Both became weary and sleepy in less than an hour, and next morning were found in each other's arms by the way—she with her head upon his bosom. His hands held the cloak that was drawn over her head to protect her from the night air, as he had seen his mother do.
               The father was disarmed of all intent to punish the boy by the sweetness of the picture he saw—if, indeed, he had ever contemplated it.
               The man was young, but manifested no desire to bring a new wife to his home, if home it might be called, where he came only at long intervals. He was busy with the world somewhere, and soon went away for a long time, leaving the children in charge of the boy's aunt.
               When he came again it wats to take Julius to Rome, to the schools of the Philosophers. It was a bitter parting, and years passed on before Julius returned with scholastic honors thick upon him. Then he only came to drink health from the pure cisterns of his native air awhile, and go out again as a man in the arena of life. Then he said to Mona,—
               "If I cannot read my praises in thine eyes, nor hear them from thy lips, what doth it matter that I earn them? or why should I wrestle for riches or glory, if I have not thee to share them? I think thy years will justify me in taking thee to wife. Speak, Mona."
               They were on the path they had trodden in childhood, by the bank where they had once been gathered into each other's arms, and Mona, looking thereon, would have called him—brother; but looking up into the dark-violet eyes of Julius, she felt the title had not the true meaning, and was about to answer according to the prompting of her heart, when she saw the stepfather of Julius in the path, confronting them with a look of intense fury; then, as if some terrible passion had been forced back by the might of a strong will, he compressed his white lips, and passed on without a word, leaving Julius and Mona defiant in each other's arms; for each had been impressed that some danger or harm threatened, and simultaneously sought to protect each other.
               That close embrace, born of peril's seeming, was graceful, usher to betrothal. Danger, or surmise of danger, uses keen rowels to spur the tongue; and lips grow fluent that else were untaught of eloquence.
               "Thou art master of thine own fortunes, and carver of thine own dignities. If thou wilt yield to no will of mine in this, at least stay thine impatience until thou canst take thy bride to Rome."
               This was the sole reply of his father to Julius's demand for Mona coupled with the avowal that he would give way to no unreasonable opposition. The mild reply abashed Julius; for, by the appearance of his father when he faced them on the path, he had expected opposition, if not  peremptory refusal.
               Julius therefore began an apology for his own abruptness;  but the wave of his father's hand to be left alone was so imperative, that he let the words of courtesy die on his lips, and went out.
               The stepfather was slightly ghastly; but it might have been from the fumes arising from several crucibles that were blubbering on a small furnace.
               As his stepson left the laboratory, the eyes of the man followed him. Those were no common eyes, and were lit by no ordinary expression as his full lips muttered,—
               "Ah, how long I wait!" but now must come the turn of the tide—the fruition that has so long hung ready to fall, but falling not. She tarries at Cæsarea. I will see her. This love of dignities—this pride of ancestry—may the gods, if there are any, sink it to their own Tartarus. Yet will I not forget my vow."
               He turned to his crucibles, stirring them well, and then, drinking off a bumper of Falernian, which he had all the while held in his hand, set the cup down, and approaching a mirror, threw back a mass of wavy darkness from his brow, saying,—
               "Ah, this face has a look of the courtier yet; but this hair—hot brain-fires have dried up the moisture that should give it hue. It is flecked like unto some laggard raven's wing overtaken by the first snows of winter; yet am I in the summer of life, almost over, but still summer—  shortened, perhaps, by the tourniquet turns given this poor brain. My heart, with nothing to batten on but poor prison-fare,  has been barred from this life I have led, barred from all but this one aim—one hope; but now must be  something more than hope, or, O Bernice! nothing henceforth.
               "Crime! Can the crime over which we stumble in our way, and which the heart so loathes, call for vengeance? I have marked my course, and these things come between; yet I feel appalled with these hydra-headed obstructions. Crime accumulates on crime. His daughter!—the  daughter of my rival of an hour! I have a use for thee, Mona; yet must the boy be allowed some play. He must go—with his hopes full-flushing—so he does but go."
               The man threw himself upon a couch at hand, pressed his hand over his brow and eyes, and was soon lost in deep musing.
               
               Julius and Mona parted as happy lovers part—to meet again. Two years later they met as strangers meet.
               "It is easy—always too easy—to bring a cloud between two lives, two hearts; and he who essayed it was not one to write "fail" on any effort without a death-struggle.
               When they met, Julius and Mona, she was not a wife; but he had become the husband of an Italian lady who loved him, and whom he had married with only a feeling of passive content. He had wedded her two months before meeting Mona, when he learned the deception that had been put upon him.
               "A tale was told him by his father that had a show of right intent, if not of well-doing.
               To temper the cup of rue he had brewed for his wife's son, this is the story he framed: That Mona's mother had been purchased from a slave-merchant at an Ionian mart. Consequently, although he had reared Mona like a daughter,  she was still a slave and that he dared not be so untrue to his duty to his dead wife's son as to sanction such an alliance.
               Mona being taught the story, although she had memories that strongly conflicted with such a statement, still  remembered something of being at a mart of slaves, and having it impressed on her that she and her mother were captive, and must be sold, never to return again to the beautiful home she remembered.
               The meeting of Mona and Julius was under circumstances that induced him to take her as of old—to encircle her with his brotherly caress; and she, deceived, bowed in spirit, turned her chastened look to him as her truest friend.
               Her great love for Julius had induced her to a willing compliance with the scheme of the stepfather. Her pride in his career had been appealed to, until she felt willing to immolate herself, rather than his bright honors should be sullied by alliance so foul—even could she have wedded him at all without consent of her master. So she yielded, and the father told what tale he chose to  separate them. Thereafter her slavery was gilded; but beneath the glitter, iron coils, cold and hard, sank, festering her soul. The after-lives of these weave into the tissue of this story.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XX.
               LIFE IN A CELL.
               
                  
                     
                        "What of these fetters?—
                        How came they on me?"
                     
                  
               
               ON a pallet of rushes in a narrow fissure of a cell, lighted by a dim lamp upon a rough table, lay a captive, sleeping heavily.
               An old woman—whom we have seen reading the stars by sunlight—crept, like a cat, from the extremest angle of the irregular apartment, and bent over the man lying there so unconscious. She lifted his matted, sickly-looking hair from his face, and peered upon it for some moments. Then, shaking her head as if to negative her questioning thought, glided back into the obscurity.
               "A sound of stories grating together just where the woman disappeared must have reached the captive's locked senses. His face twitched; his fingers stirred; his eyes partly  unclosed and shut again, as soft-footed dimples went flying over his face, as if some vision of his slumber were too sweet to part with. Then his senses all awoke. They had closed on happiness such as comes but few times to man's life.
               He had fallen asleep in an apartment so beautiful that even the soul in its flight to purer worlds might have paused lingeringly, regretful at leaving so fair a habitation.
               The king was exceedingly puzzled when he awoke fully and looked about him. His limbs felt strangely languid—  enervated; for so strong had been the narcotic mixed with the wine in his last goblet, that it held its spell until the mid-hour of the next day. Though crevice nor loop-hole admitted the sunlight to him, it lay, warm and bright, far above him on wood and crag.
               While the king was busy with conjecture, a man pushed himself through a narrow split in the rock wall, and  approached with the glide of a panther. He paused when he saw the king raise himself in a defiant manner.
               "Hold thee! hold thee!" exclaimed the man. "The halibut may pull line when he is in the stream, but, fairly hooked and drawn upon land, little use hath he to flounder. It only tears his gills to no purpose. How is it with thee, friend? What wilt thou have after the thick night-cap thou hast worn on thy brains."
               "Who brought me to this rats'-hole, and why am I here, fellow?" demanded the king.
               "I was not sent to tell thee that," said the man,  producing a flask, which he tipped to his own rusty lips until near half its contents were consumed.
               "And now, as thou seest there's no harm in it, help  thyself," said he, handing the flask to Agrippa, who, thinking it the best thing he could do, filled a cup that stood upon the table, and drank it off, saying, as he set the drained cup in its place,—
               "Now, wilt thou be pleased inform me why I am here?"
               "I tell thee, it was not in my orders to tell thee that. I pray thee talk not much, it may be hurtful. Order thy breakfast; I am here to care for that. And I charge thee eat plenteously while thou canst; for when the chief  returns, I know not if thou shalt ever eat again."
               "What meanest thou? What have I done to thee or thy chief that I am here?"
               "Thou knowest well that thou hast many things to answer for to both Jew and Roman, and in the ocean of thy sins it is not likely that any one drop will drown thee, but the whole."
               
               This speech was delivered as the man disappeared, and, though Agrippa had declined anything to eat, two men soon appeared bearing a tray of tempting breakfast, books, and a harp.
               The first comer seemed insolent as before, and to some impatient ebullition of the king, induced by the fellow's impertinence, he retorted,—
               The muzzled lion may rage, since he cannot bite; though it might be better that he keep himself dormant, at least couchant, and not tempt his keepers."
               "Zadoc, keep thine insolence bridled," said the  newcomer, who had brought harp and books. "Hast thou seen thy mother Hannah?"
               "I have seen her daily for these many years, and now thou askest have I seen her?"
               "Hadst thou seen her this morning, she would have told thee that would make thee treat thy prisoner as has been thy wont—not thus cowardly."
               "Ha! nothing she could tell me could make me forget my sister Rachel."
               "Come along with me," and the two men glided off, and left the king to his reflections. He could not understand the hints of the two men. He could not conceive why his life should be sought. He thought of Claudia; she might not know of his incarceration, and deem herself deserted without a word. Who was she?
               It was in keeping with the king's character that he should accept of the love he found flowing in the wilderness. Had he met with the same gushing amid palace bowers, he would have doubted its purity and rejected it. But now he found it both the pain and comfort of his captivity. He imagined himself in the power of Ansermo, one who had laid cities in ashes, ruined villas by the score in a single night, carried off criminals from under the very blade of the executioner, and turned executioner himself on the bodies of many of the nobility.
               Agrippa was conscious of no offence against individuals or laws; many of his own subjects deemed him too much the lover of Nero, because he happened to be in favor with that monarch; but he knew of no enmity incurred in the Roman Empire.
               The man addressed as Zadoc had an Hebrew accent, and the name Rachel was Jewish, but what had he to do with either?
               He counted the days by a horn hour-glass upon the table. After the first day, his keeper became respectful, but continued reticent as to anything outside of his  prisoner's daily wants.
               On the third day Agrippa concluded to try the efficacy of music in dispelling the gloom upon his spirits. Drawing  the harp to him, he struck a chord or two, and paused in astonishment. Far above him, beyond, and around, the garrulous echoes replied. He touched the harp again, hoping to form some idea of his surroundings. He must be beneath the floor of a lofty cavern!
               Having satisfied himself of this, he played on, relieving his heart and the tedium of confinement with song after song, venturing occasionally on the love-ballads of his country, and a few of his own improvising.
               Some days after, the servant brought another harp, saying, that "it was a woman's will to exchange the  instruments, and a very wilful woman's, at that."
               Agrippa made no reply, anxious as he was to know what manner of woman could be associated with such a clan, but certain that she had both feelings and taste. The thought had intruded that it might be Claudia, that he was still at Romanus's villa, in some of the rock-bound chambers of the precipice he had seen on the cast side; though he could not imagine why he had been imprisoned. He had not seen that Romanus held any intercourse with others. No one had ever come to the villa. Yet he had heard sounds of revelry, and sometimes of contention, through the building at night.
               The servant took the harp and departed, leaving one of far richer tone and finish, and so perfectly attuned that it might have been Lucifer's own, cast down in anger on the morning when last he stood among the sons of God.  However, on touching an unaccustomed chord, it gave out a whistling sound, and on examination Agrippa discovered a strip of parchment twisted tightly around it, which on removing he perceived had been written upon. He read: 
                     
                        Captive, weep not; I am lonely,
                        Lonely as thy heart can be;
                        Absent from that peerless maiden
                        Whom thy song reveals to me.
                     
                     
                        Can a maiden's song beguile thee?
                        Canst thou send a token true
                        To "the maiden by the fountain,"
                        Wearing "softest eyes of blue"?
                     
                  
               
               Agrippa could not doubt that it was meant for him. "The maiden by the fountain" had been the burden of his improvising.
               Then a female heart beat near him—a captive,  perhaps, but able to serve him—certainly willing. It took him not many minutes to determine on his course of action. A reed tooth-pick was sharpened for a pen. He punctured his finger and gave a deeper hue to the drop of wine poured upon the table. On the blank reverse of the lady's scrip he wrote: 
                     
                        Tell "the maiden of the mountain,"
                        Tell "the maiden by the fountain,"
                        That I live in dungeon-keep,
                        And cheer the time, nor bid her weep;
                        All that irks my soul the while
                        Is the lack of beauty's smile.
                     
                  
               
               This he twisted around a ring he knew would be  recognized by Claudia, and wrapping the whole with a string torn from the harp, he kept it until the servant came with his food, when he handed it to him, saying, "Tell thy mistress I have been awkward and broken a chord, and ask of her to send me another some inches longer than this one."
               The morning brought him a chord such as he desired, but nothing more—no intimation that his trust had been received. His cell grew gloomy again.
               It was never his custom to eat until the departure of the servant. When he had gone, Agrippa, feeling lonely, but not hungry, addressed himself to his breakfast for lack of something else to do.
               His knife met an obstruction as he cut into a loaf of fine white bread, and he tore it asunder with his hands. A small ink-horn, pens, paper, and wax, dropped from its snowy heart.
               He was happy. Now he might scribe his soul upon the page and send it. He paused to think—where?—how?
               Evening found the difficulty still unsettled. He trimmed his little lamp, spread the paper before him, and began. A shuffling of feet sounded above, and to the left of him; then a harp-tone, lightly touched at first, then swelling louder and filling the space that had given birth to such clarion-toned alarums at his own strokes, presently falling again to the lowest cadence possible, when a female voice commenced an accompaniment, and words were  distinguished: 
                     
                        Speed thee, speed thee, golden circlet,
                        To the shieling by the fall,
                        Where the "white dove" coos and nestles,
                        Seeking him in captive thrall.
                     
                  
               
               
               Three times this one verse was repeated, with a pause between as if for reply, before Agrippa thought of what to do; when, at the last repetition, he struck his harp and sang: 
                     
                        Heaven's blessings guerdon thee,
                        Unknown maid of minstrelsy:
                        I have a heart and hand and nerve;
                        Teach them, maiden, how to serve.
                     
                  
               
               He was answered by a voice without accompaniment: 
                     
                        Winter winds are cold and shrill,
                        Time, the laggard, loiters late,
                        Speeding not for human will:
                        Wait, lone captive, hope and wait.
                     
                  
               
               The pattering of light feet was heard to grow faint and fainter, until the king was left without companionship of even a sound; but solitude was not now oppressive. The lady, whoever she was, evidently knew all about Claudia. "The shielding by the fall" was the residence of Lynceus, the physician who had attended him. He had been there with Claudia when convalescence permitted him to ramble.
               Claudia was known as "the Maiden of the Mountain" by the people of the high valleys between the different peaks. He had ventured so to designate her, hoping his unknown lady friend had heard of her by that appellation.
               The king understood, by the words of the song, that winter was set in in earnest, and that much would depend on time and chance.
               He would wait.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXI.
               ANSERMO
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Hadst thou sent warning fair and true,—
                           I seek a hound or falcon strayed;
                           I seek—good faith—a mountain maid,
                           Free hadst thou been to come and go;
                           But secret path marks secret foe."
                        
                     
                     —SCOTT.
                  
               
               AGRIPPA stood before the chief Ansermo. He made a grand picture in his haughty bearing. His black stole fell slightly away from his fine form as he stood with arms folded across his chest. His face was pale from confinement. The contemptuous curve of his finely cut mouth was eloquent with the scorn he felt for those lawless men (as he believed). His eye roved over the assembly, consisting of several hundred green-clad mountaineers, and rested upon the chief. He was a grand picture, shadowed only by the greater glory he gazed upon—Ansermo.
               He stood upon a dais raised by a couple of steps, and, like Saul of old, towered above those around him. There was no anger in the look he opposed to the king's. His eyes were sevenfold darker than the dark eyes of Judea's king, piercing as they could rend the rock for secrets vainly hidden; yet melancholy softness making them  beautiful as a woman's as he looked upon his prisoner.
               His words were rather harsh, and so at variance with the language of his eye that one instinctively felt that his lips would fain have found other utterance.
               "Well, dost know with whom thou bandiest looks so defiantly, fellow?"
               
               "I do," exclaimed the king; "a cowardly craven,  skulking in holes to prey on better men."
               "Ah, the cowardly craven disdains to clamor! We are of few words, and desire only to know whom the name Marcus Aulus would fain conceal, and what his purpose here so near our castellated crags?"
               "Pardon that I know not how to utter my unsullied name in a robber's den. My purpose can have nothing in common with such as thee. Thou needest not waste time; I am ready—"
               Ansermo interrupted him: "Bold words! Bertini, what saidst thou of this man?" turning to one at his side.
               "I said we took him for Felix; but Old Hannah, whose foster-child Felix was, belies the tale this bauble tells," said Bertini, holding up the bracelet Bernice had lost, the clasp of which bore the seal of Felix, ex-governor of Judea.
               "Felix!" said Ansermo, his lip curling with intense  disgust; "Felix! Felix was smooth and silky as the serpent that trailed his slimy length into Eden; cowardly as nothing but himself; gluttonous as the cormorant; but this man, thou seest, is not Felix. Yet didst thou well to take him. Where is the other? he may be this same Felix."
               "Indeed, the character does not suit. He made his captors quail, and still bends so fierce a brow I dare not question him," said the man addressed as Bertini.
               In a few moments, during which the king cast uneasy glances at the door, not knowing who was meant, Alexis entered between a couple of guards. He approached  without looking at the king, and took a stand beside him with no sign of recognition.
               "Ha! ha!" laughed Bertini. "These birds of the same nest have become estranged marvellously quick."
               "Be still, Bertini! Tongues should be bridled when wit rides with too keen a spur," said Ansermo, in a mild voice; then, turning to his captives:
               "No man need put on concealments here except he be  the friend of Rome's tyrant. Speak! or back to your cells! We are well provisioned, and do not grudge your feed."
               Alexis looked to Agrippa, whose brow was legibly  expressive of the determined silence he intended to maintain. The allusion to Rome's tyrant convinced him that it would be dangerous to acknowledge himself; for all the world looked upon him as hand and glove with Nero. He would wait for further developments.
               It was agreed to send them to the same cell, and, while passing through the dark passages that intervened between the hall and cells, Agrippa was startled by the utterance of a single word in his ear, "Elohim!" The rest of the way was made bright; he knew he had a friend and  brother near.
               Some hours after they were left together, and just before the usual time for the entrance of supper, Agrippa was  overjoyed to hear the tones he longed to hear—a harp above him, nearer than it had been before. He listened to the  voice above the low tone of the instrument: 
                     
                        A lady stood by the festal board,
                        Where the red-ripe fruit lay piled,
                        And touched the midst of the rosy hoard
                        With her jewelled hand. She smiled
                        As thence from that midst she drew
                        A citron of golden hue.
                     
                  
               
               The tones of the harp swelled louder, and the king caught no other words, though the lady played on until near time for the servant to appear with their supper.
               The king could get no clue to the meaning of the few words he had heard. He was baffled.
               Soon, in addition to their usual supper, the servant brought a basket of luscious apples—so like the "red-ripe"  fruit of the song, that he stayed the hand of Alexis, who would have probed its richness before the servant's departure.
               When the man had gone, Agrippa removed the apples one by one from the basket to the table, until in the very centre of the board he discovered—not a citron—but an apple of Atlanta's own. Turning it about, he descried a ring around the stem as if newly cut, but so nicely done that an indifferent observer would never have noticed it. He caught hold of the stem, when the core, coming out with it, a cavity was disclosed, filled with something wrapt with paper. He drew thence a ring.
               Alexis dared not hazard a word of inquiry as to the emotion of the king on beholding the ring, which he held in his fingers as if spell-bound.
               That ring had once been his own—the ring of curious device left upon the tiny finger of the child of Nicholas, the freedman of Claudius Cæsar.
               Could Claudia be of kindred to the child?—nay, that were almost impossible; for had she not avowed herself of a race equal with the Cæsars? And yet she had the same look—sad and dewy.
               He smoothed the wrapper, to be able to read what was written thereon:
               "Does this little gem, left upon my child-finger, awaken thy dead memories? Canst thou now recognize me? Thou seest that a false report was put upon thee. Why—may not be told. I write thee this by consent of Lynceus, whom thou knowest. If thou art in danger, good friends are watching over thee. "May the gods keep thee!"
               Claudia, then, was not Claudia; but Bernice, second of "The Three." The daughter of Nicholas! The king was confused; yet did he long the more to take the woman Bernice to his bosom as he had taken the child.
               Alexis, in, searching the walls for some crevice that had given such outlet to the sound of Agrippa's harp, placed his foot upon a slight projection, insufficient to hold a moment's perch. It pressed inward, discovering a slab over an outlet large enough for a man to enter in a horizontal zontal position. With the aid of the king, whom he called from his musing, they pressed the slab into the cell, leaving  the opening free. Alexis soon disappeared in search of whatever he might find.
               Near an hour passed, and the king, becoming alarmed, determined to follow him. He held the lamp inside the aperture, but saw nothing but two stone walls, so near together that a man might scarcely pass. He pushed the lamp as far forward as he could get it, and entered by lying prostrate, as Alexis had done. When through, he arose to his feet, and found he could pass between the walls by turning sidewise. The echoes of his shuffling; feet sounded far above, and he soon came to a flight of steps, mere indentations in the stone. Had he ascended, he would have found a space extending over his own cell, and a lady's harp close to the edge over the narrow pass he was treading. He went on feeling his way, for his lamp had been extinguished—turning several angles—when a murmur reached his ear, faint, and like the far-off echo of many voices.
               After turning about to the right, to the left, forward, and upward, sometimes on soft earth, and again treading the hard stone, he saw before him a star "shining like a good deed in a naughty world." He followed it as the Magi followed the Star of the Nativity. The voices became now very distinct. He even heard words, and soon he was within a yard or two of a crevice, through which the light poured from a hundred lamps.
               He came near stumbling over a dark object crouched at the opening. It was Alexis, with his finger on his lip, in sign of warning to the king, whom he had seen approaching  long before the king saw him.
               Alexis had been gazing into the cavern of the astrologer Magus!
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXII.
               THE CONSPIRATORS.
               
                  
                     
                        "In airy hills—where light comes dancing down
                        From crystal candelabra rare, back-flashed
                        From floating forms ablaze with gems of Ind,
                        And beauty's richer glow—roam I; yet there
                        My spirit calls to thine."
                     
                     
                        "This man has done well for his country;
                        Let us eat and drink to his praise."
                     
                  
               
               THE cavern was become a banquet-hall. From point to point festoons of evergreen drooped from the ceiling and wound about the glittering stalactite pillars, that seemed like draped shafts of pure light.
               Blue, gold, purple, and crimson lamps, like balls of colored light, hung on every pillar and from each crystalline point of the ceiling.
               The table was piled with delicacies of every description, apples, figs, citrons, grapes, pomegranates, confections, delicate as well as coarser viands, wines of many hues and varieties, breads and cakes.
               Simon Magus stood beside the table, looking at the  servants place the dishes, with the interest of an epicure.
               Near by was the radiant Priestess, in gala dress.
               "Why wait we longer, Bertini?" said Magus.
               "The great Magus forgets that he does not wear a  reveller's garb, and some do sup to-night who are not initiate," answered Bertini.
               "Then take these horrid habiliments from off me, and I will feel human again.
               So saying, off came the black flame-figured gown,  displaying a suit of green and gold. Lo! the silvery hair and beard, the white ghastly face, rolled off at Bertini's touch, and Ansermo, the bandit-chief, stood in the light of his hundred lamps, in the spacious cavern hall—so  spacious, that the extensive triclinium occupied comparatively a small portion at one end, opposite to where the dais, cut in solid stone, and seemingly covered with gold,  supported the magician's throne.
               The guests flowed in, in a continuous stream, until it seemed that several hundred sat at table.
               What moved the king? Along the board on every side were many whom Agrippa knew well. Some he had deemed long since clothed in viewless robes, and their blood washed by the rains of many winters from the  shambles, where it had flowed at the word of a tyrant.
               On either side of Ansermo, sat Lucan the poet, and a tall man in a mask, and near, "great Jupiter!" thought Alexis, "our mountain antagonist, him of the urbane  manners and pearly teeth!"
               His arm was still an invalid, reposing in a green silken sash tied about his neck—second best and most courtly of all in that vast hall.
               The repast was not interminable. Servants removed the dishes, leaving only goblets and wine-pitchers.
               "Close the hall!" rung from Ansermo, like a thunder-peal.  Only a few servants were retained; the rest were excluded and the doors barred. The guests evidently  prepared to have a "night of it."
               General conversation flagged, and those who sat nearest together made a grouping engrossed by some particular theme. Cups mantled, and were drained, and filled again, when Ansermo, starting to his feet, held a goblet above his head. Every man arose.
               "All health to Piso the good!" said Ansermo.
               The mask put the goblet to his covered lips, and was  followed by Lucan and most of the table, drinking to the dregs.
               
               One, two, three, yea, half of the cups, were untasted on the table.
               "What! How is this, my countrymen! Is Piso's health distasteful to ye?" thundered Ansermo.
               "Nay, nay!" said he of the green sash; "but there is another name must claim precedence. Fill again!"
               When this order had been executed by the attendants, he waved his goblet until the laurel-leaves that drooped from the light festoon above him lay on the sparkling foam within the cup.
               "To Vespasian, chosen of the gods!" he cried, enthusiastically  stamping the stone floor, until the clang of his golden spurs rang sharply in a thousand echoes.
               The applause that followed died not out for the reverberations  ringing in the vast hall, and without, near and far, for many minutes.
               The cups of some who had quaffed to Piso remained untouched; among which were those of Ansermo, Lucan, and the masks.
               He of the scarf turned his eye sharply along the table, and, looking sternly from one to another of those whose cups still held their wine, his breast heaved, his eyes flamed, and he turned upon his heel to leave the room. Others were following, when the mask drew all eyes upon himself, by exclaiming:
               "Citizens of the Roman Commonwealth, I claim your ears!"
               Lifting the mask and casting it from him, all recognized Vespasian!—Vespasian, "the hero of a hundred battles," with the bleached locks and furrowed cheeks, the servant of his country!
               All bowed before him! Again the cavern rung with long and loud acclaims! This time not a tongue was still; and when the myriad echoes died, he spoke:
               "Friends! countrymen! Let no divisions peril the good of our cause! Piso is of the blood-royal! Rome is not yet satiate with the Cæsars' line. I thank your loves, and I love you well. But, should Vespasian now yield to the wishes of most here, and the solicitations of some who are not, the blood ye are prepared to shed—the blood of Romans—would flow to little purpose!
               "The Cæsars' line is not yet extinct of goodness—Piso lives! Around him let your gathering be, and Vespasian, with all Vespasian's power, will meet you there! Vindex and Galba will aid us. We have sworn by the sacred Styx—by the bones beneath the Lupereal—to place Piso on the throne! Let this assurance disarm expectation as to the fitness of my brows for Rome's diadem!" Pausing and taking up his cup, he exclaimed, "Fill high the goblet to Piso the good!" He held it above his head until every cup was filled and lifted.
               "Piso the good!" rang from every lip. "Piso the good!" came back in a thousand voices. "Piso the good!" bounded from point to point, from cavern to cavern, above, around, beneath, until "Piso the good" died in faint reverberation  afar off, long after the clanging goblets had fallen on the silver-laid tables, drained of every drop.
               "Piso the good? yes," said our hero of the urbane manners,  in a whisper to Vespasian," but weak and vacillating."
               Vespasian wrung his hand, and looked meaningly upon him, but said nothing, as he prepared to speak again.
               "Friends, countrymen! I have yet to say that Ansermo, your chief, hath something to impart to ye, which he can do when I am absent as well, as I already know its purport. Heed what he shall say, and believe that I have proof of what he will tell ye. I can tarry with ye no longer. Until we meet at the feast of Lupercalia, farewell."
               The cheers were again deafening, amidst which  Vespasian resumed his cloak and mask, and departed.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               THE DAUGHTER OF CÆSAR.
               ANSERMO waved his hand for silence, and when he saw them attentive, addressed them:
               "Ye of the 'Eleven-Pointed Stars,' know that at no time have I deceived ye. Ye, who are remnants of the confederation once sworn to Britannicus, I perceive that it still irks ye that I did fall away from that prince and failed to uphold ye and him. I have that to tell ye that will lift the scales from your eyes, and place me in your confidences again.
               "Ye all know that the late Emperor Claudius did set aside Britannicus, his own son, as ye thought, in favor of the vile incumbent of the throne at this time. A conduct so unnatural aroused the sympathies of ye all, and mine no less; and we did enter into a compact to place Britannicus in the seat of his fathers, in the fourth year of the reign of Nero. Suddenly I forsook your cause, and, not long after, Britannicus was taken off by poison, administered, as was believed, by Agrippina, the mother of Nero. I have now to tell ye why I deserted the confederation, and will relate the facts that influenced me thereto, and of which I obtained proofs, as I can show ye all.
               "Know, then, Claudius Cæsar put away his first wife Petina, not for her vanity, as some say, but that she bore him no sons. When Messalina, who succeeded her, was about to become a mother, mindful of the Emperor's desire for a male child she took the precaution to gather about her such women as were in a like advanced stage of pregnancy nancy. She gave birth to a female child, and quickly  exchanged with one of the women, who in the same hour had been delivered of a male child, and presented the rejoicing Emperor with a spurious son.
               "The husband of the woman, as the girl-child grew, was convinced that it bore too much the stamp of the Emperor, and became enraged with jealousy, as the wife had belonged to the Empress's household for a time, and had ample  opportunities to be overcome by the sensual Emperor.
               "The woman went in great distress to Messalina to know what she should do, who gave her permission to acquaint her husband with the whole fraud, and even went to him herself, and gained him over to her interests.
               "The man, exceedingly gratified at his son's good-fortune, hoped that good might some day result to himself. His ambition was aroused, and, fearing that the Empress, who had become very fond of her daughter in secret, might relent and inform the Emperor of her fraud, he resolved to take the life of Messalina. He first poisoned the mind of the Emperor against her during her absence, and then forged an order for her execution, and carried it into effect before the poor Empress could get a hearing.
               "But mark how the gods project whom they love! The Empress, ere she died, found means to impart the story to one that promised her to deliver the same to Claudius, but who kept the secret until she could get a chance to tell it to those whom it concerned; one of whom was Agrippina, who in a short time was married to Claudius, and, having hunted up the midwife who was present at the exchange of the children, and the real mother of Britannicus, she caused them both to appear before the Emperor and confess  the whole, promising the mother of Britannicus to save her son's life if she would do so without reservation. The Emperor, having learned to love Britannicus as his own son, could not wholly forsake him; and, wishing also to be thought the father of a son, he did not make the affair public, but contented him with depriving Britannicus of the succession in favor of Nero, his wife's son, who was called Domitius Ahenobarbus. No sooner had Agrippina gained all she wished, then the Emperor Claudius was poisoned, as ye all know."
               "The daughter! the daughter! what became of the daughter of Cæsar?" broke from many tongues at once.
               "Hold! I will tell ye!" said Ansermo. "When Claudius  Cæsar demanded his daughter, he was told that she was dead. But, my countrymen, it was false. The physician  who had been suborned by the husband of the woman to take away the child's life, determined to save it, and, giving her a potion that would produce the semblance of death he rescued her even from the charnel, and has reared her ever since, under the protection of 'The Eleven.' It was determined if the council that Piso would be strengthened on his throne by an alliance with the daughter of Claudius Cæsar! What say ye, Romans? Shall it be so?"
               "Yea! yea! let it be so! Give us the daughter of  Claudius!" this was the burden of many tongues—of all within the hall.
               "Romans! I am empowered to make known to the daughter of Cæsar the wishes of the council, and I will do so in the presence of ye all!" Not heeding the looks of wonder cast upon him at this speech, he turned and  addressed Bertini:
               "Bertini, thou wilt now call those who are awaiting in the chambers of the priestess. Thou wilt enter, when thou  returnest, by the door behind the throne."
               Turning again to the astonished company, many of whom were not astonished, being long acquainted with the story—new to most of them—Ansermo said:
               "Come, arrange yourselves around the steps of the dais, upon the throne of which, earnest of a better one, ye will behold your future Empress."
               Agrippa, who, with Alexis, still looked upon all that was passing in the cavern, shook from head to foot; already he began to fear, to suspect that which the reader also may have imagined, when a folding-door spread wide, and, as Ansermo sprang to meet them, old Lynceus entered with the priestess, and was conducted to the edge of the dais, in full view of the king and Alexis!
               "Thank thee, thou God of Abraham!" exclaimed Agrippa inwardly. "The priestess is then daughter to Claudius—not Claudia—my pure Claudia! O God, I praise thee!" And the king drew a long, long sigh of relief.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               ANSERMO SPEAKS OF HIMSELF.
               THERE had been a stir, a buzzing of muffled whispers; eager and excited glances toward the great door behind the throne, but when the Priestess was led to the front of the dais, before Ansermo had time to speak, a huzza of welcome greeted her, and many sprang forward to prostrate  themselves at the foot of the steps, when Ansermo, waving his hands repeatedly, restored quiet and attention.
               "Friends, our priestess hath somewhat to say to ye by me. She is but the proxy of your future Empress, who is suddenly indisposed, and cannot appear, as was my great hope to-night. In sign that she appreciates your loves, she sendeth one to appear in her stead. Ye all know that the daughter of your late Emperor lives, which some here have long known; but as none, save myself and other some, not amounting to more than three persons, have ever been permitted to know the name she wears, and whereabouts her sacred person is bestowed, I did hope to admit ye all, this night, to that privilege, seeing that your hearts are true to her, and knowing that when ye have seen her, ye will recognize the lineaments of Cæsar, her father. I did hope that in the presence of ye all I would deliver the wishes of 'the Council' on the subject of Piso's alliance. When, two moons ago, I did mention the subject to her in private, I found her conformable. Men and members of this confederation, we will appoint an early day to present to ye the daughter of your beloved Emperor. At present let me speak to ye of myself. Ye all know that after the math of Britannicus, I enjoyed the fickle favors of the fickle monarch now crowned with a diadem that belongeth not to him.
               "Ye all know that by a breath, or, lighter still, a  contortion of my countenance, I lost my high place, and was  condemned to suffer as a criminal. I, in common with many whose faces I see here, was saved in the moment when I thought my last hour had come, by the machinations of this very confederation, whose chief I afterwards became, and now am. Some of ye know by what means I hold constant intercourse with Nero. Some have tempted me to use my opportunities for a private vengeance on mine enemy; but, citizens of Rome, that would not be for the good of Rome, nor for mine own advancement.
               "When the cause of Piso is ripe, to which it fast  culminates, then shall Rome's tyrant tremble before the man he has wronged—oh, citizens, ye know not how deeply. Ye see me among ye, leading ye to the pillage of cities that Nero has enriched from the spoils taken from ye all. To the spoliation of villas, and vintage, and harvests, whose occupants are but usurpers of your rights, I have led ye; yet ye have not seen into my soul, nor know from what  felicities Nero's enmity hurled me. I cared not for the life he aimed to destroy; but for the darkness put upon that life, I hold such vindictive hate that I will bind me to Piso unto death, if but to drink the sweets of a full  revenge. Yet is the good of the Roman commonwealth paramount to any private matter. 'Ye will meet me, as has been agreed, on the fifteenth of the month February,  which is the feast of Lupercalia. Ye will wear the garb the Julii.
               "After the feast, the captains of companies will repair to the caverns of the Lupercal by twos and threes, to avoid notice, where they will be instructed relative to their duties on the morrow, for there are some in the prisons of Nero that must be set at liberty. There we shall see Vespasian for the last time before we meet him again in the enrolled legions of Piso, emblazoned with the 'eleven-pointed star.' Citizens! countrymen! honorable confederates! ye are permitted to retire."
               Ansermo then seated himself on the throne of the dais, beside the lovely priestess.
               Agrippa, again distressed with the fear that Claudia might, after all, prove to be the daughter of Claudius, still gazed into the cavern as if bound hand and foot to the wall of stalactite against which he pressed.
               The company, dispersed until no one, not even a servant, refrained beneath the flickering lamps, save the two upon the throne. Old Lynceus had gone out as soon as the guests began to retire.
               The flight of hope caused a groan from Agrippa as he saw Claudia with Lynceus enter from the festooned  doorway at the back of the throne. Ansermo, with the grace of a gallant, arose and placed her on the seat he had  occupied himself, taking a divan placed for him by Lynceus.
               Claudia had, indeed, arrayed herself at the instance of her friends for the presentation. She had on a robe of rich blue silk, embroidered in all its borders with silver thread, wrought into flowers and leaves. On her fair hair was a circlet of pearls, extending in loopings among the braids knotted and looped upon her neck. She had never appeared so radiant to Agrippa, and he looked in vain for some sign of the indisposition that had kept the daughter of Claudius from the presence of her friends, and was  beginning to be reassured that she could not be the person meant, when Ansermo addressed her:
               Princess Claudia Bernice, I have this night sounded thy friends, and thou wouldst have done well hadst thou appeared before them; but, since thou didst decide against it, it may also be well. Thou knowest "the proposals with which I came freighted from 'the Council,' whose chief Piso. I will now hear what manner of answer I may  return to their solicitations."
               Agrippa held his breath to hear Claudia's answer.
               "Say, that, mindful of my parents' misfortunes and death's, I have no desire to assume dignities which proved so calamitous to them. I have therefore decided to live in the obscurity in which I have been reared, which alone is my heart's desire."
               "I dare not! I dare not return to those honorable men with such an answer, after that I repeated to them what thou saidst when late I spoke to thee. Thou then wert willing, as thou saidst, to do all in thy power to aid the cause which thou now desertest. Why is this?"
               "I did not then know my own heart. Now I know it better; and know that I desire no alliance with Piso,  except as his friend, kinswoman, and subject. Oh, let me remain as I am! I ask no more!" pleaded the low, yet clear voice of Claudia.
               "Woman, why art thou perverse? Ah, all of thy sex are so, and yet I thought them all ambitious too. I will await the turning of the tide; that will ebb and flow by the hours, doubtless. Lynceus, thou wilt watch thy mistress'  moods, and when thou findest her complacent, hasten to me on wings, with her answer to my suit. On wings, Lynceus, lest she overtake thy tardiness with negatives and denials."
               Claudia, thus ridiculed by a man who evidently took on him the freedom of a friend, said, as she arose to leave the room:
               "And I will even go my ways until thou knowest me better, Ansermo, and rememberest, as thou shouldst, that I neither hold a stubborn will, nor am of fickle nature."
               She disappeared, and Agrippa would have drawn Alexis from the aperture to find some outlet from their hiding-place,  when Alexis was attracted again to what was passing in the cavern.
               Ansermo approached the priestess, who evidently  shuddered at his approach, and spoke to her:
               "Mona, damsel, Ceres has now these four times gathered her harvests since thou didst learn what I will not now repeat; and yet on yesterday what came over thee, girl, to refuse my request? What saidst thou?"
               "I said that I would not again assist thee to dupe and frighten those who are of the image of God."
               "God? Thou talkest like a Hebrew! Thou hast not forgotten thy training; but, girl, know that I can enforce thee to do my bidding. Hast thou learned perverseness from the girl Claudia? She is of the race of Cæsar, and it becometh her. But thou—knowest thou who thou art?"
               "Thou hast called me slave!" said Mona, mournfully, yet defiantly.
               "And thou art: think not that I will humor thy whimsies. I must to Rome forthwith, and thou shalt take thy place."
               "I will not!" exclaimed Mona.
               "Girl! thou tamperest with thy fate. How wouldst thou like to have me send thee to the mart again?"
               "Thou darest not! Julius will protect me!"
               "Ah! the married man, Julius, thy lover!"
               "Thou darest not call him such to his face!"
               "Girl, dost thou beard thy master? Back to thy chamber,  and I will thrust thee again to thy low estate, as I thrust thee forth from this hall!"
               And Ansermo, fairly enraged, caught the affrighted Mona by her shoulders with savage rudeness.
               The increased pressure produced by the excited king and Alexis on that part of the frail stalactite, caused it to give way, and the king and Alexis were precipitated into the hall.
               Ansermo's rage was terrible when he recognized them. What do ye here, miscreants? What ferret's hole  conducted ye hither?"
               "It matters not," answered Agrippa, springing at his throat. "It matters not, since I find Magus and Ansermo the same. It matters not, since I am in time to chastise thy base cowardice—insulter of a defenseless woman!"
               Ansermo slipped in a pool of spilt wine, for he had sprung from the dais to the floor to meet the onset of the king. He fell, and the king sprang upon him and pressed his knee into his breast, calling on Alexis to bring thongs to bind him.
               Alexis was not there. The woman too had disappeared.
               Ansermo shook off, the king, as if he had been a blade of straw or a grain of dust, and arose, laughing scornfully, as he called, "Bertini! What, ho, Bertini!" while he only parried the king's strokes from fist and heel, until his guards filed in and secured their prisoner.
               "Take him to 'the Crag,'" said Ansermo, now  thoroughly cooled of his anger.
               Again, in the darkness of the next apartment, Agrippa heard that word—"Elohim."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXV.
               THE SERENADE.
               
                  
                     
                        "Keep, keep the maiden's dowry,
                        And give me but my bride;
                        Not for her wealth I woo her,
                        Not for her nation's pride;
                        She is a treasure in herself,
                        Worth all the world beside!"
                     
                  
               
               CLAUDIA occupied the room she had once resigned to the use of Agrippa. Entering with her maid, she busied herself closing the door and dropping the curtains, now of dark-purple silk, securely over the casement. She turned to her idle maid, hooded and cloaked, standing by.
               "Now let me see thy very self," at the same time  playfully snatching hood and cloak, and casting them on the floor, revealing the brown tresses of Mona, whom she took by the hand, and drew to a seat beside herself.
               "Now tell me thy hap and hazards since I parted with thee. My heart is very sad to-night, but not so concentred in self but that I have room for thy griefs."
               "Did not Lynceus tell thee how I fled to his hut with him they call Alexis? It seems the combatants forgot poor me lying pale among the cushions of the throne, where I had fallen when Ansermo thrust me so rudely. Alexis, more compassionate, took me up—did not  Lynceus tell thee?"
               "Nay; the manner of thy escape he had no time to impart; my grief shut down upon my senses so when he told me that Marcus had been condemned to the Crag."
               "Well, then, Alexis bore me out, meeting my brother Julius, who had come from attendance on thee. Not knowing  the meaning of my position, he was about to attack Alexis; but I had life sufficient to arrest his blow and explain. He was enraged at his father's cruel treatment of me, and swore I should be removed from any chance of its recurrence. So he assisted Alexis; and between them I was conducted to the hut of Lynceus, which thou knowest  is built above a small cavern, where Alexis now lies concealed.
               "Julius will take me to his friends at Brundusium until I can embark for our own home in Samaria, where his aunt still resides; the place being a part of Julius'  patrimony, independent of his stepfather. He talks to me of the time when thou wilt be an empress and wilt befriend thy poor Mona."
               "I will indeed befriend thee with whatever power is mine; but I sigh not for that of an empress. Indeed, I will not be forced from my privacy."
               "Ah, I remember thou didst speak differently two moons ago. Thou hast now other food for thy mind, and this Marcus Aulus hath changed thee; but I must speak lower. Know that Lynceus' fear of Romanus' good faith ensconced me in this disguise to come to thee; but, as I was saying of thy Marcus, Julius has promised he shall be free. He knew nothing of the capture its purposes, being absent, until I told it him at the banquet. Julius will not forsake his promise, and thou wilt have thy Marcus again."
               "I doubt him not; but the vengeance of Ansermo may fly swifter than thy friend's good offices. As a prisoner to 'the Eleven,' his life was safe; but this last personal attack will give him over to Ansermo, and thou knowest his awful vengeance spares not."
               The tinkling of a timbrel stirred the darkness outside the casement, and a quivering voice was heard chanting above the constant murmur of the cascadet.
               
               Claudia smiled humorously, saying:
               "My poor old tutor thinks his mistress needs the lullaby of his song to cheat her into slumber. It is a horrible  discord; but he means well. I will give him a brimming cup of wine to show him I appreciate his love; shade thy face the while I ope the casement. So saying, she filled a goblet of crystal, and, partially opening the casement, held it out, saying,—
               "Good Casca, take this wine to warm thee, and tarry not long, for the night-air will chill thee."
               The old man mumbled out his thanks, and took the cup outside. When he returned it to his waiting mistress, she heard something "click" into it. On taking it to the light, she saw a sparkle among the wine-dregs—a ring—the ring left upon her child-finger, and kept as a talisman through all her sorrows. Then the old minstrel must be the bearer of some message!
               She turned to the lattice. It flew open, and the old man entered—not her tutor—but one aged and bent as he.
               "Thou hast a message?" said Claudia, forgetting the impropriety of the man's entrance without knock or  invitation.
               The bent form grew wonderfully straight—the gray hirsute fell to the floor, and Agrippa held forth his hand, shaking back his heavy, uncombed locks from his prison-bleached brow. 
                     
                        "I do not rhyme to that dull elf
                        Who cannot image to himself"
                     
                   that chamber-scene.
               Claudia, after some demonstrations from the king that he had met her as he left her, unchanged, replied:
               "Then thou dost not scorn the humble daughter of Nicholas the freedman?"
               "I loved thee when I held thee no other than the daughter of Nicholas, which thou art not. I love thee no more nor less that thou art the child of Claudius Cæsar."
               "How is this?—thou—what?—who told thee this?" exclaimed Claudia.
               "I tell thee what I know; and, moreover, I have bound me by oath to steal thee—pilfer thee like a rich jewel from this thy home; and having respect unto mine oath, the morrow must meet us upon the Appian Way, with our faces toward Brundusium. Our most pressing need takes us to the shieling, where Lynceus will show thee what to do. Wilt thou trust me?"
               "I will," promptly answered Claudia; for she was  convinced that the king could have obtained his knowledge of her identity only through those who were her friends. That knowledge was a passport to her entire confidence, and she repeated: "I will."
               "Then hasten; and she to whom we both owe more than a life's devotion—she goes with us. Julius and Alexis wait without, and—and a muffled friend of thine—I know him not."
               Claudia and Mona, to whom the king had addressed himself with all the eloquence of his deep gratitude, were soon ready to part with whatever was dear at Mountain Villa, and the little party soon joined their friends without.
               Again Julius and Mona were fugitives together—from the same power that had once made them wander on such a night—protector and protected.
               If memory was too busy at times, it was dismissed with a sigh; and the present tried to know no past.
               Pack-mules were provided at the shieling, which took the party to an obscure station on the Appian by mid-morning.
               Post-coaches were found ready with outriders, and by the evening of the next day a fair cortege swept into the coast-town of Brundusium.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXVI.
               BRUNDUSIUM.
               
                  
                     
                        "Sweet!
                        When summer winds grow balmy, they shall fill
                        My incoming sails on yonder Adriatic."
                     
                  
               
               CLAUDIA, thou lookest so angel-like in thy beautiful robes to-night, with those star-jewels dotting thy hair—so like the blue-eyed darling of my early manhood, that the name Bernice has thrice trembled on my lips."
               "Has that name, then, a richer melody for thine ear than Claudia?"
               "Nay; but since I have found my little child-mate, memory keeps running back, tossing up diamond sparkles that make the present more glowing, more dear, by its linkings with the past—that past from whence the name Bernice thrills a sweeter note, joined to its more precious engraftment Claudia; for, in truth, Bernice gave the key of my heart to Claudia, and thanks to the faithless sentinel, Prudence, that slept while she entered and filled its  emptiness with light and music."
               "And love, Agrippa," said Claudia, timidly.
               "And love,—else there were no light, no music, which makes but the atmosphere of love. It is a sad theme, but tell me of thy sister Octavia. How did she escape the death that, thou tellest me, she died with thee?—that thou didst close her eyes at Mountain Villa!"
               "He whom we call Ansermo, having offence at Nero, sought out poor me, and fitted me up a secure home, hoping to make me subservient to his revenges upon the man who  had wronged him. I lived secure and happy until I was told of my parentage; but let that pass. I was informed of my poor sister's banishment to Pandataria and her  subsequent restoration; but, fearful for her life, I begged  Ansermo to shield her. When Anicetus so foully belied  Octavia, and was sent to destroy her, Ansermo was on the watch, and found means to rescue her from his hands; for it were a wonder had my sister's gentle ways failed to bind about her many a true heart to step between Nero and his crime. Such friends kept Ansermo informed of what transpired  relative to her. Anicetus was forced to swear that he had murdered her, and to produce a body clothed in her garments to deceive her enemies.
               "My sister was brought to Mountain Villa, where, from grief and the ill treatment she had encountered she died. I had learned to love her; for she was the first and only one I had ever seen of kindred.
               "She bathed the heinous crimes of Nero in the bleaching dews of sweet forgiveness ere she died, while I—I felt it pollution to live co-dweller in a world with such a monster.
               "I prepared a draught, that my soul might overtake hers in its swift flight to Elysium; and they would have found me as cold and pale as she, but Lynceus dashed the cup from my lips and taught me better things."
               Claudia ceased speaking, and the light from festal lamps that streamed into the balcony where they sat, glittered upon the tears that fell in large drops from her eyes.
               Agrippa spoke:
               "Nero hath another crime the less upon his soul. His mother lives."
               "How may that be? She died before my sister."
               "She lives. The same Anicetus had not the heart to finish what he had begun, and hired another to give  Agrippina the last stroke. The man, who was husband to the ill-fated Accerronia, pitied her who had never wronged him. He bore her bleeding body to a boat on the Lucrine lake, and thus conducted her to the care of a fisher's wife, until Vespasian, who was sent for, sent her on a ship loaded with dates and figs to me. She landed at Cæsarea, and came with my sister to Jerusalem. Her mother-love and longings grew too strong for my beseechings, and—so changed that none may know her—she feigns to be my niece's governess, and so keeps watch and ward about her erring child—her only one."
               "Then I have seen her at Valley Villa, and now I know why she seemed never satisfied, that I was lowly born and reared at Mountain Villa."
               "Ah! she is changed. The sickness of the heart hath tamed her haughty and cruel nature. She seemeth like unto a lamb under the slaughter-knife, so much hath  misery changed her. But, hark! the watchman of the night crieth to his fellow. Let us in; for the night waneth, and the ship lieth in the offing that must bear me from thee. But, sweet! when summer winds grow balmy, they shall fill my incoming sails on yonder Adriatic."
               With many words they wound about themselves a net of most sweet promises ere they parted.
               "I will keep my vows and come for thee at the appointed time; but I leave thee bound not to me, and if, within that time, thou choosest the brighter destiny that is thine to claim, Agrippa will strive to be content, and he, and all that is his, shall be subject to thy will, servant to thy wishes  though, in thine altitude of power, thou mayst regard him as less than the dust outside thy palace-gates."
               Claudia, as they stood ready to part, laid her hand upon his shoulder, and replied:
               "Ah me! woe is me!—thou wilt not trust me! I forego  all pride of ancestry, or hold it subject to thy will, so that thou do not—that thou never—"
               "What irks thee? Say on; what may follow that never?"
               "Oh, thou knowest there is one in Rome, that, while he lives, Rome's air is foul to Claudia—deadly as the  upas-dew."
               Agrippa took her hand, saying:
               "By consent of mine never shall thy sensitive nature be so tortured, so outraged by such a presence as that of thy sister's murderer. By wish of mine thou wilt never be other than Bernice, the love of Agrippa; that fills the measure of thy riches, and outbids ancestral honors; but, oh, thou hast not yet told me how thou didst put off  Ansermo."
               "Oh, when he stood before me—As I told thee, he came some days since, when I was sorely frightened and ill at rest for thee—behold he came and stood before me, looking into my eyes—with those great, awful eyes of his, and said, looking straight into my eyes, as thou dost now, he said: 'Dost thou love Marcus Aulus?' Oh, I did not die, but my startled face, my pained, milk-white face drew his pity upon me; and he sat down beside me, taking my hands that lay helpless on my lap, and talked to me of my father, of Piso, and the duties I owed my countrymen, until I became quite calm; then he said, 'Wilt thou still refuse Piso's alliances?'
               "Then I found words, and answered him as before; so he straightway left me, and I did rejoice that he made no further question of Marcus Aulus."
               The morning rode up over the Adriatic. A ship's fair  sails were lessening thereaway. Two maidens, with arms interlocked and cheeks pressed together, stood on a high balcony of a princely residence in Brundusium. They gazed toward the rising sun, in whose eye lay the path of the out-bound.
               
               The king's escape from Castle Crag had a few features that puzzled him.
               His cell was a very palace of despair—a round hole it seemed, bored into solid rock. It had no outlet, except at the top, from which he had descended on a ladder, that was drawn up again. He could not sleep. He could not eat the meals that were let down to him. He was in  despair. He had no means of counting the hours; but they were counted for him, and on the third day of his comfortless  confinement, the wall of his cell on one side began to move, and parted sufficiently to admit a man in a mask, who carried a very brilliant light. He set his lamp upon a jutting rock that answered as a table, and turned his face toward the prisoner, making a sign, at which the king crossed his arms upon his bosom and uttered the word, "Elohim," but not in a steady voice, for he was evidently agitated with extreme surprise.
               The man spoke:
               "By the sign of the open hand, by the emblem of the  olive-branch, I charge thee to accept the terms I bring for thy release. Thou wilt swear to reveal nothing thou hast seen or heard since thy imprisonment."
               "I swear," said Agrippa, folding his arms.
               "Thou art a Jew," said the man, "and must put thy hand under my thigh as thou swearest."
               Agrippa did so, and swore as he was directed.
               "Now, wilt thou swear to go to the Mountain Villa, were thou art known only as Marcus Aulus, and, with the help that shall be given thee, abduct the girl called Claudia, and take her where thou wilt be directed?"
               "If she be content to go with me, and the manner of her abduction and the place to which I must bear her tends not to her injury, or the marring of her fair fame—"
               "I assure thee of that. It is desired to impress Romanus that she was stolen by thee. Care will be taken that thou canst not be traced. Thou wilt take her to Brundusium, and there thou wilt leave her with one who will assist thee and bear thee company. She will be with honorable friends; so thou hast only to swear as I have desired thee."
               "Then will I swear by the God of Abraham to do as thou desirest."
               "It may be as well to tell thee that I know thou art Agrippa—"
               Agrippa started with surprise, but replied:
               "Ha! how knowest thou that? Am I known of thee?"
               "Nay; I never saw thee until I saw thee stand before the chief, when they took thee for Felix. Even then I had cognizance of thee."
               "Then is thy knowledge of my name a riddle; but, so that I get quittance from this place—so that I can be upon mine errands, I care not who knoweth Agrippa here or elsewhere.
               "But thou wilt not be permitted to go on thine errand; one thing else thou must swear to do is, to turn thy face from Rome. Indeed, there is little need for thee there. Nero hath issued a decree that mars success for thine errand."
               "What decree? And how knowest thou the quality of my business at Rome; or, how knowest thou that I did expect to go to Rome?"
               "The decree giveth to the Greeks the city of Cæsarea; now thou canst tell whether or no I know thine errand to Nero. Thou hadst best hasten to thine own kingdom, for there thou wilt find dissensions; and this I have been instructed to promise thee, that, if within twelve moons thou hearest nothing contrary, thou mayest spread thy sails again, and thou wilt find a bride ready for thee at Brundusium."
               Agrippa was astounded; but the man hurried him on to still greater bewilderment by saying:
               "Now the last oath required of thee is this: thou shalt not force on the acceptance of thy sister Bernice any spouse, until she be claimed by one who shall be king over all, the lands lying between, the Euxine and Mediterranean seas, and east as far as the eastern borders of Pontus and Cilicia, south to Mount Lebanus. Thou wilt keep all I have said, and the oaths thou hast taken, in thine own breast, except the oath thou hast taken to abduct Claudia, and that thou wilt tell only to her and the girl thou wilt find with her."
               After administering the oaths with great solemnity, the man said, "Follow me!" and went out through the door by which he had come, and that led to the foot of a flight of stairs of exceedingly narrow proportions. A spark afar above, like a star, showed the steps cut in solid rock; at the head of which the man pointed the way along a narrow  passage to another flight of steps, and left the king to find his way, guided by the small lamp he had taken from his cell. When he had reached a landing on the second flight of steps, he felt the upper-ground air stirring amid his hair, and when he had reached the hall above, a door led him into the presence of Julius—Julius, who had been for days planning to release him, and who was as much surprised as the kings at finding themselves together. He, however, accepted the cue, and hastened to show the king the outside of Castle Crag. A man, whom Julius knew not, left his station by the outer portal and followed them, giving the king a sign agreed upon. After which he held Julius in conversation for some time, who, on joining the king, said:
               "Thou goest to Brundusium; and I will go with thee, and one whom we shall find at Mountain Villa must bear us company."
               And Julius explained his wishes respecting Mona. Thus did the king leave Castle Crag with some queer oaths on his soul, and many subjects for consideration and astonishment, none of which were more curious than the oath in regard to his sister.
               While at Brundusium, he was introduced to many whose faces he had seen around the triclinium of the cavern.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXVII.
               THE CONFLAGRATION.
               
                  
                     
                        "There shines no sun—
                        But flaming horror of consuming fire."
                     
                  
               
               A D. 64, Titus was "home from the wars." What sweeter sound ever greeted a mother's ears? What wilder woe ever shut down upon a mother's soul, than when fate has barred it out forever, and, in its stead, supplied a bloody bier, far off, undecked, and rough-smoothed by  comrade hands.
               The atmosphere had been hazy for three days, like the Indian summers of the nineteenth century, though the month was June, and the earth's lap was filled with fruits and flowers.
               A murky belt girdled the northern horizon toward Rome. Titus lay on the grass near the cascade. The phenomena of the dusky heavens had for awhile occupied his thoughts, but they soon gathered around a theme of more heart-interest,  and the black heavens, the green earth, and the thick air were forgotten.
               "How will she meet me?" sought but found no answer. Piqued at an imaginary slight, he had gone away from the places that knew him, to mingle with the "red tide of  battle;" but that which had sent brought him back again, asking, "How will she meet me?"
               As he lay there, this questioning wooed a host of  bright-plumaged memories that beguiled him of hours, until a horseman, galloping furiously, passed on toward the house, arousing Titus from his day-dreams.
               "Halloo, friend! What bodes thy haste?" cried Titus, springing up and leaping into the road.
               Horse and rider were known to Titus, though he had not seen Julius or Libyan Mira since the day of his  mountain fray.
               "What bodes thy haste, friend?" said Titus again, as Libyan Mira stood with expanded nostrils and foamy flanks.
               "I seek thee," said Julius; "Rome has been burning three days. Nero is at Antium, and a band of wretches, professing to obey his orders, keep back the citizens from saving their hones, and, moreover, themselves fuel the flames to keep them flush. I come to thee: wilt thou lead troops against these wretches?"
               "I must to Rome, indeed!" exclaimed Titus, terribly excited; "but pardon—pardon that I—"
               "Doubt my good faith," said Julius, finishing the  sentence for him. "But seest thou this?" and Julius opened his doublet and displayed a signet upon his vest.
               "Command me," promptly replied Titus, recognizing his father's signet—a flame-star, seven-rayed, set in a rim of gold.
               "Then to horse! The detachment I wish thee to lead will cross us at Appii Forum. Mine own is not far hence."
               Titus was not long making his arrangements. His silver-footed  black barb stood at the door by the time he had informed his mother of his intentions, and was receiving her good-bye embrace, as he said:
               "Ah, were I my father, tyrants should not fill thrones. Vespasian's policy draws too slow its length, wasting tons of Roman blood that one stroke might save."
               "Or lose all, my son. Thy-father is wise, politic. Though cold of heart, unloving in his home, I never doubt his right doing."
               
               During pauses in their rapid motion forward, where the state of the roads rendered it necessary to proceed more  slowly, Titus and Julius engaged in a desultory  conversation.
               "Thou art, then, one of 'the Seven'?" said Titus, by way of breaking the silence.
               Julius replied by an affirmative motion of his head and hand, and Titus continued:
               "War having made me acquainted with men's souls, my father deemed me worthy to make one of them, of whom until recently I knew nothing. I expected to keep tryst at the Lupereal three days from this, without  knowing whom I should meet. Pardon me: the credentials of Ansermo appear clear, but—but—"
               "Dost thou then take me for him thou namest?" said Julius, laughing.
               "Ay, surely! and have flattered me that I crossed swords with him upon a time."
               "Thy thought hath deceived thee. I am that Julius of whom—"
               "Of whom Agrippa wrote most lovingly," exclaimed Titus, approaching close to snow-bank Mira, and grasping the hand of Julius, far more pleased than if he had met the renowned Ansermo.
               The road again permitted better speed, and when they drew rein in a bog of Campagna, Julius took up the broken threads of discourse by remarking:
               "Ansermo is not of 'the Seven;' he hath the star glinting eleven points, which I warrant thou hast upon thine inner vesture."
               "Then I shall not meet Ansermo until the moon's  meridian guides me to 'Eagle Nest,' when I expect a guide to Castle Crag."
               "Then we meet, and the dilatory Piso will at last cast the dye for at final coloring to his fate, that might have been two years ago, when this sore boil upon the Roman  commonwealth was fully ripe, and needed only the touch of heroism to pierce and relieve it of its rottenness, and make the part sound and whole. But Piso is the sleepiest hero that ever turned glance upon a coveted elevation. Thy father doubts his final firmness, and so do I. But he is the only Cæsar beloved of the people, and the trial must be made."
               "And if it fail?" said Titus, more in self-communion than as a question.
               "Then 'the Eleven' will be prepared to unite with 'the Seven,' which, depending on itself, will not fail."
               The two men rode night and day, and in the evening they had the satisfaction of hearing the thundering of troops along the Appian some hours before they came upon them at Appii Forum.
               Under a strange banner Titus entered Rome, and was alarmed at the first outpost with the intelligence that the wind had suddenly veered, and driven the flames direct toward the Numa Palace which was there in a ring of fire. He also learned, from some who had escaped, that the  inmates, deeming themselves secure, had not essayed to leave until too late.
               Titus saw the splendid pile afar off, glowing like a city of gold, in the light sent up by the red flames from all parts of the Palatine. Bernice might be there! He was frantic. Unmindful of the troops awaiting his orders, he was dashing along the flame-canopied streets that  intervened, when Julius arrested him.
               "Titus, to the Lupercal! that way is left!" shouted Julius, as he caught the rein of Titus and drew his steed to an archway that led in another direction, but not before empowering one of his captains to take command, and act as had been ordered, directing their operations toward the foot of the Esquiline. Titus passively followed, trusting to  one who for the time was calmer than himself. By circuitous  ways, through peril's midst, yet many times where the dissolving element had exhausted all trace of habitation,  they drove full speed. Emerging at last at the foot  of the blazing Palatine, where the caverns of the Lupercal opened from its bowels, they alighted, and turned their  steeds loose. Without question, Titus followed Julius into a tomb, or what had been one; this gave ingress to a succession  of others until the light of day was lost in a narrow winding passage, leading gradually upward. They shot along with inconceivable rapidity, considering the  darkness—Julius again and again calling, to assure himself that Titus followed. After some time they came to a sudden halt, when Julius bade Titus assist him to lift a bar that had grown rusty from disuse, and which they easily distinguished  by the sense of touch, crossed upon some barrier to their way. It yielded, and a creaking door fell back, making loud echoes above, by which Titus knew he was gaining an outlet. A flight of steps led them to a wider space, and Julius informed him they were in the vaults  beneath the palace, from which they emerged in the under apartments of the palace-wing that had once pertained to the Empress Octavia. By wrenching bolts and forcing an entrance, they soon found themselves in the unused  chambers of that unhappy woman, now reeking with smoke, but yet untouched by the encroaching fiend that gradually drew nearer with its lapping tongue. To that part of the building farthest from the flames Titus and Julius deemed it best to hurry, for the wailings of despair already reached them from that quarter.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVIII.
               BURIED ALIVE.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "'Twas his own voice—she could not err—
                           Throughout the breathing world's extent,
                           There was but one such voice for her,
                           So kind, so soft, so eloquent!"
                        
                     
                     —MOORE.
                  
               
               BY the spurting fountains of an inner court, whose foliage and tender blossoms were already withered in the simoom air, the inmates of the palace awaited death; they had but little hope of succor, and that little was fast  declining into despair.
               Titus knew by its wealth of beauty whose head lay half lost in the wet cushion, by the rim of a marble fount, whose jet was doing its best to allay the overpowering heat. He had seen the party from a window of the upper room, and snatching up the light bed-covering as he passed, he was prepared to envelop the almost unconscious maiden in a wet sheet; and, taking her in his arms, made direct for the vaults, which Julius had taken the precaution to close, lest the smoke should permeate the underground channel.
               Titus placed Bernice upon the stone curb that rimmed the ponderous and inclined door. He tried in vain to lift it, until Julius with the whole party came up. There were old men, maidens, and mothers with their children—not a very large party, for many had fled to be consumed in flight; others with the first alarm had taken wing, and perhaps were safe.
               The screams of riderless steeds and harnessed chariot-horses  that had been drawn out in the outer court too late for flight, was intensely horrible to the human cortege that entered the narrow subterranean descent in utter darkness, leaving the noble animals to their fate.
               At the foot of the steps, where a landing gave wider space, Bernice requested to be placed upon her feet,  removing from her face the wet covering, which was now  useless. She was bewildered: the voice that called her name as she lay in a half stupor of despair, was still  speaking words of cheer, low and earnestly, and pleading for an assurance that she was revived and conscious, and would permit him yet to bear her on. She declined, feeling herself  able to relieve her deliverer of so great a burden and drawback to their progress.
               He, however, led her, and supported her where there was need, until the long labyrinthine passage led them into the more open tombs, when, in exhaustion, her head lay upon his shoulder and his arm encircled her. Julius approached and whispered in his ear something which detained him until the last person had passed and disappeared in the outer tombs; then turnings to the wall and rapping thereon, a panel was heard to slide, and Julius led them into a small cavern; and, producing a tinderbox, struck a light and lit a lamp that stood upon the table in the centre. It was the same spot visited by Titus in his nocturnal visit to the astrologer Magus.
               Bernice was seated; and in the glare of the bright lamp she turned her eyes to meet those of Titus. He noticed the bound of joy into her eyes as now she recognized him; though he said, as if doubting, while her hand lay a yielded tenant of his own:
               "Hast thou remembered me?"
               The lamp-light had fallen at first on a pale, weary face, but now it was lit, radiant, as her exhausted energies with intemperate leaps of joy sprang into gushing life; but she did not answer.
               "Thou dost not remember me," said Titus, pretending not to understand her emotion, that he might draw her out to some expression by which he might judge of how she wished to meet him.
               "Oh, how could I forget?" was stammered rather than spoken, and then, as if alive to her full self, she added, "but where hast thou been caged so long?"
               Titus shook back his clustering curls, and rising rather haughtily, placed himself beside her on the low settle, as he said with a disappointed air, "My bays are withered indeed,  since thou dost not know. But thy safety demands little tarry here; and, what time remains to me, think me not presumptuous in seeking to know if thou hast received my letters—letters of recent date. I know, for a while thou didst deign to notice the billets of a too-daring boy. When that notice ceased, he grew proud in grief and went to win a name. Fame yet eludes him, since she has never trumpeted that name into thy ears, crowned to the full by deeds his boyhood longed to do."
               "My ears have not been closed, I must confess; but, to thy query, which interests me more nearly, I answer, nay! for since the proud son of Vespasian disdained my love-token,  cast at his very feet in the arena, I have not dared to hope my humble self remembered."
               "What meanest thou? On that day when last I saw thee in the Circus Maximus, a token fell to my feet; but thine eye rested on one who claimed it, and I cast it in his face, where I afterward threw my gauntlet. Was it then meant for me?"
               "It was: true, I turned my eyes away to avoid the  scrutiny of others, and for a moment may have glanced on Caius Angus; I saw not what followed. When I turned my eyes again my poor token lay in the dust, and thou wert moving away flushed and angered; I knew not why, and dared not ask."
               
               "Ah!" exclaimed Titus, seizing her hand while his eyes and face grew rich with hope and love; "had I but known so much, what wild, untutored love would have betrayed itself in song beneath thy lattice that night! The poor youth had sent the week in framing verses, warm and flaming, to send his heart in them, when in madness he tore the inoffensive parchment where he had painted his soul. He wrote another, full of jealous frenzy—say, came it to thy hand?"
               "Never. I heard no more until rumor said thou wert in love with fame. Then I hated her, since I, poor  castaway, was left for such a wanton."
               "Didst thou so? How wide of the mark! Each stroke     that brought her favors upon me, was made, not for fame, but Bernice, without whose love, fame will be as wayside dust. But these moments pass into the 'unreturning.' Once more, Bernice, assure me that the soldier is as dear to thee as the pale student of Valley Villa."
               Bernice laid her soft palm on his hand as she answered  hurriedly, for the sound of wheels and prancing steeds was heard approaching, indicating that Julius was returning with a vehicle to convey them away.
               "Do not doubt me again: sure, thou wilt not now; and oh! believe that the boy-student's measure of love, repaid in full by mine, and prized above all else my girl-heart knew, yet reaches not one-millionth part of the high esteem wherein Bernice holds the soldier's vows."
               The heart of Titus sent the blood so tumultuously through his veins at this reply, that his frame quivered intensely,  and he, forgetting time and place, drew her to his bosom. Then, taking both her hands, he said: "Bernice, kneel here with me. I would bind thee to me beyond the power of death to disunite."
               She, half frightened by his impetuosity, yielded to the     action of his hand, and they knelt face to face, while he improvised the invocation, repeated after him by Bernice, their eyes raised as if piercing beyond the stone roof that confined their vision.
               "Attend, O ye gods! and Thou, Supreme of all, and holding all in Thy mysterious palm, hear! for Thou art present! and do Thou by thy mightiest links bind our  beings, body and soul, into an eternal one, despite of man's decrees, or fate, or death! beyond even Thine own awful power to unknit! To this end we devote us! By all things known and unknown, material and immaterial—by men and gods, and by infinitude and Thyself, essence and indweller thereof! hear Thou, and ratify, that this is my wife—forever, and forever!"
               "My husband," echoed Bernice, "forever and forever!" and she fell forward into the arms of Titus. The place had heaved around them, and now the walls and roof came crushing in, while a rush of sounds like the crash of  concussed worlds, stunned the two beings buried up beneath the Palatine.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIX.
               CONSTERNATION.
               
                  
                     
                        The sight of our treasure
                        Shall give us great pleasure;
                        We'll count it, and clink it, and jingle it well.
                     
                  
               
               NERO was quartered in the Agrippa Palace. His own imperial residence was blackened with the ruin that  had swept away nearly one-fourth of the Eternal City. The fire was now stayed at the foot of the Esquiline, by the  exertions of the green-bannered bands that had come from the  mountains, and overpowered the wretches that had spread the flames and resisted those who succored the people.
               Nero was waiting in a private chamber, evidently expecting  some one, by the anxious attention given to every  sound that floated through the palace. Some laggard was  trying his patience.
               Though every sense was on the alert, Simon Magus stood behind his chair before Nero was aware that any one had centered, and was the first to speak.
               "Why hast thou been importunate? Have I not done well?"
               "Very well, good Magus!" replied the monarch, startled entirely out of his ease. "My coffers are full. Magus, thy statue in the Tiber shall be refitted, and thy worshippers protected by royal edict. Thou, truly, art greater than a  god! Thou turnest all things to gold. See that black mass yonder where my palace stood! That must arise and burn with gold, until it seemeth like the sun. Thy art will do it; and I will call it my 'golden house'!"
               "Then, if thou art so deeply gratified, why do I find thee thus ghastly—excited? I see thy soul is troubled."
               "Oh! Charon has borne back my mother's shade to torment  me, or, it may be, some spirit of thy power, too loosely reined, has made escape, and mocked me with a fantasy, here in this palace built by the old line of Agrippa."
               "What manner of look had it—the shade—the ghost of Agrippina?"
               "As if it had been my grand-dame. Loving and forgiving, as my mother sometimes was to me, so looked the phantom."
               "Then it should not irk thee, since thou hast so oft  importuned my power to bring her back, if but on the wing of a moment, that thou mightest feel thyself forgiven."
               "I did so; but now, with this most stupendous crime upon my soul—this crime I dare not name—while the fury which I hear surging up from the ruin of yon flame-ocean where Rome was, threatens with its awful front, until the fires seem one vast Phlegethon through which I must pass to Tartarus—her face must come to remind me of crimes that are past, and have been of sore ruth, this many a day. Hand me thine elixir, pray!"
               The bad monarch and worse son trembled as he held the goblet indicated to his lips. He drank deeply of a draught that had been prepared before by Magus. As he felt himself revived, he continued speaking:
               "What meaneth the outcry about yon pool of fire? Why, how came the populace to butt at me? and, tell me, good Magus, how must I appease and smooth its frowns?"
               "By filching deeper from its treasure hoard!" said the astrologer, suggestively.
               "Tell me what thou meanest!" asked Nero, ever ready to receive advice of that order, but puzzled to know what Magus meant by the implication conveyed in his words.
               
               "Propose to remove the rubbish left by the fires—to bury the dead carcasses at thine own expense. There are  chests of treasure—fire-proof coffers—yet beneath the ruins, that have escaped thy trained robbers, closely as they  have pilfered," said Magus, in a cool and steady tone.
               "My trained robbers? Mine? Dost thou echo in my very chamber the song of yonder base multitude? Dost thou? Know that I am still Nero, and have racks!"
               "For things like thyself, perhaps! Magus would not feel them!" said the astrologer, half hissingly.
               "Art thou then invulnerable, like the gods?"
               "I am Magus, and have an altitude above the gods thou namest, as great as they hold above thee! Let us not prate. Thou hast burnt thy capital, and the people cry for vengeance. Thy crime is past recall, and as it is so, I have told thee how thou mayest appease whom thou canst not remunerate. I propose to profit by thy crime. I must have gold to produce gold, gems to multiply gems. If Nero would reap the harvest, let him furnish seed, and I promise to multiply it a hundred-fold. Do as I propose, to salve the wounded populace; and lay the crime at the door of the Christian sect, that encumber thy provinces too abundantly."
               Nero had listened eagerly, and saw at once the deep policy involved in the measure. He could destroy the enemies of Magus, and relieve himself of the odium he  had incurred; and then—oh, those buried hoards!—he would make them his own!
               "I will do it!" and Nero arose and paced the floor,  rubbing his hands with extreme satisfaction; "and to show them—this growling populace—how zealous I am, in its service, I will turn loose the dogs of my vengeance at once upon that race. Magus, thou art greater than a god! Thou art Nero's friend!"
               "Short-sighted fool!" was the comment of Magus, as he left the Presence. "Yea, persecute them, for they are mine enemies—inimical to my pretensions to the Messiahship,  which I shall enforce in addition to the petty crown Piso promises—all too small for Ansermo's brows—yet, by it will he ascend higher. Since the Jews look for their Shiloh among the princes of the earth, rejecting the lowly-born, I will gratify them when the time seemeth good.
               "Yea, Nero, sweep mine enemies from my path, since it will also hasten thy fall! Build thy towers, and spread thy palace-roofs, burnished with the stuff that simulates gold; while the people's treasures thou pilferest lie safe at 'Castle Crag' for them and me, while Piso revels in the 'golden house' thou buildest. I must to Jerusalem, when this job is done; for a suitor payeth court to Agrippa's sister! Soft, Bernice, I will be there!"
               The astrologer Magus had not been seen to leave the palace, but a man in the livery of the household came near stumbling over Julius, who was mounting the principal stairs. An interchange of question and answer passed between  them, when a bustle at the door drew their attention, and was ascertained to be the arrival of Domitia, who had followed her son almost immediately after his departure.
               The two on the stairs gathered that Titus had not arrived at the palace with Bernice. Where, then, were they? He had not seen then since he had sent a vehicle to convey them from the vaults.
               Julius was in the garb of an imperial guard off duty, and, mingling with the household, he mentioned the fact that Titus had been last seen with the fugitives from the burning palace of Numa. Some were there who had not tarried in the vaults, and who attested to the statement.
               Mother Antonia was there. She owed her salvation to the fact that she was out on her rounds of mercy, when the fire swept between her and all chance of return.
               Nero was enraged with Poppœa that she manifested no anxiety as to the safety of Bernice, and boxed her ears in presence of the household, and of others, who had gathered in commiseration, about Domitia.
               It was now the hour for tryst at the Lupercal. Julius had come to accompany Titus—but where was he? Wherever  he was, Julius felt certain of meeting him at the Lupercal,  and, watching his chance, he gave Domitia a token, and told her that he would soon return with Titus, or with news from him.
               He then took his way to the Lupereal. Appalling  destruction lay on every side. He skirted the foot of the Palatine through ruin and desolation that was not there when he had trodden it last. He came to the tombs of the cavern. They were buried up beneath the fallen towers that had once stood above them!
               While he waited, thinking what course he should next pursue, a woman, creeping from the ruins near by, informed him when the towers had fallen, and then a great fear fell upon him that Titus and Bernice had not escaped in time.
               He turned to the stand of the charioteer whose services he had engaged to bring his friends from the vaults, and learned that the fallen towers had frightened his horses just as he paused at the tomb, which alone had saved his own life from the destruction that had surely fallen upon his friends.
               Julius engaged him to procure men to clear away the mountain of stone above the cavern's mouth, and hastened himself to the Agrippa Palace with his account. Domitia was cold and white, but instantly gave orders for workmen to be summoned, and herself preceded them.
               Julius knew that he could penetrate to them by an avenue known only to a certain few; and perhaps he might find them alive if the roofs had held good. He took his way toward the ruins of the Numa Palace.
               Antonia had once or twice forgotten herself in her  excitement, and startled Poppœa as by a voice from the dead; but regaining self-control as quickly, Poppœa looked not a second time to the veiled woman with so harsh a voice, in which tone Antonia usual spoke.
               She did not accompany those who followed the laborers with their picks, crows, and other implements for removing the stones, but, passing into the streets, she walked some distance, and then obtained a cabriolet and was driven to the Capitoline and toward the Tiber. She dismissed the vehicle and pursued her way through by-lanes, until she came to a hut on the Tarpeian.
               An old man sat in the door; on seeing her, he arose and was about to kneel, when a peremptory sign arrested him; and he only stood aside and let her pass into the hut before him.
               When next seen, these two were in at small boat on the Tiber, at the foot of the Tarpeian.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXX.
               LIFE UNDERGROUND.
               TITUS and Bernice we left buried beneath the Palatine, close pressed upon by the incrushing walls of the cavernous tomb. They were safe; but confined, and in darkness. Afraid to move lest some fragment of the still trembling walls might be unloosed upon them, Titus held Bernice as she had fallen, for some time, trying to instil hope and fortitude, though he felt but little himself. He had heard the chariot approaching just before the catastrophe;  but he heard it also speed past, as if flying for life, at the very moment that roaring sound broke upon them. Might they not be forgotten in the awful confusion of Rome? Julius had promised to send a vehicle, not bring one. He was to join his command at the Esquiline,  without returning.
               One hope had Titus. He moved his hand along the utmost limit of his enclosures, to find some crevice of egress. he was afraid to touch a stone of the pile that lay between them and what had been the cavern's door, leading into the outer tomb. Night and day must have gone and come again, before they gave over that hope.
               "Bernice," said Titus, "dost thou know why I have  bound my soul in such sure bonds as by the oath we  uttered?"
               "I thought it almost unseemly, Titus; but was borne along by the earnestness and truth I saw in thee, and the strange enthusiasm of thy manner. Indeed, it was the out-spoken  wish of my own soul, for I know that in the world  above, there are those who may try to separate us. The thought but just crossed me that it were better, far better, to be here, to die here together, than in the happiest spot the upper world can give without thee, Titus. Dost thou think the gods were angry, and thrust this fate upon thee and me for our impiety? The all that irketh me is, that thy freshly new career is stayed, and if we die here, I lose the joy of seeing thee the tallest pillar of the state, the brightest of Rome's bright glories: but for this, I would deem the gods had smiled, in that we should die together."
               "Do not talk of dying. It will not come to that. My mother's care watcheth. She would pick through hills of adamant to find her son. We may lack food to the craving of it, that is all. We will not suffocate—the air comes freely. But, Bernice, thou love of Titus, when we are released  from this, think not we will be left to love as we will. There is a current swelling in the affairs of state that may press us asunder, or so aim to do, and this is it that I wish to be bound to thee beyond the power of man or gods to undo. Beneath the floor of this tomb lie the relics held most sacred by Romans. We knelt above them, and cannot undo what we have done, if we would.
               "In two days from this, I was to have knelt on the same spot and taken vows little less sacred. Those who were to meet me here will come, and upon them I rest my hope of release; finding their altars buried up, they must needs find means to reach the sacred relics.
               "I am thy husband, and thou wilt not mention what I leave spoken. When we are free, we will send to thy uncle Agrippa, and to thy mother Mariamne, who will not refuse us the formalities of thine own faith, so that forms of  outward show shall not be wanting to ratify the vows we have taken, since all shrines are alike to me."
               While he was speaking, Bernice had caught a faint current rent of air as her hand passed over a part of the wall. Calling the attention of Titus to it, he examined minutely, and found a small crevice that indicated a nearness to some opening. Titus pushed heavily against a block of stone. It fell outward: another and another was removed, until he could pass through into what seemed a confined passage. Both were weak from hunger and watching, but Titus managed to lift Bernice through the opening, and felt that she was safe, as the roof above appeared to be solid stone. Bernice was too exhausted to explore this passage with Titus, and he would not leave her; but when she had fallen asleep, with her head upon his shoulder, he gently undid his doublet, and taking it off, folded it, and laying her down softly, placed it under her head. He then made an effort to ascertain his surroundings. The Palatine and the Capitoline  were full of quarries made by man, as well as natural caverns. Titus found himself descending, and felt assured that the direction was not toward the palace, but toward the marsh that lay between the Palatine and the Tiber. He could not leave Bernice long. He returned, and, with his hand but touching hers that she might not awaken and miss him, he lay down also and slept. When they awoke, the last drop of wine in the small flask that Titus bore in his doublet was drunk, to enable Bernice to accompany Titus in his search for an outlet. How long they had slept, or how long they wandered, they had no means of knowing, but, exhausted at last in a narrow pass, Titus made a pillow of his own breast for Bernice, and propped himself against the close walls, that he might hold her securely in case his weariness should overcome his  watching. He did not wish to sleep. He was a soldier, and had fasted often for days. It was not hunger that unstrung  him, but the terrible excitement of that awful night, and  the weary, tangled way he had threaded. The whole circuit cuit of the hill did not seem so long as that labyrinth, twisting and changing in direction until he had no idea of his situation in regard to points of the compass. In no part had he been able to stand upright; but crawling, pushing up and down, he had drawn Bernice along, sometimes resting as her comfort required. Certain was he that he passed over the same ground more than once. But he held Bernice in his arms, his own; the boy's dream was  realized, the man's hope resolved into certain bliss. Thoughts of this passed through his mind as he reclined against the hard stone, and felt the gentle beating of Bernice's heart near his own, and heard the softly rustling breath that told him how sweetly she slept on the bosom that loved her.
               A light flashed upon his eyes and awoke him, for Titus had slept long and soundly. Mother Antonia had found them. They were in a labyrinth with which she was  acquainted. Bernice's awakening was joyful.
               A basket of food hung on the old man's arm who accompanied  Antonia, of which the hungry pair were allowed to partake sparingly. Then, by what ways it matters not, they were led to a channel that gradually approached the light, but grew deeper, and at last covered with water. It led to one of the deep drains, cutting the marsh to the Tiber. They there entered a boat, and, between the high banks of the drain covered with thick marsh-shrubs, made their way to the Tiber, to the foot of the Tarpeian. A secret entrance conducted them by steps through and up, until they emerged in the old man's hut. Agrippina enjoined them to keep their manner of deliverance secret, and sent them to join their friends, who waited at the Agrippa Palace.
               Domitia could, in common with other Roman mothers, say to her first-born, when buckling on his shield, "Come with it, or on it;" but when dancer's stern front appeared in any other quarter than the battle-field, she was nerveless  as the simple and soft-hearted mothers that milked the goats of her valley farm. She did not recover from the effects of her suspense, that made the two hours of Antonia's  absence assume the proportions of years, for weeks; and then she was accompanied to Valley Villa by Antonia and Bernice. Titus soon after left for a campaign of months, in pursuance of orders he had received from his father.
               When Nero learned that Bernice had left the capital, he demanded her return, and Domitia was left alone, as she could not be induced to live at Rome, though Vespasian had a house there.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXI.
               JERUSALEM.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Yet on that day, meseems, the golden thread
                           Grows even closer, as the years have sped
                           Since that fair morn—I reckon not beyond—
                           That we were wed!"
                        
                     
                     —GARDETTE.
                  
               
               ON Jerusalem's towers and minarets the morning looked aslant. Moriah's dewy places were all endiamonded; its glowing brow englowed more gorgeously by the glorious temple, that, like a star, blazed beyond the eastern horn of Akra's crescent.
               Tiny patens of gold, sifted through a vine-lattice, lay on the Mosaic pave of a balcony, where a young mother trilled a lay to her first-born.
               She was more lovely in, maternity than when we knew her as the sad maiden of Mountain Villa.
               Agrippa had not returned from Cæsarea, where he had gone to stay the excitement between the Greeks and Jews, that was culminating fearfully.
               Although Berytas was the chief city of Agrippa, Claudia had chosen to spend the first months of her motherhood in Jerusalem, where the first days of wifehood had passed so happily that her girl-dreams of wedded bliss were  over-leaped of actuality.
               Her new motherhood was yet more holy and sweet; and cheery as a bird-song was the outgushing of her heart in that early morning.
               She wore a robe of fine white linen, girded with a blue silken scarf. A triple row of pearl and amethyst embraced her throat, and was fastened in front by a bunch of violets. She sat on a cushion on the low sill, toying with the palm of her infant, that kicked the drapery from its little feet as it lay in a snowy nest of a wicker cradle just within the room. It tossed its plump arms in glee at its mother's motions—cooing, or opening its large, black eyes in wonder, at some peculiar trill of her matin song.
               The baby-boy was six months old. Its hair was golden as its mother's—wavy around the white brow, but curling decidedly about its fat rosy neck. Its eyes had caught the hue and look of Agrippa's; and when Claudia would study their bright, earliest depths, her heart o'erfilled with those exquisite and blissful sensations known only to wifehood when her fondness can trace in her offspring semblance of the man she loves.
               The room was a summer pavilion; silk curtains of Kermes dye mingled with Tyrian purple, were festooned to a line of marble pillars running on two sides, balustered  with low trellis. Here and there were openings to balconies.  From the lofty ceiling of sky-blue porcelain swung flower-vases and rich bird-cages. The floor was checkered  marble, and covered here and there with crimson matting,  fringed with blue and gold.
               The cool air was heavy with odors coming up from the vale of Hinnom, whose beautiful gardens still lay asleep in the hill-shadows.
               The tiny captives in their gilded prisons twittered and, carolled as the beautiful mother filled all the morning air, with low sweet melody as she sang:
               
                  
                     The gloaming and the starlight,
                     The skylark's matin song,
                     Still find me watching, waiting;
                     Thy sire tarries long:
                     Yet, the wild bird trilleth sweetly
                     Into this heart of mine;
                     'T is that his eyes, my baby,
                     Are looking out of thine.
                  
                  
                     The gloaming and the starlight,
                     The skylark's matin song,
                     Still find me watching, waiting;
                     Thy sire tarries long:
                     Yet the perfume of the citron-tree
                     Makes glad this heart of mine;
                     'T is that his eyes, my baby,
                     Are looking out of thine.
                  
                  
                     The gloaming and the starlight,
                     The skylark's early lay,
                     Would find me watching, waiting,
                     All cheerless through the day:
                     No song-bird and no odors
                     Could reach this heart of mine,
                     Did not his eyes, my baby,
                     Look on me out of thine.
                  
               
               The tenderness of the last lines changed to a glad  triumph when, repeating them, she caught her baby from its wicker bed, and covered its face with kisses. As she raised her face, her eyes met the eyes of her lover-husband, out there, at the end of the colonnade. In another moment,  wife and child were in his arms. The leap between the higher balcony and the high colonnade was something perilous, but he made it safely.
               Agrippa had left his train, by light, at their night  station, and galloped off unattended, hoping, by means of a private key, to steal upon the slumbers of his wife, that he might witness her awakening and surprise, to find him there, as humbler husbands have joyed to do before and since. He was hastening to her apartments, when her voice and position arrested him. Leaning against a pillar, he contemplated his treasure, while his dark eyes, by their scintillated joy, showed the full content of his heart. He knew not that he was making a splendid feature in a picture presented to two promenaders on the upper terrace.
               Alexis, being compelled to leave early for some duty in a distant city, had requested to see Mona, in the apartments  of Claudia, that they might confer of their nuptials. Claudia had sent him to assist Mona gather her flowers while the dew was on them; and they had just lifted a basket heavy with blossoms to the upper terrace and sat down on the stone flags to rest, and moreover to talk,  unrestrained by the presence of others.
               Alexis had applied to Agrippa for the hand of Mona, in whose care she had been placed by Julius when he gave his Samaritan home for her use.
               Mona had refused Alexis many times; but when he at last convinced her that he would be satisfied with the high equality of mere respect with which she regarded him, she gave Agrippa leave to draw up writings of betrothal, and herself agreed to a tryst in Claudia's apartments.
               The fortunes of Alexis had been advanced, until he might mate with the haughtiest damsel in the realm; but he chose only the little hand lying there on the dewy  blossoms, with not as gerah in its gift.
               Julius had been consulted with regard to Mona's  espousals. He had only written: "I dare not advise thee, Mona." "I have no right to deny thee, Alexis." Agrippa was gratified, but Claudia looked sternly and coldly upon them both, when they came in; and Mona twined a fresh garland  about the baby's wicker bed, and scattered rose-leaves on the white pillows, before Claudia's brow unbent.
               Alexis drew the king away upon the colonnade, for he had much to say of state matters before the breakfast hour. Many things of painful interest were discussed  relative to the disturbances and dissatisfactions of the people; some of which arose concerning the marriage of the king; but so general was the confusion that comparatively few knew that the king was married at all.
               The doors of the breakfast-hall were heard to open, and the gathering of the guests came to the ears of the hungry king, but Alexis talked on. The king advanced to the door nearest them, and Alexis followed a step or two, then stopped, leaning upon his sword-sheath, with an air that said plainly, "I have a mystery on my mind," and was so understood by Agrippa, who placed one arm akimbo, and struck the palm of his other hand against the pillar at the door, resting his elbow on the top of the base, with one foot upon the plinth, in an easy attitude, knowing very well that the brain of Alexis was "laboring," and, though it might bring forth only "a mouse," the chances were that he would be detained beyond his patience.
               Alexis frowned at the amused smile on the king's face, which was often thus when he expected to be bored;  nevertheless, Alexis would do his duty, as he always did,  regardless of ridicule or anger.
               "I saw a man but now in the eastern garden. He doth not belong to the palace, or, if he doth, he hath no business there. His aspect is foreign."
               "Some lover of my wife's maidens, doubtless; but it must not occur again. They may find elsewhere for  love-tryst than in my queen's private gardens."
               "He was not tired like a simple follower of thy wife's damsels; nor, indeed, a Jew. One such form have I seen only. I suspect—"
               "A gerah for thy suspects!" and the king went off rapidly, as if fearing that Alexis would finish his remark with something sufficiently potent to detain him against his will.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXII.
               THE LANGUAGE OF GEMS.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Why, what read you there
                           That hath so cowarded, and chased your blood
                           Out of appearance?"
                        
                     
                     —SHAKSPEARE.
                  
               
               OH, Zephyrus comes so boldly up from moonlight ramble,  with the daughters of Cloris, about the lonely heritage  of Hinnom!" said Bernice, the widow of Herodes, as the night-breeze chased the heat from her bared brow, and fluttered back the crimson scarf, all crystal-frosted, that lay over but did not hide her hair, that was done up in a jet bandeau like a crown about her brow, upon which lay a circlet of garnets, looking fiery in the lamplight. She was not young, but her cheek was dappled with the rose of youth's freshness.
               Bernice spoke in answer to Alexander the Alabarch, who chided her with aiming to throw off his company by  wanderings thus to the lower balcony, while her guests were assembled at the upper end of the pavilion, enjoying the  performances of the dancing-girls on the illuminated green of the gardens below.
               Bernice, wearied with the idealess nothings of her guests' conversation, had stolen away to her own musings. She had something to think of. There was a stranger in the crowd, introduced by Alexander. The man had nothing about him, any way, to command attention, except the royalty of his movements. His face was of the rubicund order, showing him to be a most devoted adorer of Bacchus. His hair and beard were of a reddish brown, and crispy. Bernice was thinking of him!
               Urged by Alexander, she returned to the company, and was soon seated among them, with the stranger near her footstool.
               Bernice wore a long crimson robe over a white silk skirt heavily wrought with silver-thread, and encrusted, like her scarf, with crystals. Jewels sparkled on her arms, from which the full open sleeves fell away as she reached to  receive a small box of gems from a servant who had brought it at her bidding, that she might show some peculiar  property of amber—perhaps its electrical powers.
               "Canst thou read the language of gems?" said the stranger, selecting one from the box and placing it on his palm. There seemed little in the question or action,  except its rarity. Yet Bernice started, as if stung with pain.
               She was too schooled in the art of seeming to lose her self-possession longer than her quick will chose to recall the color to her cheek. Her hand, however, was unsteady, as, dropping her questioning glance from the face of her interrogator, she chose red spinelle from the box and laid it beside the emerald in the stranger's hand, saying carelessly:
               "Ah, I learned something of that in Pontus."
               The man's face was impassible. It wore nor smile nor frown as he turned the gems about with the point of a  bodkin taken from the box.
               Bernice's respiration became exceedingly labored as she watched the action of his hand, as he laid a flaming ruby beside the rest.
               Her hand pressed upon her brow for an instant, and then wandered to a garnet set of her bracelet, while a white rim that had gradually appeared about her mouth grew more intensely white.
               The man tossed the gems he held back into the box, and with the bodkin touched the fiery set of a ring upon his own finger—its emblem—"I pursue my vow."
               Bernice's eyes followed the motion, and seemed to be fascinated to the last degree, as they rested for many moments on the ring. It seemed she would never tire looking at it. She arose with glittering eyes, saying:
               "I acknowledged defeat. In truth, it has been so long since I played the game."
               The stranger arose also, and said:
               "Come, I will show thee a curious thing of this ring."
               And, stepping within a recess where a lamp hung low, Bernice followed. The curtains were parted away; but, it might have been accident, something dislodged them, and they swept from their fastenings and fell to the floor, concealing  them from observation, just as the man, taking a small dagger from his belt, touched its point to the setting of the ring. It flew upward, and a coil of fine steel wire, shot upright, cloven at the point like a serpent's tongue, and quivering in the lamplight.
               Bernice looked bewildered, gazing, not at the ring, but up to the face of the man, who, with a practised touch, shut down the set with a sharp click, and stooping to her ear, uttered, "Bernice!"
               She pressed her hands hard together, looking close into eyes we have seen before, but never so magnificently bright, so softly beautiful as they appeared above the mask he let fall from his face, in answer to the unspoken demand of her eye.
               "The olden tryst by the olive—shall I see thee there?"
               "I will send to thee there an hour hence," and Bernice motioned for the curtains to be lifted, and went back to the company, who saw nothing in all this worthy of second thought.

                           "Until at last like autumn leaves
                           They lie, a faded, withered pile
                           O'er buried youth."
                        
                     
                     —ETHEL LYNN.
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Vows between us now
                           It skills not paying. Thou hast known my heart
                           This many a year."
                        
                     
                     —GARDETTE.
                  
               
               BERNICE waited in a small sitting-room, part  laboratory, museum, and library. Around her were gathered the implements of her daily labors, curiously mixed up with luxurious appointments.
               She listened to a faint sound coming up out of the  stillness of a long corridor that swept past her room. Soon it assumed the measured echo of footfalls. Her nostrils dilated—her throat swelled—her bosom heaved with emotions that had been acquainted only with their  prison-cell—her heart—for years.
               She lifted her brow from her palm, where it had rested for half an hour, and arose, turning her face to the door, her eyes restless and longing, striving to pierce the dark green curtains, which in another moment trembled and were lifted, as a servant admitted a guest and retired.
               The toga dropped slowly from his form to the floor, and the man in his own magnificence stood before the haughty Bernice, who, in a moment, had changed that look of yearning tenderness to one of cold dignity; her beautiful neck curving almost in disdain, as she put back his hand, proffered, at best, doubtingly, but with as haughty a lip as her own.
               "For the first time in five long years, what bringeth Ansermo to Jerusalem?"
               He folded his arms across his broad chest, and, with a movement backward, turned the battery of his wonderful eyes full upon her, and answered:
               "That which kept me ignominiously at Chalsis—that which sent me to Pontus. I am here because I am thy slave, and a willing one."
               "Since willing,"—and as she spoke, her lip uncurled of its haughtiness and her tone became tender,—"since willing, why heedless of my recall? or why, since unmindful so long, dost thou come now? and why should Ansermo deem  disguise necessary with his friends?"
               "To the last question, which I perceive is first in thine heart, I answer: Three years ago, I met thy brother. The name I then wore, the character I then sustained, will not bear introduction here,—not yet,—and upon that 'not yet' dependeth much, Bernice."
               "Ah, Ansermo, thou speakest like the Delphic Oracle, in no wise clear to dulness; but this I gather; thou art come, as of old, from wrestling with the world; thy hopes still driven from fruition by that potent 'not yet.'"
               "But soon to change to a present 'now.' Do I find thee the same?"
               "Else I had not remained husbandless in my brother's kingdom," said the woman unswervingly, as she seated herself, motioning him to do the same.
               The last question and answer involved the whole matter, and set at rest the unrest of their bosoms.
               Bernice no longer refused to lay her hand in the extended  palm that invited it. It was not relinquished until the gap of years had been filled with mutual confessions and explanations.
               The lamp shone strongly upon the pair, and Bernice caught the glitter of winter's snows beneath his cap;  throwing off which, she said looking into his face:
               "Ah, let me see the nail-prints made by the vixen fingers of thy mistress, Fame. They are not shallow, Ansermo; and thy hair! oh, where are the dark rings thou didst take from me?"—and she burst into tears.
               He was no less moved. Both felt that life, for them, had been wasted, seeking for a phantom.
               "Why heedless of my recall?" was the next question of Bernice, when she could speak at all.
               "I was weary of the existence Fate had left me; and when thou didst taunt me so cruelly with low birth, and the nature that thou saidst had not lifted me above it, I left thy face, to see it no more until I should come clothed with the might to make my vows good, which I did take upon me, as thou knowest. I should have little minded thy petulance, had I not known it sprung from principles as deep as thy love for the true and beautiful. Thou wilt not deny this?"
               "And well thou mightest have forgiven me! Had I not worshipped the god within thee, making that my whole, wealth?—and could I see the brightness and strength of thine intellect, like a conquered banner trailing in the dust, debased to make the low and vulgar wonder, as well as dupe highborn dullards, as he of Rome? This thou didst with a zest, as though thy soul were made of such poor stuff as to joy in the adulation of the populace!"
               "Thou knowest I liked it no better, Bernice; but it was the nearest way to wealth, to power, to station, to Bernice. Wilt thou deny me the culminate for which I strove?"
               "I deny nothing—I assent to nothing. Are not thy hopes still chimerical? The way has seemed long, indeed, and my widowhood an eternity."
               
               "But it hastens now into wifehood. Listen, Bernice. Though thy scorn of my enforced avocation has often  unnerved both heart and hand, I have never turned from the vow of my boyhood. 'All for Bernice,' I scribed high upon my banner, and behold, I have grown gray, grasping the standard that bears it yet.
               "In the days when I might not seek thy presence, never did I leave thee unguarded by my love. Thrice, as thou knowest, when most thou didst need me I was found  present, and not powerless.
               "Begun in my uncle's laboratory for love of knowledge, and as a pastime, I found it a key to power, this traffic in what the vulgar call magic. I have used it since to gain access where else my low fortune would have denied me. I claimed its aid, only when sunk under the weight of Nero's resentment. I had struggled over crucible and  furnace, and by midnight-lamps patiently, to bring me nearer the proud widow of Herodes; and just as the toil was over, and thou didst wait to receive the homage of my laurelled brow, one slight contortion of my face, a sneer fainter than an infant's first smile, lost me all I had won, and more—ruined those who called me friend."
               "Ah, thou didst make faces at Poppœa's dulness, then  wife to Otho; and Nero her paramour caught the meaning as he understood it, rather than as thy looks expressed. For that, he called in the honors he had bestowed on thee. Thy wealth and that of thy friends were confiscated to his private coffers, and thou to the executioner, from whom thou didst escape by connivance of the good Empress Octavia."
               "I then became associated with a confederated power of which thou knowest naught Bernice. From my hidings in dismal caverns, and many disguises, what wonder that I should conceive some plan? Was it wrong that I used my power to work on the superstitions of the vile, for the good of the Roman people—to succor those who had fallen like me? My uncle Magus was dead, but he had left a prophecy that his body, after three years, should be  resurrected and joined to his soul. His name had a power, and it was easy to take his semblance. That similitude hath been sustained perfectly, up to this hour. Thou wilt  forgive it!"
               Bernice had sat with her brow upon her hand, her face hidden by the crystal-crusted scarf that had fallen over it. She did not reply, and Ansermo continued:
               "When thou wert landed safely at Joppa, on thy return from Pontus, the married man Ansermo, sometime Celsus, went out over the earth and wrought for wealth, renewing his youthful vows, and pledging to his soul that, should he ever be loosed from the bonds that bound him to his Samaritan  wife, he would bring it to thine acceptance. My natal star burned brightly through the years that followed. I was free, and the Roman world had no gift too good for Fortune's favorite. With Nero to back my suit, I was making me ready to visit thy brother's court, when,—oh, Bernice, it was a most cruel thrust—back from the very threshold of my great hope's fruition."
               Both seemed overcome by the remembrance, and were unable to speak for some time, when Bernice, still sobbing, broke the silence:
               "Cruel, cruel; but more cruel when—when thou in  disguise of Magus came to Jerusalem in my sister Drusilla's train, and I—I alone recognized Ansermo beneath the Magian garb; and my wild joy breaking so strangely forth, they thought me crazed that Drusilla had married Felix. I let them so think, for indeed I had not loved the match, and sent for Magus under pretence to berate him for his sorceries, with which, some said, he had gained Drusilla to love Felix.
               
               "We met in this very chamber, and then, to damp my joy, thou didst confess thyself that Magus that was stirring all Samaria with his sorceries. Then I forgot thy sorrows, and only thought of thy wonderful gifts debased to vile usage. I deemed it outrage on thy soul's lofty gifts, and on mine; and did for a moment play the sharp-tongued shrew.—Oh! it was cruel, cruel, Ansermo. I crave thy pardon still."
               "The past is with the past, Bernice; so let it be. Hath thy brother ever told thee of his masquerading among the bandits?" said Ansermo, cheerfully.
               Somewhat of his being held in durance by them. Was it then thou didst meet him? Thou wilt tell me. My brother and Alexis evaded the theme; and, like a lapwing that flieth afar from the nest she would not have discovered,  they flit wide of the topic when I questioned them. Thou wilt tell me—"
               "Some day, in the sweet, quiet hours of the future, when thou sittest by my side, queen of thrice thy great-grandsire's heritage."
               "Thinkest thou then of a surety that Piso will deal thus generously by thee?"
               "Incredulity, thou shalt see!" answered Ansermo.
               Bernice rejoined:
               "Ah, I hope. But what hast thou done with Polemon's daughter?"
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXIV.
               WHAT BECAME OF POLEMON'S DAUGHTER.
               
                  
                     
                        Oh, 'mid the world's great rush and din,
                        Care without, and unrest within.
                     
                  
               
               WHAT, thou askest, have I done with Polemon's daughter? Hast thou not seen her?" was the  wondering query of Ansermo.
               "Why? How should I?" was answered, with equal surprise depicted in countenance and voice.
               "She is under this same palace-roof. I saw her as the day-spring ushered in this morning." And Ansermo eyed Bernice keenly.
               "Then it must be the girl Mona?"
               Ansermo replied by an affirmative nod, and Bernice continued, in a musing tone:
               "No wonder! no wonder that her brown eyes called up such spectres! Why send her here?" she concluded, turning reproachfully to Ansermo.
               "It was a bungle of my stepson's. He hath ever loved the girl, and, thinking it without my knowledge, posted her here, that he might wrest her from the life she led."
               "Ansermo! The priestess of thy pageantries—was she, then, Alvah?" exclaimed Bernice.
               "She was. Hast thou any interest in her fate?"
               "Nay—so that Polemon remain as childless as he would have made me. Shape Alvah's destiny as thou wilt, so the pang is rendered life-long in him with which my heart was torn when I saw the sails lessening that bore my darlings away, nor knew until then of the foul purpose to embark the children."
               "Polemon knew little of the race of Herod when he thought to put the hatches on thy will. I did not forgive his luckier star until—"
               "Until when, Ansermo?"
               "When I held thee to my heart in the rocking boat, while the rowers pulled for dear life toward the ship, and thou didst tremble with fright lest Polemon should have aroused him in pursuit. Thou didst call me thy friend—thy brother; but oh! Bernice, I knew that I was more to thee than friend or brother; and that dark hour of midnight  was a full compense for all the triumphs of Polemon—his luckier stars!"
               Bernice's thoughts were evidently wandering to some other subject, some loose ends of which she seemed to have picked up, winding them off thuswise:
               "His natal star played the watcher well, that the ring, whose use thou didst teach me as a mere nice contrivance, did fail in its office in my skilless hands, when, maddened to frenzy, I aimed at the sleeper's life! I shudder yet, to think I might have murdered Polemon! O thou God of Jacob! I thank thee that I did not!"
               Bernice's frame shuddered as she spoke, ending with hands stretched upward, and eyes raised to the God she was still offending by keeping the father from his child. She did not know that the ring placed in her hands had been left there for just the purpose to which she came near devoting it. He who had said, "Keep this for my remembrance,"  knew then of the chances that would call out her fiery spirit to vengeance, and trusted to the hot blood of Herod to do what had twice been done before. Mark and Herodes had both felt the envenomed sting of the cleft tongue of steel coiled within that ring.
               The man who might have been a fixed glory in the scientific world, had he lived in another age, regarded nothing that crossed the sirocco-path of his will. He must become one among the great ones of earth before he could aspire to an alliance with Bernice—for so he had bargained with his soul; but he could not endure that his probation should be tortured by seeing her the wife of another. He had married a widow, only that her full hand would place him nearer the sphere of Bernice, even to a position in the very court of Herodes of Chalcis.
               His wife seemed on the point of dying with an incurable malady when he married her, and he did not expect her to cumber his path long; but, strangely enough, about the time of the death of Herodes she rallied, and gave some years of a mother's care to Julius and Mona. It might have been owing to the healthful region to which she had retired, choosing peace and quiet to the society of a  loveless husband, who visited her but seldom in Samaria.
               Why he did not, after securing his position, prove as  unscrupulous as he had in the cases of Mark and Herodes, was owing to the fact that he looked upon his own sex as his legitimate prey, but women as objects of his peculiar care, arising from an innate principle of his nature that caused him instinctively to choose the cause of the weak and oppressed. He was a strange compound of right and wrong; and though in the case of Mona he had been irritated  to use her roughly in one single instance, he was well apprised of her brother's intention to convey her away, and had, unknown to Julius, aided in her escape from his own power.
               As Ansermo and Bernice stood for a moment beside the yet unlifted curtains of the doorway at parting, they would have been pronounced a matchless pair.
               On lifting her head from his bosom, she appeared erect beside him, and though herself of fair proportions, the tip of her garnet coronet just levelled with the "eleven-rayed star"  glittering on his vestments even with his armpits, and her braceleted arm was almost straight across his broad chest as her right hand lay on the off shoulder.
               Ansermo's parting steps sounded adown the corridor. Bernice held her breath softly, listening, as she had done on a time when he was leaving her in anger. Five years had trampled over the hour—five wasted years for her!
               Bernice sighed deeply when she had lost the echo of his footfalls, and turned to her own private rooms; where, having unrobed without her maid's assistance, she threw on a white linen robe, took up a small chamber-lamp, and, with a wistful look in her dark eyes, proceeded to the apartment of Mona.
               The girl was asleep. Bernice held the light so that it might not fall too strongly on her face, but sufficiently to reveal the features she had not recognized, in their changed beauty. Straight hair, of a dark, rich brown, lay divided in undulating tresses over the pillow. The child Alvah's had been a rippling flow of light, but Bernice did not doubt.
               Mona's sleep was not deep. She awoke, wondering much at the intrusion; still more at the tender reminiscent look she met on the face of her who had never before paid her even ordinary attention.
               "Why hast thou come to me? Is there aught the matter?"
               "I did not mean to disturb thee, child. I could not sleep, and hoped to find thee waking yet; now I will go, so thou mayest sleep on."
               "Nay, then, I would have thee stay. It doth me good, that thou didst look upon me as I slept. I oft beguile me with the thought that my mother would have done so. When I am troubled, it sootheth me to think her spirit watcheth by me; and to-night I fell away to sleep with the sweet fancy that her spirit-palm lay cool upon my fevered head."
               "Thy mother! dost remember her?" asked Bernice, in a tender voice.
               "As the only treasure of my heart covered from all eyes, is the memory of my mother—my mother, who was associated with a life that then, methinks, was blotted from my child-memory by the awful sorrow that made my mother's death the only point to which my thought  returned through the succeeding years of childhood."
               Bernice, anxious to relieve her own consciousness of such reminiscences, drew the thoughts of Mona to the present, by remarking:
               "Thou didst speak of trouble. I did not think my noble brother had left anything undone to make his wife's friend happy."
               "He has not. I should be happy as the young birds among the citron-groves, but discontent is seeded in mine own heart, and I leave no stern philosophies to uproot it."
               "Thou hast morbid fancies, peradventure, that need a physician's care."
               "Oh, I am unreasonable. Thou knowest Alexis—Alexis—" and Mona hesitated.
               "Thou dost not love him, and yet hast agreed to wed him," said Bernice, feeling a well-spring of sympathy suddenly  bursting in her heart for the confiding girl, to whom she owed so much; and her next words were prompted by a feeling akin to a mother's:
               "Oh, child, if Alexis is satisfied, and a man of stern  integrity, peradventure thou didst right; but who tampereth with human passions standeth upon a frail lava-crust, cooled  over seething fires, that may burst in ruin upon the experimenters menters. A home-hearth unbuilt of human love is colder than the ice-plain where Boreas chases the reindeer. Though, of a truth, domestic association hath bound many a sheaf of love that else would have been ungathered; thus adding to the number of earth's pleasant homes, which is a duty in men and women, to whom God hath given what the angels enjoy not, connubial affection.—We will talk more of this. Sleep now. Sleep is such a gracious boon!"
               Bernice kissed Mona, vowing in her heart to shield and love the lonely maiden, that should never have been deserted  by her, when, after restoring the child to its mother or conniving at the mother's abduction of the child, both found an asylum in the merchantman. The mother was on her way to a secure asylum, to await a passage to her own friends in Greece, when Ansermo should be ready to sail; but her sickness made it necessary to tarry in the by-ways she had chosen, and the unhappy woman found a grave by the cot under the hill.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXV.
               JEALOUSY.
               IN the stranger of the evening, Alexis had recognized the morning promenader. He had come with the alabarch  of Alexandria, and occupied the rooms belonging to the chamberlain's suite. Alexis said no more, but kept his eyes unhooded in all that concerned the individual, who had somehow gained access to the private gardens. Once, from a distant parapet, he had seen him walking alone in Bernice's own olive-grove; but soon after, the lady herself joining him, Alexis became chagrined at his surveillance,  especially as she—the queen of court society—  received him most graciously in public, notwithstanding the man's uncouth look.
               Agrippa, hoping to gain the confidence of his turbulent subjects, concluded on an excursion through the principal cities, taking with him his sister Bernice, who was a  favorite with the people.
               She requested the attendance of Mona who had become her daily companion, and, with fitting escort beside the attendance of the alabarch and part of his train, they had compassed the cities eastward from Jerusalem, when Agrippa, finding the people too turbulent and unreasonable  for pacific measures, concluded to return by Jericho and Gilgal.
               They halted for a noontide rest along the wooded banks of the even-full Jordan. Larch, oleander, and tamarisk leaned over the low willows that trailed their branches upon the slow waters, as if reaching after the waves as they passed sluggishly.
               
               The blue water, between the close, thickly-wooded banks, looked like the carpeted floor of a dim church-aisle  canopied with cerulean crystal, so closely the blue sky seemed to fit down on the tree-tops.
               Near the gorgeous tent of Bernice, that was sheltered by interlacing trees, within the compass of the picket-guards, was an opening to a little dell, down which came a prattling  brook and leaped into the Jordan just before the  tent-door.
               Alexis, finding Bernice not within her tent when the hour for departure came, obeyed an impulse and turned his horse up the dell. The sward was soft, and gave no sound to the tread of his horse's feet as he approached the head of the rivulet. A turn of the dell brought him fall upon a twain conversing by the little fall embowered with vines trailing from the oleanders above.
               Alexis turned his horse back unperceived, nor wished to be. He was certain he had seen Bernice unveiled beside—  and it made his blood curdle to think of it—Ansermo of the Crag! The lady's hand lay confidingly on the bandit's shoulder. Her attentive eyes expressed no repugnance as she listened to his absorbing discourse. His grisly hirsute was on the bank beside them.
               Alexis, though agitated by the discovery, returned, and  immediately caused the trumpeter to sound for the  gathering of the party.
               "What did Ansermo so near Mona?" This was the burden that weighed upon him, and at last fired his  jealousy until his cheek was flamed like one drunken. He had no doubt that Ansermo's lover-like attentions to  Bernice were put on to be nearer Mona, and to furnish a chance for abducting her. He had before conceived the probability that Ansermo had loved his beautiful priestess, and that her coldness to him might be that she regretted having left him—in a moment of anger, perhaps. He had been counting the worth of the less than lukewarm affections  of Mona, and found they had not satisfied him.
               He found no opportunity of conversing with the king, and arrived at Jerusalem with his secret still piercing its vulture-beak into his heart.
               The palace had become quiet from the recent arrivals, and Alexis went out to curb his impatience by a promenade on the back colonnade of the front buildings. Below lay the garden of the court, but he saw not its beauty. The dreamy hum of the fountains soothed him not. He was blind with rage and athirst for vengeance. It seemed the kill would never leave his wife's apartments to give him audience.
               Unconsciously he turned the angle that led around to Bernice's wing of the palace, that opened on the same court. He was aroused from his torturing thoughts by the  murmur of conversation. He knew the voice of Mona, suppressed as it was, and his own suspicious fears told him whose manlier tones replied.
               The end of the colonnade was near, which he reached by only a few strides. Beyond, within a balconied recess, sat Mona, pleasantly smiling up into the face of her  companion, Ansermo. The light was pouring full upon them from a pendent cluster of lamps beyond, and within the room.
               Execution was twin-born with resolve. Alexis, unmindful  of the peril, leaped over balustrade and banister into the balcony, and clutched Ansermo by the throat, before he perceived Bernice beside Mona, with their hands clasped, upon the same seat.
               The females uttered such cries that Agrippa himself soon appeared on the scene. The brown hirsute of Ansermo  attached to his ruddy-cheeked mask lay off on the seat he had occupied, when his antagonist sprang upon him like a tiger from his jungle. Alexis was firmly held, impotently raging, by the strong grasp of Ansermo. This was what the king saw.
               Others were gathering about, when Agrippa, reading something of the matter, commanded the lookers-on to withdraw, as he placed a hand on either antagonist and urged an explanation, coupled with the command to Alexis to cease his strife.
               "At my king's command," said Alexis, restraining his efforts to regain his sword that Ansermo had sent rattling into the balcony. Agrippa thrust Alexis into the room, and interposed himself between them; then restoring the sword, Alexis departed at the king's request.
               Ansermo stood confident and defiant, with folded arms, regarding the puzzled face of Agrippa.
               Bernice read no anger in her brother's frown. It savored of awkward confusion—nothing more; yet she drew near to Ansermo, and stood ready to espouse his cause. Her eyes glittered with defiant concern, as she laid her hand on Ansermo's arm, as if to make her assumption of his cause more apparent to her brother.
               Agrippa choked with embarrassment, but looked steadily—not haughtily—not with a look of conscious power—into the flaming eyes before him, as he said:
               "Why do I see Ansermo a masquer in Jerusalem—within my very palace?"
               Ansermo's smile had a touch of sarcasm as he replied:
               "Bethink thee, king, how once thou didst baffle a like inquiry at Castle Crag."
               "No will of mine had sent me there. I had good right, therefore, to reticence; which thou hast not, or, if thou hast, it doth not appear."
               "Wert thou to find Ansermo within the circuit of thy sentries, under a false name, wouldst thou not treat him as a spy?"
               "Ha! I see thy drift; but were Ansermo now as free from ill intent as was the wearer of the false name thou wottest of, free and welcome might he come and go  throughout the circuit of Agrippa's landmarks!"
               "Now! didst thou say now?" said Ansermo, emphatically.
               "Now: what time thou wilt!" was the answer of Agrippa.
               "Hah! rankles no memory of fettered limbs—of  prison-cell?"
               "The memory irks not me: let it pass;" and the king drew a jewelled case from his bosom and extracted therefrom  a parchment-paper, saying, "When I signed this parchment,  he who stamped the warm wax with a flame-colored seal, a star, thou seest, having eleven rays, thought himself  unknown; but he was mistaken. I knew him as well at Brundusium, when I went back to claim my bride, as when I followed his formula and took upon myself some vows of odd shape and spirit. I knew thee, Ansermo, 'by the sign of the open hand, by the emblem of the  olive-branch!'—But why do I see the widow of Herodes take upon herself the freedoms of betrothal?" concluded Agrippa, while his heightened color betokened rising indignation at the act of his sister, who, still standing by Ansermo, on finding her brother acknowledged friendly relations with her lover, had glided her hand across his shoulder and gathered his dishevelled tresses back, impressing his brow with a kiss.
               "Because she hath the freedoms of betrothal," answered the proud woman, "which my brother will ratify, or be untrue to his vows."
               Agrippa shot upright from his seat, the pride of the Asmoneans stinging his face scarlet, as he thundered,  turning to Ansermo:
               
               "Who, then, art thou, that thou aspirest to be the equal of princes?"
               Ansermo smiled a little derisively, and was about to reply, when Bernice forestalled him:
               "Thou hast recognized this man as Ansermo of the Crag: know him better as Ansermo Verus, the tentmaker's  son, he whose name has been unspoken of men for long years—he who is mentioned in the compact thou  holdest as—the sworn friend, best beloved of Piso."
               While Bernice was yet speaking, Agrippa sprang  toward them, saying:
               "Here, then, I give thee this right hand," and kissed him—Ansermo—on the cheek.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXVI.
               THE UNFORGIVING.
               SOME hours of conversation ensued concerning their mutual affairs, the discussion of Piso's tardy movements,  and the instrument of writing held by Agrippa, conveying to him a surety of the enlargement of his kingdom,  and to his sworn friend and best beloved, Ansermo, all the lands between the Euxine and Mediterranean seas, west from the Euphrates, south to Mount Libanus, to have and to hold as king thereof for himself and posterity  forever, signed and sealed by Piso and the "Eleven," as it had been for three years, during which Piso's fears and dilatory preparations had three times disappointed those who stood ready to place him on the throne or die.
               Ansermo had wrought for the interests of Agrippa as well as for his own. On Claudia refusing the alliance Piso offered her and was prepared to enforce, Ansermo's next choice was to have Agrippa espouse her, as he had become well convinced that she loved the man, Marcus Aulus, before his imprisonment. So keen were the eyes he kept about him, that nothing had passed at Mountain Villa but had come under his surveillance.
               The twelvemonth passed which Agrippa had taken oath to await for his bride, without any manifestation of a  movement on the part of Piso; and, true to the conditions of Agrippa's oath, his bride was found ready for him at the appointed time. At which time Agrippa, being introduced  into the lodge of a fraternity of which he had been a member from youth, saw there many whose faces had appeared around the board at Castle Crag, and by them was furnished with sufficient reasons to induce him to join the conspiracy against Nero.
               After these things had been discussed, and the espousals of Bernice and Ansermo considered, Agrippa said:
               "All this may be well with us, but now others must be satisfied also. What claim hast thou upon yonder maiden?"  seeing Mona re-enter the room, for at the first she had gone to seek Alexis, but not finding him, had wept in her own room until, solitude under such circumstances  becoming painful, she again sought Bernice.
               "Ah, my Bernice was aiding me to plead my cause with the damsel, whose sweet forgiveness was falling like dew upon my parched repentance, when thine infuriate friend throttled me. I had nearly been forced to crush the boy, to keep my body scatheless from his drawn gladius."
               "Then I will bid him hither," said Agrippa, stepping within the balcony and calling to one he saw above on the corridor.
               Alexis soon entered, his sword springing from its sheath, his face quivering and white with the agony he had endured.
               Agrippa met and prevented him from rushing upon Ansermo.
               "What meaneth this, my king? wilt thou not lift thine interdict to my just vengeance?"
               At the moment Mona timidly approached and touched his arm. Turning fiercely upon her, he pushed her with all his force from him, so that had not Bernice's arms  received her, she would have fallen to the floor. Agrippa, angry at the unmanly act, bade him begone or listen to reason, adding:
               "Thy rage is unseemly even hadst thou cause, which thou hast not!"
               "How? Did not mine own eyes detect the guilty tryst? Did not I see her, the shameless, there, smiling into the face of her paramour? Stay not my rage. She shall have his foul heart, when I have let loose his soul from that ill bestowed clay which so pleaseth the wanton's eye." And the jealous madman would have passed the king to  Ansermo, who was standing looking on indifferently, with something of pity mingling with the cool contempt of his curled lip.
               Agrippa caught Alexis firmly.
               "Alexis, I command thee, listen! and do thou remember who it is commands thee to hold thy purpose until I have spoken; then, if thou wilt, I shall not hinder thine encounter. Take thy seat!"
               Agrippa began a hurried statement of facts, but enlarged more particularly when he saw Alexis softening to  returning reason. He soon reached a transport of sorrow and repentance as highly inflamed as his anger had been. He went to Mona and attempted to take her hand, as she lay with her face buried up in the robes of Bernice. She shrunk from him with the most eloquent disgust. The king and Ansermo essayed to plead his cause, when she answered vehemently:
               "It is enough that he did doubt me, too much that he should—should—"
               "Brand thee so foully," said Bernice, finishing the  sentence as she read it in her own mind, while her eyes flashed the indignation she felt. "Too much, my girl, and with my consent thou wilt never unite the breach he has so rudely made." Turning to her brother and Ansermo, she continued:
               "Nay, this is only the beginning to what she must endure in the event of such trumped-up espousals. She does not love Alexis, than as a friend. Men are not satisfied with such a soulless skeleton of love, which, in her, could only be tedious and cold duty in its effects.
               "He hath shown himself capable of rank disgusting jealousy, which in time will teach him tortures for her that a sane man could not dream of. Alvah! Mona! child, I will henceforth thrust myself between thee and harm! Come to my chamber, and when thy racked spirit is calmed, thine own feelings must decide: come!"
               The two went out, Bernice with arms thrown about the still weeping Mona.
               After a time, a messenger from Bernice led Ansermo to her laboratory. They conferred long concerning Mona,  acquainting her with her parentage, and laying the choice before her, to go to her father, who was become as a private man, or remain with them. She chose not her father. The wrongs of her mother were truly painted, and such a strong disgust of her father took possession of her, that she spurned the idea of ever informing him of her existence.
               They were interrupted in their conference by disturbances  without the gates, and a voice above all cried  continually:
               "Woe! woe to Jerusalem!"
               It was the voice of a maniac Christian, who had for some  time made it the burden of his ravings that the time was  near when that prophecy should be fulfilled concerning  Jerusalem and the Temple.
               "Woe! woe to Jerusalem! Thou that stonest the  prophets! thy habitation shall be desolate!" And again the  same voice would scream concerning the Temple:
               "'There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down!'"
               All night the maniac had wandered through the streets raving, and Bernice felt thrilled with dread. She had heard Paul of Tarsus, and was not so sure if Jesus were not the Messiah; and the time seemed fitting for the  consummation of the prophecy. The signs of civil outbreak in her brother's kingdom were appalling.
               Ansermo was yet in her apartment, listening to the sounds that disturbed Bernice, when, louder than all, arose a clarion summons at the principal palace-gate. It was no unusual sound, but the horn had something in its ring that startled Ansermo.
               He arose precipitately, going immediately to the rooms of the chamberlain.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXVII.
               DESPAIR.
               
                  
                     "The setting of a great hope is like the setting of the sun."
                  
               
               ANSERMO seemed greatly agitated as he entered  Alexander's apartment, saying:
               "Thou heardest the summons at the gate?"
               "I did! but little noticed it: why art thou disturbed? Thy face is—ha, Ansermo! what aileth thee?"
               "The tune yon clarion playeth is premature, and like to the boding hoot of the owl."
               "Thou knowest it, then! art sure?"
               "I know its language as I know my mother-tongue! There hath been disaster!" said Ansermo, striding the floor and striking his palms together, as one tormented with the suspense he fears to have ended.
               Steps were heard without, and Alexander flung open the door as a servant approached, saying that a courier  demanded audience of Alexander the alabarch.
               "Admit him at thy speed, Matthias!" returned  Alexander. It was perhaps half an hour—half an hour of  intense anxiety, before a man entered and stood silent until  the doors beyond, beside that which led immediately to the chamber, had been barred against intrusion, when Julius lifted his courier-cap, and greeted Alexander and Ansermo.
               "Thy news are weighty!" and Ansermo could only grasp the hand of Julius.
               "Most weighty! Piso hath proved the weak fool I thought him. He is dead, and by his own hand—scared by the fate fallen on Lucan and Seneca, who are done to death by Nero, in consequence of a traitor's tale! The eleven-rayed star hath fallen from our horizon! Long live Vespasian!
               "Now may the seven-pointed glory never set!"
               The countenance of Julius was at variance with the effect his news had produced on Ansermo, whose white face and rigid limbs were appalling. The lambent light of his  glittering eyes played upon the face of Julius, who had near quailed in terror as he repeated "Long live Vespasian!"
               The two men whom Julius addressed were dead to the enthusiasm of his own bosom—dead to all but the  disappointment that scathed the one so terribly.
               The events that so disastrously ended the league for Piso commenced at an entertainment given by Nero in honor of Vespasian's unexpected return, and whose troops lay encamped without the walls of Rome.
               Lucan had the temerity to censure the ill-made verses recited by Nero at the table, which caused his arrest. Some enemy, emboldened by the poet's disgrace, whispered in Nero's ear certain things against his loyalty, which, causing rumors, reached the ears of Piso, who immediately retired to his country house, and thinking all lost by the false reports brought him, opened his own veins, and died, with confession on his lips, but sturdily refusing to implicate  his associates. Seneca and Lucan also put an end to themselves by Nero's orders.
               Such was the substance of what Julius imparted, when he could get a hearing from Ansermo—Ansermo, who had again been thrust back from the uppermost battlement, the which to reach, he had scaled the moated walls of impossibilities, and from which he could almost have grasped the near beyond, that had bounded his vision life-long long. He fell like the weary bird of the sun, whose spent wings had failed within sight of his eyry.
               Ansermo had not entered the path to which virtue called him. Her ways seemed diverse from the object that drew his eye, and he went on stumbling into this  crime-pit, and that; reaching and looking beyond, he took no thought to the ways of his feet, and he had fallen. What had he gained? His life was in the sere of autumn. He had struggled, hoped, despaired, wrung his energies to the  last turn; and now, prone lay his proud spirit, crushed by  the accident of an hour.
               Bernice came to him, but he would not see her. He saw only the mocking shadows of Mark and Herodes, the  taunting grimaces of the childless Polemon.
               For days he remained nerveless and gloomy, and then, by the might of his will, gathered up his shattered energies and stood nerved and braced to grapple with his foe—misfortune.
               Agrippa had designed leaving Jerusalem as soon as he could obtain his wife's consent, for his chief city, Berytas. He now saw the necessity of moving his family thither with all speed, or, what would probably be better, sending  them with Alexander the alabarch to Alexandria, until  the civil contentions were allayed or culminated to actual  warfare.
               Ansermo and Julius would again join those bound to  them by mutual interests and dangers. Ansermo must find means to overwhelm Nero, or skulk in obscurity for  an indefinite time, perhaps for life.
               Julius had foreseen the overthrow of his stepfather's  schemes by the weakness of Piso, and had made it a point in the council of "The Seven" to urge Ansermo's claims,      so that the way was open for him to profit by becoming one of them; but Julius could not mention that fact to  Ansermo until he had again met the council and proposed his admittance in form.
               While Ansermo had dallied at the court of Agrippa, Vespasian had landed prematurely at Rome, or at least some weeks before Ansermo expected to meet him there, and also in advance of other confederate powers, that were to join Vespasian, and, at an appointed time, strike for the cause of Piso.
               But the whole was defeated, almost on the very eve of execution; and, strange enough, the principal conspirators were never suspected. Piso dead, Nero thought himself secure again.
               According to previous arrangements, one morning the left wing of Agrippa's palace was all in commotion. The trains of Herodes's widow were forming in the court-yard for departure.
               Her own superb chariot, to which were harnessed six white steeds, was drawn up to the flight of porphyry steps leading to the magnificent central entrance to that part of the building. Outriders in blue and silver were already mounted on snowy chargers, housed to match the riders' habiliments.
               They camped their silver bits impatient to snuff the outside air, as did the raven-black barb that stood, housed in gold and purple, trying the patience and strength of two stout grooms that held him.
               Adieus were being said in chamber and hall; and soon the veiled form of Bernice was conducted, by the masked Ansermo and her brother, down the steps and placed in the waiting chariot. Ansermo himself mounted the fiery black steed, and at the word "ready" from Bernice's  position, another chariot, containing two ladies, drew near, and the whole cavalcade moved under the arches of the circling colonnade and through the palace-gates.
               
               Outside, the alabarch waited with his guards to fall in behind the cortege of Bernice. Then the train swept on with loud trumpetings and accelerated velocity through the western gate, and across the valley toward the heights.
               Agrippa in this manner smuggled his wife and child out of his own kingdom, for a space.
               Instead of going to Egypt, as was first intended, they, having found the route dangerous from turbulent factions, turned aside and embarked with Ansermo for Brundusium; where, domesticated with the friends of Agrippa, Ansermo left Bernice, to rejoin his friends of "The Crag." The last days spent by Bernice and Ansermo were solemn,  reminiscent, soul-communing. She said to him: "We are man and woman, Ansermo; what further need have we? Let us turn into the by-way of obscurity and be at peace!"
               But he answered her:
               "Bernice, bear with me! This once again will I wrench this poor brain to another turn for the sake of my boyhood's vow, and then—then—"
               "Then—then, Ansermo, thou wilt come to me and rest!"
               "Then, Bernice, if I fail, may the gods explode this  joyless globe, on which we breathe and are tortured, into atoms no bigger than the grains of gold dust sifted here upon the purple fabric of thine apparel!"
               "Ansermo! Thy misfortunes have made thee impious! Oh! bethink thee how my father once left his country, a vagabond fugitive, weighed down by debts he could not discharge; but when he came again, behold! he was clothed in royal purple and fine linen, with the crown of his fathers upon him. I could not desire this world's destruction, while thou wert upon it—thou and my brother!"
               Ansermo, in adieu, folded his arms about her, and said, "Now, may the God of thy worship bless thee, Bernice—"
               "The God thou also dost worship, Ansermo," said  Bernice, lifting her eyes to his, inquiringly.
               "Nay, nay, I worship naught—naught but thee; but may the God thou hast faith in, be true to thee, bless thee, Bernice, for thou hast suffered for my sake. The world hath wronged thee, charged thee with infamies on account of thy husbandless residence at thy brother's court, and thou hast suffered it for my sake; and I will try to bow to thy God, if but that his power may bless thee!"
               "Oh, Ansermo! Look thou to the God of Jacob! Too long hast thou neglected the sacrifices of the Temple; but I will sacrifice for thee. I will go again to Jerusalem, and barefoot, for many days, will I do penance in the holy Temple for thee—for thy test and peace."
               So they parted. He to wrestle—she to wait!
               Julius returned to the Crag to find his wife buried at Mountain Villa, in a tomb beside Claudia's sister.
               She had become despairing at the death of Piso, losing all hope of being restored to her former splendor, which had been her hope, her only life-giving hope, and she sunk under the effects of her despair.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXVIII.
               THE MIDNIGHT SIGNAL.
               
                  
                     "I see them on their winding way."
                  
               
               ECCLESIASTICUS! Ecclesiasticus! The emperor's dogs are scenting foxes. Unkennel, thou elder gray-beard; or they will oust thee from thy hole!" This was shouted from the beach below the cave by Domitian, the young brother of Titus.
               "My mother sent me to tell thee; else they might worry thy old hide for care of mine!"
               "What news dost thou bring so ungraciously?" replied Simon, appearing at the cave's mouth. "What is it thou sayest?"
               "My mother wishes to see thee at the villa—thou mayest get the good news from her," said the precocious and  over-grown boy—grown in stature and villany. Whistling to his dog and sauntering along the beach, tickled was he with the fright in which he imagined old Simon to be, who presently came out and hurried toward the villa.
               Domitia met him as he crossed into the garden, with an open letter in her hand, saying:
               "Father, here are some cruel words to disturb thy peace;" and she read that portion which ran thus: "I have been questioned of a nest of Christians said to be harboring on those lands of mine: if there are any such, which I know not, see to it." This was all. The rest of the letter contained an order for Vespasian's family to meet him at Nero's country house without delay.
               "Father, canst thou suggest anything? the danger is imminent. Are there others sheltering with thee?"
               "Too many, too many—sick and dying—orphaned  infancy and helpless age—children whose parents have been devoured by wild animals and torn by trained bloodhounds.  Oh, too many, too many!"
               "If there were safety in waiting till nightfall, my  wine-cellars would be a safe retreat for the present, until my son arrives. He can sure meet the emergency," said Domitia.
               "We will to the hills. Already have we invited danger to thy door. We will to the hills. The fierce men of the wilderness are less cruel than the dwellers in cities! God will be with us; and if he will us to perish there, each atom of our ungathered dust will be as good seed sown in rich places, yielding a harvest for the Word in years to come! Daughter," he continued, stretching out his hands above her head, "daughter, I may not see thee again this side the cold river; but may the germ of a fair promise that is in thy heart be breathed upon by the Spirit and warned to perfect growth." Lifting his eyes, he invoked a blessing, ending thus: "O Master! be her good shepherd; lead her by pleasant ways to quench her thirst at the true Fountain." Domitia had bent her head in profound respect to receive his benediction, and longed for the faith he manifested; for she was yet, on a starless sea, drifting. He turned to leave. As their hands unclasped at parting, she said:
               "Forgive me that I came near forgetting. Thy retreat must be provisioned. I must aid while I can."
               "Happily bethought! The increased drain upon mine own store hath left it scant indeed," answered Simon.
               "Trust me, hampers shall be prepared, and pack-jennets as if for my own furnishments on the morrow. If all be well, to-night a light shall burn in the guest-chamber; then send one to yonder cascade: my servant shall meet him, and confer as to transporting the hampers."
               
               Within the hour Domitia watched from her high portico the hapless people picking their way along the clifts—women bearing children, young women supporting the aged, old men tottering along, sick and halt, borne on rough litters. The dying too were there, night-dews  mingling with the death-damps upon their settling features, as they were borne along to graves in the wilderness. On, on to the hills they slowly wound: twilight deepened down and curtained their swaying lines from the weeping watcher ere she turned to the tasks before her.
               A full hour after midnight, Domitia lighted a bed-lamp and proceeded to the chamber once occupied by Agrippina and Bernice. She placed the lamp in a high silver sconce on the table near the open lattice, so that its light fell far out on the night's murkiness. As she turned to leave the room, a sound as of many oars broke the utter stillness. It came from the bay. She stepped back and removed the lamp to the sitting-hall, but too late! The signal had been seen and acted upon!
               Simon, unwilling to risk another's safety, had himself waited on the high point above the cascade, and, when he saw the light, by means of vines and roots he swung himself  down beside the sheet of waters. Here he waited for more than an hour—then descended to get a better view of the villa's windows. All were dark—the black buildings lay dark against the sky. Suddenly lights as of flambeaux shot here and there about the cliff's, between the bay and villa. So intently eye and sense were given to the swaying  torches, that his ear had not caught the sound of hasty steps and ribald jesting, until both burst full upon him, as a party, rounding the angle of the road, espied him by the light of the pine torches in their hands. They seized him with many a shout and rough jest, and a voice he knew well, shrieking with laughter, exclaimed: "By all the gods, it is the old goat himself! Let us make him bleat out where he hath stowed the balance of the flock. I say, Eccelesiasticus, how dost thou like thy fix? Oh, thou needst not turn thine eyes upward—we have not come here to prayer-meeting."
               One here proposed to give him the benefit of his  three-fold baptism in the cascade. Another, that he should have the high honors of the cross conferred on him, to which he was entitled by hereditary descent; at the same time exclaiming, "Here's the initiatory buffet," as he struck Simon upon the mouth. It was the last act of his life. His skull crushed in, and he fell a shapeless mass beneath a huge boulder projected from above, which, after fulfilling its  retributive mission, rolled forward and lodged against a tree. The other miscreants stood aghast, until a sharp clang as of ringing steel from the rocks above scattered them in to the darkness—their speed accelerated by sounds of jeering laughter making the night merry around them. Their weapons and torches were left on the field of their valorous exploits.
               As Simon turned from contemplating the crushed flesh and broken mass of bones at his feet, an armed man in full bandit-costume—forest-green, even to the green-plumed cap, banded with gold—stood beside him.
               "Thy companions' leave-taking was not over-courteous! said he, showing a row of white teeth in the light of the failing torches. "I judge thee to be leader of the Christian sect who sheltered in the hills at nightfall. They, being citizens of the Roman commonwealth, are entitled to  protection; though not as a sect. Shelter thyself now, and to-morrow go to the cavern called the Eagle's Nest, and one will be there to show thee further." So saying, he blew a sharp blast on his horn, and was answered from the  direction of the house.
               
               While Simon makes his way, through tangled fields and darkness, to the hills across the valley, it behooves us to follow the hero of the night.
               Beyond the stile he found part of his own band, with Domitian and his fellow-miscreants in closed custody. The rest had surrounded the house.
               "Laying his hand heavily on Domitian's shoulder, the chief said, "Now, sirrah, go in and tell thy mother not to be alarmed: we only capture the carousers in her  dining-hall. Not a word to any one save thy mother, or I make thy flesh food for the eaglets by to-morrow's sun. Go!" For once, the craven was true to trust, and another half hour saw some two dozen blood-scenters bound and guarded by a cheerful set of green-clad mountain-troopers.
               The chief demanded to see the mistress of the villa. She arose and met him courteously, as the ushering servant retired, leaving them alone in the sitting-hall.
               He opened his doublet, and she recognized her husband's star. At the same time he produced a ring, saying:
               "I received this at nightfall, with orders to hover about the villa in case its peace should be disturbed. I encountered  the old Jew at the cascade but now, in the hands of his captors. The whole band must feed our pet ravens, from the topmost of our topling crags, at sunrise."  Observing the lady shudder, he changed the theme, when she  mentioned the affair of the Christians.
               "Ah, I can manage it for thee—my men can transport the hampers."
               "But they are heavy, and will require pack-horses; thy troopers are afoot. If thou wilt, mine are conveniently stabled; but ye must seem to take by force what I freely bestow. These are perilous days."
               "Ah, I comprehend. The servants will report us a pack of brigands—Apennine thieves. Let it be so. Our backs are used to such burdens. Thy son will not reach here before noon-tide to-morrow. Thou wilt have time to replenish thy panniers; and thy pack-jennets will be  restored."
               "But why tarrieth my son? His father's letter gave promise of his being with us earlier."
               "Oh, a sudden freak of Nero sent Titus to escort the damsel Bernice from his country house. He giveth a grand banquet at the 'Golden House,' in honor of his favorites, thy husband and son." And then, as he held his plumed cap in one hand, and buttoned his doublet with the other, he continued, with some hesitation:
               "I crave thy patience, but I would caution thee as to thy younger son. He is young—therefore, open to  persuasion. Through him the authorities were informed of the Christians harboring on thy husband's lands."
               Then with quiet grace he resumed his gauntlets, and prepared to leave.
               It was almost morning before Domitia could win her senses to repose. She was thinking of her younger son, and his peculiar hatred of the Christian sect, of his erratic ways, his long absences from home, his newly awakened admiration for Nero, and mimicry of the tyrant's very manners. Where had he been for the past months of summer?
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXIX.
               AT THE BANQUET.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "The board was spread with fruits and wine;
                           With grapes of gold, like those that shine
                           On Casbin's hills—pomegranates full
                           Of melting sweetness, and the pears,
                           And sunniest apples that Caubul
                           In all its thousand gardens bears."
                        
                     
                     —MOORE.
                  
               
               IT was of strange but magnificent construction—that banquet-room. The floor was a circular plane of gem mosaic, inhemmed with pillars wrought of solid gold, set with mirrors. They—the vine-carved pillars, hanging with golden fruits—reached only half high, to meet the blue and vaulted ceiling, as the horizon meets the sky. Between the pillars, the walls were incrusted with flower-vases  of ivory, made to turn on pivots so as to cast flowers at will upon the revellers; inmingled with which were tiny vessels of perfumery, so arranged that at a signal a misty shower of sweet odors could be made to fill the room.  Next to the pillars, but with ample space between, were ranged oval tables overlaid with gold in every part; the twining legs of the tables resembled vines hung with thick grape-clusters and leaves. The tops were of gem  mosaic, so exquisitely done, they seemed shining paintings. The vessels were of gold and crystal, with fruit-baskets of ivory and silver, wrought like lace-work. In the centre of each table was a fountain whose different jets poured as many different wines. Clusters of globe lamps formed into  pyramids hung at the cornice of each pillar. The ceiling was made to revolve, the floor and sides being stationary, but framed within a huge revolving ball. At times a semblance  of the sun scintillated a brilliant light. Again, the moon, stars, and constellations shed a softer, paler  radiance upon the guests, shining as the heavens do. A vast fountain occupied the centre of the apartment, whose jets poured forth into various crystalline lined basins different  brands of wine, from which, by pipes, the table fountains  were supplied. The servants in attendance kept their places between the tables and fountain—the tables being on only three sides of the room. At times, dancing-girls with timbrel and harp entered, to amuse the guests by  performing within the spaces.
               Nero chose to depart from usual customs. It was his pleasure, on most occasions, that male and female should revel at his board; each lady to be attended by her  cavalier; and thus it was that Bernice's scarf, by some means, became unknotted and trailed to the floor, as, with Nero, she advanced at the head of the incoming guests.
               Titus sprang from the side of Poppœa to replace it; in doing which, by some strange bungling, he knotted it on the right shoulder, which was inadmissible, as only matrons wore it in that fashion.
               Vespasian, marking the mistake, and seeing the various significant glances and winking nods of the company,  reminded his son to recall the blunder. The face of Titus colored, and that of Bernice crimsoned; but both passed on unheeding—Titus even so confused that he retained Bernice's hand and led her to a seat, while the emperor, amazed, was compelled to play the gallant to the rejected Poppœa.
               This incident was not uncared-for by Nero. His anger burned hotly, for he allowed no infringement of etiquette; yet he was not prepared for a rupture with the people's favorite; so his anger was nursed, and as the wine circulated,  and Titus still dexterously kept himself between Bernice and the ardent regards of the emperor, his chagrin had wellnigh bubbled over more than once. The tables were arranged so that not more than two dozen were at the same board, at the head of one of which was the emperor.     And it so happened that Titus bad drawn Bernice to the extreme foot—however, placing himself opposite Nero; and  each attempt at badinage with Bernice by the emperor was warded by her assiduous attendant with the most quiet, cool, excruciatingly polite impudence—saying to all, as plainly as actions could: "Thus far shalt thou go, only! I dare thee to breathe but one word of thy lascivious  passion into her pure ears, and I stand against thee—her defender!" Only within the hour he had known of Nero's new-fledged aspirations with regard to Bernice. He was first led to suspect by Poppœa's hints and cutting innuendoes as they passed from the great ball of audience to the banqueting room, which movement consumed at least two hours! It was the custom to proceed according to the humor of the emperor, who chose to stop frequently and have his guests admire the style and manner of the decorations—  the festooning of the doorways—the pictures—the grouping of statuary, and more than all, an image of himself, in marble, representing him sitting on a throne above the clouds, with all the gods kneeling at his footstool. This image was placed over the vaulted entrance to the banqueting  hall, and was a most ponderous structure,—  making the doorway of considerable thickness. The  entablature of the door, which supported the statue, was  upheld by six equestrian statues—three on one side facing the three on the other.
               Before this grouping Nero paused, with all the ecstasy and glee of a child showing some pretty toy-book of pictures tures for the first time. Seeing Bernice in raptures at the remarkable beauty of Castor and Pollux—the nearer statues upholding the doorway—he took her hand, and drawing it within his arm, said: "Most gracious beauty, this was done to please thy lovely self; and since it pleaseth thee, it must be well done—and I grudge no cost. But come, and husband not thy sweet approvals when I show thee the most rare offspring of my artisan genius! Stint not thy smiles and pretty exclaims, for I do love them so; and would wrench my brain by the year for devices that might woo a smile so sweetly perched as thine upon the spouting redness of thy lip. Come! what thinkest now?" said Nero as they passed into the blazing, pillared hall. But he saw no smile upon her lip. Her eyes were turned beseechingly upon Titus, who, if he had not heard the words, could not fail to have read the expression of the emperor's passion-stirred voice and beaming face; and when Bernice—by design, not, accident—let fall her scarf, and so furnished him excuse to approach, the emperor read well the fierce language of his eye, though his manner was most cool and passionless as he replaced the scarf; but, "Humph! the young eagle must be looked to!" was about all in Nero's thought, until he found by Titus's persistent manner that he meant to cross him, and that, too, in the face of the world.
               The banquet was near its close when Nero, rather excited with wine, arose to recite some verses of his own composition—a wild dithyrambic of so amorous a turn, and so constant were his glances toward where Bernice sat, that all saw plainly then, if they had not seen before, that the emperor was the victim of a new flame. The cheek of Titus blazed, and his hand was more than once upon his sword; but a look from his father, and the stealthy pleading of Bernice's eyes, withheld him; until Nero, glancing around, saw a smile of withering contempt on the youthful face of Lucan, and heard the remark that condemned his verses. The monarch's rage burst upon him like a gathered  storm; and the whole table arose as he aimed a silver tankard full at the offender. It struck wide, for his hand that threw it was unnerved with wine and fury. The  effort seemed to have exhausted his rage—sufficient for the  time; for very blandly he requested the guests to re-seat themselves; and calling for wine, seemed to expect the repast continued. But when the servant was filling his cup, he gave the sign, and the man bending to him, all saw the snaky glitter of Nero's eye as he whispered in his servant's ear.
               But few dared manifest concern; yet not one around but felt his pulses thrill with unknown terror at the white light of those sinister eyes, and cold gray cheek ashen with some foul intent.
               The eye of Titus once or twice turned determinedly upon his father. His look was answered with silent reproof, command, entreaty, blended in the look of the cool  calculating Vespasian.
               The merry tones and the laughter flowed on with the wine, but had a hollowness not to be unrecognized. At the other tables the hilarity almost entirely ceased, for very quickly it spread that Lucan had offended the emperor, and that something was brewing.
               Domitian sat nearest Nero, on the left, and, in his most honeyed words, said insinuatingly, that "traitors' fangs  should be plucked before their bite—that if he knew as much as others, he might speak what he knew." This was said in a tone so low, and most being busy with their own thoughts, that only Nero's ear caught the serpent's hiss, and saw the sinister look that implied more than the words.
               "Domitian, lovest thou Lucius Domitius Nero?"
               "Most gracious sire, I do!"
               "Then come with me, for I have need of those that love me. Yet stay—what saidst thou of traitors?" whispered the monarch.
               "I said but little, yet would I say more, if the time and place comported! Think not that I prate! I would have audience in thy good time!"
               "Then, by the gods, I give it thee! what time thou wilt! and here's my signet-pass," said Nero, taking a ring from his finger and slipping it into Domitian's palm. "Didst thou execute what I gave thee to do?"
               "I did, my liege, and found me lovely lakes in quiet valleys, where morn and evening spreads the mountain-shadows  dim and cool over the clear waters; and fleece-dotted  pastures and fields rich with grain and wine smiled there, where Beauty's invalid cheek might grow peachy and round to the kisses of the mountain-breeze." And Domitian threw a sidelong, meaning glance to where Bernice,  with glowing cheek and eyes bent down, was listening to Domitia, who, with her hand upon her son's arm, leaned across to speak with the maiden. Domitian continued:
               "As the mountain-breezes may go down to woo the flowers of the valleys, so may a gay gallant leave his sovereign's court to find his lady-love whiling the summer hours in rustic woodlands. And he ended with unmistakable  reference to Titus, indicated by look and nod.
               "A gallant, saidst thou—a gallant?"
               "My liege, I did!"
               "What? of such port as yon dark-browed scowler?" said Nero, his eye turning back upon Titus, who was  listening to his mother, with a frown heavy upon his wontedly smooth brow.
               "Of such port, truly, was the blithe fowler and fisher who bagged his prey, and had it dressed to suit a dainty appetite. He was as constant beside the sick-couch as the convalescent's chair."
               
               "Ah! it is time I sent him hence: he shall have  commission with his father in those cursed Jewish wars, that must come to rob my treasury at this juncture, when I have bethought me of such splendor as were never before dreamed of in architecture, splendors that must win one I wot of to smile more sweetly than she smiled to-night. Ha! thou beardless boy, thou canst appreciate beauty, cast thou? That was no weanling's look thou cast upon her, the dancer there! Say, hast an eye for— for beauty?"
               "And a heart also, sire," answered Domitian, whose  youthful cheek had flushed beneath such questioning; for, with a fresh relay of dancing-girls, he was conscious his glance had singled out one whose loveliness caused his heart to throb and eye to blaze with the unmistakable admiration noted by the emperor. "And a heart also, sire!"
               "So young, and so ripe! ha—that pleaseth me well. But stay thy panting heart, child! I was no older when Acte's Circean charms won me—and she no better than a dancing-girl!  Hast won thy charmer? Hist, confide!" said Nero, bending his ear to receive the boy's answer, for a sudden  desire to possess the girl himself had taken possession of him, and he wished to know more of the graceful beauty that was evidently no stranger to Vespasian's younger son, by the telegram look that was answered by conscious smile and blush as she floated near the royal board. What the whispered answer might have been—was stayed by the entrance of two imperial guards, who quietly advanced and pinioned Lucan! The scream of his young wife, who sat near him, was the only interruption. He was led out. The only audible interruption was the screamings of the poor wife, for each guest sought the eye of his fellow in  silence, as were the dark looks that passed between  Vespasian and Titus—scowling but silent.
            
            
               CHAPTER XL.
               AFTER THE BANQUET.
               THE night's revel was over. Early with the morning, Bernice and Titus carelessly sauntered into the forsaken banquet-hall, as if met by appointment. They proceeded to turn the flowers about with which the floor was strewn. Near to her own seat the night before, Titus found it—  that tiny pearl box containing a soft, silky curl of infant's hair, on which they both gazed fondly;—then Bernice thrust it in her bosom, while Titus drew his arm about her, and the two, smiling and happy, promenaded back and forth, so like the joyous boy and girl once seated at the cascade of Valley Villa, that the time past seemed present.
               A footstep struck on the outer pave, and Bernice glided from her lover's side ere he turned to meet his father, whose face betokened perturbation, if not anger.
               "Rash! thoughtless! How darest thou! Thou wilt ruin thy fortunes and mine! Nero has already cast his eyes upon that girl; and thou playest the lover, regardless of the future, in which she cannot be thy wife!"
               "Pardon me, sire; she is already my wife," said Titus, stepping toward Bernice and taking her hand. Vespasian's surprise deprived him of speech for the time, and Titus repeated:
               "She is already my wife—of a year or more. The rites were consummated according to the forms of Roman law."
               "She is a Jewess," said Vespasian, deprecatingly.
               "Like her Idumean grandsire, she is not strictly wed to the forms of her faith; and when the Jewish High-priest  refused the rites of marriage because I was not a Jew, she became, as I am, subject to Roman law and custom. I have waited for thy return to confer of it, since I knew the bearing it must have upon our fortunes. She is my wife!—that cannot be subservient to any  consideration."
               It must—else thou art a traitor to thy vows. Think you the Roman people—"
               "Hush, sire; I know all thou wouldst say—"
               "If the good of Rome—of the Roman people—may be insured by the sacrifice, let me not be acknowledged!" said Bernice. "In some quiet vale I will nurse my baby-boy,  content to know I am his wife, until a fitter time, when Rome shall not need the sacrifice of human hearts. Let me go!—so that he come to me when the world can spare him best. My mother urges my return with her, since Nero plays the suitor, and so that will furnish a  simulation of embarkment for Cæsarea. I need but turn aside to some fair isle or secluded spot convenient to the path of glory, which he must tread without me—since I can only be a shadow in that path."
               "It is well—it is best. Leave Rome. Already tongues do wag and link your two names; and now, lest it be found that ye have license for your loves, go hence! Be circumspect, that no breath of it reaches the Roman people as yet."
               Bernice drooped her head upon her husband's shoulder and wept very quietly while Vespasian was speaking. Titus, stroking her brow with his hand, kissed it and  replied:
               "No, I cannot feel myself a man to deny my wife longer—no part of a man to send her to the seclusion of a peasant's lot, from all the gayeties which are hers by  birth-right, while I lord it here in palaces."
               "Or soldier it in Judea. Know that I have commissions for us both to quell the rebellion there! Another moon must see our preparations completed, if—if—thou knowest what I would say."
               "Then it will not be so difficult. In her native land my wife can find a retreat fitting her birth, until these times are over, and I am—am—free!"
               "Free! He who is servant to the Roman commonwealth  can never be free! It is his duty to make the people free—not himself! Can I boast of liberty? I wrought well in Britain, and came home, thinking to take long rest in quiet nooks with my family, and see! I must nerve me to the toil again."
               Titus was moving away with Bernice, when Vespasian laid his hand upon him.
               "Stay! I have a word that may not be put off." Bernice therefore received her husband's embrace and left them.
               "I came to tell thee that Piso is implicated in the  accusations against Lucan. If he prove a man, (which I doubt,) thou must look for summons to thy command. Be ready!"
               "I am, and have already dispatched a courier to Castle Crag; for before the cock crew this morning, I was  apprised of the traitor's gabble!"
               "Piso has hanged himself!" said a voice passing along the gallery beyond. "He is dead! Piso has hanged himself!" rang from many tongues.
               Father and son gazed upon each other with suspended breaths and white temples for a moment, then passed hurriedly from the room, their eyes glittering, and teeth set firm beneath pale lips.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XLI.
               THE RECORDS OF AN HOUR.
               IN an hour, Titus was riding beside a post-coach  containing his unacknowledged wife, and the mother of Nero, bound, with a small but trusty escort of his own followers, to a distant lake-shore, where Bernice had spent the spring and summer months, and where her infant was left in charge of a shepherd's wife.
               In an hour, Nero had dealt a blow that was shame to manhood. In an hour, Poppœa was dead! Maddened by her unseemly joy and sharp taunts when she informed him of Bernice's departure, Nero struck her again and again, and fatally. Octavia was avenged!
               In an hour, Vespasian stood by the dying couch of Piso; dying, but not dead. He was speaking feebly, and at intervals, as the life-flame flickered and was renewed.
               "I thought all was lost; they told me thou wert arrested and betrayed to death. Now, indeed, must the gathering be to thee. The cause need not perish with me. It is better so; I was only a marplot. Thine was the steady hand for this. I die, Vespasian. Thy hand beneath my thigh. Now, swear to me that thou wilt—"
               "Aid me, ye gods!—I will!" was Vespasian's low reply into that dulling ear. Piso had not finished his adjuration, but there was no need—Vespasian knew; and Piso must have had faith in that promise, for a gratified smile  irradiated his sunken features, and was fixed there on the still cold face. When the guards entered to take him prisoner, he was dead.
               He had fled with the first tumult occasioned by the arrest and subsequent accusations of treason against Lucan; and on arriving at an obscure villa of his own, the report followed that Vespasian, with his son Titus, was arrested, and that himself was hunted as chief conspirator. This was the coinage of fear by one of "The Eleven," who was more true than truthful, and hoped to induce Piso to strike then for the emperor; for Vespasian's armies lay without the inwalled city, ready to follow their chief wherever he chose to lead them; and Piso's secret hordes were panting for action—connected by a chain of concerted signals that would have operated instantly throughout the land; but, what had he done?
               He was brave, good, wise, but vacillating when any great interests were hazarded, except in actual battle; there, he was determined, decisive, and unconquerable.
               Happily, Vespasian arrived before the myrmidons of Nero, and secured his last injunctions and such papers as might not be destroyed, but were dangerous, falling into other hands. Vespasian's timely arrival was not a thing of accident; he knew where he would find Piso. It had been agreed to meet there if any unforeseen trouble should put the cause in jeopardy. Vespasian had been but a short time with the dying man, when he saw soldiers approaching; for the servants—frightened at the condition of Piso—had hastened to Rome with the news; and a guard was sent to arrest him, dead or alive.
               From stormy contention with his wife—during which he used her so foully—Nero passed into a chamber where he had directed that Domitian should meet him.
               "Ah! my captain of detectives, what reward shall I  prepare for thy faithful loves? Thou hast saved my crown and life. Whatever youthful fancy or wild boy-dream thou hast had—tell it me, and it shall have fruition in a measure thou hast not thought of."
               
               "Pardon: I had not thought of reward, or if I had, the reward would be in that I had saved my most loved sovereign  from his enemies. Yet there is one—since thou art so gracious—one boon."
               "Say on: 'tis granted ere thou shapest it in words."
               "Then, my liege, thou wilt shield me from the anger of thy Parthian hero, and—and—my father."
               "Why of old Corbulo?"
               "Longina is his daughter."
               "Gods! thy impudence exceeds thy boldness. What! make a leman of my general's daughter? Were it not that I love thy stripling insolence, thy body should be hacked, and every drop of thy vicious blood let out upon the shambles. But thou salt wed the girl, and, since I owe trice much, I will dowry the bride."
               "Indeed, my liege, I am too young to wed."
               "Too young! I was scarce older when I took Octavia. Come, put thy head in Hymen's noose!"
               "Rather the hangman's halter, sire. I am too wild a colt to be so saddled and bridled. Longina might become shrill-tongued as—"
               "As Poppœa is—wouldst say? ha-ha! I do not blame thy fear. But wed the girl; I shall be angry else."
               "Send me to the shambles, rather!" said Domitian  vehemently. "I will not be both hooked and drawn in. While  youth lasts, I must have line."
               "And thou salt have it, if Nero can aid thee! What shall I do with old Corbulo?"
               "Let him not return to Rome."
               "Why, his Parthian conquests are over, and his disbanded army, in squads, is drifting homeward."
               "Yet he can be stayed at Corinth. Let a charge of treason meet him there, instead of triumphal honors—a renewal of the old charge, true perhaps."
               "Ah, it shall be so, then. Thou remindest me of what I had forgotten. Corbulo is dangerous to my power, and shall not return to Rome."
               "Then I am easy again, and my pretty Longina will still trust me to become her husband some day—when I am old enough to defy my patrician-natured but plebeian-born  father," said Domitian flippantly, and winking as though he had been forty years a libertine.
               "Hark thee, Domitian," said Nero, suddenly bethinking him; "art sure that Seneca is not deep in this plot as Lucan is?"
               "I only tell you what I saw at my mother's country house, in a private chamber, while they thought me asleep in a recess. Seneca turned away from the other two, and as he passed close to where I lay, he muttered, with a sneer upon his lips—"
               "Ha! what did he say?"
               "'Thy neck is too slender, Piso; 't would bend, and thy crown fall off thy heavy head. I would not have thee try to wear it.' Thus said he, looking back contemptuously to where the two sat still conferring."
               "Yet was he consorting with conspirators, and that looks not honest. He is the wealthiest man in Rome, and his riches have an itching for my coffers. I will think on it. What, ho!" this last exclamation was caused by the entrance of a domestic saying that Poppœa was dying.
               The remorse of Nero availed him little. His unborn and only child perished within its mother, and this grief for his lost heir stayed him from further pursuit of Bernice for the time. It had been his intention to proceed to Puteoli, thinking she was gone with her Mother Mariamne to embark for Cæsarea. He was determined to force her stay, by right of his guardianship to her fortunes, with which her father had invested him at the death of that prince, which circumstance had caused her residence at Rome.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XLII.
               THE LAKE.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Valley in whose rosy deeps
                           Honest labor worship keeps."
                        
                     
                     —WALLACE.
                  
               
               A WILD, sweet valley smiled up in the face of heaven from its rimming of hills. It was some half-dozen miles in length, and three in breadth at its widest part. It sloped gently from the mountains on one side, down to the lake-shore, which extended near the whole length of the valley. It was not a mile's width from the wooded shore to where its waters lay quietly against the rugged and overbeetling precipice of its eastern barrier.
               The mild skies of early September looked pleasantly down on busy wine-press and purple vineyard, garnered  grain, rich pastures filled with flocks and herds, orchards, gardens, and farm-houses. Conspicuous was one of stone, cut from front to rear by a long hall, into which the other apartments opened. Front and rear were fringed with low piazzas. The windows were wide and low, and altogether  latticed. It was, with all, a low-browed, home-like structure, such as a weary traveller would hail with joy at eventide, sure of a welcome beneath the tiled and moss-dappled  roof. Here lived a shepherd and his family, consisting  of a bustling motherly wife, two sons, and a maiden, who was not his daughter, but the child of his patron and foster-brother, one of Rome's servants, whose life was spent in camps, while his only child grew up guileless and beautiful in this valley-home, secure, her father thought, from the evils of society, led as it was by one so vicious as Poppœa.
               Longina was happy in her ignorance of the outside world, until the spring-time of A. D. 65 brought two  patrician ladies to the unpretending farm-house. One was an invalid, come to recruit her broken health by the pleasant lake-shore. From her, Longina caught glimpses of fairy-land,  and ideas of splendor and enjoyment that had been shut even from her conception. The lady was always richly robed, and decked with jewels, whose sparkle  fascinated Longina to covetousness; and when, at intervals, a gentleman would visit the ladies, whose look and port were such as she had dreamed belonged to heroes and gods, the girl's head and heart turned from her simple pursuits, and went longing after the gay world.
               One morning, after the departure of the farm-house guests, she grew excessively ennuied, sitting by the wicker bed of her foster-mother's charge—a beautiful infant, which came by bequest of a dead relative, during the stay of those fairy guests.
               She became weary looking into the babe's dark eyes, smiling though they were—and inly wished that the lady, the younger one, who had taken such a fancy to the child, had taken it with her; and now, looking into its eyes, came a consciousness of something in its look familiar; on which she pondered, until she found herself wondering why the child—the infant of a far-away dead mother—should favor the gentleman so, the high-browed visitor that had won her reverence and love by his soft, womanly nursing of the  invalid lady. But the little boy-baby, looking up into her dreamy blue eyes—her wondering blue eyes—became drowsy, and beginning to wink, soon forgot to unclose the heavy lids at all, and fell asleep, with the maiden's wondering eyes—her pondering, wistful eyes, set full in its face.
               
               Then rising, the maiden swept back her golden-brown hair, that spread about her shoulders from beneath her hat, and casting a veiling of gossamer silk over the wicker canopy of the tiny bed, let it fall around the child, to shield it from any chance insect that might be on wing; and as she still held an end of the fabric in her fingers, her eyes put on the dreamy, wistful look again, and thoughts of the rich tissue, and the lady's good heart that gave it to the orphaned child, were mingled with the wish that she might some day wear a dress of such, and would—would she not, when her father came home front Parthia? for was he not a general, and would he not take her to Rome?
               In lieu of better, such thoughts passed lightly through Longina's mind, and unconsciously she passed out at the door, thinking of the time coming. By accident or habit her steps took the path to her accustomed seat, where the tamarisks hung over the lake just where a little brooklet heaved its waters over the bank.
               The day was warm; she undid the strings of her broad shepherd's hat and hung it on a low bough of an acacia-shrub.  The limber stem, under the slight weight, bent to the stream, and the ripples caught and bore the hat out beyond her reach. She quickly undid the clasps of her shoes, and taking them off, very warily dipped one white, foot and then another into the cool, shadowy water.
               "Stay, maiden! I will catch the truant!" said a voice from a point projecting into the water, and to which her hat seemed tending, and where a fisher, unobserved, had sat watching her.
               Longina stepped back abashed as she saw the stranger rise from his concealment, almost facing her; for the point was the off horn of a crescent made by the curving in of the bank. She stepped back, intending to resume her shoes, but her incautious movement had brushed them into the lake, and they were fast following her hat; for the waters of the brooklet were always busy getting up after their fall, and running away from the bank, carrying chance trash with them. But her shoes, trying to catch her hat, were themselves caught by a branch of oleander which the youthful and handsome fisher held in his hand, and with which he had lifted the hat from its baptism.
               If Longina suffered with diffidence at the approach of one who was evidently not of the valley, no such disagreeable  emotion fettered the free and graceful stranger, who, laughing, approached, twirling the hat upon his fingers and  holding the shoes by their bands.
               He gave the hat into her hands, and before she could utter her thanks, he, getting at glimpse of her feet,  exclaimed:
               "Ye gods! such pretty pedals need no hiding; and as these are mine by right of capture, I will dispose of them as it pleaseth me!" and, suiting the action to his word, he twirled them out upon the lake as he said: "Thus do I rid me of the envious things that would veil such beauties from me."
               Longina thought it rude, and, by her blushes and shocked looks, more than manner or words, taught him that she was offended. On the instant, the boy—that beardless chin scarcely belonged to a man—changed his tack and became respectful, regretful, and, before Longina was aware, bounded into the water beyond his depth, to recover the still floating shoes. But they were far out, and she called to him to desist, in piteous tones, before he relinquished the pursuit. By the time he reached the bank, all  dripping, he was forgiven.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XLIII.
               THE PROMISE.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Alas for her dream of dreams!
                           For the prophecy of her flowers!
                           They were bright with the buds of the heart,
                           They were fair with the lilies of youth."
                        
                     
                     —BROWNE.
                  
               
               WHATEVER had brought Flavius, the stripling stranger,  to the valley, Longina kept him there for weeks. His business could not have been very important, or it found performance in the farm-house and its particular locality; for there he was ever—sometimes instructing  Longina on the harp, or receiving lessons from her in dancing to the timbrel. Again he would sit by the elder lady's spinning-jennet, asking questions, though on some points he found the old matron reticent; and all his dexterous questioning was warded as dexterously when her springtime  guests became the subject of remark. This, by some chance, was always occurring, and seemed a topic of  interest to Flavius. Who they were, where they came from, he could not ascertain, for Longina did not know. She had heard no names, except general appellatives that might belong to any one. But she could tell "how looked the lady," and how the tints of health deepened in her cheek day by day; and how he would come and nurse her, as a new-made husband nurses his bride; and how his coming seemed to clothe her with happiness, as did his going rob her of the springy step and cheery laugh; and how she had learned to love the orphan babe and have it smile upon her until he loved it also; and both spent ours by the wicker bed, chatting and tossing the babe, one to the other, listening to its cooing, or watching it sleep upon the lady's bosom, or in its snowy couch. Then, when the last day came, how the lady and the man both knelt there and said strange words of blessing and prayer—prayer to the  Hebrew's God; and how the lady wept bitterly bending over the babe and kissing a good-bye; then going, returned again for another kiss and look, until it seemed she left half her heart behind in the child's cradle. Flavius was quite as curious, as to the gentleman's appearance, but, after some days, seemed to forget all about them, and to be thinking of nothing but amusing himself and Longina, or of drawing  upon her natural and cultivated powers of thought; probing for pearls which he did not dream existed in the wild valley. He was young; his mother had forced wholesome  food upon his mind, but it was digested with the viler aliment taken in at the Elean school, which school had become  a secret nest for the ripest villanies, and had ruined many a youth born to grace his kind. Flavius could appreciate  Longina's excellent capacity and enjoy her innocent  sallies of wit, while he aimed to inflame her mind with desires for withheld enjoyments, and an unwillingness to wait until her father's indefinite campaign in Parthia should end. He persuaded her that he knew her kindred in Rome and that he would see them relative to receiving her and introducing her into that coveted city-life. Nothing could please Longina better; and it was not difficult to persuade her, also, to say nothing of their plan to the  farmer and his family, who would assuredly conform to their patron's wishes and oppose her going.
               Three weeks of animated intercourse, tender sympathy, glowing hopes glowingly pictured, and at last youth's  energy of passion, upset all the sober reasoning of years; and Longina consented to leave her tried friends and pure quiet life, if her kindred should invite her to make her home with them in Rome. So it was arranged that, if they should send for her, it must be by stealth, and she would go without the knowledge of her valley friends.
               There was an engagement on the part of Flavius to visit her at her kindred's residence, and in time, when he should be older, to ask her hand in marriage; to which Longina consented;—then the bold boy caught her in his arms and kissed her, until he saw the same look in her face, which had frightened him into his good behavior, down by the lake.
               Down by the lake they went—to the selfsame spot; and as he untied the strings of her shepherd's hat, seated there by the acacias, beneath the tamarisk-tree—the leaning tamarisk-tree—their feet on the verge of the water, he said:
               "If thy friends should send a post-coach to the village at the head of the lake, couldst thou walk so far? and how shouldst thou know?"
               "Oh, I shall not know, unless one I can trust should come to tell me."
               "Is there one thou canst trust in the village?"
               "No one; but the village courier might bring me a letter, informing me of the time that I might expect a coach."
               "Suppose thou wilt, then, meet me here, two weeks from this; for I will try to come, though I have wherewithal to keep me busy. Say, meet me here, at this same spot, two weeks from this—after the bedtime hour, when the house is still; and I will bring a message from thy mother's sister, and—"
               "Why—why at so strange an hour?"
               "I only thought of this—that if thy kindred send by stealth—I would not have it thought that I had borne thee company in secret flight, which some would say, if it were known that I were in the valley."
               "Then I will be here. I can trust old Livia to come with me here—mine and my father's nurse."
               "Thou wilt be happy in Rome, and thy beautiful dancing shall please the emperor. How wouldst thou like to dance before him, as the daughter of Herodias did before Herod? Indeed, perhaps, some day thou mayst demand my head to be brought thee in a charger, as the reward of thine accomplishment."
               "If I thought so, I would now lop off my foot, so that I could never be a dancer."
               "If it were to be, would it not be, even wert thou footless? I saw thee asking the flowers of thy future—what said they?"
               "They said thou didst love me, wouldst never wholly  forsake me, and wouldst put a crown upon my head. Now do I believe them in part, for here is the wreath of  wild-wood flowers inside my hat, for crown bestowed of thee, and which I shall wear when thou art gone, until leaf by leaf deadens and falls away."
               "And I, what shall I wear when I am gone, but memory for my night-cap, and for my daily habiliment? Say, give me this chain of yellow rings dancing here on thy temple; and here I have wherewithal to sever it," said Flavius, taking a small gladius from its sheath, and cutting the tress with a stroke.
               Chatting, hopeful and happy, the last hours of his stay were spent there on the lake-shore—the shadowy, cool  lake-shore—with the white cliffs opposite, near a mile away, seeming so near that the long moss sweeping from their forest-crowned heads seemed within reach of a boatman's oar. The blue petrel, with its mate, skimmed the wavelets near by, and white swans were dreaming almost at their feat, as "the voice of the charmer went on charming, not wisely," and the smooth, silky creeping of the serpent was not seen among the flowers, nor its hiss heard, for the music of the voice; yet it folds went winding softly, smoothly twining about the innocent pet lamb that had no flock.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XLIV.
               HOW IT WAS KEPT.
               
                  
                     "A gurgling sound—a heavy fall—and the murderer stooped to make sure work."
                  
               
               THE night was very stormy. Longina and old Livia had sat enwrapped and hooded for hours, waiting for the rain to cease, when a pebble, thrown against the  casement, skimmed through the bars of the lattice; on opening which, a cloaked form approached from out the bowels of the storm, making the sign of peace and silence. As he peered in cautiously, he raised his slouched cap to reveal himself to longing. It was Flavius. Grasping her hand, he drew it to his lips, while with his other hand he pulled a letter from his under-robe and placed it in the hand he had kissed. He made a sign of farewell and was gone, out in darkness—of which was born the evil within him.
               Longina looked out eagerly, gazing into the noisy darkness,  into the roaring blackness, the angry, stormy, hard and cruel face of midnight, for another glimpse of him; but nothing of human sound or mould rippled the unbroken  clamor, or disturbed the swaying, drunken mass of darkness outside, impervious to the dim chamber-lamp she held above her head. Eagerly then she broke the seal, and read her aunt's letter: 
                     "Dear child of my dead sister, yea, come to us. It was strange in thy father to keep thee so long hid from those who had a right to have thee, since thou wert motherless. I would myself come for thee, but Flavius assureth me that I would only meet opposition from thy kind foster-parents.  Trust then to him, and I will await thee at Appii Forum, to conduct thee to Rome as becometh the daughter of thy renowned father."
                  
               
               After much fair advice, and prudent direction as to the manner of her journey, this missive was signed "DORIA LEFIDA."
               Longina's tears started more than once at the kind tone of her aunt's letter, and she longed the more to be with her. She read a few lines written by Flavius, but unsigned, on the blank surface of the envelope: "To-morrow night, by the acacias on the lake. Be sure, leave nothing to trace thee. Thy aunt's woman will accompany me, so thou needest not bring old Livia."
               "Go to bed, child, and sleep; thou wilt be busy to-morrow.  He need not say, 'Thou needest not bring old Livia.' She will follow thee, child. I know thy aunt, but thought her dead with the plague that sent thy father hither with me and thee, that was a babe then."
               "Yea, thou must go; I will not feel happy, with only the strange woman of my aunt for company, inside the coach—only she inside the coach—and the rough  out-riders, strange and uncouth as I have seen them, trooping after the village courier."
               Longina could not sleep; she was about to leave tried and true friends and the home of her childhood; and long hours after, when the storm ceased and the clouds drove rapidly from the face of the sky, the starlight found a watcher by an open casement.
               As she watched, the stars came out, and the light  fleece-clouds went flying high, floating in light. The moon lay aback in the west, hanging over the horizon's rim, where Longina could not see it, that part of the house being in shadow; but the light came to her eyes from the lake's reflecting flecting waters, seen here and there through the trees; and she saw it on the fringed clouds scudding above. Looking from one to the other, off toward the lake, and up to the clouds, thinking and weeping, she did not see a form  stepping cautiously from one shadow to another of the  shrubbery, until another pebble clattered on the casement and fell by her side.
               The girl arose and leaned further out, to beckon him she saw in the shadow of vines.
               Flavius leaned upon the window-sill holding her hands, until he had proposed and effected plans for the morrow night, and reassured Longina of her coming happiness, strengthening his injunctions for secrecy and prompt acting, and urging that old Livia should be left to explain the cause and direction of her flight after it was too late to be overtaken; then the wily boy, young in years but old in guile, left her contented and happy that she could come again and make her peace with the good shepherd and his wife—and so she slept her last innocent sleep.
               The morrow night came. So beautiful and pure looked all along the peaceful lake that the wicked Flavius, as he, with one that seemed a woman, floated in a shallow boat within the tree-shadows. He unconsciously sighed, and once groaned for the wickedness from which he would not, must not stay his hand that night, while the beautiful, peaceful, holy moonbeams would be falling all around like angels' silent footsteps.
               Longina and old Livia were already beneath the leaning tamarisk, when the boat struck farther down where the waters were deep, and Flavius, springing to the bank, soon joined them. After a tearful parting with her nurse, he led Longina  and placed her in the care of the woman. Flavius then pushed the boat from the sore, telling the two rowers to stop for him a short distance up—that he had neglected to reward the good Livia, and must follow her. She was still weeping along the narrow embowered path that led to the house. "Bona mater," (good mother,) said Flavius; and the old woman turned round at the sympathizing tone, to meet the flash of his gladius in her eyes and the point deep in her throat—a gurgling sound, a heavy fall, and the murderer stooped and made sure of his work. Then clutching her garments, the moonbeams glinted through the foliage on the ghastly open eyes and the trailing white hair, as he dragged her to the brow of a jutting bank, aside from the path, and heaved her into the lake.
               She could not now tell the tale that was left for her to do when three days should have gone over Longina's flight.
               The sinful, red-handed—scarce man, and all a devil—  removed the clotted gore from his hands and dagger, down by the clustering acacias—wiped the crime-ooze from his pallid face; and then hurried along the banks—until then unstained of blood—to where the boat awaited him. He said nothing to the weeping but hopeful girl, who sat on a cushion in the bottom of the boat, with her head in the woman's lap. He said nothing to any one; but the boat turned from following the shore, and cut directly across for  the white cliffs looking like a wall of snow across their way.
               Longina loved Flavius too well to be very unhappy, or anywise distrustful. She looked up when he entered the boat, and continued watching him through her sparse tears—thinking of his kindness, and of the rare, excellent heart that caused him to leave his business and pleasures waiting for her sake.
               The change in the boat's direction induced her to ask if they were not going to the village, as had been her  expectation; when Flavius passed over to where she sat, and told her he thought it best not to have the coach wait at the village, but at a point on the mountain near the main road. She was satisfied; distrusting not, though she was lifted from the boat to a crevice in the face of the cliff, from whence they had to pass up through a narrow, steep path to the top. A weary walk brought them to a lanternless  coach, with ready-harnessed jennets tied to the hubs. She entered the vehicle, which seemed comfortable, though allowing but little chance of seeing out. Wearied with the night's fatigue, as soon as the carriage began to move, with only the woman beside her, Longina fell asleep, and was not fully aroused at any time until the stopping at a little inn on the Appian Way at daybreak, when she found that Flavius was not with them. He had gone forward  to prepare relays of horses, as they must reach Appii Forum without stopping. On the third day of their travel, Flavius opened the narrow coach-door and told her that they must avoid Appii Forum, and take another road to Rome, as there was a civil brawl at that station between the troops. We leave them winding by by-ways toward Rome.
            
            
               CHAPTER XLV.
               WHAT CAME OF IT.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "But they passed like the light of her smile—
                           They fell from her listless hands—
                           The gold turned to dross at the touch of the vile,
                           And the gems were but idle sand."
                        
                     
                     —BROWNE.
                  
               
               THERE was a pretty chamber in a gay street in the heart of Rome, in which Longina awoke from a long rest, after her wearisome journey. She was very happy. The servant-woman of her travels had brought her different suits of gay apparel—sent by her friends—that she might array herself in a style becoming her beauty and pretensions.  A hair-dresser and tire-woman soon arranged her toilet, and she almost screamed with delight when they held a mirror before her. She did not dream of possessing such exquisite charms as she saw reflected there, and she panted with eager desire to appear before Flavius and her kindred.
               She was robed in blue silk over a crimson skirt and waist, with sapphire ornaments on her arms and neck. A blue fillet sparkling with brilliants bound her radiant hair.
               She passed into an ante-room, and was charmed by its luxuriousness—luxurious to what she had known; and as she sat on the silken cushions, waiting for expected guests, not one regret of the step she had taken crossed her. She heard a quick, eager step outside, and saw the panels, which she had thought only a wall, sliding back to a sweet musical chime, and Flavius, dressed gorgeously, entered and saluted her, expressing his admiration of her appearance.
               She was so pleased to see him, and to have him see her, that she was entirely oblivious that she had not, as yet, seen her aunt; and lost sight of the fact that he had no business there at that hour. She had partaken of her morning's meal, and waited to receive her aunt's embraces before seeing a visitor. But her brain was turned with her new position, and listening to his flatteries, which were now not stinted. His manner was grown bolder, and more defiant to her frowns and remonstrance. But she loved him, and forgave him—thinking of the trouble she had cost him; and so, an hour—a most happy hour—was chatted away; and the cunning villain, with the youthful years and aged experience, arose as if to go. When he saw the regretful look come to her face, and the pouting, pettish lips, he threw his arms about her, and kissed the red pouted lips again and again; then he attempted to press his lips to her bosom; but the old look in her eyes warned him to desist. Very deliberately he stepped to the door, as if to leave her frowning presence; but turned his face round, laughing at her discomfiture, as he touched a spring, and the panels closed again to their merry tune. But he was still within the room. Her face became serious, as she dropped back on her seat, and rested her cheek on her finger-tips, looking at him with a slight degree of reproach in her air.
               "Longina!" he came toward her with a hard determination settling on his features, strange in one so young,—  "Longina, I have coolly deceived thee, wantonly deceived thee, but I hope not fatally—not cruelly." She looked up, bewildered by both look and words, as he took her hand, and seating himself by her, continued: "It is an ancient story, Longina, 'love and fraud.'"
               "What dost thou mean, Flavius? why doth not my aunt come to receive me?" said the girl, beginning to fear  something unthought of in her simplicity.
               "Because thou hast no aunt; thou hast only Flavius—only Flavius, Longina." She did not shrink from his encircling  arms then, for she had fainted as they closed around her, with the first words of his reply.
               When he thought life never would come back to her, he bore her to her couch in the chamber, and sat down and cried, as a child over a broken toy. Again he smiled and cried by turns when he saw the slow return to consciousness;  only then calling to mind the perfumed waters of the toilet, with which he deluged her face and bosom, until she was restored and sat up, or strove to do so; for, with tenderest affection, he pressed her back to the pillow and begged her not rise, but listen to him. She was not able to reply. Pale and suffering and helpless, she turned her sad eyes upon him, trying to understand what he said.
               "Think only of Flavius, Longina! He loveth thee. He can take care of thee. Thou shalt have thy heart's desire of all in Rome. I could not wait. Thou knowest I love thee, and our fathers would cry 'wait,' if no more. I am not Flavius, but the son of one great in Rome, and he would never say to his son, 'Marry the daughter of Corbulo;' they are rivals—deadly foes—thy father and mine. I could not lose thee so, Longina! I have done service for the emperor, and he keeps my purses filled. My fortunes are thine, Longina. Let us be merry, and hold revelry a duty. Come, my darling, shake off the pruderies of thine humble life—the cramped, soul-starving precepts taught by whining matrons over their cheese-tubs. The dye is set upon thy fate, the color cannot be  withdrawn. Come, Longina, smile for me. Oh! I have been unthinking;" and rising, he glanced around, but seeing not what he sought, struck his heel upon the floor, and was answered by the tinkling of a bell below. Hasty footsteps soon paused at the panelled doors, to which he hastened, and tapping thereon, said, "Bring wine."
               As he passed along the ante-room, Longina arose,  resolved to accept her fate,—every vestige of the guileless child of the valley gone, to make way for the calculating courtesan. She resolved not to be known as Corbulo's daughter in Rome, but write to her valley friends such accounts as might induce the belief that she was with her mother's kindred, though kindred she had none—her mother's sister having truly died of the plague. She would trust the future as regarded her father, not dreaming  of the fate she was preparing for him. She had listened to Flavius without moving a muscle of her pale face, counting every step of the way before her, by the time he told her of their parents' enmity, nothing doubting its truth, though she had been so deceived. She did not love him less for the deception, but was thrilled with joy that his love bore so strong a quality as to prompt so bold and hazardous a step. She would aid to shield him from the consequences—and together they would plan for the future. She cared not who he was; and when she met him with soft smile and winsome caress, as he turned from the ante-room, she forgot to ask of any other name than Flavius, until he told her.
               The days that followed were not what Longina had pictured for herself. She looked upon her reflected  loveliness, in the rich mirrors of her home, without her former delight, for she was not yet what she became, and had not learned to value beauty as a thing of power—a possession to be weighed with gold. She had not learned to coin her sacred gift of thought, or temper it into keen blades, with which to cut her way among the high and powerful to a throne. She had not known contempt, nor had she learned whose the voice that said to Nero, "Corbulo must not  return to Rome." Vengeance was a word that had no  definition for her; it had not become a crushing, awful power, lending swift wings to ambition in the years that came slowly on. Let none say she was stung to evil by wrong.
               Had principle with Longina been rooted—a part of herself—her native scorn of the false would have hissed the deceiver from her. She would have abhorred him, and shrunk as a pure, clear-perceiving spirit shrinks appalled from unadorned vice. She would have turned back to her obscurity, found her way to the valley, and defied all  circumstance of good or ill to make her what she was not. She would have kept the tablets of her soul unwritten of all, save pride and purity, and gloried that the vase  remained unbroken amid all the hurtling stones of the  multitude. 'T would have been her treasure—her chief jewel—that she could say, "God and I testify to this—two  witnesses to a fact—true and sufficient."
               Principle was only exotic in the mind of Longina. It was not "grown in the rifled rock." It shrank, withering at the first breath of temptation, as shallow-soiled  vegetation crisps at the first coming of the drought. Yet she never became all bad. The closing scenes of her life's drama were played brilliantly—the stage-lights were color de rose. But she did not arrive at her coveted place through the "valley of tears," lighted by the principle that "Long sufferance is one path to heaven;" but by an opposite maxim perverted, "An eye for an eye,"—"I will repay,"—which led her to trample on buried loves; and from where her enemies lay beneath "the wine-press of her wrath," she came with red robes, like "dyed garments from Bozrah," glorying in the hue of her hands.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XLVI.
               THE ASCENSION.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "And thus passed from its unequal frame
                           A soul of fire—a sun-bent eagle, stricken
                           From its high-soaring down—an instrument
                           Broken with its own compass!"
                        
                     
                     —WILLIS.
                  
               
               AGRIPPINA, by extreme caution, managed to preserve her disguise, and by her attendance on the emperor's ward, Bernice, had opportunities of being in contact  frequently with her son, over whom she watched and—through Nero's favoritism for Bernice—acted; many times dissuading  him, through the maiden, from crimes into which he would have fallen to his more certain and speedy destruction. The woman hoped to win peace of mind for herself by turning aside the very shafts that she herself had let loose from the bow.
               She could not act openly, and had used Bernice to  influence Nero to restore many a ruined family that had fallen by her means in her pride of power. She undid what she had done as far as lay in her to undo; though she did not experience the fullness of repentance for her vast crimes until Simon had taught her the meaning of "holiness of life," and then she saw why the rod was upon her.
               She went to Rome seeking mercy, and busying herself about the good works Simon had enjoined upon her.
               Once, when passing through the Jews' quarter, on foot, alone, she was attracted by sounds akin to Simon's psalm-singing.  She was enticed to follow the melody, and found herself within a rough building in the midst of some dozen, who were gathered to worship and to hear. When the psalm ceased, the speaker arose. It was he of Mars' Hill, who had said: "The unknown God, whom ye ignorantly worship, Him declare I unto you." He who, "in his own hired house," taught the people.
               The eloquence of Paul had more power than the simple reasoning of Simon with the anxious woman, and it was not the last time by many that she appeared in that humble tenement.
               One evening, as twilight dimmed the waves, where the Tiber flowed calmly, she came up out of the water, and, as Paul lifted her from the stream, the few gathered in His name met and kissed her—the baptized Christian—once haughty and cruel empress of Rome.
               A large, irregular excavation that made the core of many underground caves of the Palatine, had been constructed by Agrippina in her days of power for purposes of her own.
               When Vespasian befriended her, she had occasion for certain jewels and moneys that were in the vaults of the Numa Palace. She then acquainted him with the passages in order to obtain what she desired. Vespasian used them thenceforth for other purposes; and after the conflagration and consequent persecution of the Christians, Agrippina herself used a part of the excavations to secrete and succor the persecuted, when all above them lay in heaps of ruin.
               About the time or after the conspiracy of Piso had failed, Paul and Peter came to Rome, probably to minister to the little church of the Palatine. They were arrested and  imprisoned; and Nero, hearing of it, and being struck with Paul's eloquence, conceived the design of pitting him against Simon Magus, who was again in Italy.
               Ansermo Verus had again set his standard forward. He was one of "the Seven," and Vespasian had not refused to ratify Piso's unkept promises. His services as Magus were invaluable to the throngs among the hills, and facilitated  the purposes of "the Seven," so that he concluded to continue the existence of Magus for a time longer, if not in pursuance of his pretensions to the Messiahship.
               When Nero called on him to frustrate the doctrines of Paul by the machinery of his power, he determined to bring all his necromantic ability for one grand joust against his enemies.
               Nero gave his own gardens for the trial of eloquence and learning, united with craft and magic. For three days the gardens were a vast ocean of heads, and the air was cleft with shout after shout, as Magus's cunning reasoning threw Paul from his strongholds, his chief defenses.
               So triumphant was his victory, and so much had he  enmaddened the people to believe him akin to the gods, that he ventured on the impiety of appointing a time for his ascension into heaven.
               "Nay!" said he; "the appointed time is near that I shall go from ye for a space; and when I come again, it will be as a prince among the people! This night, when ye see Arcturus tremble over the Capitoline, come hither, and ye shall witness a glory ye have not seen!"
               Accordingly, at the appointed hour, a blazing throne of intense brilliancy appeared in the grounds of Nero, that  were also illuminated. On the throne, arrayed in garments of crystalline lustre and transparency, sat Magus. The noonday sun was scarcely more dazzling than the image of that orb blazing upon his head. His very face was of light. His long robes floated down over the throne in shining waves, but hid not his glowing feet that rested upon a radiating star. In that dark age of superstition and the many-god system, few could doubt his divinity, so perfectly had his art wrought for this deception. His voice was modulated and toned to the fullest and grandest melody, which in itself had a power that awed and enhungered those who heard it afar off—enhungered them to  madness—for the words they could not hear; hearing only the mighty voice, and seeing the blazing glory above the nearer multitude.
               Paul and Peter prayed in sight of the emperor and the people, without ceasing, while that voice went on arraying its heresies before them.
               Nero himself was drawn out of himself, and shouted aloud, again and again, "This man is a god!" But Peter and Paul prayed not loudly, but vehemently, knowing that their God bent his ear as quickly to the inaudible wish as to a thunder-peal of prayer.
               At length the ultimatum was reached. Arcturus hung over the dome of the Capitol. Magus shouted, in a loud, sonorous, ringing voice:
               "Prepare ye the way! I come!" At the same time,  lifting his face and stretching his hands toward heaven, he began to float upward! The people screamed and shrieked with excitement; some swooned, others were still and dumb as if under a spell. Paul and Peter prayed!
               Higher and higher he rose; his long glistening garments  swelling, waving, and floating, he seemed borne on radiating snow-clouds. Music attended him, low and soft; then swelling, rushing, echoing, until the air reeled with a triumphant diapason.
               Higher and higher the darkness fled before the  ascending glory.
               The multitudes held their breaths and gazed, awed, wonder-stricken, crazed, agonized. Paul and Peter ceased not to pray.
               Far up the shining wonder coruscated, seemed poised for a time—then there came a rushing, whistling, whirring sound, startling the gazers, and something like a meteor of the night shot to earth.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XLVII.
               AGAIN AT CASTLE CRAG.
               
                  WHY leaned they upon their inverted pikes?
               Why were they so still—those green-clad men, filling the vast underground hall of a hundred lights? Why spoke they in whispers and choked voices? Why hung the green banners, emblazed with a seven-pointed star, half furled from their staffs? Upon the gilded throne was biered all that remained of Ansermo—a mangled mass!
               The broken limbs were swathed in fine linen, and made, as far as possible, to assume the proportions of a human form.
               Strange! the fine head had not shared the body's utter ruin. That was entire, except a contusion above the broad brow; and the still unfrosted locks that waved there were gathered over the wound, and Ansermo seemed sleeping. An olive wreath lay on his hair, and the red image of an open hand was stamped just where a white linen scarf was crossed upon his breast above the heart.
               His brow lay smooth and white, unwrinkled of the scorn that hung about his lips; but his eyes were bent down, as though he had died while looking contemptuously on the gaping multitudes beneath him.
               His head above the brain had retained its human warmth until the next midnight, but it was now cold as the marble lips and face; and they awaited, those chiefless men, for some one who was to come before they placed him in that new sepulchre, hewn from the living rock, there in the centre of the cavern.
               Oh, that stillness! broken only by the spasm-sobs of overteeming grief! or the click-click of the mason's trowel perfecting his work! O God! who of us have not known it—that smothering, thick and leaden silence about the loved dead!
               A succession of sharp shrieks without, at length, pierced the lifeless stillness of the hall, and eager glances, tearful, agonized glances, turned toward the door behind the throne, from which the crowd parted, leaving only two on either side, holding their spears crossed above it.
               Julius, in full costume, entered, accompanied by two veiled females, one of which he bore rather than led. The other drew aside the veil of her companion as they advanced  to the bier; and when those wild eyes fell upon the burden it bore, a shriek, prolonged and unearthly, appalled the sad-browed men standing there, as she tottered and fell upon the enpalled corpse.
               Bernice and Mona had posted from Brundusium, at the entreaty of Julius, coupled with the information that their presence was needed. He did not inform them of Ansermo's  death until their arrival at the cavern. Bernice was not prepared for it: Julius had misconceived the woman. He had thought her a being moved by the calculating power of will only. Ah, she had a will stern as her sire's, but with it she wore the stamp of true womanhood, a warm heart, a heart that could burst, within the grasp of her cold steely will.
               When asked where she would have the body of Ansermo sepulchred, she answered, as if delirious:
               "Oh, here! close to my heart, the true heart that  struggled to keep him, when my hard, cruel will thrust him away, and let them diadem my brows with the baubles of Chalcis and Pontus! Oh! entomb us away from the sepulchres where crowned heads lie, afar from the marble monuments of Herod. I spent my life with kings, while toil and woes dried up his youth! Let my death-sleep be here, alone, with him—here in this cavern, Julius! Now take me to him again before it be too late. God of Jacob, I thank thee! Atropos! loveliest of the three—I bless thee!"—the conclusion showing the delirium of her grief, in thus blending her Hebrew faith with that of the heathen, as Julius and Mona led her for a last look upon Ansermo.
               Bernice thought she was dying, and when Julius raised her from the bier, she seemed to be gasping in her last agony; but she did not die, for 
                     
                        "Existence may be borne, and the deep root
                        Of life and sufferance make its firm abode
                        In bare and desolated bosoms."
                     
                  
               
               They raised her to her knees. For some moments, supported  by Julius, she struggled with clutched hands and wild eyes staring upward, and the next moment she grew cold and stony, and, with hands crossed upon her heart, stood up and saw Ansermo sepulchred, with an awful calmness  that curdled the hearts of those who saw her.
               Bernice lived, if the mere task of breathing may be called existence; and after a long illness, nothing could induce her to forego her determination of returning to Jerusalem, and at a time when her brother was in Egypt, and the country embroiled in civil warfare throughout. Bernice would return, and daily in the Temple she stood barefoot, in pursuance of her vow, for the rest of Ansermo's soul.
               At different times during the upbubbling of popular  dissension, Agrippa induced his sister to appear before his      subjects in Jerusalem and elsewhere, hoping her persuasive  eloquence could allay the disaffection; but her prophetic warnings, delivered with the solemnity of an oracle, made only a transient impression. Her statue-like, smileless face, enlit by the unearthly lustre of her dark eyes, awed, but did not convince.
               Her name found its way into the annals of her country, but so blended with the actions of others of the same name, as to do her foul injustice, growing out of the fact that Claudia's retired habits rendered her very existence as Agrippa's wife a matter of doubt, in the turbulent condition of the kingdom. Her name, Bernice, was never bestowed as an address by her friends, but all public documents requiring  her signatures were so signed; and the people, being accustomed to look upon Bernice the elder as their queen, knew not the difference, and the rumor went out that she was both sister and wife of Agrippa, which had begun to be looked upon as infamous, though it had not been  considered so in other times.
               Again, the niece of Agrippa, Mariamne's daughter, came to the court of her uncle at Berytas, and the attentions of Titus became noted: many, hearing of it, and having never known, or forgotten the existence of Mariamne's daughter, gave it out that Titus paid court to Agrippa's sister.
               The agitations of the times favored all manner of  misconstructions, and historians, gathering materials from rumor, ensoiled her memory falsely, by attributing to one various actions that should have been chronicled to "the three."
               Bernice's true life was unchannelled at the death of  Ansermo—it had no further course. Her face of uncovered thoughts became impassible. Her cheek, where the upgushing  blood of impulse had been wont to mantle, took on a marbly look, stern and white. Her long hair of finely spun jet, being ensilvered untimely, paid the debt due to time's threescore years.
               
               The cause of Ansermo's disaster found no explanation. It was conjectured by Julius, and the few admitted to  Ansermo's confidence, that the mechanism of the peculiar aëronaut, by which he had elevated himself, had by some means become disarranged; or, exhausted by his super-human  efforts, Ansermo had fainted, so that he could not manage his machinery.
               Certain it was that some arrangement had prevented his head—the receptacle of his mighty brain—from sharing the crush of his body; which shapeless mass, with the ruined machinery, was taken away by Julius's orders during the confusion and dismay that followed its descent, not at the point from which Ansermo had ascended, but near a little lake in the same grounds. So excited were the spectators, that most of them thought a meteor had fallen in their midst, and went to their homes, glorying that they had heard the voice of a god.
               So perished Ansermo, "ambition-wrecked" Ansermo, the tent-maker's son, who had made a vow by the pools of the valley in Jerusalem.
               Mona was left at Brundusium with the friends of Julius; and in time, these two, who were once so hopelessly separated,  were wedded; and when Julius found it expedient to accompany the Roman army into Syria, he took his wife to their Samaritan home, leaving a garrison at Castle Crag, to protect and provide for the families among the hills.
            
            
               CHAPTER XLVIII.
               THE TWO DEATH-SCENES.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Oh! is it not a noble thing to die
                           As dies the Christian, with his armor on?"
                        
                     
                     —WILLIS.
                  
               
               THERE was a baptism at the head of the bay, where it was made pure and fresh by two mountain-streams that met there, and together, with hands enlinked, glided gracefully into the crowd of idling waters, with low, pleasant laughter-greeting.
               The gibbous moon lay down on her sea-foam pillow as the white-robed form of Domitia arose from the parted waves, and a psalm of joy and praise burst from the shore, where "a handful" waited to give the "kiss of peace."
               Her face was white with emotion, and her eyes glowed with the infinite peace of her soul, as Simon led her toward the beach. The moon-glinted drops, disentangling themselves from her long, unbound hair, glided down and fell again into their fountain, rippling away quietly, as the two parted the audible waters.
               The moon gathered the last fold of her flowing skirts from the waves, and went in to rest behind the sea, as  Domitia with unslippered feet stepped upon the beach, and Simon closed the loud anthem in which he had joined in a voice joyous and triumphant.
               They parted there—"the few" giving the "God speed," and went from the darkening shore to their several comfortless  homes in the hills—Domitia, to thread the winding path back to the villa, alone.
               
               Simon felt that he must die, and that he must do what he had to do quickly; and so he preached ceaselessly where he could—in caverns and on mountain-tops;—for that portion of the hilly country being under the jurisdiction of Julius, Simon's preaching was not interfered with,  Ansermo being now dead.
               Sometimes he had been summoned to the villa at night, going joyously to teach; and when at last Domitia's  summons found him sick indeed, he, eschewing the word "wait" in all he had to do, made haste to do her bidding, and found her ready for baptism.
               Not many days thereafter Domitia stood by his  dying-couch.
               "Thou wilt be called to shelter the saints and enlarge the walls of Zion; for, when I had prayed, yester-night, that I might not go hence to meet my Lord empty-handed, I slept, and sleeping, dreamed that I saw fields of ripe grain, and many reapers, and a voice said, 'Behold thy harvesters!'  and when I turned to ask how that might be—one stood, pointing with a rod—I looked, and lo! a throne! and she who sat thereon seemed a spirit in likeness of thyself; and a voice like to thy voice said: 'Let there be more reapers, for the grain is abundant; and let there be stores builded to receive it!' Then I awoke, and felt comforted that my work was well done, and that I should leave it in thy hands. Glory to the Lamb!"
               Thus spoke Simon feebly; and when he had done, he tried to lift his hands, but could not; and Domitia, lifting them for him, he stretched them in silent benediction over her as she knelt by his rush pallet.
               She vowed a vow as she knelt with closed eyes—made a vow—holding the leaden hands; and as she opened them, her eyes rested upon the dead.
               She placed the limp hands on the still breast, and closed down his already inflexible lids. She arose and called to those without, who came and assisted her to straighten the lax limbs, and to smooth his couch decently and fold his garments fittingly about him. Then she bowed her head and kissed the cold brow for his kindred; for he had told her of them. He was "Simon, son of Cleophas, the Lord's brother," whose fiery nature had led him to strike the high-priest as he scoffed the name of Jesus!
               He fled in secret from his kindred and country, not  knowing that he had stricken with a deadly stroke, until upon his way he heard of the high-priest's murder by an  unknown hand.
               He knew then that he must become a wanderer, feeling the brand of Cain upon his brow, until years of penitence had worn the stone of his cell, where he knelt before a wooden crucifix fashioned by his own hands.
               There was another death-scene at the same hour. Nero's affrighted soul was gazing into eternity from the verge of a life misspent. A horrible wound gaped in his breast, made by his own trembling, inefficient strokes, as the soldiery of Galba rushed in, preceded by an agonized  woman with long white hair, who threw herself between him and their spears. She could not save him. They thrust her through and tore her aside, casting her to the wall. They could not know her—the white-haired, noble woman, who had proved herself the last friend of a tyrant.
               All had forsaken him, courtier and courtesan—all, save her, the mother. He had known her at the last. When vengeance called to him from without his very palace-gates, and he sat on his throne trembling like one beneath the gallows, his mother sought him, and, clinging to his knees, begged him to know her—to believe that she was warm and living, and he no matricide. She urged him to flee from Rome, and to live as she had learned to do—free from the woes and crimes of greatness; but he had  lingered too long.
               Overcome to tears with the joy of seeing his mother living before him, he, for the time, forgot his danger—but she did not. She urged him to trust her, and conducted him through the underground passages beyond the walls of Rome; when, refusing to go elsewhere than to his own country house, she was forced to follow him. No sooner had he arrived than the populace sought him there and enrimmed the palace with hideous uproar, until the arrival of Galba's soldiery—Galba, who had set himself to obtain the empire, being not of "the Seven."
               The wound Agrippina received in defence of her son was not fatal. She was dragged away and tended by some females  of the household with sparse care in the general uproar  and confusion, until Nerva, in whose house she had been domiciled since Bernice's departure, hearing of the woman's defence of Nero, conjectured who she was, and brought her away,—for he was of those who knew of her existence.
               For years people wondered whose the hand that tended Nero's tomb—the loving, tireless hand that gathered the spring's earliest budlets and autumn's latest unfrosted gifts, to lay upon the tomb of the unmourned—wasting fragrance and beauty on the tomb of the unmourned.
            
            
               CHAPTER XLIX.
               DEATH OF DOMITIA.
               
                  
                     
                        "I care not, so my spirit last
                        Long after life has fled."
                     
                  
               
               DOMITIA was alone at Valley Villa. She had ever shrunk from court society. There were those who had swept past her with a dainty fear of plebeian soil to their patrician robes, during the first years of her husband's rising fortunes; and she would not now receive their  humblest services, much less mix her with their follies.
               She had wished to follow her husband and son—to be nearer the scene of their operations; but wish or will of hers had never been taken in account by Vespasian, and she had long ceased to expect it. He had conceded one point—that of permitting her to remain at Valley Villa through the years of his absence in Britain; not that it was her wish, but it suited him as well; and when he  departed for Judea, from which he was to return at intervals, he only said, "I shall always find thee here." This was enough; he always found her there.
               Vespasian loved his wife as the many do, soberly, without thinking it necessary to be demonstrative. She enjoyed his perfect respect and confidence, and was the sharer of all his plans—his plans; hers were never taken into  account, as I have said; nor were her feelings consulted in any matter if he was satisfied, as though he thought it should be her pleasure to do his will,—even when he took her child, Domitian, from her breast, and sent it to be nursed at Elea, when he thought her health demanded perfect rest from the cares of maternity; as though a mother  could rest with her tender babe left to a hireling's care!
               Had any ever called Vespasian an unkind husband, he would have deemed the man or woman mad who said it, so well assured was he of leaving nothing undone that a husband could perform for his wife's comfort. He seemed to be satisfied in that his wife was near him, when days would pass with only common courtesies exchanged between  them: no little, trifling chats to call up pleasant memories or relieve the tension of thought; no endearing looks and words, that make up woman's chief tokens. Sometimes he loved to hold discourse of public interests, metaphysical problems, and appeal to her clear reasoning to solve some philosophical mystery; but he never came to sit beside her when she wrought at her tapestry frame, or other household employment, with smile and jest and pleasant badinage that make labor pastime. This exposition  of Vespasian's domestic proclivities, at so late an hour, is not superfluous, as may at first appear. Domitia had much at stake. She was a calculator, and the influences she could command were all counted; and very cautiously she had begun to draw on her resources, taking into  account the slight influence she held over her husband's mind.
               She had made a vow, dedicating her life to its accomplishment.  She had blamed Simon for giving over to despondency,  and now, counting up her resources, she found herself yielding as he did—yielding at times to her  difficulties, saying to herself, "I have nothing to do in this matter; surely I am not accounted worthy;" and when she would venture to plead the cause of the Christians with her husband, meeting with worse than lukewarm interest, she pronounced herself a self-called disciple, not acceptable. But she went on in her quiet way, giving comfort, bestowing  alms, and seeking out the needy and distressed among the hills. She had united with Agrippina in many ways to help the wretched of Rome; but since the death of Nero, and the consequent partial cessation of persecution against the Christians, she had confined herself to her immediate neighborhood.
               During the few stolen days spent by Titus and Bernice with their child at Valley Villa, Domitia pleaded for the Christians with her son; and when she saw him wandering with Bernice about the accustomed places, her heart throbbed with pride and hope—hope, that through him might come peace for them—the Christians.
               She did not dream that her death would prove a nearer path for their deliverance—but so it was; her death had power greater than her life. Her memory became more potent than her existence had been. How was it? In the strange parcel of man's nature—that 
                     
                        "What we have,
                        We prize not to its worth, whilst we enjoy it;
                        But, being lacked and lost, why then
                        We rate the value"—
                     
                   Domitia saw, as her husband did, that it was best to let the immediate aspirants to the throne tug at each other: so many fractions, and never a true one, would soon prove like the dragon soldiers of Cadmus; and when the fury and commotion clearest away, the people would be the more ready to return to peace and wiser counsels: this was  Vespasian's cool policy, winding surely to a slow fruition.
               Domitia believed that her husband would succeed to the empire, but that assurance did not prevent the harrowing cares incident to the awful tumults between the contending factions of Galba and Otho, and her finely-spun nervous system gave way to excitement, added to anxiety for her son and husband, who were in the red tide of battle  constantly in Syria.
               In her chamber at Valley Villa, she lay a wasted  invalid, penning a letter to her son and husband, whom she thought never to see again. She heaved her soul upon the page, and angels must have stood around prompting.
               Angels! oh, a mother's love needs no prompting—nothing to guide a mother's hand so true as a mother's heart. Angels might have looked on envying the surpassing purity of that love, which, if it could have been embodied or wrought into form, would have outshone in purity and beauty all the angels of heaven,— 
                     
                        "Supremely sweet with radiant face,
                        And blooming with celestial grace."
                     
                  
               
               Domitia addressed a strong appeal to her husband on  behalf of the Christians, giving an exposition of her own views, confessing her baptism of water and of the Spirit, in words calculated to take hold on the heart of the reader, and force conviction on his mind. But when she addressed her son—Titus, the beloved, the idol of so many years,—she slid upon her knees, feeling that she could have power there—more than mortal power to wrest words to her  purpose—words warm as the soul's prompting, holy as its emotions. She wrote on and on, feeling that her heart was battling its last, and to that dear one its last throb should be given. The words fell upon the page—holy inspiration  mingled with the love-light in her eye, as silently, lightly, her hand passed over the pages—silently, lightly, for an hour; then it quivered and went staggering—quivered and staggered—and was still.
               "Mother!" Her eye lifted to his at the door, but her soul must have passed with that look—passed, and in passing left the words "My son!"—as though she had answered his call—last upon the page. Titus sprang to receive his  mother's soulless body in his arms—the  body of that soul which had met him in a look as it was poised for flight—met him in joyous recognition, and passed on, out of the insufficient frame—passed on forever!
               The loud wailings of the motherless brought the domestics,  to find their mistress lifeless in his arms, as he had knelt to catch her sinking form, still striving to call back the spirit, for dear love's sake—for one look—one word.
               They took her from him and laid her on the couch, smoothing her robes about her decently, and pressing down her lids until the dark lashes lay on her thin cheeks—thin and worn, but radiant with the smile with which she greeted her son, left there upon the face as a farewell gift of the passing soul to its idol.
               Titus had heard that he might see his mother no more, and had thought of her by the lonely watch-fires and in the roar of battle, on his sleepless camp-pallet, and as he watched the stars at the door of his tent in far Galilee, until his yearning grew too strong; and as his father needed one to bear his offerings of mock allegiance to Galba, he seized the happy chance to see his mother again, lest it might be true what he had heard of her sinking health: and so he had come to her prayer.
               Titus wept incessantly for some days after he had placed her in a new sepulchre in the garden, intending to remove her to a more fitting tomb when quiet should be restored: for Galba was dead, and Otho and Vitellius were contending  for the empire. He did not go to Rome under such circumstances, but determined to return to his father for instructions.
               On the last day of his stay in that motherless home—  home no longer since the presence that made it home was departed—he opened his mother's chamber, which he had caused to be closed, as they bore her thence to an  ante-chamber to be shrouded.
               He slid back the panelled door slowly, reverently,  uplifted the dark-green curtains as a priest might put aside the veil to enter the "holy of holies:" then burst upon him the remembrance of that look—the look that met him there on the threshold, where he had stood for a moment only, watching the attenuated fingers and the love-lighted eye, until he saw hand and lips falter and quiver. Thank heaven, the music of that sweet word "mother" made glad her parting spirit! but the empty couch, the still garments, the dinted pillow, the cushion by the side of the couch on which she had knelt, and the wooden seat where lay the unfolded letters, the ink-horn, and the pen as it had fallen from her hand!
               Reverently, as if treading on holy ground—feeling that her spirit was still there—around him—embracing him—he approached, as the curtains dropped noiselessly behind him. His soiled and dinted armor was still upon him, except the bruised helmet which he had doffed at the door and held in one hand with his arms folded across his breast. His large melancholy eyes glanced slowly upon each feature of the room's arrangements, while his finely cut nostrils dilated and full lips quivered with grief's surcharge. The morning sun was shining through the trees into the casement;  and as the dappled shadows fell within the room, a golden halo encircled the words, "my son," last upon the parchment page. As the eyes of Titus fell upon it, her voice seemed to thrill in his ears,—his lips moved: "Mother, mother! oh, my mother!" was the silent syllabling of his lips as he bent his knee on the cushion and gazed with awe and unmeasured love upon the last work of her hand. Truly, he knew that her spirit was more blessed that her last effort—the last bubbling of heart—had been given to him.
               He read what she had written—there upon his knees, where she had knelt when her soul had traced itself in words that now flamed into his heart and mind as never a Delphic oracle took hold on priest of the Temple. He read—read what was written, as it were on the shores of another world. A low, sweet spirit-voice seemed to syllable  the words; and when he came to the last uneven, fitful characters, a farewell dying cadence thrilled his ear—so perfectly had words been wrought to her prompting soul.
               When Titus arose from his bowed posture, with his forehead  pressing upon the written parchment, he bound his soul with a vow, and smiled—smiled, thinking of life's short allotment, bounded by the glorious heritage of  eternity.
               Titus lingered yet a few days about the places where she had been—the places of his boyish frolic, and of his first young dream of love beside the cascade; then he took his way to Brundusium, not neglecting to visit the small  garrison at Castle Crag—left to protect the families of those who, under Julius's command, had followed Vespasian. At Brundusium he found Domitian revelling away the  remnant of Nero's bounty. Thence he departed for Syria.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER L.
               THE DESPATCH.
               VESPASIAN'S policy had at last conquered. He was proclaimed emperor by his legions in June, and his appointed generals began their march toward Rome.
               In December, Antoninus entered the city in triumph. Vitellius, who had reigned eight months over Otho, fell in then path of the conqueror. Domitian was already at Rome courting the populace.
               The scene shifts to Samaria—to the home of Julius and Mona.
               Titus, in rusty armor, stood by the outer door, bending to look upon at dark-eyed gypsy-looking boy who was pleading for a bow and arrow, having already made a shield of a dried palm-leaf. A glowing woman of rich, ripe beauty stooped also, to press a mother's kiss upon the child's  curl-enrimmed brow. Few even in that household knew how close the tie binding the three.
               Julius, also in armor, was within the room; and Mona's brown eyes were more pleading than even the words with which she sought to hold her husband longer from duty.
               The Roman army lay only a few leagues away, and the two men, loth to leave, were yet anxious to be off to receive the news awaiting them at camp from Rome. The year was A. D. 70.
               Titus, unwilling that Bernice should immolate herself, had taken her to her uncle's court at Berytas, where he managed to join her frequently; and so devoted and lover-like  were his attentions that they became a theme for gossip.
               Agrippa, having failed to win his subjects to peace, found it necessary to array himself against the turbulent, and joined his forces to the Romans. When their united forces lay in Galilee, Bernice went to visit her child, which she had left for a time with Mona.
               Julius turned from the pleading Mona, and Titus from his son's winning prattle, to meet a tired courier who had flung himself from his enfoamed steed, and was at the door.
               Titus trembled as he received certain private despatches into his hand.
               Bernice's face was pale with dread, as she looked upon his emotion.
               He gathered her to his bosom one moment, and then drew her to a recess, and sat down where the snow had drifted against the sill, scarce whiter than the two faces laid  together, as Titus and Bernice, enwrapped in each other's arms, still hesitated to open the despatch.
               At length Titus twisted the seal from the silken thread that bound it, and was proceeding to open it, when Bernice laid her hand upon his:
               "Stay, my beloved! I know the time has come when thou must choose between the half of thy father's diadem, and poor Bernice—the despised Jewess!
               "I ask thee only this: acknowledge our child—I would not wrong him—and I—I will never thrust myself  between thee and the Roman people!"
               The mother was in her heart, and all the heroine in her eye as she concluded.
               "Bernice!" said Titus, folding his arms again about her, "thou once didst say that if the plebeian Titus could not sit in princes' seats, the princess Bernice would become a peasant-girl for his sake. I will open this envelope, and, whatever it may contain of Fortune's offerings, thou wilt see that thy Titus hath not forgotten the sweet maiden's devotion, nor the high quality of her love."
               Titus read—evidently what he expected to read—thus:
               "Thou knowest I have diligently sought the daughter of Claudius, but the death of Ansermo and old Lynceus hath made it of none effect. I shall therefore proclaim her  existence, and cause it to be spread throughout the empire, as peradventure the girl, who knoweth of her parentage, may respond to the wishes of those who would reinstate her in the position to which her birth calleth her. I design her for thy wife, and the folly that hath entangled thee must be given up; as I do pledge me, the so lately attained peace of the empire shall not be endangered by thy bringing  a Jewish bride hither; for thou now must hasten to share the burdens and honors that are mine, to the half of the empire! Let Julius take the chief command as yet in Syria, and do thou hasten to Rome and be installed in thine offices; the while, the empire shall be searched for Bernice Claudia, who, as thy wife, must wear the honors that my Domitia, thy mother, should have lived to enjoy. And now I do intrust to thee, in Syria, the granting of the boon she craved for the free worship of the Christian sect: thou wilt, therefore, cause my edict to be published in the lands whereunto I send it, giving them peace, and liberty to worship where they will."
               Titus did not go to Rome, but wrote his father of many things, concerning which Bernice cared only for the  termination of the missive, thus:
               "I can serve Rome without sharing thy honors. Let the camp be mine—the court thine! I am husband, father, and soldier, and will alike maintain the three  inviolate against the world! I have sworn by the hallowed relics beneath the stone of the Lupercal, and the sacred blood that bathed the pedestal of Pompey's statue—vows by which thou also hast assumed the Roman purple!"
               This letter, with army despatches, was sent to Vespasian by Julius, whom business of some import drew to Rome. His confiscated estates were to be restored, and a schedule of the treasures at Castle Crag delivered over.
               After the performance of these duties, Julius returned to Syria.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER LI.
               THE CHARIOT RACE.
               VESPASIAN, though busy with cares of state, felt  unsettled as a bobbing "will-o'-the-wisp"—felt a stranger in familiar places, so changed seemed all things in his wifeless home, so dull and pulseless; for unconsciously she had been more to him than spurring ambition.
               The time would come—the idle hour—when feeling long in abeyance to shrill-tongued occupation kept tryst with reflection and memory; and then, the man who had wisdom to gain and rule a world, would sit and toy with by-gones, until words and looks, until then forgotten or unheeded, became a motive and a power, giving spring and action and character to the man's political status, as well as color to individual life. In acting out principles which he knew to be dear to the noble woman he had lost, he was influenced by the atonement his awakened consciousness  enjoined as due for long neglect of her wishes while living; hence what she would do, what she would think, became a line and a rule; and as she ever advocated private sacrifice for public weal, he the more desired the immolation of Titus's love for Bernice. But when he found by what sacred vows his son was bound, he ceased to importune him. He felt his throne unsettled, his life lonely, without  the prop, the companionship which his gifted and thrice noble son could give. He had no respect for the colubrine nature of Domitian, whose hands were already cruentate, and whose rampancy of vile practice had wellnigh severed his father's heart entirely from him. Encouraged as he had been by Nero in every species of debauchery during his father's absence, his viciousness acquired such  momentum, that no control had power to arrest it.
               The existence of Claudius Cæsar's daughter had not faded from the mind of Vespasian, and he had diligently sought her, hoping by some chance, that Titus would be released and twisted to his wishes in regard to Claudia Bernice, if she could be found; in which condition of mind he was startled by Domitian with the announcement that Romanus was at Brundusium, awaiting orders to appear before his emperor with proofs of the identity and  whereabouts of the lost maiden. This resulted in Vespasian himself, with sufficient escort, setting off to the obscure hamlet where she had been reared, and bringing her to Rome.
               She was fair and beautiful, but not Claudia—eyes of the same liquescent blue, hair of shining amber-rings, but not Claudia—our own Claudia! Romanus was prodigal of oaths, and his other proofs were incontestable. The letters of Messalina, the dying bequest of love and forgiveness  to her husband, her jewels, and private appeal to Claudius  on behalf of her daughter—these things Romanus confessed  to have withheld from fear of Nero. How had she—Claudia—been so mistaken? or was she mistaken? How, then, had Romanus obtained those letters and proofs? He had not been one of the three acquainted with her parentage.
               There was a brusqueness about the girl in question,  shocking to refined tastes, but which was pronounced charming simplicity by rising-star worshippers, and looked upon not unkindly by others less fatally enlisted. She had scarcely been made acquainted with her trivium, and knew only a few unpolished touches of the harp, and yet in a few months she showed herself mistress of wiles and plots worthy of sage experience. The music-master, after a few lessons, opened wide his eyes at so wonderful a genius, and her other masters declared her mind a mass of constellate gems.
               She chose to be addressed as Claudia, which pleased  Vespasian well. He did not fancy the name Bernice—thought it sounded better in Jerusalem than Rome.
               Again Titus was tempted by his father's friends, and all the graces which she had, or had not, were set to the name of Claudia.
               Claudia herself confessed to one grace, which was to set herself against any overtures to Titus; for Domitian, as if to thwart his father, had told her of the Jewish Bernice, and his brother's more than penchant. She seemed to angle for Lamia, a handsome patrician youth, who one day fanned her with his ostrich-plumes at the Circus Maximus, which happened in this wise:—All other eyes were drawn to the ring, oblivious that she was almost fainting with the heat of the royal pavilion, the curtains of which were drawn on three sides to shut out idle gazers—crimson curtains that rose-tinted the paly loveliness of her too lily-like face. It must have been the heat that overcame the lady at that time, and caused her to gasp and fall back against the ivory back of the seat, and grow pale and deathlike; which gave the young Lamia a chance to do her service, to spring to his feet from behind her, where he had been sittings so near, that she had felt his warm breath in her hair. Having dispatched  a servant for a cooling draught, he stood over her, stirring the close still air about her face with the plumes  of his beaver; for she had crushed her own jewelled fan to atoms in her clenched hand as she dropped back, the lines of her mouth setting hard and firm, the while. There was a moment when Lamia, kneeling, proffered a brimming goblet of iced Falernian; and she, half recovered, received it with listless grace to her lips. Her hand, encountering his as she took it, sent an electric telegram post to his heart, summoning the wild blood thence to his face, as he arose and replaced his plumed cap upon his heated brow, to hide that babbling blood. He then stooped, with common  phrase of courteous inquiry. Just then a chariot entered,  and passing near them, its occupant turned a smiling face upward, glancing back, as onward the six black coursers whirled the glittering vehicle. The smiling on the face, turned upward with expectancy, passed rapidly as the electric flash that leaves the storm-cloud black and ominous—it vanished as though a demon had, wantonly and on the instant, swept his blotting fingers across the fair record of angelic fingers. So passed from that upturned face the smile and the expectant look; and in their stead glowered the portents of acrid hate as his eye took in the grouping of the royal pavilion. The faint commonplace reply to Lamia's  courteous and kindly questioning was scarcely said, when a telephonic voice from the central pavilion announced that the charioteers were ready for the lists.
               The Lady Claudia did not seem to care for the race, though Domitian contended for the prize. It was decided she must bestow the bay-wreath, which hung near her on the ivory balusters of the pavilion. She did not even heed when those baleful eyes again fell upon her in the swift whirl of the race, though she was fully recovered from her chance illness, and conversing with Lamia carelessly.  She was attired in light-green silk, with her long hair caught from ear to ear with loopings of pearl, and pomatumed until its amber rings had rippled off in Pactolean  waves to the floor, where it lay shaming the gilded fringes of the purple matting, as she bent toward her  companion to hear what he was saying. Her transparent veil, rosy as the garments of Aurora and flecked with crystals, was fastened to a narrow crimson tiara or cap, with a bunch of ostrich-plumes, white as snow-wreaths, that drooped from her brow to her polished shoulder, where a broad clasp of gold and pearls caught her robe, leaving her  graceful neck gleaming through the scarce obstructing veil.
               "What said the alabarch of one Corbulo? I was listening  to hear what seemed to give thee interest, when the excessive heat overcame me."
               "He was but saying what others have said before—speaking of dark plots that robbed great Corbulo of life, and Rome of him."
               "Ah! even in my former low estate I heard of him. Was he so great a man?"
               "Rome's Unparalleled! Thou shouldst hear Alexander the alabarch discourse of his great deeds in Armenia—he being there with him—and in Parthia."
               "Of that I have heard; but his death—what said the alabarch of one, now great in Rome, having compassed it? Pray tell me; I have an itching ear."
               "Maiden! maiden!" said Lamia, confused, and not knowing what reply to give a question he dared not answer truly.
               "Oh, I asked for no such rueful countenance. What man is he, now great in Rome, who could do so vile a thing, and live to become great, where, in this happy day, none should be great but the good! Can the courtly Lamia find it in his heart to deny a lady what she should know—seeing that she may smile on great Corbulo's murderer; yea, touch his hand, and not recoil, knowing not its carmine hue?"
               Lamia could not see the scintillate light in her blue eyes, for they were downcast; but he saw the white rim, left by her illness around her mouth, grow whiter, and he knew that she was more than in earnest. He began to suspect that she had heard enough to throw suspicion where it belonged, and he was doubtful of consequences; for rumor spoke of Domitian's suit to the lady—whether agreeable or not, none could tell, she was so little  demonstrative; though Domitian's plans were very clear, since it was known that Titus had refused the maiden's alliance, she herself having with much resentment  declined the reluctant bridegroom.
               None could say that she ever gave Domitian more than a passing notice; but it suited well, such an alliance, and Domitian had conceived hopes of supplanting his brother in the plans of Vespasian. He could not hope to win his father's esteem, but he addressed himself to the well-known policy which outweighed affection with Vespasian. But whether he addressed the lady or not, the sequel will show. He had quitted his excessive debaucheries, and was winning esteem among the young nobles with whom he associated, cutting acquaintance with the companions of his former life. Longina had been forsaken in the first year of her association with the young reprobate, and had disappeared from the gay circle of courtesans to which he introduced her at Brundusium; but whether dead or living, none seemed to know or care.
               A death-warrant had met her father at Corinth, instead of the triumph due his great services; so there were few to care for the hapless girl, even had she been known as  Corbulo's daughter, which she was not, except by the shepherd and his wife, who never left the security of their beautiful valley.
               Lamia began to fear—yes, fear that the seemingly cold heart of Claudia was stirred with warmer pulsations than he had thought, by the eager questioning and undoubted emotion with which she sought more certain elucidation of the implications conveyed by the words of Mark  Alexander; who, standing near the closed curtains, had unconsciously consciously elevated his voice, while speaking to a  companion; so that Lamia as well as Claudia heard the  remark which seemed to be levelled at Domitian, who was then entering the circus.
               "I will inform thee at a more fitting time," at length said Lamia. "The while, may I ask thee to keep the words thou hast heard locked in thine own breast, and prejudge no one? But see!" and Lamia shook back the plumes that shrouded his face, and leaned back—leaned back on his seat—"see! the victor will soon demand his bays!"
               Claudia lifted her eyes, and saw that Domitian's chariot was whirling in advance of all the rest. The shouts were deafening, as his tireless steeds leaped to the goal and were drawn up, like an arrow stopped at its sure mark.
               The judges pronounced their verdict; and the victor, amid trumpetings and shouts, was conducted to the steps of the royal pavilion, where he was received and assisted to alight by the marshals. A cortege of fair maidens, ranged on each side of the broad steps that, one above the other, were flanked by the seats of the chief nobility, showered upon him their garlands and unbound flowers.
               Domitian ascended the steps with quick, hasty strides, but with no look of gratified vanity in his sullen face, as he knelt by the low ivory baluster and bent his head to  receive his guerdon. Claudia had arisen, and stood in advance  of the other occupants of the pavilion—holding the light bay wreath in her hands—and, when he knelt, laid it gracefully upon his temples, but wittingly, so that her hand might not touch even one of the short curls that crisped about his head, nor, in the slightest, contact a brow she feared might be a murderer's. Did he suspect her thought? No sooner had it settled upon his head, than he arose with a bound and fierce oath, and threw the chaplet in her face, and his gauntlet into that of Lamia!
            
            
               CHAPTER LII.
               A MYSTERY.
               
                  
                     "There is a pleasing dread in the fashion of all mysteries."
                  
               
               ACCIDENTS are the "paper walls" that separate what might have been from what has been—what is and what will be, from that which is not—the consummated from the probable and possible.
               Vespasian struck the inlaid ebony table with a smart stroke from his open palm, as his brain, not his heart, gave birth to this:
               "I will wed the maiden myself—yes, and so give Rome an empress worthy of the Cæsars' line; and her sons—her sons and mine—shall lengthen out the great line whose head is the first Cæsar—laurelled Julius!"
               He refolded the last letter of Titus with energy—entwined  it in its silken bonds again, with the air of a man who has concluded exactly what he is going to do. He tossed it to his waiting secretary, who consigned it to an ebony cabinet checkered with massy gold bars, that stood between the high, narrow windows.
               "I will marry the girl myself, Nerva! Her father's  adherents begin to buzz about my ears, and talk of wiving her to Lamia! I will have me no divisions. Thou smilest, most noble Nerva—what is it?"
               "I but thought of frost and sunshine, sire."
               "Frost and sunshine? That's a curious mixture!"
               "A mixture that must exhale in mist, as thou wilt find it. What wills the maid?"
               
               "The maid! wills? I never heard of a woman that had a will!"
               "Then I am wrong," said Nerva, whose forty winters had not left his head unsprinkled of domestic showers. "I took thee to be a man of some sixty years or so, on this our world—this turnspit world; and now I must needs think thee only newly-born—that thou knowest no more of women! As well might yonder low-hanging cloud be arraigned  for dearth of moisture as charge a woman with lack of will! Happy man, never to have fallen on its sharp and jagged points!"
               Vespasian looked with cold surprise upon his laughing secretary, to whom he allowed more than ordinary privilege,  and whom he had thoughts of appointing to a higher petition.
               "I never knew but one, to say I knew her well," gravely replied the emperor, rising as he continued, "and she was ever conformable. If her thoughts went opposite to mine, I had to filch them from her by the piece—and she a woman withal, that had the traits to govern. Her sight was most lucid on things of state that tangled my own arguments. When I have conversed with my fellows at our house of Reate in Tempe's Vale, and have chanced to meet her eye of questioning wonder, straightaway would I reconsider the matter in hand. If I did not perceive myself at fault, I have drawn from her reluctant lips those clear views that showed the nakedness of my insufficient arguments."
               "And therein lay the wile! That garrulous eye and mute lip would now rule Rome, were she alive! It is the trick of woman to seem to follow when she has firmest hold on our nozzles—"
               What else he would have said was cut short by shrill screams from a distant part of the palace. Both paused in consternation, then hurried out, and along the corridors toward the female apartments. The screaming suddenly ceased; and, from the tortuous windings of the passages, it was difficult to determine the locality from whence the sounds had come. A maid-servant vowed that she knew her mistress's voice, as she went flying toward Claudia's chamber. Vespasian, however, deemed himself and her at fault, when, arriving at her chamber-door—on which the maid was pounding might and main, and calling to her mistress—no answer came to his summons, and no sound was heard.
               It was not the hour that she should be returned from the Circus Maximus, and he was leaving with the rest to search elsewhere, when a servant said he had seen the shadow of a man pass athwart the window in that very room, as he sat on his chariot-box without, not long before the screaming. Another vouched that she had returned; that he, being at the stables, saw her chariot come in. Vespasian was induced to have the doors forced; when the maiden Claudia was found lying upon her face across the sill of the inner balcony, still in her gala-dress. Her women raised her, and a pool of blood was discovered where she lay, with more than one stab in her breast, from which the blood was oozing. She was not dead. Her eyes opened, and she looked from one to the other, then closed them with the mixture of a sigh and a smile on her lips—  both looking strangely on her pale lips. It might have been that the smile was for the glad life dawning for an innocent soul; and the sigh, for the bright existence she was leaving.
               An hour later, while the leeches were undetermined as to Claudia's life or death, the bruised, battered Domitian was brought to the palace in a most precarious state. He had striven with Lamia, in open tournament, and been unhorsed. Not satisfied, the two encountered as gladiators to the death. Domitian's fire gave out in craven submission, as he lay in the arena crushed beneath the hearty blows of the incensed Lamia, more angered at the affront to Claudia than his own wrongs.
               Claudia had returned, and by a private entrance sought her own suite of rooms, a white paly fire shooting in her blue eyes, like the cold gleam of tempered steel—so it seemed to Nerva, who had encountered her on his way to Vespasian's chamber, as she crossed an inner court; though why he did not acknowledge it, as he stood with the  rest before her chamber-door, was a matter known only to himself. Did he know who had aimed at her life? Perhaps!
               Claudia did not die. For days she lay still and pale, not even moaning, though her wounds must have been painful. It was doubtful whether or not she was conscious; at least she turned away from all question, as though she did not understand.
               At the end of two weeks, Vespasian, being informed of her ability to sit up, proceeded to her apartment, doubting not that she would inform him, though she had steadily refused to name her would-be assassin to any one.
               To his surprise, he found one whom entreaty nor  command could influence. She utterly refused to implicate any one—owning that she knew her assailant, that it was not fear that kept her from naming him, but that she would not.
               In this spirit, Vespasian's wooing commenced, through Nerva.
               He could scarcely think of such unequal nuptials without  repugnance, but soothed his disgust with politic unctions,  until by the time she was able to appear in public again, he had become reconciled to the thoughts of so young a wife. She had not accepted his plans, nor rejected them; and when he met her, radiant in recovered health, he looked upon her as his own, and so looking, began to reckon her value, and for the first time felt a thrill of  intense satisfaction. She met him with cool dignity, which he thought remarkably fitting to her station, and pondering  on her queenly ways among the sons and daughters of the nobility, became the more enamored. In one month Nerva detected him giving orders that the neglected silver mirrors of his own apartments should be reburnished. Nerva quietly smiled, and thought of something akin to the cap and bells of a later day, as a present for his friend and emperor.
               He said to his wife that night, "Vespasian is a booby;" and she, shrieking with laughter, cried, "Then there's two of ye; or have ye only changed characters?"
               "No, the gods wot I have not—nor learned to hold my tongue; for to-day, when I saw them locking fingers, I could not refrain, but told him how like a crocodile's dried paws beside a lily-petal were his own, trying to lace her tender digits, long and tapering, within his ugly brown claws. 'Like snow-woof of glossy silk in sackcloth web,' said I. Where, thinkest thou, I left him but now?"
               "Oh, looking after his envious friend, Nerva, who must show too plainly how he grudges his monarch's good luck," snapped his wife.
               "Indeed, he had his tire-man taking measure for a pair of gloves that must be broidered with seed-pearls—ha! ha! I held my nose as I passed him, for he was scented like any dancing-girl."
               "And thou didst leer, no doubt," added his wife, "to show that thou hadst a double scent of other people's business."
               "In truth, I turned my eye askant and winked, to let him know I scented his folly."
               
               "Had it been Nero, thou wouldst not have lived to tell it. Did he not frown, or wince?"
               "He blushed—the good Vespasian blushed through the bronzed parchment that covers his honest face. I could weep to see him so befogged; and now he has the palace all astir for feast and revelry to-morrow night, when, no doubt, he will play zany to a cockerel."
            
            
               CHAPTER LIII.
               THE ASSIGNATION.
               LAMIA, with his graceful tread and pleasant smile, was not among those who threaded the thronged and glaring rooms. Although friends had interposed long before Domitian's bruises were healed, their quarrel had not been altogether amicably settled.
               One was there recounting a famous victory gained by Titus in Syria; and while all eyes were riveted on the speaker, and ears were busy taking on their cargo of wonders, Claudia slid from the side of Vespasian, eluded the watchful gaze of Domitian, and glided out of the blazing rooms. She passed rapidly along lighted corridors, into dim passages, many a one, making almost a circle in her course, until she emerged at the head of a flight of steps commanding the illuminated court gardens that lay beneath the rooms she had left. She stood for some seconds in the shadow of a dark passage, regarding the promenaders in the walks.
               One solitary form detached from the crowd, and carelessly  sauntered here and there, until, at some distance from the rest, it shot along rapidly—choosing the shaded bowers and avenues, until within a few feet of a marble fountain that poured a heavy mass of waters, so thickly jetted as to seem one broad, circular sheet. This fountain stood at the foot of the steps, which were enclosed with solid marble so high that the gardens could not be entered from that side except by escalade; the fountain itself closing up so that the rim of its lower basin served as the lowest step to the flight—having been so arranged for the convenience of access to the fountain from the part of the palace devoted  to the body-servants of the household.
               Claudia watched the figure as it approached, recognizing  the nodding plumes of a man's cap among the shrubbery, which was more sparsely illumined in that quarter than  farther up—nearer the great entrance—where each shrub and statue seemed to have caught a blazing star and held it in durance.
               Near the fountain the man paused—as Claudia could  see from her shaded, but elevated nook—paused and looked up; then removed his cap, the white plumes  streaming down as he stood with his arms folded. He glanced to the right and left, then back, up to the row of high-balconied windows, from which music and merriment floated. He was on the opposite side of an immense  quadrangular court, converted into pleasure-grounds. After  many concentric walks, broad terraces of flowers and shrubbery, with alcoves, and statues interspersed, began to rise like the steps of a pyramid, on the apex of which—on a line with the palace-roofs—a beautiful fountain threw up its waters airily, in many a jet. The fallen waters,  overflowing the shallow basin, trickled down in meandering streams, or came jumping from terrace to terrace, forming miniature cataracts here and there. Four other fountains at the four corners of the quadrangle assisted to fill the place with coolness, as did the buildings around with shade—aided by the foliage of tamarisk, olive, cypress, and willow, that, overlacing the shell walks, made dense  twilight bowers, even at noonday.
               Claudia said to her maid, who had accompanied her since she entered the dark passages, "There is some bungling, Nina. How will he reach the landing?"
               "Go down, my mistress; for, see, he beckons!"
               Claudia hastily gathered her maid-servant's mantle over her own attire, and stepped lightly down some dozen steps to a broad landing, flanked on either side by marble statues, where the flight curved to meet the fountain—a place wholly isolated from observation. She had but reached the spot when the waters of the fountain parted right and left like the drapery of a tent, and Lamia dashed through with a bound, paused to shake his silken garments and plumed cap free from the spray, then sprang up the intervening steps, and dropped on one knee at the feet of Claudia, catching the hem of her light blue robe to his lips.
               "Pray, let us not waste the time in idle ceremony," said Claudia, presenting her hand to him as he arose, and she dexterously let fall the maid's ungraceful cloak from around her. "Thy message said thou wouldst be here; but I dreamed not of how thou mightest pass yon vigilant sentinel."
               "In truth, I have some marks of Niobe's weeping upon me," answered Lamia, making some effort to brush the few drops of water that still clung beaded on his short silken cape, "but it was my own inapt management. The fountain has a contrivance by which its waters may be parted, giving ingress and egress to the hollow centre, which is a pavilion curtained by the descending waters flowing from an upper basin. How I learned its secrets I need not tell thee. I came here to speak of other things. Seat thee on this pedestal, while I address me to a most unwilling office."
               Claudia did as he requested, and, seating himself on the step below, where he could watch the play of her features, he selected his words carefully from the rush of "passion-winged  ministers of thought," that would have leaped from his tongue but for the hard grasp on his heart, held by duty.
               
               Lamia's voice was sternly sad when next he spoke. "I  have brought no words for myself to-night—my wild dream is past—my presumptuous visions are over. Tell me how I can aid thee and I will do it, though I rob Corvus of his office."
               "It is no light matter that thou shouldst deem thyself an innovator on tale-bearing Corvus. It is of weight that I should know who compassed the death of Corbulo, leaving  no hair's-breadth for doubt."
               "I should deem thee his avenger by the look in thine eye, but that I know thou seekest to clear suspicion from the foul hand destined to clasp thine at the altar. I cannot wash it from the blood of Corbulo!"
               "Thou meanest Flavius Domitian?"
               "I do!"
               "He it was who drew up the false charges, substantiated by forged letters from Corbulo's friends, one of whom was the alabarch of Alexandria? Do I understand thee to say that Flavius Domitian did this?" said Claudia, slowly pausing on every word.
               "Why repeat it? I do say it—I know it! Do not  forget thy promise to absolve my unwilling tongue from the charge of base perfidy to a base rival, though more blest."
               "Why did he this?—what motive had he?—oh!"
               "Report has blown nothing of that. Ask him when in nuptial bower. Will he deny thee there?"
               "Lamia, thou speakest bitterly, and hast forestalled events, being unadvised of present things. In one moon's circling I am to have a bridegroom, and wear the tiara of an empress," said Claudia, laughing hysterically and scornfully. "Art not glad of my good fortunes, friend?"
               "I heard such clamor, but deemed it idler than the  unstirred air. Dost thou forego love for ambition?"
               "I forego all things for power—power to avenge!"
               "Avenue? What is there to avenge but the dark attempt  upon thy life, which all Rome shall avenge, if thou wilt but name the villain!"
               "Lamia, thou wilt serve me?"
               "To the last red drop that fills my veins, lady."
               "Something calls me to be Corbulo's avenger. I cannot sleep for a phantom! Its bloody neck, severed by great gashes, appalls me, and I awake but to sleep and dream again! Is it not strange that I should dream of Corbulo, and my waking fancies goad me to tax his murderer?"
               "'Tis a sickly fancy then, and had best be hooted from its perch. Art thou serious?"
               "Yea; and I shall wed Vespasian, perhaps; but first he must know the plots his son is forming. Thou knowest he has something of the elder Brutus in his nature, and would wrench out his heart for duty's sake. Then would he not immolate the father on the altar of the statesman? Convinced of Domitian's treason, would he hesitate to award him the traitor's death? Dost think he would. hesitate, Lamia?"
               "Nay, I think not. But what is this plot?"
               "My maid will conduct thee to a closet next my chamber.  After the festival is over to-night, contrive to bring the alabarch, for ye must both witness what ye shall see and hear; and thou shalt witness for me that I enter into certain plots that I may unmask a villain—only to  unmask a villain!"
               "Then thou lovest not the man?" exclaimed Lamia, joyfully taking her hand, which she drew from him with cold dignity, and arose, saying:
               "Thou wilt come—my maid will find thee the last lingerer beneath the dying festal-lamps in the west  rotunda," as she turned to leave.
               "I will be there," Lamia said, replacing his cap and cloak, and turning sadly away; but seeing Claudia forgetful  of her mantle, lifted it from the pedestal where it had fallen.
               "Cover that fair hair—its flashing ripples would betray thee to the most distant vision." So saying, he laid the uncouth wrapping over her head, bent upon one knee, kissed her yielded hand, arose with a flushed face, went slowly down the steps, and, without pausing to use the sweep that parted the waters, plunged through the  fountain.
            
            
               CHAPTER LIV.
               FRUSTRATED.
               
                  
                     
                        "He was hoar with the winter of age—
                        And what was now his hope? Where was the balm for his sadness?"
                     
                  
               
               VESPASIAN had wellnigh drowned his manliness in the full bumpers with which he aimed to compete with much younger men—a folly totally unworthy of his abstemious life; but as the wine went round, he never once refused, until Nerva, noting its effects, pretended some message of importance, and withdrew his sovereign from the  banquet-table. His cup had been filled by Claudia, who, in a freak of pleasantry, insisted on being his cup-bearer—his Hebe; which made him more intoxicate with love than wine, until Nerva left him in his chamber more enamored of sleep than either. Vespasian had slept some hours, when a hand, though a woman's, grasped and shook him rudely. He awoke, but his impatient grumbling would have startled the sentinel at the door, had not a storm of unusual violence raged without, a sequel to the night's early promise.
               "Vespasian, friend, I beseech thee, awake!" was  whispered into his ear; and Vespasian, recognizing the tones of entreaty, slowly gathered up his slumberous senses and opened his eyes.
               He did not recognize his visitor in the dim light, but she, beckoning him to follow, passed toward an ante-room; and as she lifted the curtain of the doorway and stood for a moment in the brighter light of the inner room, he was surprised to see the face of Agrippina.
               
               He drew his robes about him, and followed, knowing that no ordinary service could have prompted her visit to him at that hour. He knew it must be an act of devotion to his service.
               "There is small time for explanation," said Agrippina under her breath, as Vespasian advanced and took her  extended hand. "I should know the daughter of Claudius—should I not?"
               "I think thou wilt! Thou shouldst have come sooner to enwrap the gentle one in thy material loves."
               "What if I should say she whom thou callest Claudia is no blood of mine?"
               "Then I should tell thee thou hadst forgotten, or that Time had ripened the fruit beyond the promise of its  budding. When thou hast seen her, thou must recognize the sweet uplift of the eye that was her sister's."
               "I have seen her—the girl is not Claudius's daughter! The daughter of Romanus, and old Casca, are now in the palace, ready, with thy protection, to undeceive thee. I have been in Rome, yea, in the palace, many days, and, conjoined with Nerva, have fished a dark plot from the bottom of many mysteries. Come with me, and thou shalt see what manner of bride thou wouldst take to thy arms! Here are the keys that give admittance to the rear of the female apartments, from the gardens. I obtained them by the might of thy signet, from the porter. Come!"
               Vespasian had almost gasped when Agrippina first  disclaimed Claudia as the daughter of Claudius; but, accustomed  to control his features, not a line curved or straightened  in his face different from its wont, as without a word he listened to her recital, and at its conclusion obeyed her "Come!" and followed as if mechanically. Vespasian was surprised to find the sentinels withdrawn from the suite of rooms pertaining to himself, and through which they passed, until at the last door, opening into a corridor, he  recognized Nerva doing duty as sentinel, who whispered: "Ye cannot pass into the gardens; the storm is too violent. Let the lady mantle her form closely, and, while the servitors whose hilarity we hear, are yonder, feasting on the banquet's fragments, ye can gain the eastern corridor through the gates of the darkened archway that may be seen when ye descend to the inwalled pave—the same keys will serve thy  purpose."
               "I should have no need to walk in darkened archways in mine own palace, good Nerva."
               "And would not, were all as true as Nerva, that breaketh thy bread."
               "What is this business that so absorbs the hours that should be given to rest?"
               "A kind of treachery that needeth thy certain espial, since thou alone must be physician to it. Hark! it is the second alarum after midnight. The sentries change at this hour. Thou wilt find them here at thy return. Hasten, sire."
               Vespasian and Agrippina soon found themselves on the open corridor leading around a private court, from whence they entered an arched passage leading to a broad flight of steps that conducted to the light verandas in front of Claudia's apartments.
               Agrippina cautiously listened as she stood on the sill of a low lattice, then noiselessly opened it, and entered with Vespasian. If there was any sound of life within the rooms through which they passed, they could not distinguish it for the sobbing of the storm. At length the heavy curtains  of a doorway were lifted, and they stood in the twilight  of a room separated from another by a transparent screen, through which the light sifted sparsely. There was a doorway curtained with salmon-colored silk to match the straw matting of the floors, and the curtain of each lattice; for the room was large, extending from the front balconies to the rear court.
               Agrippina softly parted the curtains and looked in. She saw only Claudia writing at her desk—a splendid gold-and-ivory  escritoire, we should call it at the present day.
               For some minutes she wrote without lifting her eyes; then, as her maid appeared at the opposite door, she raised her graceful head, nodded, and with a slight wave of her hand toward the rear balcony, indicated something that  was to be done there, evidently understood by the maid, as she immediately approached it, which being shrouded by the curtains, Agrippina saw nothing of the rope-ladder firmly fixed on the iron balustrade, and thrown down to reach the hand of one who waited in the veranda below, screened behind one of the statues that terminated each of its columns.
               Agrippina beckoned Vespasian to her side, and resigning  her place, whispered a word of caution; and then silently screening his form by drawing a fold or two of the ample curtains about him, left him, and returned the way she had come. She had scarcely disappeared from the room, when Vespasian saw Domitian enter from the balcony; and the maid, coming through the door beside which he stood, must have seen him had she turned her head at all, for her movement of the door's drapery caused it to glide from around him, and the caryatid against which he leaned was so white that, as a background, it lined his dark figure distinctly in the dim light. But she went on hurriedly through the rooms, and soon a sweet tinkling sound was heard filling the apartments. Agrippina knew, when she heard it, as she ascended to the servants' dormitory, that the great door that shut in that suite had been closed. The small silver bells connected by wires that hung at each door announcing at the same time to Claudia that her apartments were isolated from intrusion.
               The clear silver chimes vibrated through the stillness like a thrill of rare sweetness that sometimes stirs the human pulses. Then it went out to join the tinkling of the rain on the leaves of the citron and olive groves, that made pleasant vistas for the eye, from either balcony, in daylight, or when they were illumined at night.
               Vespasian could have groaned in bitterness of heart, when he saw Domitian clasp Claudia in his arms with the freedom of a licensed lover. He was expecting something—some perfidy on the part of that woman; but he did not dream of his son's complicity. He thought only of Lamia. He had noticed her leave the festal hall, and, watching her only as love watches over the beloved, he saw her yellow tresses, bound with a glittering tiara, floating down a distant corridor; and again, as she stood at the head of the steps, her hair, swayed by the breeze, shone like golden rain streaming aslant on the white statue at her side: but he had thought little of it; and when she returned, and in her playful freak almost drunkened him at the banquet, he forgot every unpleasant suggestion.
               The sleep of the aged is easily broken—their dreams of folly as easily shivered. Vespasian thought he had been brought there to arouse him from what he, at that moment, considered a most baseless vision; and shame, that he had ever conceived the folly of binding the young girl to him, was the sole disturber of his breast, after the first sickening confirmation.
               He was preparing to move away, feeling ashamed of his espionage, and wondering why Claudia received his son's passionate greeting so coldly, when her voice arrested him:
               "And now tell me thy designs, that I may not thwart the least minutiæ of thy will. Thou sayest I must dally yet with thy father, one month being short of perfecting thy plans."
               "Yes, for Nerva hath been appointed chief of the  prætorian guards, and Romanus removed. It hath a suspicious cast, and I would have time to sound this Nerva. He, thou knowest, saw me from the gardens enter here, on that ill-starred evening when my mad jealousy dealt thee such ruthless blows."
               As Domitian spoke, he girdled Claudia with his arm, and drew her down beside him on a settee of ivory, covered with cushions of pale yellow silk; but she withdrew from his arm gently, saying, "Thou didst promise to think no more of that; the wounds are healed, and I have forgiven them. Would that other wounds had healed so well!"
               "What wounds? Whose?"
               "Corbulo's!" answered Claudia, looking keenly into the black eyes flashing into hers.
               "Why speak of him now? I thought the mention of that name was interdicted within these walls, at least by thy lips and mine," said Domitian, seeming uneasy beneath her peculiar look.
               "Forgive me that I could so forget mine own contracting,"  replied Claudia, seating herself again by the writing-desk,  some steps from where Domitian sat, with the light of the high-sconced lamps playing in his glossy hair, his face full toward his father, and his back to the opposite door.
               "Go on; thou didst speak of Nerva. He is devoted to thy father, and may be to his son, when that father is no more," said Claudia, closing the sentence slowly and  distinctly.
               "I can count better on Romanus, whom I left but now brewing a wedding-posset for my father. He learned his art on the mountains about Castle Crag. 'Tis a subtle gas, and when inhaled, kills ere the bridegroom can more than look upon his newly couched bride."
               "And thou desirest me to administer it—did I  understand thee?"
               "Thou, only thou canst do it safely. When the aged bridegroom seeks his spousal-chamber, it will not be  unnatural that the young bride be decked with flowers, and have her pillow strewed with the emblems of purity. The gas will be enclosed in a tiny crystal globule, which can be crushed between thy fingers at the moment when thou art sure of its being inhaled. Ha, ha!—fancy shows me the old dotard stooping to kiss thy fair bosom, and nozzling the white lily-bells that hold together thy virgin robes, just there—"
               "No more of that, Flavius. Since thy father stands in the way of his ambitious son, why wait for a bridal?" asked Claudia, playing nervously with the diamond-flecked pearl staff of her pen.
               "Thou art strange to-night, my girl, that thou askest me to repeat what so well thou knowest. The empress-dower my father places at thy command, and the troops he has weakly bound himself to yield to thy sway, will assist if I should be opposed—"
               "Which is not likely, Flavius, since thy brother Titus will be stricken like thy father—will he not?"
               "Unless I have paid a bungler, he has already met a glorious death in Syria, by the arrow that pierces from  behind."
               "And then, when thy father is found dead in his  nuptial-couch beside his sleeping bride, what will people say—what will drive suspicion from my door?"
               "Oh, the influx of blood to his brain from too full a banquet, and the high-tempered transports of a new-made husband acting on a worn-out system, will suffice to  account for an old man's death."
               
               "But thy father is stalwart. His fine and stately form betrays no evidence of failing vitality."
               "If I have procured his physician to declare it so, it is sufficient. Art thou satisfied? and wilt thou put forth all thy wiles to enfeeble him by various dissipations, late carousels, and vanities, that wear a man accustomed to steady habits?"
               "I have done so, have I not?" and Claudia's look was exulting.
               "Yes, thou hast made him—hush!—did I not hear a moan?" exclaimed Domitian, starting up, and looking into Claudia's face with an alarmed expression.
               "Nay, only the surging of the wind through the pines on the terrace," was Claudia's reply, as she arose; and  leaning on Domitian's arm, the two promenaded the room lovingly, and talked of the gay life when they should reign over the Roman Empire, emperor and empress of the world.
               "And now good-night Flavius, a long good-night!"
               "Why so?" exclaimed Domitian, retaining the hand which she had vainly attempted to withdraw.
               "Oh, thy promise—"
               "Which I will respect—then, sweet, good-night!" said the bad lips, as he folded her to his bad heart, and kissed her cold, unmoved face, again and again. As he lifted his own, he saw his father standing in the doorway, ghastly with grief and rage.
               His first impulse was to fly; but seeing his father unarmed, he conceived the thought of murdering him, then and there, and catching up his sword, sprang toward him, exclaiming:
               "The furies sent thee hither, and die thou shalt!"  Vespasian had no defence. He threw himself into the room, interposing the writing-desk between them, as he caught it up like a feather and parried the thrusts, which were but few, until his son's arms were pinioned in the grasps of  Lamia and Alexander of Alexandria.
            
            
               CHAPTER LV.
               THE ESCAPE.
               CLAUDIA entered, but her accompanying maidens  retired from the door as Vespasian received her hand to lead her to those in waiting.
               Her eyes were brilliant with a strange excitement, and her long hair swayed over her blue robes, like the beams of the East spread upon the azure heavens.
               "The commonwealth, in my person, honors thee, fair maidens and accords thee thanks; thou hast saved it! And though by proof thou art not of the Cæsars, and I no fitting bridegroom for thee, yet shalt thou be none the poorer. I dower thy hand, which here I give to Lamia. He claims no other guerdon!"
               Lamia dropped gallantly on one knee, as he attempted to receive her hand from Vespasian, but Claudia drew back, saying: "Thou forgettest, sire I have no kindred, and claim no name! Even the wife of Nerva refuses matronage to the sometime impostor!"
               "Child! we never thought to impute blame to thee; thou couldst only know what thou wert told of thy birth." And Vespasian again placed her hand in that of Lamia, who being a modest man, hesitated to urge his suit before so many.
               Claudia was mistress of herself, and pitying his  embarrassment—while others, pitying it too, moved away to  different parts of the room—she interrupted his blundering by saying:
               "Thou only knowest how I have tracked Corbulo's murderer; thou alone—until Domitian's death—must know the true name of thine affianced, if thou wilt accept her—"
               "I promise, and whatever name thou wearest, I  contract my life to thee!" and Lamia kissed her hand and arose from his knees; and Claudia again spoke ere he  relinquished her hand:
               "Until mine enemy be embraced by the cold, white sepulchre preparing for him, there must be no talk of bridals!"
               "I will wait, trusting thy promises, Claudia!"
               "Not Claudia, but Longina, daughter of murdered Corbulo!"
               Even as the words left her lips, Nerva came in and said  Domitian was escaped.
               In his dungeon, Domitian quailed at the fate that had befallen him, but had reasons to hope that his life would be spared. Instead of the usual sentinel, one night, his father appeared before him, agitated and weeping.
               "I do remember me, that, in thy youth, I took thee, tender as thou wert, from thy mother's care, and sent thee where thou didst lose that nature, imbibed with thy  mother's milk, and becamest the demon thou art. For this  mine own wrong-doing, and the reparation I owe to thee, and the memory and wrongs of thy mother—I do now give thee thy life, that thou mayest redeem thy sins—wilt  thou?"
               Domitian was wild with hope and joy. He begged his father's forgiveness, and promised all he wished—swearing  by all the temples of all the gods—when Vespasian stopped his paroxysms.
               "I give thee here a letter to thy brother, acquainting him with thine attempt upon his life; yet have I instructed him to set thee in an honorable position, but not one of trust. And now, boy, go; and by thy mother's memory, keep thee from thy villanies!"
               Vespasian wept bitterly, while he clothed his son in new raiment, arming him as a soldier of the royal guard, and furnishing him with passports out of the dungeon, and country.
               When he was afterwards heard of in Syria, none suspected  the cold Vespasian of having opened his prison-doors,  though only a few knew of his prison-life, and his attempted crime.
               "I can wait," said Longina, and after a time wedded Lamia, with her parched heart athirst for the draught that was destined to be hers in the end.
               The letters produced by Romanus to prove her identity as the daughter of Claudius, had been extracted by him from his daughter's keeping during her temporary illness. She, Alena, had nursed the little Claudia while in service at the house of Nicholas, and had chanced to hear the talk of Messalina, when she came to soothe the jealousy of the man, and to enlist him in her service. She was then very young, but discreet, and kept the matter to herself, until, the child being sick unto death, Alena's evident love for it caused Lynceus, the physician, to engage her assistance,  when he was bribed by Nicholas to let the child die, or hasten its death by a drought.
               The two determined to rescue the beautiful daughter of Messalina, and keep her existence secret.
               When Alena's mother died, who was the woman that had received the dying bequest of Messalina and a few jewels for the child, the remorse she felt at not having conformed to her promises was confided to her young daughter, with the letters and jewels that she had kept from the knowledge of Agrippina, for no reason except that her instincts led her to do it. Alena had not sufficient confidence in her father, Romanus, to acquaint him with her secrets; but when she found him linked with the adherents  of Britannicus in secret plots, she determined to acquaint a man, whom she knew, with that spurious prince's lack of claim to the throne of the Cæsars. Ansermo was that man, and Claudia's fate was afterwards at his command, and he became the protector of Lynceus and his charge; until Alena induced her father to save his forfeited life, and consent to join the many who had already found shelter among the Apennines. She thus, in time, became the  attendant and friend of her beloved Claudia.
               When Claudia deserted Mountain Villa, Romanus was led, by Lynceus and Alena, to believe that Marcus Aulus had abducted her; but Romanus kept that a secret from the mountain people, acquainting only Ansermo, his master.
               Afterwards, finding the jewels and letters, he became suspicious that Claudia was the person sought for by  Vespasian; and not being able to find her, and convinced of  her death by he non-appearance, he conceived the design,  in conjunction with Domitian, of gaining some  advancement for himself, by obtaining a spurious  representative.
               Domitian having chanced upon him in Brundusium, and learning from his hints that he knew something, drew the whole story from him, and having had a full description of the girl Claudia, immediately fell upon the plan of  seeking Longina, to represent the missing Claudia.
               Longina, on being deserted by Domitian, had forsaken the haunts to which he had introduced her, and gone back to the lake-shore, where she lived, a tedious but quiet life, with those whom she had once deserted, giving such reasons for her long absence as satisfied her simple friends.
               But the serpent's trail again slimed the beautiful lake-shore shore, and Longina was won to evil again, through her strong innate love of splendor.
               Her first year of triumph was poisoned by discovering Domitian's complicity in the death of her father, and  terminated in the exposition of her own imposture by the  indefatigable efforts of Nerva and Agrippina. Nerva, induced by his constant idea of having seen the so-called Claudia in another character, and having chanced upon Domitian's chance into her chamber once, kept up an espial, and, introducing Agrippina, in the character of a servant, among the menials, she soon managed to find out enough to  convince her that Domitian and Claudia were more to each other than they seemed. She, however, knew nothing of the nature of the understanding between Lamia and Claudia.
               Nerva, having no confidence in Romanus, determined to seek the man's daughter, whom he found married in an obscure village. He induced her to come and pronounce  whether Claudia were the same child she had nursed and partly reared. Agrippina had well remembered  having seen her at Valley Villa, on a visit with Bernice, and also the strong resemblance of the girl to Octavia; and knew that the present Claudias could not be she, but was unwilling to risk all upon her own convictions.  It was not until Nerva had repeatedly questioned and cross-questioned Romanus, that he acknowledged her as the girl he had guarded at Mountain Villa. He had fabricated  a story of her being reared in a distant out-of-the-way  village, but Nerva soon threw him from that position, by himself visiting the village. When once a clue is obtained to falsehood, it is quickly unravelled.
               Lamia's blind devotion and noble trust eschewed all inquiry into the previous life of Longina, and he received her as his wife, consulting no conditions, save that she was lovely and beloved.
               
               Longina had not counted on the escape of Domitian from the doom she thought sealed, nor had she calculated on the exposure of her own false position. She intended wiling Domitian with hope until the last moment, to keep him from confessing all in his despair. As he knew nothing of her own treacherous planning for his ruin, he deemed her his partner in misfortune; and when she contrived missives to him, instilling hope, he believed them.
            
            
               CHAPTER LVI.
               THIS PICTURE AND THAT.
               
                  
                     
                        "Will they never return? will the Jew
                        In his exile eternally pine?"
                     
                  
               
               A. D. 72. A people was broken and scattered! A nation was dead! Jerusalem was fallen! Of the glorious white Temple, with its fretted roof of golden spires—"there was not one stone left upon another!"
               The "Abomination of Desolation" lay on hearts and lands! A wail of horror and remembrance vibrated to the uttermost coasts; and people, on their journeying, and in their daily toils, cast up their sunken eyes and pale hands, exclaiming, in acknowledgment of the fulfilment of  forgotten prophecies:
               "O Jerusalem! Jerusalem! thou that stonest the  prophets—thy habitations are desolate!" "Woe! woe is Jerusalem!"
               The cry was taken up, and the mountains of Moab  replied to the slopes of Ephraim!
               Disbanded soldiery, drifting wearily homeward, echoed it to their native hills, piled against the setting sun! It rolled along the rivers and plains of Damascus, and was heard on dewy Hermon! The cedars of Lebanon quivered to the cry: "Woe! woe is Jerusalem!" It quailed the stubborn hearts of the captives on their sullen march  before their conquerors!
               The remnant "children of the promise" heard it, as they went forth to be "wanderers upon the face of the whole earth."
               
               The failing senses of Bernice, the eldest of "The Three," distinguished the burden of the wailing, as she lay in her darkening chamber at Berytas, while her pulses were growing  still. The last sounds that filled her dying ear were: "O Jerusalem! Jerusalem!"
               It came upon every breeze to Mona in Samaria, where she sat, enthroned on a pile of silken cushions, beneath an awning upon the house-top. One little dark-haired, violet-eyed  boy had fallen asleep beside her—his mimic crossbow  unbent beneath one outstretched arm; the other was curved under the sweet head upon his mother's knee. An infant girl, with eyes dreamy as Mona's, but blue as heaven, cooed, and kicked its little feet free from the white drapery that robed its chubby form.
               The mother watched her children on either hand, smiling  as mothers do, sometimes fondling the plump shoulders of her babe, or taking its pink finger-tips between her own, with a gentle oscillation, would win a rippling stream of music-laughter from its wide-open rosy mouth. Again she would smooth the hot curls back from the boy's oozy brow, with a gaze of ineffable love. Her sweet pastime was broken upon again and again, by squads of soldiery  dropping to their welcome homes, varying their clamors with the cry of all Jewry, "Woe! woe is Jerusalem!"
               Mona would look after them dreamily, dreaming of the return of Julius. Sights and sounds alike growing monotonous, she sank back upon her soft cushions, and her senses glided easily into mid-evening slumber.
               The space where Mona lay was engirdled on three sides by a trellised parapet, through which she had a prospect of the grounds, and the mountains and fields in the  distance, while behind her were hills heaped up against the day-spring, so near that the dwelling lay in shadows until mid-morning.
               At the hour of Mona's slumber, within the low dwelling, from chamber to hall, silence sang her softest lullaby. The maids were on the walls below, chatting with the  straggling soldiers, or asleep in the garden arbors; while the men-servants were in the fields, or by the fountains,  watering their flocks.
               So it was found by a brazen intruder, who, leaping the garden walls next the hills, made his way sheer to the house-top, and stood for many moments looking upon the sleeping woman and her children.
               The blue-eyed, wide-awake, kicking little piece of anatomy, lying beside its unconscious mother, alarmed at the appearance of a stranger, played off certain well-known strains of anything but music, and awoke Mona.
               "Julius!"
               "Mona! darling!"
               Julius had come to win Mona from her repose. She must join Bernice and Claudia in the festivities that were preparing in all the cities, to celebrate the victories of Titus, which preparations were exampled in splendor only by the appointments under consideration at Rome, for the grand triumph decreed to him and his father by the Roman Senate.
               The spoils of Jerusalem and other rebellious cities, with the captives thereof, a mighty multitude, were gathered at Cæsarea for embarkation, when Titus should be ready to leave his glorious round of triumphs in Syria, for the greater glories inviting him at Rome. He was the people's idol, and he might do as he would, and the loud acclaims of his worshippers would have drowned all opposing  discontents.
               He determined to take his already acknowledged Bernice  to Rome, and she should share his triumphal honors!
            
            
               
               CHAPTER LVII.
               ROME.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Blow the trumpet! spread the wing! fling the scroll upon the sky!
                           Rouse thy slumbering voice, O Fame, and fill the sphere with echo."
                        
                     
                     Tupper.
                  
               
               VESPASIAN went forth, some days from the city, to meet his royal son; and together they came toward the gates, where the people had erected arches, and were crowded along the way, and on every eminence, to receive them; there they halted for preparations for the day  following—the great day of the "Triumphal Entry."
               Titus had been riding a superb horse awarded by the senate, but seeing Julius near on Libyan Mira, he requested a change for the time; and mounting snow-bank Mira, with her crimson housings inwrought with silver, and bordered with heavy twisted silver fringe sweeping down to her gilded hoofs, and swaying to tinkling music with every motion, he touched her up, and a bound or two brought him to the chariot of Bernice.
               The body of the chariot, or car, was in form like a huge scalloped sea-shell of crystal and gold, supported on  kneeling images of Æolas. The high dome-like canopy was upheld by six inmates of the gods. Couchant lions, covered with beaten gold, supported the seat which was cushioned, and covered with purple, inwrought with gems and gold upon its hanging borders.
               The wheels of the chariot were solid concentric rings set with precious stones, ruby, amethyst, sapphire, and topaz, representing the bended bow of the heavens, encircling the blazing sun-like hubs.
               Eight white horses, with flowing white manes, pink nostrils, fiery eyes, and tossing plumes—begirt with gilded network and harness all begemmed—were led by as many grooms, in blue and silver, with red plumeless caps, entwined with twisted gold and silver.
               As Titus approached, the purple silk curtains were drawn back by attendants, that sat on lower seats behind Bernice.
               She wore not the mourner's garb for her dead nation and slaughtered people; but was arrayed in crimson, with her transparent veil, rosy like the aurora, bedotted with glistening gem-stars of diamond-like light, bound upon her brow with a rainbow tiara of precious stones.
               Her eyes followed her husband's, as his horse curveted so near that one hand rested on the trident of Neptune at her side, while he pointed with the other toward the far Palatine, where arose a new palace, shining like a city of towers, in the mid-evening sun. The palace was the gift of the people to their idol, who, with the silken reins upon graceful Mira's neck, and attired in the purple robes sent him to replace his battered armor, appeared intent only on giving Bernice pleasure, by pointing out the beauties of his new acquisition, with the eagerness and simplicity with which his own swart-browed boy would have shown a new mimic cross-bow or sword.
               Pass we over that day, whose splendid and gorgeous pageantries were never surpassed or equalled—never will—  never can be. That day possesses a glowing page of its own in Roman history, which may be consulted at will. I assume not the historian's office: I take only a foot-path in the  byways, and gather up forgotten or unheeded gleanings.
               
               Titus was soon after associated in the government with his father, and the Senate decreed him the title of Cæsar.
               Domitian had acted well, fighting bravely in Syria, and on his return so conducted himself that Titus gave him his confidence and esteem; but Vespasian held fast to his distrust, though he made no undue show of it to its object.
               At first, Domitian seemed to seek the companionship of the most virtuous and renowned youths of the commonwealth;  his amusements rather inclined to the chaste than otherwise. He had a private theatre, but it was conducted on an elevated scale, and free from offence to the most  exacting morality. His intimacy with the pantomime Paris, however, gave some color to his father's suspicions that his son did not always mingle with the best society.
               Liberty of conscience and liberty of speech having  unhooded the hearts of men, Domitian saw himself despised by the youths whose society he seemed to solicit; for, the secret of his machinations against his father having drifted out, as such things will, among the people, he could look in few faces without reading detestation and distrust, and he saw that the time must be distant when he might  successfully take up the thread of his old aims, and begin to mesh his network of wiles.
               He did not then know that the exposition of his former plans was an instalment paid on the deep debt due the manes of Corbulo. He never suspected the treachery of Longina, and came back to Rome calculating on making the fine cunning of the woman a superior wheel in the mechanism of his plans.
               It will be remembered that Vespasian, at the time of Domitian's exposure and arrest, did not manifest any alarm as to the fate of Titus, although he had heard Domitian avow that he had employed a confederate to murder him in Syria. The reason of his apparent indifference may be gathered from certain facts confided to him by Longina, who did so without mentioning the name of her coadjutor.
               Longina had guarded the life of Titus. Paris, her younger foster-brother, whom Domitian had never seen, obeyed the behest of Longina, and came to Rome, keeping himself aloof, as she had directed, until she could see him privately, when she so won upon him that he at once entered into her interests, and consented to the course she proposed. In pursuance of her plan, he threw himself, as if by chance, in Domitian's way, under circumstances that would lead him to suppose Paris a villain of the deepest dye, and consequently a fit tool for him.
               The ruse succeeded; and it was not long until Domitian, being in want of such a confederate, as Longina knew, proposed the scheme he had at heart in reference to Titus, to Paris, who was bound to Longina's service—not by the promise of rewards and honors—but by bonds that had been knit in their childhood, and, on the part of Paris, amounting to enthusiastic and idolatrous devotion, of the purest and most unselfish order.
               Freighted with Domitian's instructions and bonds of  remuneration, he went out to Syria with a fresh outfit of troops for the Jewish war.
               He had also Longina's instructions, which were, to watch that no one else might effect that which he was commissioned to do, for she had some cause to suspect that a certain man of Paris's own legion had a duplicate order and service from Domitian.
               It is sufficient to say, that Paris managed to defeat the plans of his employer, without betraying that the failure was owing to his own management, or in the least arousing Domitian's suspicion, that his supposed tool was not truly devoted to the work he had given him to do; and on his return to Rome he was still kept at hand for future services, and, as Domitian thought, held safely to him, by the  flattery of his condescension in making Paris his confidant and associate.
               Longina waited. Lamia was, in every sense, a good man, earnest and honest in all that he did, and not given to suspicion; but he had so keen a perception of right and wrong, and so true a recognition of the sources of good and evil, that, when once he became convinced of moral deformity existing in a man, no seeming repentance, no apparent turning away from the old course, no pretended disgust for the unclean thing, could impose upon him; and  Domitian's well-acted and lifelike mimic of contrition passed  before him as an act of the drama—with as little effect as if he had looked upon one of the pantomimic representations  then practised largely in the theatres of Rome.
               But he had no cause or wish to show his disgust, and Domitian imagined that he had secured at least one dupe to his well-aped remorse, though he was forced to recognize the industry with which Lamia warded all his contrivances to be received on terms of intimacy; but that, he credited to a jealous guarding of the treasure Lamia kept incased in a palatial tower on the banks of the sea, near Misenum, bestowed by the free hand of Vespasian.
               Domitia was off guard as to Lamia's motives, and thought, when the time came, that it would be easy for him to hoodwink that jealousy which he had no doubt caused Longina's residence so far from the court, whose gayeties, he imagined, were still her delight.
               Longina's mind had developed richly, taking hold on every facility for improvement; but she could not escape the humiliation of her past life; and her hatred of the  instrument that had wrought her self-abasement lost nothing of its acuteness and intensity, while she waited—looking upon this picture and that—what she was, and what she should have been.
               She was a worshipper at no shrine. Pliny, the elder, had returned from Hispania, and was stationed at Misenum, in command of the Mediterranean fleet, and she had full opportunity of inoculation from his very atheistical  philosophies; for her house was the scene of many of his  denunciations against all systems at variance, real or seeming, with natural cause and effect.
               Pliny often used a small dormitory of Lamia's dwelling, that looked upon the sea, and it was there that many pages of his Natural History were written; and to Longina's taste, and suggestions, and research in mineralogy,  astronomy, botany, and to her deeply metaphysical mind, he was indebted for some of the finest chapters of his stupendous work.
               She read each of his thirty-seven books, that he  afterward dedicated to Titus, with an avidity very gratifying to the author; and in this manner the pain of her secret humiliation was partly dulled, while she waited for some demonstration of the plans she knew Domitian's restless ambition would be concocting—that she might know how to entoil him—the desire to have him owe his  destruction to her becoming a religion, and a fixed principle amounting to fanaticism.
               She did not wish to be near him, but she hoped, from Paris's espial, to track the direction of his secret foot-prints. For a long time, she was kept as one without a guide-board  at the crossing of two ways; so monotonous and even was the course of the wily man, and so generally smooth seemed the revolving of the wheels of all things, that no event occurred to index the soul of the man.
               The joint reign of Vespasian and Titus had strewn the empire with seeds of virtue and contentment, and the land heaved with abundant prosperity and peace, unknown since the base of Pompey's statue received its baptism of blood, save a short respite, when its woes were transiently rocked to sleep in the reign of Augustus.
               Contention was put away from Rome. The synagogue stood unrebuked by the Pantheon!
               The gatherings of Christian worshippers were close beside  the altars where smoked sacrifices to Jupiter, and the lowings of the garlanded victims went up with songs of Zion. The plashing of sacred libations on the marble floors of heathen temples tinkled into the ears of those who wept for the thorn-crowned Nazarene.
               The perfume of burning incense from Grecian censers mingled with the breath of prayer that floated up from lips that had learned the name of Jesus.
            
            
               CHAPTER LVIII.
               ODDS AND ENDS.
               JULIUS and Mona remained but a short time in Rome. They had arrived from Castle Crag in time to be with, and to sympathize with their friends in the general joy that stirred the pluses of half the world; but the garishness of the day's splendors seemed out of tune to them. They had come from the fulfilment of a vow; and Bernice, the dead, was sepulchred far from her Asmonean ancestors—her kingly sires; afar from the tombs of crowned heads, as she had desired.
               At last she lay beside Ansermo, within a tomb hewn in the cavern's floor at Castle Crag. The tomb was covered with its cold white slab, uninscribed. The cavern was sealed up, and its hundred lamps were never more  retrimmed.
               Hyrcanus and Bernicianus, Bernice's children, had already entombed her when Julius arrived at Berytas. He stole her remains by night from their marble tomb, and bore them to a ship bound for Italy—thus fulfilling the vow she had exacted of him.
               Vespasian bestowed prætorian honors on Julius and Agrippa at the same time. Julius hastened to his duties in Cilicia. History gives him another name, and a noble one—won by valor and moral worth, and transmitted to a long line of posterity, that bore it unsullied adown the ages. Libyan Mira remembered the pastures of her youth. When her bridle was loosed on the Syrian shore, her keepers missed her from her stall for many months, and when found, she was cropping the grass in Samaria by the hillock where Julius and Mona had slumbered in each other's arms; and ever after, when the spring-time and the summer covered the home-pastures with plentiful verdure, Libyan Mira was seen there, cropping the grass on the hillsides, until she grew old and died, leaving her posterity to grow and increase with the children of Julius, transmitting to her offspring her virtues and beauty, characterized mainly by a long, abundant mane, silvery, and flowing to the ground.
               Agrippa was more happy, shorn of his empty crown, than when it lay abrading his temples, with its emptiness: his honors and power being the same as before, he lost nothing of the real.
               Claudia would never consent to avow her royal descent. She feared that her boy might be claimed as the property of the commonwealth; but alas! the wailing once heard in Rama of Galilee sounded in her home; for another power had set its seal upon him, and his sweet face was covered away from her yearning eyes forever. She had no other son. Daughters were born to her, but Agrippa, her husband,  was the last of the Asmoneans, who were a race of kings derived from Asmoneus, the first of the Maccabees.
               During Agrippa's residence at Rome, Agrippina found with him comfort and welcome. Claudia could not forget her strong friendship for Octavia, through all the horrors that princess endured at Ostia and Pandataria. At times, however, she could not repress a sickening horror, induced by the fear that her father, Claudius, had perhaps received the poisoned bowl at the very hands that fondled her own children with such evidences of maternal love. However, when death entered her door, and her views of life were changed and mellowed by the first death of her household,  that of her beautiful boy, the tender ministrations of Agrippina rooted out distrust; and a long comfort was hers in after-days, that when called to close the weary eyes, she did it with not one accusing suggestion against the woman who had been dead to the world for so many years, and whose name was yet a curse in Rome.
               Vespasian had entombed his wife with the Domitii, to which family she belonged, and which was the root of the Ahenobarbi, of Nero's extraction; consequently their tombs were not a stone's cast separate.
               One morning, when Vespasian went early to muse in the still home of his dad, he saw that the flowers were withered on Nero's tomb. Then he knew that the hand, that had kept them freshly gathered each day, must be stricken, and he hastened to the dwelling of Agrippa.
               The woman of nameless crimes lay dying, as if she were quietly turning to her nightly slumbers. Her blood-stained  hands, washed white in the waters of repentance, lay folded calmly on her scarce heaving bosom, as Vespasian  stood over her; and when the parting throe left the heart still, a quiet, pleasant smile lay on her face, and the earnest and warm-hearted man, emperor of half the world, said within himself:
               "Oh, how beautiful is this faith in the Nazarene! Would that I, out of the shoreless sky, the cavernous earth, the great infinite deeps, and life, and death,—would that I could draw aught of faith in anything equal to this! I would follow the swift wind, the hurricane's track, paved with rended forests and shivered cities; I would go down to where the sea-slime binds leviathan's fleshless ribs, crawl through the ore-veins of rock-framed Apenninus and Alpinus,  thirst on the desert, and starve with the enhungered; I would shame conception, training swift wings to part the unmeasured space, to where the Pleiad sisters sing, to where the North Star lone centres the universe, for faith—faith that may fear no probing—faith drawn from an unveiled perception of the True! Now that age hath palsied me, dare I hope to strike upon it, as one may, accidentally, touch a mighty toned harp-string that all his life hath remained unstricken? Or, does senescence, and the consequent  decay of the sensate, relieve the sentient principle of its clogs—that my mental eyes are clearer, and that I stand here, beneath my threescore years and ten, in view of my fathers' and my nation's shrines and pyres and altars—seeing far beyond, though dimly and along vistas—mysterious  ways that lead I know not where, but beyond the set fooleries that I am forced to share or at once destroy the prowess of Rome among the nations, and ruin her internal peace? But whether the mild-mannered Nazarene, who had such strange power over winds and waters, diseases, and even death, and hath here a saved brand from the burning,  pile of many crimes—whether he be of the True or not, such faith as hers is worth the seeking, and I have promised—"
               Vespasian was interrupted by Nerva, who, advancing to the head of the couch, reverently folded his arms, and for some moments looked silently upon the quiet dead; then turning to Vespasian, he said:
               "In what manner shall I order the funeral?"
               Vespasian answered promptly:
               "Send to the house of one John, called by his sect the  Evangelist, and bid him hither, that he may perform the rites of her creed; and summon such about her bier as she delighted to call disciples. And do thou see that the tomb of the Domitii be opened, and the cenotaph unsealed; for there, where the semblance of her body already lies, we will place her near her son, and beside Ahenobarbus."
               Accordingly, some hours after, John, the enthusiast Evangelist, conducted Christian worship in a room of a Roman palace, the temporary abode of him who had been called king of Judea; and subsequently the rites of Christian burial were performed beneath the dome of a pagan tomb, by torch-light, and in secret; and the few who gathered there could not tell why so gorgeous a tomb had been opened to receive their humble friend and teacher—nor why the royal household were gathered there so solemnly,  yet standing aloof, while the simple funeral service went on.
               As the fervent and distinct prayer was echoed from the concavity of the emblazoned dome, which was inscribed in Mosaic with mottoes to heathen gods, sobs were heard in the cluster where stood Vespasian and his family; and when the anthem, "Glory to God," &c., filled dome and nave, echoing from the darkened space and recesses, which the light of the torches failed to pierce, Domatilla, the daughter of Vespasian, wailed aloud, for she remembered, a similar burial, and the song of the mountain people, as they had stood weeping around when the door of her mother's  transient tomb was closed, at Valley Villa.
               The rites were ended. The sepulchre was sealed. The last tear that pity owed fell unseen in the dull torch-light; and the little company moved silently out, and went to their homes, relieved that the sad pilgrim's journey was done.
               Vespasian possessed that "best thing in best human minds, that will not take anything for granted," and he set about fishing for truth in the huge sea of errors furnished by the philosophies of Pliny and other writers, who had been invited by the repose of the times to animated  metaphysical researches; and he found himself on the brink of time with an unkept promise rebuking him; but that was years after, in the leisure of a clear political horizon, when there were few governmental problems to discuss, and fewer abuses to be redressed, and he had become worried with the baseless visions of others; then, in the sick-chamber,  he found time to remember, to think, and to die, with the unkept promise, and the unsolved mystery embracing each other like spectres, and mocking him. But this is a digression and a forestalling of the ten years he lived and reigned beloved and prosperous.
            
            
               CHAPTER LIX.
               THE STRANGE GALLEY.
               A FESTIVAL of Jupiter was just over at Rome, and Paris came down to Misenum charged with letters from Lamia. Longina questioned him of the pageantries that had fed the gourmand eyes of the thousands that had filled Rome on that day, which led him to speak of himself,  for his performances had made no inconsiderable addition  to the entertainment that had been protracted until a late hour of the night.
               Her questions drifted gradually to the themes that  occupied her thoughts, and he answered her:
               "Yes: I saw him on the steps that led up to the portico of the Forum Romanum, haranguing the squads around touching the law of intermarriage between Romans and foreigners; which law regards the children of such as aliens, and not entitled to the rights of inheritance. As he spoke, Vespasian's chariot drew up, and he paused in respect to his father, until he should pass by.
               "Vespasian alighted, and went slowly up the steps, leaning on Nerva, for he was feeble; but ere he reached the porch, he turned around, and calling to Domitian, asked him if Titus were yet in the Forum. To which the latter replied lustily:
               "I know not: my august brother hath had another keeper this many a day; so that I cannot even tell where he hath bestowed himself at this hour, when all true  Romans expect his presence here!'
               
               "Vespasian frowned sternly into the face of his oily-tongued  son, and, as a glow overspread his embarrassed  countenance, he turned silently and went up.
               "Domitian looked after him, a sinister smile on his handsome but now repulsive face, until his father's form gained the porch and disappeared under the arches; then he turned to the listeners around, and with a light laugh stretched forth his arm, and, pointing with his finger, said:
               "'Behold! he whom my father seeketh knowledge of, waiteth by the door of yonder synagogue, while the Jewess Bernice prayeth within!'
               "We all turned our faces toward the Janiculum, and conspicuous, though afar off, we beheld the sparkling chariot of Titus, with its six black silver-maned steeds, restlessly stamping by the portal of the Jewish synagogue! Even as we looked, Titus himself emerged from the portal and entered his waiting chariot!
               "There was a movement and a stir, and anxious gazing toward the mount, and up to the face of Domitian, who still pointed significantly, until the smile of derision  gradually faded from his face; then slowly dropping his arm, he addressed them:
               "'Friends, Romans! it behooves me to be silent; but watch ye this day, and ye will see how the worship of your fathers is despised, and how the gods are insulted in their very temples!'
               "With this he took from the hands of a servant, that stood by him, a heavy purse of golden denarii, and scattered them among the crowd. No man shouted or returned him thanks, but his gold was gathered, and he knew that what had been seen and heard would be remembered; for the cluster of men assembled there were mostly idlers—loungers  that had nothing else to do but disseminate discontent  and 'tit-bits' that feed the craving of constitutional grumblers."
               Paris paused; and Longina, looking into his face, read her own thoughts there, as clearly as if he had said to her in words:
               "Now, indeed, the wind-gauge setteth steadily toward the point. Flavius Domitian is again himself!"
               Neither spoke for some moments; and then Paris, who had been standing in the presence of his mistress and friend, obeyed the motion of her hand, and seated himself on one of the ivory-backed seats that filled a curtained oriel facing the west and the ocean. The facings and furniture of the recess matched the adornments of the room, whose tables and vases, and bas-relief caryatides and statuary supporting cornice and window-arches, were of Pentelic marble, white and cold and pure as the woman would have had her soul, but could not, for the labyrinthic maze of error into which her youth had hopelessly fallen, and from which to escape her maturer years had not given sufficient moral sentience and force.
               The tapestry of the room, flowing in folds from the curved cornices, supported at intervals by caryatides, was of blue silk, as were the cushions of the ivory chairs and double seats in oriel and room. The floor was covered with pale-yellow  mossy-looking carpeting, unwrought, except in the centre, which represented a sky-reflecting lake, with white swans and water-lilies dotting the surface. The golden-fringed  matting, on which Longina's seat was placed, was of blue, centred with a clump of white lilies, among which a nest of swan's eggs looked as if in danger of being crushed by the restless tattooing of her slippered feet.
               Longina had not changed in appearance. Her hair about the brow still simulated yellow mist; thence parting,  it lay like crimped floss or dense folds of golden gauze, partly on and over the curved ivory lace-work that formed the back and elbow-sconces of her seat, from which it flashed to the floor, playing with a ray that had come over the sea from the setting sun.
               As the sun-ray and the smiling hair dallied on the blue matting, Paris stooped and gathered a handful of ringed tresses to his lips, for a moment; and as they fell back to the embrace of the sunshine beside the white folds of her robe, Longina did not rebuke him; but stooping forward, she laid her hand upon his, that had grasped the elbow of her seat, and smiling, said kindly:
               "Thou wilt never forget the sickly whimsies of our valley home."
               "I could not help it, my sister; and I think if thou wilt but now install me as thy hair-dresser, I can feel that we are boy and girl again by the lake-shore; for thou rememberest  the long morning-hours that, while my father and brother were busy with the flocks, I stole thy maid-servant's office. We were happier then than now, Longina."
               "Happier perhaps, but in our ignorance, Paris—"
               "And our innocence, Longina."
               "Innocent—only that we had not otherwise to choose. An innocence that dependeth on accident for its vitality, is not innocence, Paris!"
               "I am listening, Longina."
               "Had my father placed me where I could have been tutored in the ways to which his ample fortunes would have elevated his daughter, I should have been able to meet the demands on world-knowledge by the time I had occasion for it, and should have known, by true estimate, to value the things my spirit panted after, and so have chosen of two ways, in the light ejected upon them by knowledge—perhaps the right with the invincible determination with which I now pursue that wrong to which accident and  ignorance opened the way. Only incapacity may seek safety in ignorance. The dead clod that hath no quickening germ needs no cultivation, and may lie unstirred in its valley until the final dismemberment of matters; but the soul of Corbulo's daughter must needs evolve itself to some extent of its capacity; and I struggled in the suffocating atmosphere  of our confined sphere, until, in my efforts to free myself,  I plunged into that bituminous pit whose foulness clings to my life yet, though even then my first taste of world-pleasures was purchased with a bleeding heart. Our lake-shore life was well enough for childhood's pastimes and pleasure, and I do many times tearfully remember it; but there are pleasures in reach of the cultivated mind to which those  simple joys rate but as a sand-grain to the huge heap. But  hast thou nothing more to tell me?"
               "Little, and yet enough: Domitian, who knows me only as the pantomime Paris, came near, and touching me on the shoulder, said: 'Friend, forget not that I desire a word with thee.' But at that moment Titus's chariot came thundering  over the Sublician, and we hurried into the Forum, out of the way of the mounted guards, who parted the huzzaing crowds right and left. Amid thee scrambling for seats and places, I lost sight of Domitian, and saw him no more until the oration of Titus was over, and the emperor, with his noble son beside him in the imperial ear, was  proceeding to the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, the great nave of which has been repaired for the ceremonies. Crowds were gathering about the ruined Forum, and as I gazed upward to the temple—half-way up its hundred steps—I saw Domitian, girt about by some dozens of gaping plebeians.
               "When the altars were ready, and Vespasian stood up with his sons to do sacrifice before the people, Titus stood with folded arms looking on, his face twitching with  ill-suppressed mirth, that was shaking his chest with the laughter of contempt. Nevertheless, when the priest filled the three golden vessels for the libation, and handing one to Titus, he received it, and advanced promptly with his father and brother to empty it upon the sacrifice; but  suddenly he stopped, and with a gesture of contempt said, turning to the priest:
               "'Come, thy hands are fitter for this foolery than mine: do thou finish it!"
               "And relinquishing the bubbling cup to the priest, he turned upon his heel and moved off, while Domitian, with more than usual solemnity, finished his own libation, and then, taking the full goblet from the priest, officiated in his brother's name. As he finished the rite, there was an exclamation from the priests, that was echoed by the augurs and the people."
               "Why," said Longina, "what need was there for  exclaims?"
               "Oh, there is a rusty augury recorded in the archives of the temple, that it should be twice destroyed, and not rebuilt until a prince having two horns should be found sacrificing in the altar-place—that him would Jupiter anoint as the king that should rebuild his fallen temple and preserve the worship of the gods; and when Domitian held up the empty cups above his head, uttering the usual formula, the high-priest and augurs and some of the people were struck with the similitude, for the goblets were  horn-shaped!"
               "Ay, and the temple has been twice destroyed—once in the reign of Scylla, by accident, and again by the  turbulence of Otho and Vitellius!" exclaimed Longina, somewhat excited; but whatever train of thought had been started by the coincidence recalled, was clipped from all connection with the emotions of the next moment, for a magnificent pleasure-galley was seen driving to the pier, and Longina and her companion stepped out upon the balcony that surrounded the oriel, to get a better view of the stranger; but the vessel was soon hidden by the curving bank of the inlet, that formed an ample harbor for the pleasure-crafts that came to the villa, once the residence of C. Marius, and the place where the Emperor Tiberius had paid the deep debt that cancelled none of his crimes.
               When Longina turned to her companion, she perceived that his face had paled to the hue of the caryatid beside the door, and that his features were working spasmodically as his eyes followed the blue pennon that floated just over the low trees, as the strange vessel rounded into the bay, lying close to the shore, itself invisible to those in the balcony.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER LX.
               JOSEPHUS IN HIS STUDIO.
               A TWILIGHT dimness of plentiful dust obscured everything  in the room, and order seemed never to have entered its precincts; for the unhallowed presence of woman and menial had, for months, been interdicted there. Dust and dirt lay over rolls of old manuscript, fresh parchment, scattered papers, and articles of clothing, indiscriminately lying on chair, lounge, table, and floor. One or two vessels of insect and dust-coated water stood on stands, and as many were overturned on the floor. Several inkhorns filled with differently colored fluids, on the writing-table, seemed in immediate use; other some were lying around—several dry, and other several lying in their emptied inks—until it might have been said that "motley was the only wear" of that floor, the which fancy-habiliment bore no resemblance to the fine checkered marble of which the floor was composed.
               A man with sparkling black eyes—or eyes that were then sparkling and abundantly triumphant in their animated  expression—possessing a bold, handsome brow, and a mouth intensely indicative of firmness and courage, was coiling a red silken twine about a manuscript scroll.
               His face was aglow with light, but not the rosy light of health. The enthusiasm of some inward delight had dappled  his exceedingly pale face with ruddy spots, that looked like rose-leaves upon Pentelic marble.
               His eager fingers tied and sealed the cord, and then with an air of loving reverence he inserted it in a silver cylinder, and fitting on the top, he placed it in the hands of a servant who stood waiting. As he did so, he only said:
               "I will be at the palace betimes." Then he must have gone mad, for as the door closed behind the servant, he dropped into a chair, and throwing back his head until his long black hair reached half to the floor, he drew a long relief-giving respiration, and then whooped so loudly that the echoes filled the vast empty rooms that were around him. Not satisfied, he sprang up, and seized a silver salver filled with empty and half-empty wine-cups, oversetting them, and while some set up a clattering oscillation on the dirty table, and others rolled upon the floor mingling their contents with the general confusion, he elevated the salver above his head and began striking it vehemently, as Jewish maidens strike their timbrels, at the same time executing what would now be called a succession of pirouettes, the line of his motions, as drawn in the dust of the floor,  resembling somewhat the moon's path, with an improgressive revolution at regular intervals.
               The last book of "The Jewish War" was finished; and Josephus, though of twoscore, was acting like a schoolboy or a madman, in his joy.
               Titus had entered his chariot to proceed to the Forum, but at a hasty message from Bernice, he descended and went to her apartments, where he learned that Josephus had been taken suddenly ill on his way to the palace, and was lying within the synagogue to which he had been  conveyed, being seized with a swooning near the door thereof, from real illness and the heat of the thronged streets; for it was the day of the festival of Jupiter.
               It was full time that Titus should be at the Forum. Romanum manum, but on re-entering his chariot accompanied by Bernice, the charioteer drove to the Janiculum and to the synagogue, where they found the man whom many considered  a prophet, for he had foretold the elevation of Vespasian  and Titus to imperial dignity, before the death of Nero.
               Josephus was very weak from nervous prostration, but revived under the influence of opiates, sufficiently to be placed in Bernice's own chariot, that had been ordered to follow her to the Janiculum, and by private ways Bernice returned with him to the palace, some time after Titus had gone to the Forum.
               So it was that Titus was seen to emerge from the  synagogue by Domitian and the rabble outside of the Forum, thus giving Domitian an opportunity he had longed for of seeding distrust against his noble brother, whose  connection with the Jewess Bernice was already a source of jealousy in the minds of both Greek and Roman, who had begun to see that Titus's piety toward the gods was waning, even to neglect of the proper sacrificial ceremonies.
               He had disappointed some, by a negative course in regard  to the rebuilding of the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus,  which Vespasian made some attempt to do.
               Josephus had sent his volumes of "The Jewish War" to be approved by Titus, who placed them in his library, after Josephus himself had read each to Bernice, she being unable to read fluently the Syro-Chaldaic in which they were written.
               On the morning succeeding the final completion of his tasks, Josephus found that an alarming depression of his nervous energies had followed close on the heels of cessation from labor, being no longer braced by the force of his will, which, having nothing further to accomplish, had relaxed and died with the delirious ecstasy in which he had indulged dulged, ending with the triumphant anthem of Miriam and an impromptu dance of his own.
               He had promised to be with Bernice while Rome was jubilate and busy with her idolatrous customs and feastings. He knew that the smoke of those heathen altars was as offensive to Bernice as to himself, and that but for him she would be alone, and writhing in humiliation that her nation had been thrown out like scattered dust cast upon the winds—that Judah was become a handful, skulking in heathen lands, where even the memory of the lost  sacrifices of the holy Temple was mocked by fumes of burning flesh on Baal's altars.
               Josephus was therefore the more determined to be with Bernice, to rip up old wounds, reading of their slaughtered princes and people, and together weep, as they oft had done, for the charred but sacred heaps of Moriah, the fallen palaces of Zion, and the felled forests that had  gladdened Ephraim and shut the sun from the eternal hills embracing the Holy City of God, that had shone like a rich jewel in a rare setting, enrimmed by its green hills.
               Josephus, nerveless and very faint, lay on kermes  cushions, on a carved and gilded couch.
               The light lemon-colored curtains were parted all away, and fastened to the gilt fretwork heading, that, curving upward, formed a support to a high silken-lined circular canopy.
               The latticed window-shutters were thrown wide, to admit whatever of freshness there might be in the atmosphere, that here was odorous and cool, laden from the fountains and fresh-water lakes of the gardens of Mæcenas that lay between the Palatine and Esquiline. From its grots, parterres,  and vistas the breeze came with fingers dipped in coolness for the brow of the sick man, aiding Bernice, who, with palms as soft as the breeze, laved his face in odorous and exhilarating waters that had been cooled in Alpine snow.
               Bernice tended the sick man by right of kinship, for he, too, traced the roots of his family-tree to the Asmonean princes, and he possessed the same enthusiastic love for every drop of blood that came from the venerated fountain of the Maccabees.
               In earlier life, Bernice had cared little for ancestral glory—less for her nation's peculiar pride, the result of the Promise, that was their boasted heritage; but, during her residence afterward in Syria, becoming better acquainted with their history, and contemplating their woes, and the sullen courage and endurance with which they bore them, a passionate love and veneration took hold on her—not for her Idumean ancestry but the line running through her great-grandame Mariamne direct to Asmoneus, the first of the Maccabees.
               Subsequent association with Josephus intensified that feeling, to the highest enthusiasm, and she urged him to finish a work he had commenced before the Jewish war—his "Antiquities;" but he was then unable to produce the manuscript, as they were lost or misplaced, and which contained many things that Josephus desired to correct, as he said. Bernice, however, bargained with him thus:
               "But, oh! forget my name. Do not record that I, a Jewess, could love a Roman prince. Shame not Jewry by telling of her, that one of her daughters made loving terms with the conqueror while yet the smoke of her thousand cities went up to Jehovah!"
               Bernice's cool palms and the soft winds soon lulled Josephus to a light, uneven slumber; and while Bernice's quiet eyes watched his white face, the immobility of his features, and regular heaving of his chest beneath the fine linen covering, assured her that gentle spirits were soothing all his woes and weariness.
               She sat yet longer, and her eyes left the sick man's face, and wandered with an unobservant look over the room's appointments, indicative that her thoughts were gone out somewhere with her heart.
               She had not the full outline of her girlhood, nor the ripeness of the peach on her cheek. Her complexion was more waxy and clear, and in her eyes were the soft  shadows of mellowed thought.
               The rings of her black hair had been loth to go, by its crimpiness, as it was parted and smoothed back under her Jewish turban, that she now persistently wore, like golden spray coiled about her head.
               The sleeves of her rose-colored trailing robe reached to the floor as she sat; but they were open to the shoulders, and fastened there with topaz ornaments.
               Her white silken undershirt was fretted to the knees with embroidery in gold thread, and short enough to reveal her white buskins, beaded with topaz and garnet, that were crossed in listless ease on a square of red matting, on which her seat was placed; for the floor was formed of blue-veined  marble alternating with white, and diamond-shaped, radiating from the centre of the room, where, on a circular and elevated block of white marble, stood a blue porphyry vase-shaped laver or basin, supplied freshly, continually, by jets from below, that forever kept the sound of gushing water in the apartment.
               The walls of the room were lined with ivory panels, six by three feet, set in a frame of bluish-gray clinkstone, highly polished and fluted, the upright slabs column-shaped  from floor to ceiling, with transverse slabs between the panels.
               The casements were wide open, as were the two lofty doors on the opposite side, leading to a gallery around an inner court, and the sounds from the city at times seemed to reach even the senses of the sleeper.
               
               Bernice's Hebrew maid appeared suddenly at the door: with dilated eyes and scared countenance she beckoned to her mistress. Bernice arose, and, as she stepped softly over the floor, tried to suppress the audible rustle of her gliding robes; but she could not, and as her form disappeared through the door, Josephus's eyes opened.
               Bernice, thinking his sleep secure, humored the wish of her maid, and followed her to a distant part of the palace, that faced toward the Capitoline.
               As she approached, the clamor grew more and more distinct,  until she stood by a closed lattice nearest the noisy rabble beyond the gates.
               "Listen! oh, listen, my mistress!" said the maid, with increased excitement.
               Bernice did listen, and the whiteness of her face attested that she heard her own name linked with every odious epithet, coupled with the charge of sorcery, by which she was said to have won and held the love of Titus. She heard threats that appalled her; but just then turning with a pale, scared face, she sought the embrace of the loved arms outstretched to receive her, as Titus entered the door.
            
            
               CHAPTER LXI.
               THE WELCOME AND THE UNWELCOME.
               THE forsaken ray of sunshine wandered from the oriel floor, and lay aback in the room, regilding the gilded triple foot of a beautiful table composed of a single shaft, and an oval slab of blue chalcedony, centred with an inlaid cluster of pearl lilies and buds, with golden leaves and stems, and enrimmed with a wreath of white starlike flowers, to match: there, over the inlaid lilies, lay a package of neglected letters in their silken bonds, with seals unbroken; and yet they were filled with words that come not to the bidding of cold indifference—words of passionate  endearment that make glad the reciprocal heart.
               Had Longina read her husband's letters, she would have been expecting the guests that had come to the Tower of Marius, as her princely home was usually termed. She did not intend neglect, but there was no prompting of the heart to break those seals, until better leisure, when she had learned all from Paris, that more nearly interested her; by which time the letters were forgotten.
               There was a splendid and extended drive from the pier, irregular in its courses, but flanked through its whole extent by an array of trees, trimmed and cut into living arches of dense foliage, regular and smooth as if hewn from emerald stone; through which the vast park on either side appeared with its varied scenery—forest-trees trimmed in various forms—sometimes belting beautiful lakes, or running in long vistas, and again crowning some knoll in "circular array," or meeting above narrow waters, forming  artificial cascades and rivulets, that seemed from the very hand of nature. Hills were cut into sharp pyramids, and clothed in everlasting verdure with low evergreen shrubs, through which white grottos gleamed and waters danced. There were lakes and fountains bordered with flowering shrubs—marble pavilions amid aromatic foliage—and marble nymphs in their grots, and naiads by their fountains, gods and goddesses, that made the places seem peopled with beings well fitted for their beautiful haunts.
               The balcony where Longina had stood did not command  the view toward the bay or inlet, the head of which was formed into an ample pier, consisting of a semicircular array of marble steps, and terraces leading up from the water's edge.
               Longina therefore retired until further word should be brought her of the approaching guests: then she remembered  her husband's letters and sent for them to peruse, until the desired information could be obtained.
               The letters informed her that she might, in some days, expect the emperor, whose physical debility demanded rest, and the healthful air of Campania; also, that he would be accompanied by Domatilla, Bernice, and the Jew Josephus,  with their attendants, and one Flavius Clemens.
               Longina's heightened color and animated face exhibited the reverse of displeasure at the threatened intrusion on her quiet and privacy. There would be, no doubt, a numerous  retinue, but the Tower was sufficiently ample for a sovereign's court; for sovereigns had lived and died there—others as well as he who was seven times consul—the child of destiny, Caius Marius. The old hall were used to the ring of carousel and the echo of princely voices.
               As Longina, arrayed royally as the empress she at one  time desired to be, passed along a spacious corridor to go to the room where Bernice was resting from the fatigue of her journey, an uneasy feeling, occasioned by Paris's unexplained  emotion and pallor, somewhat troubled her; but she entered the chamber with a joyous step and an unmistakable  welcome for they were devoted friends, Bernice and Longina. Memories of the lake-shore formed a bond between  them, that had increased in strength as their association  became more intimate after Bernice's return from Syria. Longrina found Bernice nervous, pale, and consumed   with sadness—overcome with a melancholy despondency  unusual to her; but there was no time as yet for the intimate confidences that Bernice seemed anxious to bestow.
               Longina had other guests, to whom she must pay her warmest respects; for this purpose she was retracing the corridor, when she saw Paris by one of the pillars that formed a line of supporting shafts and arches running the length of the broad corridor.
               She was passing on with hurried steps, when Paris's evident desire to speak caused her to turn toward him, and he said, rather excitedly:
               "Are there no other guests beside those whose coming my delays of speech left unannounced?"
               "None," said Longina; "but why was it that thou didst fail to reach the Tower some days since?"
               "I was delayed by chance, but did not think they would so quickly follow up their resolves—indeed, before their herald could breathe himself from hard travel. I had other events to tell the of, but must now wait on better opportunity. Thou art sure no other guests are in the Tower than thy husband's letters bear testimony of?"
               "That question again? No. Why shouldest thou ask?"
               "I saw a signal that betrayed the proximity of others. Keep to thy chamber, nor wander in hall or garden, until I bring thee word. I cannot tell thee now, for see, thine aged friend and sometime lover hath yet enough of youth's fire to be impatient of thy tardiness—he comes to meet thee!"
               Longina turned away and hastened on to meet the feeble monarch, who, from the stalwart man of her first acquaintance,  had, in a few months, drooped to extreme feebleness.
               She would have knelt before her noble sovereign, who was scarcely a shadow of himself in physical appearance, but had lost nothing of mental vigor and moral acumen, in discerning the great truths that bear upon the relation of sovereign and subject, and his voice was yet as potent in council as it had been in the field during the best days of his manhood.
               Vespasian caught Longina by the hand, preventing her act of obeisance, and placing one arm around her, drew her to him, and received her kiss upon his thin cheek, and together they entered the rotunda, where others were assembled to greet her.
               Longina did not see Paris again that night, and she  retired late, still anxious as to the communication she felt sure he desired to make, and which she imagined had something to do with the emotion that had paled his face on the balcony.
               She had scarcely slumbered, when an unusual sound of bustle, and excitement of voices aroused her.
               The lamps were still brightly burning in her room, and she knew that but a short time had passed in slumber. Her excitement had been great, and slumber slothful in its approach, long after she had left Bernice's chamber, where she had received a partial account of events that had closed the day of the festival of Jupiter.
               Longina arose from her bed, and crossing the room, struck several strokes upon a spiral bell of silver wire that was coiled against the facing of a small oriel curtained off from the room. It was her usual manner of summoning her woman-servant, who slept in a closet at the end of a suite of three rooms, adjoining Longina's sleeping apartment.  No one came to her repeated strokes. The murmur  of troubled and excited voices still floated around her, and the sharp clanging of spurred heels on the marble floors told her that there were armed riders either going out or coming in, she could not tell in the confusion of sounds.
               Paris's cautions, she feared, had some meaning, and she was afraid to go herself out in the halls to make inquiry as to the disturbance.
               She determined, at length, to go to her woman's  apartment, outside of which a sentinel kept guard continually at night. The intervening rooms were always lighted, and totally isolated from all connection with other parts of the house, except by the doors kept guarded; for the windows opened on a high veranda, that had no other approach than by the windows of the suite.
               Longina passed rapidly along the rooms, that were  echoless, except to the rustle of her long night-robes as they rippled the tufted matting of the floors.
               The maid's room was empty, with the door locked on the inside; but the lattice was open.
               Longina heard the sentinel pacing measuredly without the closed door, and was about to undo it for the purpose of speaking to him, when her ear caught the sound of steps on the veranda.
               Listening a moment, she became conscious that the steps had not the lightness of her maid's, and she aimed to retreat  to another room; but her alarm at the near approach of some intruder caused her to drop into one of the curtained recesses formed by the deep embrasure of the windows.
               
               The person's enshrouded face was turned from her as he entered; he seemed to gaze around in some discomfiture, until a light step approached from the open window at which he had entered, and he turned to confront the maid-servant.  Longina's heart stood still as she recognized Domitian, through he wore a menial's garb.
               "Why, what hath bestirred the night to this wild clamor I heard but now? and why did I not find thee, obedient to my signal, at the Egyptian sphinx on the terrace? Thine eyes are wild! Why, what aileth thee?"
               "Oh, I have that to tell will frighten thee away this night! Thy father hath the potion, and will soon be dead!"
               "Fool! what hast thou done? It will yield to remedies, and his physician is with him! I charged thee to wait until the time I spoke of! They came prematurely, and I had nought else to do but hide me in old Jason's habit and come hither with the menials, when I found who had been chosen for my father's attendant physician. Hast thou  conferred with Paris, who should have been here some days ago?"
               "I had but thy letter; which contained the potion."
               "Then if thou hast given it, I am betrayed; for I had it of the very man who is physician to him, and who has the remedy for it. What hast thou done?"
               "Thy letter said that I must wait until the time spoken of: but mark, I could not know that he who sublimated the noxious dust would come to be physician to its effects; and when a chance was given to my hand, that I might wait for half a year, and never so much as come in sight of it, I but made haste to seize what I imagined would do thee speedy service. For, this night, what does my cheery mistress but sends a rare draught by my hands to the Hebrew woman, for her better repose; and so I recalled my mistress's oft-berating for absent-mindedness, and  determined to lay my disobedience to that score, if I were detected; but I dare be bound that the excitement of the coming morrow will never allow leisure for any question as to whether I conveyed the draught to the Hebrew woman, or to thy father by seeming mistake. I—"
               "But thou didst give it to my father, sweetened with the potion I sent thee?"
               "I did; and those who stood around heard me repeat my mistress's laudation of its rare virtues, that if suspicion should be stirred, it might fall on mistress instead of her unambitious slave."
               "Deftly done: but while we tarry here, the leech hath found the harm, and thine apt scheming will have no other end than to point suspicion to my door; for one breath from the physician will bestir old Nerva until he ferrets something to charge home to me."
               "Fear not: thy father complained of heaviness and lurking pains even as I gave the draught; and though he bade his physician sleep in the chamber next his own, my pulses did not stir with doubt as to the chances of his aid. Go hence; this is no time for the fulfilment of thy purpose now: we will see the end of this, and if circumstances  comport, thou mayest ere long attempt this passage to Longina's chambers, if the conference thou aimest at be still needful and desired. Go hence at once: I heard my mistress's clamorous summons but now, as I came from—"
               "Whence? Girl, I see thy nimble tongue hath aimed to cover up thine own hints; why shouldst thou doubt the chances of the physician's aid to my father? and whence now art thou come?"
               "The cause of my wandering had a deeper root than doubt in the physician's power to aid!"
               
               Domitian's impatience was fired at the woman's covert meaning, and he seized her by the shoulders with a grip, and flashing of the eye, that told she could give no further line to prevarication; yet she shook off his grasp, and  confronted his blazing eyes with a quiet but sinister smile, as she interposed her elevated and outstretched arm to ward the consequences of her next ambiguous reply.
               "Oh, think not these walls contain no traps and gins for meddling physicians!"
               They were interrupted by a sound, as if some small wild animal of the park had screamed within the room.
            
            
               CHAPTER LXII.
               THE WHITE FACE IN THE WATER.
               IN the chamber where Tiberius Cæsar had suffered and died, Vespasian awoke in mortal agony, but one little hour after his attendant had left him to repose.
               His tortures wrung the sharp screams that had summoned  his servants; but the physician, who had retired to the next apartment, gave no signs of attendance; and one of the men opened the door, thinking that he slept the sleep of late carousal. The room was empty, and the servants and Vespasian, supposing his services had been required during the night by some of the household,  dispatched in search of him; but he was not found, though the search embraced the entire buildings.
               A leech of the Tower was substituted, who pronounced it one of many cases he had mastered easily; consequently, Vespasian was looking directly down into the yawning grave before he or others were aware of it; and then, when the household was aroused, and couriers were sent to Rome, it was too late; and the emperor gathered himself into his bed to die. His daughter and Bernice came speedily to his summons, but Longina did not appear; and when her presence was demanded by the dying man, he was answered by scared faces and unintelligible mutterings, for she was not in her apartments, and the sentinels who kept the doors could only give an account of one fearful shriek, heard in her woman's apartment, followed by a bustle and noise of closing casements.
               
               The dying emperor spoke to his daughter of her nuptials with Flavius Clemens, who was no other than Bernice's old friend, Alexis, he having assumed the name with the fortunes of his kinsman, Flavius Clemens Romanus.
               Bernice's heart throbbed with apprehension as she met the hollow eyes fixed upon her, and saw that he desired to be left alone with her.
               When all, except Josephus, had left the room, it was with a sickening dread that she approached his bed, and stood white and ghastly before him. She knew that the heart's pain that wrung his features was greater than his bodily suffering, and that it proceeded from thoughts that were then suffocating her with a sense of coming woe.
               He took her hand and held it between both of his, stroking it with a fondness that showed his heart would have but little to do with what she knew he was about to urge her to do; for they had had some previous conversation  that led her to expect it.
               "Bernice!"
               The utterance of her name in that tone, so expressive of infinite love united with the extreme of human sympathy and suffering, broke the spell that had kept her rigid and speechless beside him. She fell upon her knees and kissed his hands, while her tears flowed upon them. She felt then, that, to procure the repose of his parting spirit, no sacrifice would be too great, and she pleaded with him to tell her what he wished her to do. Then he placed his hand upon her head as she bowed her face upon the bed.
               "Thou hast already had indications of the horrors my death will bring about, unless my son can appease the people's discontents. He will not aim to do so. He will forsake, and leave them to choose another sovereign, rather than sacrifice what he loves. But it must not be so. Him they love. He only can save the empire from factious divisions. The senate have no other choice. And if he stand not by his country, the horrors engendered by Galba, Otho, and Vitellius will be re-enacted. Daughter, thou must save thy husband to his country—thou—"
               "Tell me! tell me! that I may give thy dying moments the peace of knowing that I will do my duty. Look into my face, O my sovereign, and see if thou dost not think I am resolved!"
               She raised her face to his, and he saw that every  lineament was braced with the resolution of a martyr, while her glittering eyes betrayed that the soul was making a  compact with its God; but he said nothing until she urged him again:
               "Speak on! For by the sweet years that I have known of overteeming blessedness—by the vows that make my husband's weal outweigh the few brief throbs of life that may yet be mine, I will perform thy will. Tell me, what is it thou wouldst have me do?"
               "Bernice—daughter of a kingly line!—dost thou  remember thine ancestress, Bashemath?"
               "I remember? Yea."
               "Tell me of her!"
               "In her youth she was married to a Persian, and years after, when he became a prince of princes, and conquered her own land, his brothers raised seditious on account of their brother's Jewish wife: then she—"
               "Speak out: what did she do?"
               "She tore the diadem from her brows, and threw it in their faces!"
               "That was not all—was it?"
               Bernice darted to her feet, and, pressing her hands hard over her heart, turned her wild eyes to heaven as she  replied:
               "Oh, my God, no! She pressed the nipple from between tween the warm and tender gums of her infant, and left it there upon the cushions of her husband's throne, and went—"
               "Where went she, daughter?"
               "To her own land, and died childless and husbandless in Jewry!"
               Bernice was fearfully agitated; the full veins were traced by dark thick cords upon her brow and temples; and the clasped hands clutched, until the blood trickled from wounds pierced by her own empurpled finger-nails: and yet, Vespasian could not put off what he had to say; for the links were fast falling from the short remnant-chain  of his existence, and he quickly followed up her last answer by the question:
               "And was she not happier than if—if—"
               Bernice turned almost fiercely upon him, as she answered, in a quick, strange voice, ineffably firm, but ringing and defiant: "She was happier, sire! Oh, say no more!—think not that I scorn a Roman crown less than she the Persian! I married the man Titus—not a Roman emperor—and gloried in my wifehood to such a man, which had, in it, more of dignity and fair honor than the heavy glories that weigh down the head that wears a crown! It will not fret my heart to leave the regal pomps that I have ever felt an emptiness; but—oh! sire—"
               And Bernice's voice lost its asperity in sobs, as she  concluded:
               "Sire! I know my duty now is—to—to die!"
               "Not to die, Bernice! but thou must not return again to Rome. With thy countryman, Josephus, thou mayest return  to Syria—to thine own people. Thou must depart before the summons I have sent can bring thy husband hither.
               "Promise, Bernice, that the morrow's dawn shall see thee on thy way—that dawn that shall never open the day for me!"
               "What! Not take leave of my sweet babes—my precious  noble boy, that hath all his father's better parts, and thine? Oh, never again to repose within his arms—never hear his voice, nor see his lovely face again? Oh, old man, the approach of death hath made thee hard of heart!  I will sever me from this country, but do not force me to go without one more taste of joys that he, in thy blessed reign of some half-score years, has made a ceaseless stream. Oh, give me the chance of dying upon his bosom; for methinks  that I should die in the parting, and never live to raise me from it, knowing it should be the last! And then, then I should be dead—and—"
               "Oh, Bernice, thou shouldst have counselled him to revere the altars he too openly contemns—to keep the feasts and sacrifices—that, however false and futile, are dear to the people, and which the enrolled fathers and their august rulers thought not unfit."
               "Never! never! I counsel my husband to enkindle the altars of Baal? Oh, that were crossing with higher behests than thine!"
               "My life is running its sands, woman; and thou hast not given thy promise. The resolve to do had best be  performed speedily. The danger thou provokest by remaining  here, will fall on thy husband's and thy children's heads! Swear to me by what God thou wilt—but swear!"
               Bernice saw his filming eye, and the awful promise was tortured from her unwilling soul.
               As the name of Jehovah, by whom she had sworn, parted from her convulsed lips, she fell prone to the floor, and a wild, despairing cry echoed through the apartment.
               Josephus, still very feeble, obeying the signal of the  excited and suffering emperor, took her up, and with some difficulty conveyed her into the physician's chamber adjoining, just as the large doors from the hall slid away, and several persons entered, thinking the emperor must have suddenly grown worse, or mayhap died. When Josephus  had placed her upon a couch and procured the attendance of her women, he returned to Vespasian.  Visible changes made by the progress of his malady were written fearfully upon his features, yet he signed to be again left with Josephus.
               As the parted doors glided together, he said:
               "She was conformable: but nature is weak, and I would that thou wouldst take her at once to Misenum, and embark. Titus will hasten hither at the command I sent, not knowing  that he will find his father's stiff corpse; and Nerva, here in the Tower of Marius, will see that the people hear that he hath put away the cause of their discontents, making such reports antedate the news of my death; so they will be prepared to receive him with acclamations, when they hear that I am no more; and the threatened intestine  divisions will be averted from the Roman commonwealth. Flavius Josephus, thou art a respecter of set forms, holding them sacred; now, as thou art a Jew, reach hither thy hand and place it beneath my thigh, and swear to me as thou hast promised!"
               Josephus did so.
               "Now swear that thou wilt prevent thy countrywoman's forfeiture of her promises, by thy priestly power, thine arguments of Jewish law, and whatever of persuasion in thee lieth, or force, if needful, by thee—thou wilt prevent her return to Rome, and all future conference with my son. Swear!"
               Josephus did not hesitate to strengthen his promises with oaths; and as he withdrew his hand, Vespasian's satisfied look attested the truth of his words:
               "Now is this a blessed peace! and I will gather myself up to meet mine agonies with a serene spirit!"
               While Vespasian lingered in his dying condition hour after hour beyond expectation, the Tower was a scene of confusion.
               The report of the sentinel and continued absence of Longina affrighted those who had exemption from  attendance on the emperor, among whom was the pantomime Paris. He was seen hurrying to and fro, conversing with the sentinels at their posts, along the corridors and on the terraces without. His face was pallid, and his countenance  fierce and wild. At length, bounding over balcony and balustrade, he seemed to be impelled by an invisible motive-power that no one understood. As he disappeared around an angle of the building, some said he was practising a part in strange time—but none followed; and Paris was skirting the walls near the dungeons of the Tower, when he saw a man emerge from a low portal bearing a burden. There were no lights about that part of the building, and Paris could only see the outlines of the figure against the white walls of the keep, that shone in the faint light of a shrouded moon, until the man and his burden disappeared in the shrubbery of the terrace.
               Paris thought not of following him, nor supposed he had aught to do with him, but straight on to the Egyptian sphinx at the end of the first terrace his swift feet spurned the marbled walks.
               He heard a sound of busy steps, then a splashing of waters; and when, a few steps farther, he came abreast of a fountain, the moon shot from behind a cloud and shone into its broad basin—shone on a white face upturned beneath the waters of the even-full basin!
            
            
               
               CHAPTER LXIII.
               THE DARKNESS BEFORE THE DAWN.
               WHEN the moon came out from the cloud, shining upon the white face beneath the clear waters of the fountain, its light also flashed from the white oaken oars of a covered galley moving away from the pier.
               Bernice had been taken, in a state of half unconsciousness,  to a curtained litter that had been brought within a darkened passage leading from the apartments of the women, and was conveyed rapidly by four bearers to the galley that was to take her to Misenum.
               She was sufficiently conscious, by the time the oarsman began to stroke the half moonlit waters, to feel that behind  her, evermore, were children and spouse, as Josephus held her hand and tried to animate her with the strength that consciousness of well-performed duty should give; but she only felt that behind her was all she was ever to know of life and love—before her was death.
               On the evening of the festival of Jupiter, her palace-gates had been forced, and herself narrowly escaped the rude touch of the incensed rabble, even as she lay in the arms of her husband, who, late in the day, had become aware of the causes that led to the frequent brawls he had observed agitating the dense masses about the Forum and public streets. He at once hastened to Bernice, hoping to arrest the tidal wave of clamor that was gradually heaving up toward the Palatine, ere it reached her ears. He entered the apartment of Josephus but a moment after Bernice had left it, and followed her in time to see her turn toward the wing that faced the Capitoline. His design was frustrated,  for, before he reached her, she had understood too well the meaning of the swaying concourse of heads  without the gates.
               Vespasian dispatched the prætorian guards in time to arrest their violence, but Bernice was convulsed with terror, that threatened her life for hours.
               It was ascertained that the most dissolute and abandoned made the chief element of the attacking forces, and an effort was made by Titus and Vespasian to punish the  ring-leaders; then they found the taint of furious discontent pervaded the more respectable classes, and was rapidly spreading into the country.
               Vespasian had, some months before, been induced by increasing  illness to go into Campagna, in the hope of receiving benefit from its healthful waters and salubrious air; but some event of importance recalled him to the capital,  before he had a chance of testing the improvement hoped to be derived from his change of residence. After the festival of Jupiter, and its attendant horrors, he determined to  return to Campagna, and to induce Titus to send Bernice with him, while he should remain, to satisfy the misled populace.
               The near approach of death at the Tower only accelerated  his plans in regard to Bernice. He had it in view to appeal to Bernice's Jewish pride, and her known devotion  to her husband's and children's interests, keeping before  her, in his previous conversations, the fact, that she, alone, would stand against her husband's peaceful reign over the empire, when he should be gone.
               Vespasian did not know that his younger son had disseminated  the falsehoods that had, for some time, been gaining ground in all the cities and densely populated districts, regarding the sorceries and influences played upon Titus by this woman, whom many persisted in not recognizing  as his wife.
               Vespasian had given no confidence to his younger son's well-acted repentance and apparent reform of deportment; but he had no suspicion that to that son he owed his  premature infirmities, through a woman of his household, who, on his leaving Campagna, at her own request, had been installed waiting-woman to Longina.
               Titus and Bernice had offered no resistance to the wishes of the emperor, that she should accompany him to the Tower of Marius: indeed, Bernice longed for the sympathy of Longina, and was glad to go, being assured that her children should follow by the next outgoing tide. Hoping, and scarce doubting, that Titus could easily quell the  dissensions, her tender parting from him was yet tearful, and fraught with misgivings, as many a more temporary parting had been, when the skies of their fortunes were free from lowering clouds.
               The dawn was beginning to flaunt her pink robes, when a laden ship put off from Misenum; and when the sun's disk appeared red and round in the haze that lined the coast of the long Apennine range that seemed to form the distant shore, Bernice stood up beneath an awning, to gaze back on the land that, in her youth, she had approached along the same waters in the darkness of night, and when the fury of the tempest paralyzed her with its horrors. Did she, in view of the present, then, wish that she had never reached that shore? No: once the thought passed over her like a drifting cloud, but the instant cry of her soul negatived the suggestion, as thoughts of the beloved and deserted quickly followed; and she inly acknowledged that, were her life a century in extent, and every moment a deathly pang, she could not, would not, undo that which had given her to know the love of Titus and the sacred claims of motherhood.
               But the waste of waters was all around her, and as the ship heaved beneath its burdens, she found she could not stand, and, falling back on the couch that had been placed for her there, she gave herself up to the agony of mentally contemplating her husband's grief, and her children's vain cries, when they should know that she had left them.
               Near the close of the day, a stiff wind sprang up that kept the ship from following her courses, and at sundown they were close upon the Æolian isles. When the  darkness of a starless sky was spread over the ocean, suddenly the ship seemed to be caught in the deft fingers of some ocean-fiend, and twirled until the vexed waters were piled, in moving, whirling heaps of foam about and over her, and the voyagers became aware that they were the sport of a marine whirlwind.
               When the impromptu waltz of the wind and vessel was over, and inconstant Æolus had dropped his unwilling partner from his fickle embrace on a couch of snowy foam in the midst of the sea, she was without sail, compass, or rudder while a storm of some violence was fast following in the path of the whirlwind.
               Those aboard could hear its mutterings and roaring, and by occasional flashes from the clouds could see a dense line bearing down upon them. Slowly it came, for the ship was borne before the storm by an advance-guard of the power that was urging the tempest on, in its wake.
               The violence of the storm, therefore, had subsided before it reached the dismasted ship; and well for the crew was it, that they received only the remnant-drippings of the disgorged heavens.
               Bernice's couch was fixed fast to the ship's timbers, and she had suffered herself to be lashed to it at the first broadside side of the winds, that had whirled her from her course, and apprised the crew of dangers that Bernice smiled upon, feeling a joy in the companionship of things, that had in them something akin to the convulsions of her own bosom.
               She had, hours before, been exhausted by paroxysms of grief, and ineffectual attempts to evoke some light out of the darkness, until mental and physical depression induced the gloomy quiet of partial delirium; in which state she remained until the influences of the night gave her senses some activity, and part of the time she lay laughing with the storm, and apostrophizing the lightnings and the  tempest as she would familiar things.
               In this condition, Josephus, staggering from the motion of the vessel as he came in, found her. With much difficulty  he managed to procure an opiate, which he administered,  and she fell asleep, babbling of the cascade at Valley Villa, until her maids beside her wept aloud, and their meanings for her mingled with their cries of fear at each lurch of the vessel, that made it difficult for them to keep their places beside their slumbering mistress.
               At the same hour, Titus, in Rome, was awakened from a dream that showed him Bernice sleeping as she then slept, with the pallor of suffering upon her face. He awoke to find his father's messenger waiting for admittance to his presence. In the same hour he cast himself on the fierce waves, that he thought would bear him to Bernice,  with a great fear upon him that all was not well with her.
               The shipmaster disliked to put to sea, for the course of the ship was in the wind's eye, and clouds were hiding the heavens, on the south; but a large reward decided him, and Titus blessed the billowy sea that could bear him on to his love; for he had tidings for her ears. How little he knew of the space between them, and of the frothy envelope of frisked waters enshrouding her.
               Before day-dawn, Bernice awoke rational, braced and invigorated for another wrestle with her woes.
               All night the dismantled vessel had floated upon the agitated seas, borne hither and thither as the winds and waves listed. No one had any idea of her position. They might be far from the track of any ship, in unexplored seas, for aught that was known to the crew. Their decks were swept clean of everything; not a rag of canvas for a sail, or an awning to protect them from the brazen skies of the morrow—if the morrow ever came. There were few females on board—none but those attendant on Bernice; for the ship had been loaded with commodities for the merchant-service, being the only one in the harbor that was ready, bound for the southern seas, when Josephus reached Misenum.
               Its accommodations were rude, but Bernice noticed nothing of its coarse appointments. Had she been couched on thistles, she would have as little heeded their pricking; but her bed was comfortable, and her maids had lined the small recess where she lay with rich hangings, which their forethought had procured at a tapestry mart in Misenum; for Josephus had brought but her Jewish maidens, telling them only, that their mistress was suddenly determined to escape from the country, where she was become so little welcome.
               Through that night of gloom, beside their mistress's fixed couch they had knelt, fanning her with gilded fans made of the tails of the lyre-bird. They were frightened and anxious, but never once did they turn away from that couch; and when she awoke during the dark hour that precedes the dawn, their pitying looks touched her to tears, and the three were weeping together, when a heavy lurch of the ship and a tremendous jar caused the two maids to scream with fright. There were loud exclamations, and hurryings  forward and aft, and questions and replies, by which, Bernice learned, that they were in collision with some other vessel, but with what damage to either she could not judge, and very little cared to know, since she could not aid them. The respite, however, had dried her maidens' tears, and she yielded to their wishes that one should leave her, for the moment, that would suffice to ascertain the state of matters.
               The maiden's absence extended until Bernice had  forgotten the occasion of it, and returned to the sorrowful images of her own mind.
               She lay with her hands clasping on her breast, and her eyes closed, with the lashes folding down over the  hollowness that her agonies had so quickly cut.
               She did not hear the sound of voices and coming steps, until the small door glided back, and oh—that voice! It was no dream, and she felt herself gathered into those tender arms, before she fainted with joy upon the bosom of her husband!
            
            
               CHAPTER LXIV.
               THE DAWN AFTER THE DARKNESS.
               THE wind, in its pirouette with the merchantman,  becoming drunken with its own motions, had forgotten its first course, and went, blindly staggering, until it set fairly toward the north, and so heaved back the ship along its own out-bound path, and far past the harbor of Misenum, until it was left lying upon the waves almost in the usual track of vessels leaving Puteoli; hence it was that the crippled thing ran foul of the vessel in which Titus had embarked, and which, by the violence of the wind, had been forced to a slight detour from its course.
               There was little damage to either vessel, for the one propelled against the wind struck the other with little force, which other, possessing no momentum, offered little resistance, and the concussion was comparatively harmless.
               When the crews by hail and answer had ascertained the purposes and conditions of each, there was an interchange of greeting, and offers of assistance to the crippled bark.
               Lights glanced about, and the Hebrew woman of Bernice,  recognizing some of her acquaintance, called to them, and the result was, that Titus came to the knowledge that his wife was on board of the other vessel.
               Joy has been known to rupture the delicate tissues of life, when physical attenuation has made the threads thereof too weak to bear the rude and frantic leaps of the wild, joy-crazed heart; but Bernice's hold on life was by chords of greater strength, and, by restoratives and the endearments of Titus, was soon in possession of her faculties, but  trembling and nervous from emotions of both joy and grief—grief that the conditions of her vow were yet in force, and that she must recognize but the parting smile of her  happiness.
               When Titus demanded some explanation of her presence in the merchantman, and the cause of her evident distress, with great sobs and wringing of hands she told him.
               "Nay, nay, my wife! never! What? Didst thou not know that I would have followed thee, and, had I not found thy hiding-place, would have throttled the prince of Syria, every one, or forced them to yield thee from their realms?
               "I have better plans and hopes than to build Rome's weal upon thy despair! I have satisfied the gulled fools, by giving half my private fortune to rebuild their chief temple of Jupiter Capitolinus; and have sent my memorial to the senate, assuring them that I have no desire or intent to level the people's altars and despoil their temples, as they had been told, for I care not for their senseless worship.
               "In answer to my memorial, the senate graciously  restored me the high privilege of being still a servant to thankless Rome, permitting me to retain my wife, provided her son may not be called to the succession.
               "I gladly yielded to the demand; for, for him, my noble boy, I would spurn a crown that had not been earned by his own prowess. No fear but that he will win one, a noble one, if but spared to manhood!
               "See then, my Bernice, thy promise to my father holds not good, and thou wilt come with me; and if he be dead, we will weep for him, and together lay him in the tomb of the Cæsars. If he still lives, then must he absolve thee from thine oaths; seeing that the powers that rule both thee and him have cast thee back into mine arms; and the people will be moved, that the gods they worship—Jupiter, ruler of the lightnings and the thunder, Æolus of the winds, and Neptune of the waves—have all combined to force thee back to thy husband and to Rome again. They will cry, 'The gods approve!' and so thou and I will be happy again, my love! Come, let me bear thee to yonder ship, where lie thy slumbering children, whose prattle of their mother kept on, when their sweet eyelids were battling, in vain attempts, to resist the drowsiness of their usual bed-hour; for they were happy, being told that they should have thy morning kiss, as was their wont. Come!"
               Titus lifted her, still doubting the way to duty, but yielding to the bliss of once more feeling his heart beating against her own, as he conveyed her to the splendid vessel, whose rich arrangements as little affected her as the coarse appointments of the merchantman.
               It was noon when the vessel anchored at Misenum, and alleys were procured to take the party to the pier of Marius's Tower. The shadows were slanting westward, when Titus and Bernice arrived, to find that Vespasian yet lived, and was eager to see his son; but his agonies had become sullen and slow, so that his sufferings were not acute.
               Bernice and Josephus retired to their apartments, lest the sight of them should hurry up the finale that finishes all, and to which his malady still pointed surely.
               The emperor was "all the emperor," in his advice to his son, in relation to the succession, and the best means of securing peace to the commonwealth. Titus listened, and,  when he had finished, told his father of the senate's decree, and of his own acts, at which Vespasian expressed satisfaction,  but seemed laboring with oppressive thoughts, which  Titus perceiving, judged of their nature, and hastened to tell him of the strange chance that had restored Bernice to him.
               The narration was necessarily of some length, during which Vespasian showed the various symptoms of alarm, surprise, and even pleasure, as the rehearsal affected him.
               "Thou wilt absolve her from her oath, my father?" said Titus, kneeling by the bed and kissing the withered hands he held.
               At that moment Bernice and Josephus entered, and threw themselves with bowed heads down on either side of Titus.
               Vespasian, releasing his hands from his son's clasp, laid one on each head, saying:
               "I do absolve ye both from your oaths, until the peace of Rome demands the fulfilment."
               Vespasian could with difficulty articulate the last words of the sentence, which were the last that were intelligible.
               He seemed to have held up, only that he might see his son, for ere Domitian reached the Tower, two hours after Titus's arrival, Vespasian was a corpse.
               Domitian and Lamia had in company hurried down to Campagna from Veii; and while the alarmed, agonized husband sought in vain for his wife, pursuing every  possible clue to the cause of her disappearance, Domitian's noisy grief for his father was the topic of quite as much talk as the strange circumstance of Longina's absence at such a time; for the white face, seen by the moon's light, deep under the clear waters of the fountain-basin, was that of Clotho, the waiting-woman of Longina, gone to her account, with her victim following after, instead of preceding her.
               Paris, after the hour in which he discovered the body, was seen no more in the Tower, and no one knew whither he had gone.
               There were some evil suggestions, that Pliny's absence   had something to do with Longina's, although he had been gone some days before; but in the midst of it, Pliny arrived from Misenum, brought up by the news of Vespasian's  illness and Longina's unexplained disappearance, and he entered with equal interest into the mourning of the mourners, and the search for the mistress of the Tower.
               When the funeral barge, with its accompanying trappings of splendid woe, left the pier, Bernice returned to the  Tower. She could not yet feel willing to go to Rome. She was painfully anxious regarding Longina, for the dead body of the maid and the accounts of the sentinel left but little doubt that Longina had been forcibly abducted—but by whom?
               After some days, a deputation from the senate found Bernice, quietly teaching her two younger children the art of spelling, although their little lips could scarcely mould the syllables, even brokenly.
               She met the deputation with cold dignity; and when she was presented with an invitation to Rome, that she might be crowned on the same day with her husband, her Jewish  blood spouted to her cheeks, and she refused utterly to share a Romish throne—expressing her contempt for its crown, except upon Romish brows:—she was the wife of the man, Titus—had never aspired or consented to be Rome's  empress, and she would not:—that she could not forget that the crowns of her country's kings had been ground to  dust by the power of Rome; therefore her legitimate diadem  was but the matron's turban!
               With this answer the deputation returned to Rome; but Bernice followed, at the request of her husband, and was present at his coronation, sitting conspicuously with the patrons of the nobility. When she saw him crowned and enthroned, with the diadem that had been intended for her glittering on the seat beside him, he turned his love-lighted eyes upon her; then, for the first time since her maidenhood, she remembered the prophecy of old Hannah, the seeress, as she sat doubled up on the low wall of the vineyard at Mountain Villa.
               Soon after, Bernice went to Reate, where she made her usual summer residence, in Tempe's beautiful vale of lakes and streams; and though her rejected crown lay empty beside her husband whenever he sat in state, she was none the less happy and beloved.
               The reign of Titus was, as his father's had been,  prosperous and peaceful, tolerating all religions; and, though Simon the Anchorite—Simon, son of Cleophus, had long been forgotten among men, the cause, to which he had given impetus, by his influences at Valley Villa, went ramifying over the earth: for, though Vespasian and Titus, in their rule of an idolatrous people, could give no direct aid to Christianity, having no positive faith of their own; yet, influenced by memories of those to whom Simon had taught the story of the Cross, permitted it to sustain itself, which, freed from the pruning of persecution, stood, by its own power, and grew, putting forth shoots, and rooting firmly; so that it defied all after-persecution. Enthusiasts say that Simon, the lonely, desponding "hermit of the Rock," now sitting above the clouds, still sings his  "harvest home," as he watches the "gathering in" from fields that stretch from the rising to the setting, and from the setting to the rising sun—from the ice-plains of Zembla, to where the Southern Cross hangs nightly above the wave; but that a chord of his lyre is mute, that the Sepulchre and the Cross are still in the hands of the Infidel.
            
            
               CHAPTER LXV.
               THE END OF AN AIM.
               PARIS, the pantomime, was seen gliding like a scared ghost from city to city, ever following the track of Domitian, who did not suspect the espial, or its motive.
               Paris had again insinuated himself more zealously than ever into the service of his former employer, which service was, generally, to conceal or assist in secret debaucheries, secret only, that he wished to sustain the character he had assumed, for steady statesmanship.
               While his father lived, he felt his suspicious eye ever bearing upon him, and piercing through his best-acted  performances.
               He was kept from any near contact with Vespasian's  person; and, though he received honors and emoluments, he was never permitted any position of trust or power.
               Tired of waiting for the hale old age of his father to subside into infirmity, he determined to remove him, and thus free himself from that disagreeable surveillance, as  well as the constant marplot influences which he saw his  father brought to bear on all of his schemes, ere they were suffered to grow, especially in regard to diminishing the people's idolatry for Titus; for however closely he kept his  own participation in any effort of the kind, his father  seemed to divine the spring of it, and was ready with a marplot.
               During the continued illness of Vespasian, induced by  the tamperings of Domitian through the woman Clotho,  whose lover was the usual body-servant of his father, his plans for injuring his brother acquired quite as free an acceleration as he could desire.
               He, however, did not wish Titus to yield Bernice; and when by surveillance he found that his father would urge it, and intended taking her to Campagna, in order to operate upon her sense of duty to her husband and his country, Domitian feared the influence of such a step,  preferring to retain Bernice as an apple of discord between Titus and the people: hence his resolve to hasten Vespasian's  death, before he could have time to influence either Titus or Bernice.
               Domitian had no hope of supplanting Titus in the  succession, immediately on his father's death; but, that father removed, he could the better operate in secret plots for Titus's future overthrow, when he, himself, should have gained a better show of the people's confidence, and the love he had intended to win by humoring their passions  and prejudices with a zeal, that, he imagined, would be successful.
               Paris, certain that none other than Domitian had  abducted Longina, hoped, by watching and insinuating himself  into his confidence, to find out whither she had been borne. For many months he was unsuccessful, until one day, surprising Domitian in tears, affected by a momentary softness, induced by a full-length portrait of Longina, as she appeared in her youth, sitting under the acacias by the lake, and which hung in a secret chamber of the man's apartments, Paris gained a betrayal of all Domitian knew of Longina's disappearance.
               He had really conveyed her fainting form from her apartments, on the night of her disappearance, by a secret door in one of the pillars that supported the double verandas and which led to a staircase in the heart of the pillar, that descended to the opening of an underground channel to the Egyptian sphinx, which was hollow, and  had a door of exit so nicely fitted that its character could not be suspected. So much, only, knew Domitian of the secret passage.
               He left the woman-servant at the foot of the staircase,   supporting Longina's apparently lifeless form, and went to  get a lamp he had left in the sphinx: when he returned, both women were gone. While he stood waving his lamp  to see if he could discover any outlet, he heard a grating behind him, and the woman appeared by a sliding door  in the side of the pillar leading to the terrace. She  appeared overcome with despair and apprehension, and  seemed as utterly surprised, as Domitian, that Longina was gone.
               Domitian's fiery temper accused the woman, and she fled  outward toward the vaults of the Tower, with her pursuer  fast behind her. Within a dark archway Domitian caught her, and, before he could master his passion, had choked her until she was dead, or senseless.
               Being not far from the sphinx, he took up the body, thinking to conceal it there; but being closely pursued, as  he thought, by some one, he was forced to cast it into the  basin, and escape.
               Domitian expressed the belief that Longina had been   destroyed by the woman, who was afraid that she would at some time escape from Domitian's keeping, and expose  her complicity in some criminal matter, of which Longina had become aware on that night.
               The narrative of Domitian assured Paris that he had        been under an error. He had not scrupled to examine the packet sent down by Domitian to the woman Clotho; but the letter was couched in terms that he did not  understand, except that something must be done when Clotho's lover should arrive, and that the signal of Domitian's own  proximity would be a blue pennon floated above the trees that lined the bay. The tiny packet contained in the  letter was so curiously enwrapped and sealed that it could not be opened and sealed again, and Paris therefore  delivered it as it was.
               The fears of Paris were all for Longina; but as he knew  when the lover of Clotho was expected down, he thought he would have sufficient time to co-operate with her in defeat of any plan that Domitian had in agitation; for he never  once suspected that Vespasian's life was the object aimed at.
               Six months later, when ocean and shore were in agitation  from the eruption of Vesuvius, and the villas had been deserted and left open to exposure and pillage,—if any were so hardy as to remain for such purposes in the  threatened districts,—it was then that a clue to Longina's disappearance was obtained.
               Numerous vaults and secret passages were found thrown open, that no one had ever suspected existed, with evident marks of treasure having been therein stored, and subsequently  removed, perhaps during the threatening convulsions  of Vesuvius. A skeleton was found, recognized as the missing physician of Vespasian, by the golden lid of his  medicine-box, on which his name was inscribed. It was beneath a trap-door of a narrow passage near the room  into which the physician had retired, and had, perhaps,  never been discovered by the robbers.
               In the floor of the hollow pillar mentioned by Domitian was discovered a trap-door leading down to the secret vaults.
               Paris and Domitian, at once, concluded that Longina had thereby escaped, or been conveyed by some one; the discovery was not made until after the destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum, and the country around    was beginning to quiet down, and the villages and villas  receive their occupants again, the vaults beneath the Tower of Marius were minutely examined, and ascertained be a haunt of Sicarii.
               Paris and Domitian, in unison, followed up the hints given, and, by various means, insinuated themselves among the bands that infested Italy, and were soon affiliated with  them; but without success, until Paris was sent on an errand, connected with their robberies, into Syria; there he discovered Longina in one of the immense caverns in the heart of the hills of Judea.
               Trusted by the Sicarii as one of them, it was not difficult for him to rescue and escape with her.
               She returned to the husband who had mourned her as dead; and the account she gave of herself was that, in her insensibility, she had been discovered by one of the band, who had chanced to uplift the trap, immediately  after the woman had gone on an errand of her own.
               She had been treated well, but, when recovered sufficiently, was conveyed to Syria, as the best means of removing her from all chance of escape. The robbers had no motive for doing so, except that they feared she would, alike,  expose their haunts beneath the Tower, and the keeper of her wine-cellars, who was one of them, and who, having an intimacy with the woman Clotho, had acquainted her with as many of the underground channels as her own purposes required;—she was as ignorant of the trap as Longina herself.
               A time came when Domitian's inviting destiny lured him into the error of winning Longina from her virtuous life as the wife of Lamia.
               In furtherance of her own plans, she resolved to appear passionately fond of Domitian, as she had been, when her sinless heart was happy by the lake-shore. Lamia procured a divorce, and she married Domitian; for her increasing fascinations had procured her the award of  being considered the most beautiful woman in the Roman empire, and he married her from motives of vanity as well as love.
               It is not the design of this work to enchronicle  intervening events; but a day heaved up upon the ever-heaving billows of time, when Domitian lay dying, a painful,  torturing, remorseful death; hurled from the supreme zenith of all his ambitions, by the hand that refused even the slightest caress to his longings for sympathy.
               Longina stood over him in regal robes, her countenance aglow, and her eyes flashing with the joy of gratified  revenge.
               With her white finger indexing the date and record of her father's execution, that she had caused to be  emblazoned on the walls of the apartment to which he was  confined, she bade him bring Corbulo from the reeking pits of Corinth—to restore the life he had robbed him of, and the name upon which his villanies had stamped  traitor—to blot out the ignominies of Brundusium—to do these impossibilities, and she would soothe his agonies, with the love that had been his, ere she knew, to recognize, the face of her father's murderer;—that she would stay the hand of Paris from unbarring their palace-gates to the enraged populace, thirsty to tear asunder the homicide—yea,  parricide;—that she would, then, let him peacefully die, of the almost ineffectual wounds he had given himself, in emulation of his prototype, Nero.
            
            THE END.
