            INTRODUCTION.
            THE publishers of this edition of "The Upper Ten Thousand," violate no privacy or
               courtesy in placing upon the title-page the name of Mr. CHARLES ASTOR BRISTED, as
               these brilliant sketches of American Society were not only generally attributed to
               him from the commencement of their publication in Fraser's Magazine, but were
               publicly acknowledged to be his in a letter to N. P. Willis, on the appearance of the
               sixth of the series. The London impression from which we print has the following
               preface:
            
               Reader, the mere mention of Americans is probably associated in your mind with
                  much that is wild, savage, and frightful,—sanguinary duels, Lynch law, nigger
                  babies boiled for breakfast, swamps and yellow fever; in short, a pleasing and
                  promiscuous mess of "a' things horrible and
                  awful." Or if, through some Whiggish leaning, or large feeling of fraternity for
                  all the Anglo-Saxon race, you are disposed to stand up for your Transatlantic
                  brethren, you will panegyrize them much in the same way that Rousseau and others
                  have maintained the superiority of savage over civilized life. You will say,
                  "These people are inferior to us in the graces and courtesies of civilization, but
                  they are more frank, more natural; fashion exercises no capricious tyranny over
                  them; there is no room there for servility or luxury." Doubtless, then, you will
                  be surprised when, in presenting you to American society, I introduce you among a
                  set of exquisites,—daintily-arrayed men, who spend half their income on their
                  persons, and shrink from the touch of a woollen glove,—who are curious in wines
                  and liquors, and would order a dinner against the oldest frequenter of the Trois
                  Frères; delicate and lovely women, who wear the finest furs and roll in the most
                  stylish equipages,—who are well up in all the latest French dances and the newest
                  French millinery,—who talk very much such English as you do yourself, and three or
                  four Continental languages into the bargain. And, moreover, in comparing English
                  and American merits (for, knowing something about both Mr. Bull and Master
                  Jonathan, belonging partly to both and loving both, I would rather compare their
                  merits than their faults), I should say that the American was more successful
                     in the minor elegancies and amusements,
                  and the Englishman in the more solid and domestic virtues of life. Now if you grow
                  incredulous, and conclude that I am trying to quiz you, or going to write about
                  America without ever having been there, even that is no more than
                  Englishmen have done before, ay, and turned out a big volume, and made "tin" by
                  it, and been praised by "the Thunderer" for accuracy and fidelity of description.
                  But, in sober earnest, I am writing about what I see and know. If, then, I tell
                  you nothing about alligators, or regulators, or any such wild animals, it is
                  simply because I have never met with any; nor that I think it much loss to either
                  of us, for, sooth to say, we have lately had enough of this bowie-knife school of
                  writing, which after all is much as if one were to go to the wilds of Connaught,
                  or the dens of St. Giles's, to collect materials for "A Country Residence in
                  England" or "London and the Londoners." Suspend your opinion, then, or at least
                  your incredulity; open your eyes and shut your mouth, and see what the Yankee will
                  send you.
            
            This is characteristic of the author, and was a sufficient introduction to the
               English reader; but it seems to us not improper, in an edition to be offered to the
               society whose peculiarities it illustrates, to add the letter to which we have
                  referred, induced by an intimation in the
               "Home Journal," that under the name of "Carl Benson," the writer designed a
               portraiture of himself.
            
               
                  To N. P. WILLIS, ESQ.
               
               My Dear Sir:—Several intimations to the above effect have already reached me, but
                  now for the firs time from a source deserving notice. Allow me to deny in toto, any intention of describing myself under the
                  name of Henry Benson. Were I disposed to attempt self-glorification, it would be
                  under a very different sort of character. Here I should, in strictness, stop: but
                  as you have done me the honor to speak favorably of certain papers in
                     Fraser, perhaps you will permit me to intrude on your time (and
                  your readers', if you think it worth while), so far as to explain
                     what (not whom) Mr. Benson is meant for.
               The said papers (ten in all, of which four still remain in the editor's hands),
                  were originally headed, 'The Upper Ten Thousand,' as representing life and manners
                  in a particular set, which title the editor saw fit to alter into 'Sketches of
                  American Society'—not with my approbation, as it was claiming for them more than
                  they contained, or professed to contain. Harry Benson, the thread employed to hang
                  them together, is a sort of fashionable hero—a quadratus
                     homo, according to the 'Upper
                  Ten' conception of one: a young man who, starting with a handsome person and fair
                  natural abilities, adds to these the advantages of inherited wealth, a liberal
                  education, and foreign travel. He possesses much general information, and
                  practical dexterity in applying it, great world-knowledge and aplomb, financial shrewdness, readiness in
                  composition—speaks half a dozen languages, dabbles in literature, in business,
                     in every thing but politics—talks metaphysics one minute, and
                  dances the polka the next—in short, knows a little of every thing, with a knack of
                  reproducing it effectively; moreover, is a man of moral purity, deference to women
                  and hospitality to strangers, which I take to be the three characteristic virtues
                  of a New-York gentleman. On the other hand, he has the faults of his class
                  strongly marked—intense foppery in dress, general Sybaritism of living, a great
                  deal of Jack-Brag-ism and show-off, mythological and indiscreet habits of
                  conversation, a pernicious custom of sneering at every body and every thing,
                  inconsistent blending of early Puritan and acquired Continental habits, occasional
                  fits of recklessness breaking through the routine of a worldly-prudent life. The
                  character is so evidently a type—even if it were not designated as such in so many
                  words, more than once—that it is surprising it should ever have been attributed to
                  an individual—above all, to one who is never at home but in two places—outside of
                  a horse and inside of a library brary.
                  Most of the other characters are similarly types—that is to say, they represent
                  certain styles and varieties of men. The fast boy of Young America (from whose
                  diary Pensez-y gave you a leaf last summer), whose great idea of life is dancing,
                  eating supper after dancing, and gambling after eating supper; the older
                  exquisite, without fortune enough to hurry brilliantly on, who makes general
                  gallantry his amusement and occupation; the silent man, blazé before thirty, and not to be moved by any thing; (a variety of
                  American much overlooked by strangers, but existing in great perfection, both here
                  and at the south;) the beau of the 'second set,' dressy, vulgar and good-natured;
                  these and others I 
                     dave
                     have
                   endeavored to depict. Now, as every class is made up of individuals,
                  every character representing a class must resemble some of the individuals in it,
                  in some particulars; but if you undertook to attach to each single character one
                  and the same living representative, you would soon find each of them, like Mrs.
                  Malaprop's Cerberus, 'three gentlemen at once,' if not many more; and should one
                  of your 'country readers,' anxious to 'put the right names to them,' address—not
                     one, but, five or six—of his 'town
                  correspondents,' he would get answers about as harmonious as if he had consulted
                  the same number of German commentators on the meaning of a disputed passage in a
                  Greek tragedian. Some of the personages are purely fanciful—for instance, Mr.
                  Harrison—such a man as never did exist, but I imagine might very well exist, among
                  us. But, as the development of these characters is still in manuscript, it would
                  be premature to say more of them.
               Yet one word. The sketches were written entirely for the English market, so to
                  speak, without any expectation of their being generally read or republished here.
                  This will account for their containing many things which must seem very flat and
                  common-place to an American reader—such as descriptions of sulkies and
                  trotting-wagons, how people dress, and what they eat for dinner, etc.; which are
                  nevertheless not necessarily uninteresting to an Englishman who has not seen this
                  country. Excuse me for trespassing thus far on your patience, and believe me, dear
                  sir, yours very truly,

               CHAPTER I.
               THE THIRD AVENUE IN SLEIGHING TIME.
               A HEAVY snow on Broadway! The house-tops are all iced over like so many big
                  holiday cakes. The ugly telegraph posts, that suggest to the occupants of the
                  second floors the idea of an execution perpetually about to take place under their
                  windows, are not destitute of the same tempting white covering; and high up in the
                  gutters are piled heaps of the plentifully-dispensed commodity—so high, that in
                  places the foot-passengers can hardly see over them. But on the causeway
                     (Americanicè, 'side-walk') the feet of pedestrians, and in
                  the middle of the street the hoofs of horses and the runners of sleighs, have
                  packed down the smoothest and sweetest of all 'metal' for roads into a hard
                  pavement three or four inches thick, of a dirty dun hue. Out of doors it is cold,
                  but pleasantly cold,—brisk, exhilarating, sparkling,—as if an extra quantity of
                  electricity (and is it not really so?) were abroad in the atmosphere. This
                  sensation is particularly observable during a snow-storm, and renders it
                  absolutely agreeable to walk in one, until the insidious moisture begins to
                  penetrate your garments; but both before and after the actual fall it is plainly
                  perceptible, nor is it now unaided by the musical accompaniment of the
                  sleigh-bells. Every thing feels the influence fluence, and goes a-head accordingly. Men shuffle
                  and slip along in their India-rubber overshoes at a five-miles-the-hour pace. Boys
                  half sliding, half running, with skates suspended on arm, are hurrying to the
                  nearest ice-ponds, or other temporary skating-ground they know of: and sleighs are
                  swarming up and down the street, of all sorts and sizes, from the huge omnibus
                  with its thirty passengers, that lumbers along behind four or six horses, some
                  trotting and some cantering under great pressure of whip, to the light,
                  gaily-painted cutters, with their solitary fur-capped tenants, their embroidered
                  bearskin robes flaunting down behind, and their iron-mouthed-lightning-footed
                  pacers, that seem to draw them entirely by the bit, so slender and all but
                  invisible is the attaching harness. And every now and then passes a family party,
                  a little red or blue about the noses, but very jolly for all that; beautiful girls
                  buried in furs, and glancing from under their wrappings with demure looks of
                  mischief, as if the bells rang for them the tune 'I'm owre young to marry yet;'
                  lots of children, who have always an intense appreciation of the fur; a tall black
                  coachman, all alive to the dignity and responsibility of his position; the large
                  and roomy sleigh decked with buffalo*
                   and black bear and grey lynx robes, red-riband-bound and furnished with
                  sham eyes and ears, so that the carriage resembles a portable menagerie; while the
                  gallant horses, curbed with their heads well out from the pole, are stepping
                  twelve miles an hour, and ready to keep up that pace for half the day. The
                  Londoner, who in his complacency brags of the carriages and horses of his native
                  city as the finest in the world, should go to New-York to learn wisdom in
                  coach-horse-flesh. There he would see many a pair sold for six hundred dollars
                  that a duke would be glad to get for as many guineas. You can scarcely find a
                  carriage-horse that is not a beauty; and they exhibit all varieties of beauty,
                  from the blood chestnut colt, a-fire in every muscle, yet gentle and tractable
                  amid a crowd of vehicles, to the heavy grey, sixteen-and-a-half hands high, firm
                  as a statue, travelling on with a majestic action and a steady pace. A lover of
                  the noble animal on arriving here congratulates himself on having reached the
                  paradise of horses and horsemen, until he resides long enough to require a mount,
                  when the mystery is explained. He finds that all the best horses in the country
                  are trained to harness, and that a good saddle beast is for a gentleman the work
                  of months to find,—for a lady, a very phoenix.
               
                  
                  *It would be as pedantic in America to call this animal bison,
                     as to speak of 'the earth bringing the sun into view,' for 'the sun rising.'
                     'Buffalo' is often used independently for 'buffalo robe,' whence they tell a
                     good story of two Englishmen just arrived in Boston. They ordered a sleigh,
                     having heard of such a thing in a general way, without being conversant with
                     the particulars of it. 'Will you have one buffalo or two?' asked the
                     hostler. 'Why,' says Cockney, looking a little frightened, 'we'll have only
                     one the first time, as we're not used to driving them.'
               
               But there is one particular sleigh to which I must direct your attention—though,
                  indeed, you would be likely to notice it without my doing so, as it sweeps round
                  from one of the side streets, for its style and equipments are in some respects
                  unique. The body is a sea-green shell, not answering exactly to any known species,
                  extant or fossil, but carved out of wood, after a fantastic pattern, something
                  between a scallop and a nautilus, evincing considerable imagination on the part of
                  the designer or builder. And you can see the owner is proud of the idea; for,
                  while all the other sleighs that pass are so hung behind with bear or buffalo
                  robes that you can scarcely discern the colour, much less the shape of their bodies, this one, to show off its
                  peculiar form, and also perhaps to do justice to its crimson velvet lining, has no
                  back-robe at all, the black bear being placed in front, instead of the ordinary,
                  wild-cat or wolf lap-skin. The runners are a pale straw-colour; the harness, which
                  is rather more elaborate than usual for a one-horse sleigh, is adorned with silver
                  crests, and the double-plated bells (suspended by a band of red leather, which
                  encircles the body just behind the saddle of the collar) are acorns instead of the
                  customary walnut pattern. The horse is not exactly such an one as a London
                  exquisite might select for his cab; he has neither commanding stature nor
                  clambering step, finely-arched neck, nor gracefully sweeping tail; but he is 'all
                  horse, what there is of him,' and his points irreproachable for a roadster. He is
                  a dark bay, fifteen hands and a half high, with the compact figure, chunky neck,
                  powerful fore-arm, and projecting hip of a trotter, and he steps fair and square
                  in his gait, without a pause or a hitch anywhere, as a gentleman's trotter should.
                  The portion of the turn-out most open to criticism is the groom, an unmistakable
                  Pat. He has on a Parisian hat, probably a second-hand one of his master's; an old
                  pair of fashionably-cut trousers, most likely derived from the same source; a
                  white cravat; and a coachman's greatcoat of dark blue cloth, with huge plated
                  buttons and a crest on them. Such make-shift liveries may be seen all along
                  Broadway on fine days, marring the appearance of the otherwise perfect equipages
                  that congregate before Stewart's, the Howell and James of Gotham. When some
                  enterprising imitators of European customs first introduced liveries, there was a
                  great outcry against them on the part of the sovereign people. They were hooted
                  out of Boston, and remain banished to this day. In New-York York the hatband has
                  gained a partial and the button a general footing, but the plush has not been able
                  to keep its ground; so that the servants' costume presents a walking allegory of
                  society, part English form and deference, part French affectation and dandyism,
                  part native independence and outward equality.
               The sleigh stops before a house in the upper part of Broadway. Broadway was once
                  the fashionable place of residence, as it still is the fashionable promenade, and
                  most of the city magnates lived in it; but the progress of business northward
                  crowded them out, and their dwelling-houses became shops, till, throughout its
                  three miles of extent, from the Battery to Union Place, scarcely a private
                  residence remains, except in the most northerly half-mile, which still partly
                  sustains its claim to be in the fashionable quarter of the town. Even here the
                  dwellings are interspersed with shops; elegant mansions are beginning to be
                  elbowed by dentists and boarding-houses, and to assume an appearance of
                     having been in the aristocratic precincts. Such is the house in
                  question; but, though hard pressed by a business neighbourhood, it is still
                  evidently the residence of a man of wealth and position. What is more remarkable,
                  two or three garden lots are attached to it, and the garden and shrubbery form a
                  marked break in the line of regularly-built four-story houses above and below.
                  This is certainly a phenomenon in an American city, where a man will sip Cordon
                  Bleu and Latour every day, or buy two hundred dollar handkerchiefs for his wife,
                  or pay a fancy price for a fast trotter; but to lose the interest on a town lot by
                  making a garden of it, is an extravagance not to be thought of.
               Two young men come out of the house. The first stands five feet ten (in his boots,
                  which help him an inch), and is,
                  probably, not a bad-looking fellow to begin with. At any rate, whatever he may be
                  by nature, he has made the most of himself by art, being got up like a picture
                  with a fine eye to effect and contrast. He has a very white overcoat, with a white
                  velvet collar and large white silk buttons, and very black pantaloons
                     (Anglicè, trousers), chequered with a white bar, so
                  ambitious in its dimensions, that there is not more than a square and a half of
                  the figure on each leg, said legs not being very large. For a muffler he wears a
                  red India scarf, leaving a little aperture under the knot at the throat to let us
                  have a glimpse of the diamond pin that fastens his red and black satin long
                  cravat. His black hair is as glossy and neat as a woman's, and his moustache,
                  which not being so old as his hair by twenty years is considerably lighter, has
                  been brought up to a corresponding sable by some skilfully applied dye, so as to
                  set off to the best advantage the clear red and white of his complexion. Even
                  through those thick white buckskin gloves and heavy cork-soled boots you may see
                  that his extremities are delicately small; and even through the carefully buttoned
                  sack-coat you may notice that his figure is more slender in the waist and hollow
                  in the back than you would have expected from his height, judging him by an
                  English standard. His head is protected by a rich otter-skin cap, nearly as tall
                  as a hat. The front and earpieces are turned up, and it is set rather jauntily on
                  one side; but should the day prove too cold he can bury his features in it, till
                  only the tip of his nose is exposed. That is Harry Masters, a young man of the
                  exclusives, rejoicing in nothing to do and ten thousand a-year (dollars, not
                  pounds) to spend. He has not long returned from his travels, and next week is to
                  marry one of the most beautiful women in the city. She has just attained her
                  majority, and he is just twenty-three.
               His companion is about ten years older, though he might be any age, from
                  twenty-five to forty, so far as his face shows, being one of those dark, wiry men,
                  who retain the same appearance for fifteen or twenty years, and make up for
                  looking like old men in their youth by looking like young men in their middle age.
                  Not that Tibbets Schuyler the broker is an ugly man; on the contrary, he is rather
                  handsome—decidedly handsome, we might call him, according to the American type of
                  men. He stands six feet two in his boots, and weighs barely one hundred and fifty
                  pounds, great coat and all. His hair and whiskers are jet black, his features
                  regular and well-proportioned (except that his nose is a trifle long), and his
                  dark eyes keen and expressive. If you were told that he was a jolly good fellow
                  and a trump, there is nothing in his countenance to belie it; if you were told
                  that he would take in his own father for sixpence, there is nothing in his
                  countenance to belie that either: one thing only you would infer immediately and
                  correctly, that it is no easy matter to take him in. His features, we
                  have said, are good, but his face is of a uniform sallow tint, without freshness
                  or colour. In this dyspeptic countenance, in the lines about his mouth and the
                  absence of a moustache, you read the young man of business, who works hard and
                  lives high, smokes abundantly, and, though too frugal of time to indulge in
                  after-dinner or midnight revelries, has a pernicious habit of taking small drinks
                  in the morning. These men present a singular contrast and combination of strength
                  and weakness. They can work at their desks all day for days together; they walk
                  like locomotives when they do walk; are impervious to the intoxicating effects of
                  any known liquor; and though generally prudent enough to keep out of a row, acquit
                  themselves manfully if ever caught in
                  one. But they are continually bilious, dyspeptic, and altogether seedy; are
                  subject to rheumatism and other venerable disorders, require strong excitement to
                  amuse them, and know little of that every-day enjoyment of mere animal existence
                  which a man derives from good health and consequent cheerful spirits. Of course
                  Schuyler is not an exquisite. His drab great-coat is a real working, travelling
                  garment, with plenty of pockets, and no superfluous ornament in the way of
                  cording, velvet, or buttons. His pantaloons (as he would call them) are an old
                  black pair that have already done duty for dress as long as they were presentable,
                  for evening parties; his hat is not of the newest, and his neck is defended by a
                  blue worsted comforter. Yet are none of these things put on carelessly, but with
                  the air of a man who had been fashionably dressed when younger, and may be again
                  when richer. His tastes now, however, are certainly not fashionable, nor can they
                  be called literary. In the evening—if it is not the night before packet-day, or no
                  other business call interposes—he patronizes Burton's theatre or the Ethiopian
                  Singers; and at three in the afternoon, when his office and the banks are shut,
                  and his day's work generally through, he reads the papers (the usual extent of his
                  reading), if the weather is unfavourable; if it is fine he drives a trotter, or
                  rather assists at the driving of one. For he does not keep a 'fast crab' now
                  himself; he is too intent on making a fortune, in the pursuit of which he has
                  missed fire once already. No, he goes out driving with one and another of his
                  friends, and in this way partially gets the interest of his earlier investments in
                  horseflesh.
               And now the two friends are in the quaint little machine, filling the shell body
                  full to overflowing, so that the bronzed railing which runs around the top of the
                  back seems very necessary to keep one or both of them from being canted out;
                  Schuyler coils his long legs under him, the bear-skin is tucked in on both sides,
                  'Ke-ip, Charlie!' and the sleigh glides off at a five minute pace.
               It is a nice position altogether, that of Masters. Take a young man, handsome and
                  clever enough to make him courted by others, and on very good terms with himself,
                  in exuberant health (for Harry has not been home long enough to lose his fresh
                  tint and grow dyspeptic), comfortably off in point of 'tin' for the present, and
                  rich in anticipation and imagination for the future, in all the flush and
                  exultation of a rapid, fervent, and successful courtship, and all his other
                  delights swallowed up in the delight of reflecting that a witty and beautiful
                  woman is soon to be his—put him into a well-appointed sleigh, and let an
                  indefatigable trotter take him along eleven or twelve miles an hour, with the
                  potentiality of nearly doubling that speed, and as he glides away musing on all
                  his good luck, it would be a hard case if he were not happy and thankful.
               Yet why is not his ladye-love with him? Poor girl, it is so near the time that
                  half her mornings are spent in consultation with dress-makers, and the accepted
                  one is postponed to the milliner. But he has the memory of her last ineffable
                  smile in his heart, and feels content. Schuyler looks amiable too. His are not the
                  rosy visions and golden dreams of Masters, the pleasant realities rivalled by more
                  pleasant anticipations; but he is thinking of the good hit he made in government
                  sixes last week, and how comfortable the sleigh is.
               'Why, you might go to sleep in this, Harry,' says the broker, who has just settled
                  down into the position that affords perfect support to his back, and is lying
                  coiled up like a sea-serpent in repose.
               
               Not the beginning of an answer from the other, who is dreaming of that
                     smile, no doubt. The horse, meanwhile, seems to be taking care of
                  himself. Having no winkers, he sees his own way and keeps a look-out, not only
                  before but behind him. Were a hand lifted or a handkerchief exhibited by his
                  driver, he would take it for a signal to be off, and would be off like a hurricane
                  accordingly. And therefore is the cherry-handled whip kept completely out of his
                  sight, lying in the hollow between Master's side and the side of the sleigh, with
                  the top sticking out behind under Harry's right arm and appearing to grow out of
                  his pocket. Few trotters will bear even the sight of the whip—at least not till
                  half tired. A man usually wants all his hands to hold them to their trot.
               'That's really a nice animal,' says Schuyler, at last. He has hit the right topic
                  to arouse his friend, who immediately begins to show signs of returning
                  consciousness.
               'Yes, Charlie is a good horse. But I am not quite sure that he is now
                  at the work he is best fit for. I rode him the other day and found he had the
                  remains of a real canter, and all his paces were so good under the saddle that I
                  think of devoting him to that purpose after this snow is over He is not fast
                  enough for harness.'
               'How fast?'
               'Three seventeen with two in a wagon.'
               'But he is young.'
               'Seven.'
               'A horse does not fairly begin to trot till nine or ten. I wouldn't give up my
                  original purpose. But we are out too early to test his speed against anything. It
                  is only just past two.' (He has taken a half-holiday to-day on the strength of its
                  being his birth-day.)
               'Exactly the reason I came out so early. I don't want to race him, at least on the
                  out-road. He has been in the stable for two days, and is too free to trot. We will
                  go to Yorkville at an exercise gait, and then turn.'
               While thus talking they have left Broadway, and, turning to the right, have passed
                  through Lafayette Place, a short, wide street, with a marble colonnade on one side
                  and large brick and granite mansions on the other. Another turn to the right
                  brings them in to the Bowery, the great democratic, as Broadway is the great
                  aristocratic, thoroughfare. It is a wider and straighter street, but the houses
                  have a very different appearance. Markets, butchers' stalls, and secondhand
                  furniture shops, abound in it. Leaving this not very interesting ground they shoot
                  transversely into the Third Avenue, which, however, for the first five minutes,
                  presents nearly the same features, till at the distance of a mile from their
                  starting-point it begins to assume its proper characteristics.
               The Third Avenue has been ever since it was made, that is to say for twenty years,
                  the exercise and trial ground of all the fast trotters and pacers in the city. It
                  runs about a mile in town to the end of the 'stones' or pavement, and nearly five
                  miles out of town to Harlaem Bridge. In these five miles of road there are just as
                  many hills, not steep, but gradual, and pretty equally distributed, so that every
                  third or quarter of a mile presents a different level; and in every mile you have
                  the alternation of ascent, descent, and level ground. At the top and bottom of
                  each hill are several taverns, at which the horses may rest and their masters
                  'take a horn;' but more of these establishments are at the foot than at the
                  summit, as it is the custom of the 'fast
                  crabs' to make a brush down the hill after ascending it leisurely.
                  Besides the taverns, the only houses along the road are blacksmiths' and
                  coachmakers', so that if you break a tire or lose a shoe you may be set to rights
                  on the spot. The Avenue is wide, and in good order. The middle of it is
                  macadamised, the sides are left in soft earth for the benefit of the trotters
                  whose feet would be broken to pieces by hard pavement at their rate of going.
                  These distinctions are now, of course, obliterated by the snow.
               From three till dark the fast horses and fast men are in their glory here. It is
                  too early for them yet, as Schuyler said; there are only family or omnibus sleighs
                  out, so Charlie keeps on at one steady pace, without pulling very much, as there
                  is nothing alongside to worry him. In fifteen minutes they are at Yorkville, a
                  small and not over-clean suburb, inhabited chiefly by Irish, and here there are
                  more taverns than ever. Masters does not stop at any; his horse needs no rest, and
                  it is not altogether comme il faut to do so: but
                  he has a word to say about some of them in passing.
               'Wintergreen's is clearly the pet stopping-place now,' he observes, glancing
                  towards a white house on the highest ground in Yorkville. The long, low, white
                  shed near it is tenanted, even at this early hour, by twenty or more cutters,
                  whose owners are tippling inside.
               'A queer fellow Wintergreen is, too! When sober (those are the mornings when he
                  comes to sell you a horse) he behaves like a gentleman, and if he were put into a
                  decent suit might almost pass for one. When drunk, which he is invariably at
                  night, and frequently at noon, he is the beastliest of buffoons, and the fancy men
                  use him for their court-jester. His father was rich once; he had money himself and
                  good prospects when a youth, and might have done well.'
               'Yes,' says Schuyler, with an ironical smile, 'he might have gone through college,
                  travelled in Europe' learned the polka, and been one of us.'
               There are two miles more to Harlaem Bridge, but Masters suddenly determines to go
                  back. Perhaps his fingers are a little cold. 'Let us turn here,' and round sweeps
                  the sleigh. Charlie begins to bear on the bit Masters is far from dreaming now.
                  All his energies are concentrated on his horse, who is a handful on the
                  home-road.
               'Now we shall see them to the best advantage as they meet us.'
               'I must confess I should like one race, just to beat something before going in.
                  I'm sure your horse is faster than you think him.'
               'Well, if anything comes along to give us a fair chance we will have
                  a race. See, here comes a batch from the city already, all doing their best to be
                  first at Wintergreen's.'
               Here they come, sure enough! First advances an old black pacer, that looks only
                  fit for the crows: he is so fine-drawn as to appear all skin and bones, and steams
                  like a limekiln; but he has come down the last hill at a 2' 40'' stroke, and is
                  going as well now if he can only keep it up a few seconds longer. What a pace it
                  is! not like trotting in the least, nor yet like running—more a scramble than
                  anything else. His feet rise two on the same side at once; sometimes all four are
                  off the ground together, and he rocks till you fear he will roll over laterally.
                  He tears along behind him a sleigh of the commonest construction, a mere deal box
                  on runners, furnished with an ancient and fragmentary buffalo, which serves for robe and cushion both. The driver is
                  'one of 'em,' a young butcher probably, in glazed leather cap and pea-jacket,
                  despising gloves, yelling frantically to his animal, and putting on the string
                  unsparingly, while he holds him up as if for life with his left hand. Close in the
                  rear comes a beautiful clipped chestnut, a fair square trotter, driven in a
                  handsome cutter by a fashionably-dressed youth, The young gentleman cannot be much
                  above twenty, but he holds the ribands as carefully as an experienced jockey, and
                  like a gentleman too—no recourse to the whip, no screaming at his horse, but a
                  perfect management of his mouth, so as to get his full speed out of him without
                  risk of a break. His nag has less foot for a brush than the pacer, therefore he is
                  behind; but more strength and endurance, therefore he sticks to him, and hopes to
                  catch him. About two lengths behind come an old gentleman and his negro servant,
                  with a fine team of bays. They are large and handsome enough for carriage-horses,
                  matched exactly, and go 'to the pole,' i. e. together in 3' 25''—in
                  fact they are going at that rate now. Down the hills they fall behind the single
                  horses, but up-hill, where the weight tells, a team has the best of it, and
                  accordingly you see them gaining now. The old fellow, who is as ardent for the
                  sport as a boy, knows this well, and keeps them up to their work. The team gains
                  on the chestnut, the chestnut on the black: they are not more than three lengths
                  from the tavern. Suddenly the pacer stops short and capers. He is uses up, and has
                  broken.' The chestnut glides by like an arrow, and being none too fresh himself,
                  escapes further pursuit of the team by slipping triumphantly under Wintergreen's
                  shed, whither the discomfited black follows him; while the big bays keep their way
                  up the road, and after them trail two men with a grey horse, who, though visibly
                  tailed off, still persist in a fruitless attempt to overtake the gallant pair.
               'There goes twelve hundred cash,' says Schuyler, as he glances back at the
                  receding trotters. 'But it's a good team, and well worth the money if a man has
                  it.'
               'I mean to treat myself to a team whenever I can pick one up at a fair
                  valuation—when some one breaks or goes abroad, and wants to sell his horses. But I
                  don't mean to trust myself in a jockey's hands again. I have had to do with the
                  fraternity three times already, and come off tolerably well. Fortune is not to be
                  tempted too often.'
               'You have no reason to quarrel with your last purchase. He goes prettily, and
                  keeps it up well. Does he pull much?'
               'Not as trotters go; but he requires a tight rein Hallo! Wo-o, Charlie!'
               The horse has made a leap that jerks both the occupants of the sleigh nearly out
                  of it, and would be off in a run but for the ready hand of his driver. At the same
                  moment a large brown mare rushes by with the least possible quantity of harness on
                  her, a shadowy sleigh behind her, and a little black-eyed, fur-capped man in it.
                  Though Charlie is stepping off at least fourteen miles an hour, he is left behind
                  in an instant as if standing still.
               'There's a fast one! Can you catch him?'
               'I should be sorry to try it with the double weight we have, and the start he has.
                  Even if I were ten seconds in the mile faster than he is, I could not overhaul him
                  before he gets to Sparks'.
               'True; he will stop at the Four-mile House, no doubt. His pace is too good to
                  last. I didn't think of that.'
               About a minute and a-half passes in silence. Schuyler not wishing to be caught again without notice, has
                  roused himself from his recumbent attitude, and keeps a good look-out behind.
                  Masters is wholly occupied with his horse, who grows more eager as he approaches
                  home. They are near the Four-mile-House, when two common-looking men in a
                  common-looking sleigh, with a long-legged roan pacer, emerge from the shed some
                  hundred yards in front, and dart off at full speed.
               'Now for it,' says Masters: 'we'll try those fellows.'
               'Do you think you can have them? Their horse is going very fast.'
               'You never can tell how fast a pacer goes till you are alongside of him. There is
                  no stopping-place between this and town: they must go to the stones, or where the
                  stones should be, and that's a mile and a half, and Charlie will outlast them that
                  distance if they outfoot him at first. G'lang, old fellow.'
               While thus delivering himself of his opinion, Masters has been making hasty
                  preparation for the trial. Taking an equal hold of the reins at that point where
                  he can best apply his whole weight and power to them, he twists one round each
                  hand to prevent their slipping; then bracing his feet against a little iron bar
                  that runs inside the swelling dashboard (for they would go right through the
                  leather), he throws himself back on the lines simultaneously with the 'g'lang'
                  that starts his horse. The ever-ready beast leaps off as if his run were arrested
                  midway and turned into a trot; at every step his hind legs are lifted quicker and
                  tucked further under him, and his fore feet rise higher from the ground as he
                  darts down the slight descent before him at a three-minute velocity. The reins are
                  so tight that you might stand upon them; Masters is nearly standing behind them,
                  for as he neither will nor can give an inch (his arms being already stretched ed
                  straight out and the reins secured by the twists in them), the pull all but lifts
                  him to his feet. So rapid is the brush that they are soon close upon the other
                  sleigh, and Schuyler can distinguish that its occupants are of not-to-be-mistaken
                  Bowery cut—veritable 'b'hoys.' Charlie is just lapping their sleigh when the
                  driver breaks out with an unearthly yell, which has the double effect of
                  stimulating his own horse and frightening the other. The next moment Charlie is
                  dancing in the air, and the old roan racker glides away as if by very magic,
                  skimming over the snow like a bird, and looking ready to shake himself out of his
                  ancient and scanty harness.
               'Wo-o, Charlie! What y' about? Ho-o, poor fellow!' and Masters hauls his horse
                  first to one side of the road and then to the other, in vain efforts to make him
                  catch his trot. Charlie throws his head up and jerks it down, and keeps cantering
                  for ten seconds in spite of all that can be done, till at last, just as they reach
                  level ground, he strikes his true gait with a bound like a hunter's, and is off
                  faster than ever. If the road continued to descend there would be little chance of
                  closing the gap; but it now rises for a quarter of a mile, and a trotter generally
                  climbs better than a pacer. This is what Masters depends on, and accordingly he
                  drives as if for a fortune to come up with the racker before the road dips again.
                  Now he eases out his horse the least bit by bending slightly forward; now he lifts
                  him with the rein, and again holds on with all his might to keep him from
                  breaking; now he stimulates him with a gentle chirrup, and now sends at him a
                  prolonged growl, such as trotters and the drivers of trotters delight in.
                  Meanwhile he carefully scans the road a-head, so as to avoid every inequality and
                  keep on a smooth and even surface, nearly, but not quite, in the middle of the
                  road, where the snow is neither so much
                  worn down as to make it hard running for the sleigh, not so deep as to clog the
                  horse's feet. Schuyler sits motionless and breathless, watching the rapidly
                  diminishing interval between the sleighs. Masters' calculation proves true. Before
                  the ascent is completed, the gap of eight or ten lengths has been shut to within
                  one and a half. Charlie's head is in a parallel line with the pendant buffalo of
                  the Bowery sleigh, and not more than three feet behind it. The broker's excitement
                  overpowers him. His long body and sharp nose reach over like those of a cockswain
                  when he bobs to the stroke, and his eyes flash with eagerness.
               'Now hold him, Masters, hold him! Don't let him break; don't, for God's sake!
                  Shall I drive?'
               'Teach your grandmother!'
               Masters is comparatively cool; he feels sure of catching them before the descent,
                  and then he means to wait on them down till he can tire out or break up the
                  racker. And now the b'hoy, finding himself overhauled, emits another hideous
                  screech, and lays the string about fearfully. But either he has been premature in
                  his manœuvre, or Harry is better prepared for it this time: the only effect of all
                  the row is to help Charlie on. Three of his bounding steps,—with the first he laps
                  the other sleigh, with the second he is alongside the roan, and the third puts his
                  belly on a line with the pacer's nose. He is a neck and shoulders a-head and going
                  his very best.
               'Hi-i-i! G'lang! He-e-e eh!' shout both the Bowery boys at once, and slash goes
                  the long whip again. All they can accomplish by this demonstration is to fetch
                  their horse up even with Charlie, who has lost a little ground by swerving to the
                  right to avoid an omnibus that takes up half the road. This movement brings the
                  sleighs so close that they almost touch, and thus they go down the hill at the
                  rate of eighteen miles an hour, locked like a double team. The b'hoy is pouring
                  out a stream of yells at his horse, and Masters is holding on to his as a man
                  holds on for his life. The pacer, black with sweat and dropping foam from his
                  mouth, scrambles along with his head down like a lame cat, Charlie's glossy flanks
                  are marked with a dark streak here and there, and a few beads of white hang about
                  his mouth; he trots fair and square still, with his head well up and his legs
                  striking out regularly as a steam-engine. The contest will be decided by this
                  hill, for neither horse is fresh enough to make up a gap in the preceding half
                  mile of level ground which brings them to the city. It is safe betting on the
                  trotter if his temper and his owner's arms only hold out, for he goes better at
                  every step, while his opponent flags visibly. See, Harry is a head and shoulders
                  in advance again—all that he wishes to be at present, so he keeps his horse well
                  in hand with a hard, steady pull. They are half way down and the momentum of the
                  descent is at its maximum when the b'hoy makes his last effort. Whip, voice, and
                  rein are combined in one final push and, aided by the ground, he absolutely shoves
                  his horse once more even with Charlie. At this critical instant Masters feels the
                  pull slacken a little—very little, but enough, combined with his keen eye for
                  pace, to tell him that his horse is coming back to him.
               'He-e-eh! Why, Charlie, are you going to leave your master, old fellow? He-e-eh!
                  steady, boy! g'lang!' The lines are drawn tight as a bowstring; Charlie's neck
                  goes out and his head down as he reaches away in his bounding trot, and gains half
                  a length on the enemy at two steps.
               'Steady, boy! so-o! G'lang now!'
               'He-e-e-eh! Gr-r-r! G'lang, you beggar!'
               
               'Take care, Masters, take care! Now you have 'em! Hurrah!'
               Splut! There is a great scattering of snow. The racker has broken short up, and
                  fairly disappeared in a cloud of his own raising.
               For a hundred yards or more the trotter sweeps on triumphantly at the top of his
                  speed. Then his owner draws him in very carefully, it being nearly as nice a
                  matter to diminish as to increase the velocity of a fast horse, since the least
                  jerk or sudden check will break him. More by the voice than the reins he is
                  sobered down to his wonted pace of twelve miles an hour, at which the sleigh
                  continues to slide on merrily, and our friends have a little leisure to look about
                  them. They are passing the Three-mile House, once a tavern on the road, but now
                  less than half a mile from the pavement. It is past three, and every one is going
                  out. The road is beginning to be thronged.
               'What a lot of them!' says Masters. 'There is Henderson with his clipped bays, not
                  so fast for a brush, but equal to anything for three miles. And there is Black
                  Modesty—good for 2' 38". They call her Modesty because she travels with her head
                  down. And there is Löwenberg, with four white horses.'
               And the fiery little foreigner dashes by with two dashing Creole-looking women in
                  his sleigh, and a neat groom, dangerously like himself, on the driving-seat
                  alongside him.
               'There goes the horse of horses, Jim Polk. His owner told me, that just before
                  this snow came on he paced half a mile in fifty-nine seconds.'
               'He ought to repeat that in public, then, for his best mile time on record is 2'
                  23". But I wouldn't have him for a gift, unless I wanted to meet with what the
                  newspapers call the 'painful accident' of getting my neck broke.'
               Masters cast one look at 'the fastest pacer in the world.' Polk is a middle-sized
                  chestnut, with a flowing tail and mane, handsome enough for a lady's horse, and
                  with power written in every muscle. He is pouring foam from a desire to get off,
                  and his owner's efforts to restrain him. And then Harry turns round and starts off
                  his horse once more, for his old enemy, the roan, is creeping up behind, and
                  trying to steal a march on him. But it's no use. Charlie has lost his superfluous
                  fire; he can be held with one hand, and will take the whip. Masters puts it on
                  him—three light strokes—and at every one he doubles himself up faster and throws
                  more road behind him. By a great effort the pacer has put himself close behind
                  Masters' sleigh, so that he is almost looking over Schuyler's head; but not
                  another inch can he better his position, not can he hold it more than a few
                  moments. There is no more left in him, and he falls back exhausted, and is pulled
                  up to a walk. And now as Harry for the second time eases down his horse, another
                  four-horse sleigh meets them. It cuts more dash than Löwenberg's—richer furs,
                  showier livery, finer horses, more paint and gilding. The team are greys and
                  chestnuts (sorrels they are called in America), driven chequered; that is, the horses of the same colour diagonally. Highly polished
                  steel chains take the place of martingale and polestrap; and the rest of the
                  harness, except the collars and traces, is made of white silk cord. Within are two
                  men and two women, elaborately dressed; but they are not of 'our set,' or any set
                  that Masters knows.
               'Schuyler, whose team is that? Some rowdy's, I perceive.'
               
               It shows you are a virtuous youth to ask such a question. You know all the proper
                  celebrities, and none of the improper ones. That is Mary Black, who keeps the
                  greatest flash-house in Leonard Street.'
               'That vile woman! I thought she was in prison.'
               'So she was, and got out again on some technicality.'
               [They did 'quod' the woman permanently some months after; but it was only
                  accomplished at great trouble and expense to the city, and Schuyler has already
                  seen so many rogues go unwhipt of justice, that he may be pardoned a little
                  scepticism.]
               'Doubtless there are several causes of this maladminstration, or
                  non-administration of the laws, but one is particularly obvious. I consider the
                  Anti-Capital-Punishment agitators—Whitey, Carroll, and that set—directly
                  responsible for half the rascality in this city and state. Their arguments, though
                  nominally directed at the death penalty merely, really aim at all penalties,
                  create a morbid sympathy for all criminals, and resolve all crimes into disease or
                  insanity, according to phrenology or some other of their hobbies, which they have
                  dignified with the name of sciences.'
               'Yes; and these scamps aim at all the property in the country, and want to resolve
                  it into their own pockets. And that is why I think the Jacobin a
                  worse paper than the Sewer, though the former preserves a decent
                  exterior of language. It has been the great abettor of the Anti-Renters
                  throughout.'
               'Does it preserve a decent exterior of language? Is not Whitey an
                  avowed Fourierite and Communist? and are not his contributors following suit?'
               'But you don't know Whitey's excuse?'
               'No.'
               'He is the most henpecked and curtain-lectured of men, and therefore goes in for
                  Fourier's plan, hoping that, in the general distribution of women and goods, some
                  one else may get Mrs. Whitey.'
               'A precious fellow, too, that correspondent of his, who has just been writing some
                  city sketches—'Bits of Gotham,' he calls them. They are all constructed on this
                  pleasant and easy syllogism,—'Some men in good society are hypocrites; therefore
                  all respectable people are scamps.' To read this vagabond, a stranger would
                  believe that our fashionable ladies were in the daily habit of making assignations
                  at confectioners, and that all our church deacons and trustees lived upon the
                  wages of iniquity, sanctioned, if not practised, by themselves. A pretty storm
                  there would be if any foreigner dared to talk so; but this pestilent fellow, it
                  seems, may slander his countrymen and countrywomen with impunity and profit! Did
                  you ever hear of this man Goldsmith—P. P. Goldsmith, Esquire, as he
                  calls himself?'
               'No; but I believe he was cut or snubbed by some gentleman with whom he was trying
                  to scrape acquaintance, and hence his hatred and abuse of the 'Upper Ten.''
               'As to Carrol, one understands him well enough. Est
                     proprium humani generis, and so forth. A benevolent Whig merchant
                  took him up when a poor boy, educated him, and gave him a fair start in life. Of
                  course he became a violent Democrat, intensely hostile to all Whigs,*
                   and all merchants. His descent tells there. It's a real specimen of Irish
                   gratitude.'
               
                  
                  *The American Whigs are Conservatives, except some of those in
                     New York.
               
               Masters remains half sulky, half pensive. They sweep down the Avenue into the
                  broad Bowery, and through Lafayette Place
                  again. Masters likes to drive past Lafayette Place, for he owns a house there, and
                  it gives him a chance to talk about 'my house,' and' my tenant.' They are in
                  Broadway again.
               'Won't you come and dine with us, Schuyler? Four sharp. The grand-governor is ill,
                  and I have the cellar key and the butcher's book. There is a bottle of Cordon Blue
                  in ice; our cook makes good oyster soup; smelts are prime now; and I laid in a
                  tall Philadelphia capon this morning. Come!'
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               A WEDDING 'ABOVE BLEECKER.'
               THE first thing, as a general rule, that a young Gothamite*
                   does is to get a horse; the second, to get a wife. Having, therefore, seen
                  Henry Masters on the road, it naturally follows in order that we should go to see
                  him married.
               
                  
                  *The appellation of Gotham was first given to New York by
                     Washington Irving in his earliest work, Salmagundi, evidently
                     alluding to the singular wisdom of the inhabitants; and the city is now
                     familiarly known throughout America by this name; just as Boston, for less
                     evident reasons, is generally called the American Athens.
                  
               
               A fashionable marriage is an event to honour which all nature and all art are
                  expected to put on their best face, and present themselves in their brightest
                  colours. You go to such a wedding prepared to see the nicest kind of people under
                  the most favourable circumstances. Accordingly, whereas in my last we found it
                  necessary to mention Bowery Boys and newspaper editors, and various other low
                  characters, not to speak of our friend Tibbets Schuyler, who is decidedly 'second
                  set,' I shall, on the present occasion, introduce you to none but the real
                  respectable, fashionable, exquisite part of New York society, the very cream of
                  the cream; and if you find them very slow, it isn't my fault. I have an idea that
                  fashionable people are stupid all over the world, even when they are fastest.
               
               It is mid-winter still, and there is snow on the ground; but the sleighing is not
                  so good as it was, and the state of the streets admits 'wheeling.' Wheeling
                  Masters is, not in the ancient olive chariot which he usually does his grandfather
                  the honour to borrow when going out, for to-night the old gentleman is going out
                  himself; but in the neat claret brougham of his first groomsman, Philip Van Horne,
                  under whose auspices and comfort he is about to go through an awful ceremony at
                  eight P. M.; that is to say, in about twenty-five minutes from the present
                  time.
               It is the ceremony of matrimony.
               Henry was an orphan. This condition is in most parts of the world supposed to
                  render a young man an object of pity and compassion; but in America it is deemed
                  peculiarly desirable, as it puts him into possession of his fortune immediately on
                  attaining his majority, and relieves him from even the semblance of authoritative
                  interference with his movements after that epoch. So far as he can be said to have
                  any home (for he has been very much in a state of transit and travel for the last
                  four years, ever since he graduated at Columbia College), he lives with his
                  maternal grandfather, Mr. Backus, in New York, during the winter, and at his
                  brother Carl's country-seat on the Hudson in summer. When a young man of
                  independent means is thus afloat on the world, his friends think it desirable to
                  get him married as soon as possible, for the same reason that a boy is often sent
                  to school—to keep him out of mischief. So when Henry came back from the Rhine one
                  spring and in the natural course of things was expected at Ravenswood (which, by
                  the way, had never had a raven within ten miles of it), Carl took care to have
                  proper relays of young ladies provided on visits of a week or a fortnight each,
                  ostensibly as company to Miss Masters, who had come out last winter: but it was
                  known perfectly by all the dear creatures who came that Carl Masters had a brother
                  to dispose of. Three damsels came successively, and walked and sailed, and rode
                  and drove, and went through all the proper business with Henry, the accompanying
                  papas or mammas and Mr. and Mrs. Carl always taking care to keep at a respectful
                  distance. And the three damsels departed successively, but not successfully, so
                  far as the impression on either side was concerned. But when the fourth came,
                  Harry finding her an undeniable beauty, and clever to boot, and knowing that she
                  was an heiress to some extent, and that there was no mother-in-law, (an immense
                  point), very speedily 'concluded to invest,' as Tibbets Schuyler would have
                  phrased it, in case the young lady accorded. And, somehow or other, Clara
                  Vanderlyn also came to the conclusion that Henry Masters was rich enough and
                  handsome enough for her, and that he was a very proper and virtuous young man, and
                  had a positive reputation for literary attainments. Not that she valued the last
                  for its own sake, since she seldom read anything more profound than a novel, but
                  she esteemed it as helping to give a man éclat;
                  and, on the whole, decided that he was a very eligible match. Perhaps her decision
                  was accelerated by the information conveyed in a letter from a friend at Oldport
                  Springs, that her contemporary and rival belle,
                  Miss De Lancey, had been cutting a great dash there, and was positively engaged to
                  a rich Bostonian. Soon the young people began to look very understandingly at each
                  other, and to make those mutual confidences of the eyes which express so much more
                  than can be said in words; and the Vanderlyns were easily persuaded to stay
                  another week; and it was hinted very
                  early in the fall*
                   that there was something between Mr. Masters and Miss Vanderlyn; and as
                  soon as they returned to the city, attentive friends kept asking them and their
                  relatives 'if they were not engaged;' and when at last one fine day in the Indian
                  summer (a delightful appendix to the warm weather which the northern states enjoy
                  in November), the two were seen walking arm-and-arm down Broadway, nobody was the
                  least surprised at it.
               
                  
                  *An American rarely says autumn or autumnal, but
                     uses the more poetic word, both as adjective and substantive.
               
               Harry is to be married, then, to-night, and he is going for that purpose—to
                  church? No, to the house of his father-in-law.
               Mr. Vanderlyn's house is distant from that of old Backus about half a mile
                  north-westerly, and situated on the corner of one of the long, broad avenues, that
                  intersect the upper part of the city longitudinally, and one of the widest of the
                  numerous cross streets which in this quarter are wide and narrow in the proportion
                  of about one to eight. The corner is a favorite situation. Why should it be
                  thought desirable to have the dust and noise of two streets instead of one? A
                  Frenchman or German disposed to theorize on local peculiarities would say it was
                  owing to the business habits of the New Yorkers; that a 'corner lot' being more
                  valuable for a shop or a warehouse, thus came by force of association to be
                  considered equally so for a private dwelling. But there is a more natural and very
                  appreciable reason for the preference. As the houses are built close against each
                  other, with the main rooms three-deep on a floor, the middle room of the three in
                  each story is dark, having no means of illumination from without, except when the
                  position of the house at a corner affords a side light. The street on which one
                  side of Mr. Vanderlyn's dwelling stands is a fashionably-built and inhabited
                  street, and the avenue on which it fronts is the fashionable avenue.
                  Three streets to the east there is one fully as broad and convenient, and two
                  streets to the west another; but that on the east is decidedly second-rate in
                  point of fashion, and that on the west literally nowhere, there not being a house
                  belonging to 'any of us' in it. The general course of fashion has been necessarily
                  northward (as the city, built on a narrow island, cannot expand laterally) with a
                  slight inclination westward. But many accidents help to make a particular quarter
                  fashionable. In the present instance, Vanderlyn and two or three of his friends
                  happening to own land here, built on it, and were influential enough to draw other
                  friends round them, and give a name and reputation to the avenue. Similar attempts
                  are continually made, and frequently without success. The upper part of the city
                  is dotted over with little spots, which have tried to be fashionable places and
                  couldn't be. This is particularly the case with the portion 'above Bleecker
                  Street,' which street is familiarly taken, though not with strict correctness, as
                  a boundary between the business and pleasure quarters of the town.
               The house is built of brick; not, however, the flaring vermilion, with each
                  individual brick picked out in white-lead, which disfigures a great part of New
                  York (though it is not quite all red brick like Philadelphia), but a dark brown,
                  nearly corresponding in colour to the thin veneering, as it were, of stone, which
                  covers the front on the avenue. This same stone front presents rather an imposing
                  appearance when you are right before it, but seen together with the brick gable on
                  the street it exhibits a contrast of
                  material which, notwithstanding the similarity of the colour, is far from 
                     agreeble
                     agreeable
                   to the eye. Old Vanderlyn is a man of taste; considerations either of
                  economy or of conformity to the popular want of taste must have led him to adopt
                  this common incongruity.
               Masters and Van Horne are ascending the steps. Let us go in with them, and you
                  will see an average house of the first class, not such a one as a millionaire
                  occasionally half ruins himself by building and furnishing to make a new lion for
                  the town; but a fair type of a New York gentleman's house, equal to the majority
                  of those at which you will visit or dance during a season. It has been hinted more
                  than once that land in fashionable localities is expensive, and the Gothamites,
                  when they build, are consequently economical of ground. A 'lot' of the ordinary
                  size is twenty-five feet front by a hundred deep. The desire to make one's house a
                     little superior to the ordinary standard has caused many of the
                  lots in the newer and more fashionable streets to be arranged, wherever the size
                  of the 'blocks'*
                   would admit it, with fronts of twenty-six or twenty-seven feet. It will be
                  evident that such a width allows only one front room alongside of the not very
                  wide hall; the house can only be extended perpendicularly and longitudinally.
               
                  
                  *A block is the front space of one street between two others
                     from corner to corner.
               
               Thus Mr. Vanderlyn's twenty-six feet are carried up into four pretty tall stories,
                  and back over nearly seventy feet of the hundred which the lot contains, leaving
                  the smallest possible quantity of yard, but allowing three rooms en suite on each floor. One inconvenience of this
                  arrangement is, that either your hall shrinks into very small dimensions—becomes,
                  in fact, merely two landing-places places—or you must dispense with a private
                  staircase altogether. Mr. Vanderlyn has chosen the latter alternative, and up and
                  down a single steep and narrow flight of stairs, whenever the Vanderlyns give a
                  party, every one has to tramp on entering and retiring, for all the cloaking and
                  uncloaking must be done in the bedrooms, as there is no place for it elsewhere.
                  Very inconvenient, you will say; but use is second nature, and the New-Yorkers are
                  so used to this climbing and swarming on the stairs, that even in a double
                     house, or a house and a half, or a basement
                     house, three different styles which would all admit of cloaking-rooms on
                  the lower floor, no one ever thinks of having them there.
               Masters is now to become an inmate of the house where he has been so often of late
                  a guest, for it is the invariable custom that the young couple shall reside with
                  the bride's father for the first four or six months. Indeed he may already be said
                  to have taken up his quarters there. This morning his valet came round; for Harry
                  has just set up a valet, a sort of English-Irishman, who makes it his principal
                  business to quarrel with all the other servants wherever he is; and this important
                  personage brought over various preliminary instalments of Mr. Masters—seven coats
                  and twelve pair of trousers, and about thirty waistcoats, no end of linen, and
                  carpet bags full of boots, a gorgeous dressing-gown, and Turkish slippers, and
                  smoking-cap, and cigars numerous, and all sorts of paraphernalia generally, until
                  the little dressing-room adjoining the nuptial chamber is overflowing with
                  foppery. And now as the happy man pauses on the second flight of stairs, he cannot
                  help casting a glance at the door of the front room on the second story, for he
                  hears the flutter of female voices and dresses, and knows that his bride is there.
                  Yes, in that room she is contemplating
                  herself before a pier-glass with her six bridemaids hovering around her, and
                  making the last suggestions and arrangements about her dress.
               Clara Vanderlyn, or Clara Masters we may call her now without much anticipation,
                  is a New-York belle and beauty. The terms are
                  not by any means synonymous, though in her case both attractions happen to be
                  united. But when I speak of her as a beauty, you must dismiss all ideas of
                  voluptuousness, commanding figure, Juno mien, and the like, and summon up all such
                  associations as you have been accustomed to connect with the words sylph and
                  fairy. You could not call her a 'fine' or a 'striking' woman, for she stands about
                  five feet one, and weighs probably less than a hundred pounds; but you must own
                  that she is a very lovely one. Her complexion is a pure blonde, the most exquisite
                  combination of red and white; and her hair, that 'brown in the shadow and gold in
                  the sun,' which poets love to rave of, and painters are always trying to paint.
                  Her features are delicate and regular; her nose very slightly aquiline, with her
                  thin blood-horse nostril, which is supposed to be aristocratic; her throat and
                  chin beautifully rounded; her mouth small and tempting, yet with an expression of
                  firmness at the corners, which to the close observer denotes no want of spirit;
                  her eyes are the clearest blue, neither large nor languishing—they might not
                  attract much attention by themselves, but are marvellously suited to the rest of
                  her face, and give the signal for the ineffable smiles which, whenever she is
                  thoroughly pleased, sparkle out suddenly over her whole countenance, and light up
                  those beautiful and expressive features until 
                     
                        A man had given all other bliss,
                        And all his worldly worth for this,
                        To waste his whole heart in one kiss
                        Upon her perfect lips.
                     
                   As to her dress, it is all white, of course, a delicate wreath of orange
                  blossoms (white roses are trying to any woman, but especially to a small woman), a
                  profusion of the finest lace—but no ornaments of any kind. What jewelry she
                  has—and it is not a great deal—is displayed on a table in the little
                  cedar-closeted passage that serves her for a dressing-room, along with all the
                  handkerchiefs and fans, and small articles of plate, and various knick-knacks that
                  she has received from her friends and relations; and they will all be inspected
                  to-night by the curious ladies, who take advantage of such an opportunity to
                  criticise everything in the house, from the new chandeliers to the bride's
                  nightcap.
               All this we see by our privilege. Harry sees nothing of it as yet. He passes on to
                  the third story front-room, enters the open door with Van Horne close at his
                  heels, and finds himself in the presence of a large bowl of punch and his second
                  groomsman and first cousin Gerard Ludlow. There are plenty of mirrors and candles
                  about, and a great display of toilet apparatus, in case the young men need to
                  complete their Adonisation.
               You couldn't do much more to the bridegroom, for he is got up to
                  kill. His mulberry-blue coat, resplendent with gilt buttons, and white satin skirt
                  lining, fits him as if he had been moulded and cast into it. His white
                  watered-satin waistcoat, which descends about three inches lower than if it were
                  the work of an English tailor, is set off by a heavy gold chain, streaming down
                  from a little watch-pocket under his left arm to the lowest button-hole, into
                  which it hooks. Surely he has appropriated some of what should be his wife's
                  jewelry, for in that very embroidered cambric shirt of his sparkle
                     three splendid diamonds set in dark
                  blue enamel. He must have stolen a bit of her lace to finish off that flourishing
                  white tie. His pantaloons are a triumph of art, and his supernaturally fitting
                  boots are—not patent leather, but (a wrinkle worth noting) thin French calf
                  carefully varnished afresh from day to day. He has pulled off one glove, and is
                  playing with it to show his little white hand and a fine sapphire which he has had
                  cut into a seal ring.
               Grand as he is, Ludlow is a touch above him. He has a grander tie, more
                  embroidery, larger diamond studs, and for watch-chain an enamelled snake, with a
                  head of opals and rubies. But Gerard is a magnificent fellow, and can carry off
                  any amount of dress. If there were only some ornamental service, like the Guards,
                  in New York, he would become it grandly; having no such resource, he drives
                  stylish equipages (belonging to other people), gives and goes to recherché little dinners, and dances the polka and
                  redowa in the intervals; by which contrivances he manages to pass his time
                  agreeably and ornamentally. He is two years younger than Henry: though not
                  precisely of like tastes, they are much attached to each other; indeed the only
                  thing which ever alloys the good feeling between them is a slight family likeness
                  sometimes remarked by strangers, to the annoyance of both. For
                  Gerard, who is nearly half-a-foot taller than Harry, thinks himself, at least
                  proportionably handsomer, which he is; and Harry thinks that he knows three times
                  as much as Gerard, and shows it in his face, which he does: so neither of them is
                  flattered by the resemblance. By the way, did you ever know two
                  persons who were? Gerard's father allows him twenty-five-hundred a-year
                     (dollars, always remember), and he lives at the rate of eight
                  thousand, partly by tick, partly on his brothers and acquaintances; for he is so
                  generous, affable, and altogether so gentlemanly a fellow, that it is a pleasure
                  to oblige him; and some day he will be a rich man and repay all hospitalities and
                  kindness with interest. Moreover, it should be mentioned in justice to him, that,
                  with all his luxurious and spendthrift habits, he is free from any vicious
                  propensity, drinks moderately, eschews gambling, and has no female acquaintance
                  whom he would be ashamed to acknowledge before ladies.
               And now it would not be respectful to postpone any longer our mention of Phil Van
                  Horne, the oldest and richest of the groomsmen. A genuine Knickerbocker from the
                  start, in the enjoyment of hereditary wealth, and fortunately without any turn for
                  dissipation, he began by educating himself thoroughly, according to the American
                  notion of the thing,—that is to say, he learned a little of everything. He studied
                  law for six months after leaving college, and attended medical lectures for a
                  year, and once contributed to a mathematical journal. He is an amateur performer
                  on two or three instruments, and sketches rather prettily, and has mastered the
                  common-places of three or four modern languages. But all these accomplishments
                  being grafted upon a certain native Dutch solidity, he is by no means forward to
                  display them, and will always let the rest of the company do the talking, unless
                  you take considerable trouble to stir him up and put him through his paces.
                  Perhaps it is this same disposition which has caused him to remain a bachelor till
                  the mature age of thirty, though greatly sought after for his wealth, and
                  connections, and abilities, and good habits (the money first and the virtue last:
                  I believe we have enumerated the desirable qualities in their proper order). He is
                  now an inveterate groomsman, having assisted sisted at half-a-dozen similar occasions within the
                  last three years; indeed, it is considered quite the thing to call on Phil for his
                  services, for he is tall and good-looking, and decidedly ornamental, in addition
                  to his other merits.
               Here come the other groomsmen, Sedley and Laurence, Jones, and Robinson. Very
                  young men they are,—boys they would be called elsewhere. Sedley is a sucking
                  barrister, sharp, spiteful, and loquacious; Jones makes believe to be clerk to his
                  father, a well-known Wall Street broker; Laurence and Robinson are not long out of
                  college, and have not exactly made up their minds what they shall be; their
                  present occupation is chiefly dancing the polka. One resemblance you will observe
                  in all the six: they have blue coats with gilt buttons, and their waistcoats are
                  of the same pattern with Masters', as if he had put them into his livery for the
                  occasion; and so he has in a sense, for he gave them coats and waistcoats.
                  Methinks this custom is somewhat snobbish, and might with propriety be
                  abolished.
               Masters is fidgeting slightly, and looking at his watch about once every three
                  seconds; Ludlow and Sedley are chaffing him mildly; the other three are practising
                  a polka step,—the natural resource of a young Gothamite when he has nothing else
                  to do. A servant announces that 'the ladies are ready;' Van Horne, with very
                  serious face, ladles out a full tumbler of punch, and hands it over to Harry, who
                  disposes of it rapidly. Then they hasten down to the second story, where each man
                  picks up his lady on his arm in passing; and so the party of twelve sail down into
                  the middle parlour of the first floor,—the folding-doors on each side of which are
                  closed. In the front parlour both families are attendant, to the number of sixty,
                  of all ages; from old Backus, who never stirs out except to see one of his
                  grandchildren married, to the Master Vanderlyns, two promising collegians of
                  fourteen and sixteen, who look up with intense respect to their new brother as a
                  man who has been abroad, and owns a fast trotter. As soon as the bridal party is
                  arranged in a semicircle, filling up about half the room, the folding-doors are
                  thrown open, and the company have a very pretty tableau fronting them. Van Horne stands on Masters' right—it would
                  not do to have the stately Gerard too near his less lofty cousin—and then the
                  little men taper off down to Robinson, who looks hardly older or larger than the
                  elder Master Vanderlyn, notwithstanding his white tie. The bride, on her part, is
                  admirably surported by her maidens. On her left is Miss Masters, a stylish
                  brunette, with a half Egyptian head and swimming black eyes: she looks like a
                  poetess, but is in reality remarkable for nothing so much as her common sense and
                  management. Next her, is Miss Alice Vanderlyn, a somewhat larger and coarser
                  edition of the bride, very good-natured and lively, and, on the whole, excellent
                     belle material, though not a remarkable
                  beauty. And then come four more Misses, very pretty and proper, whom we will not
                  dwell upon more particularly.
               And now advances into the semicircular space between the two groups Dr. Mabury,
                  the officiating minister. Parson and port is not the alliteration
                  for New York, it is Minister and 
                     maderia
                     madeira
                  . The doctor presides over the most respectable church in the city.
                  Everything is respectable about it; the doctor 
                     himslf
                     himself
                   and his congregation, and the architect and the organist, and the prim,
                  pompous, ponderous (male) pew-opener, even to the 'respectable, aged, indigent
                  females,' who are among the objects of its charity. Such clergymen are apt to
                     love good dinners as well as theology.
                  So say, at any rate, the Presbyterian and Methodist preachers, who shun wine like
                  poison, and wear long faces, and don't wear black coats; but, between you and me,
                  I think it's all their spite. I know the doctor to be a very good and pious man;
                  to say that he cannot excite spiritual concern in a hardened and worldly
                  congregation is only to say that he is not a Whitefield or a Wesley. And as to the
                  edibles and potables, he might tell you that it was flat blasphemy to hold that
                  all the good things of this life are sacred to the evil one.
               The marriage service has been completed about five minutes, and people are
                  crowding unmeaningly round the bride and bridegroom, making them formal
                  congratulations, when a shrill whistle is heard without, and the door-bell rings,
                  and straightway the six groomsmen rush out into the hall, for the company are
                  coming. Company? What company? Why, my unsophisticated reader, only
                  the two families were asked to the wedding; but all the fashionables
                  of New York, some seven hundred strong, were asked to the reception.
                  And the manner of the reception is this. As the successive arrivals descend
                  from—not their carriages, but the rooms upstairs—the ladies are taken from their
                  gentlemen by the groomsmen, and carried up to the bride to be presented to Mrs.
                  Masters. A pretty amount of locomotion these six young gentlemen have to do for
                  the next two hours, and a hard task it is for the bride to stand up all that time
                  to be looked at. But she seems to bear it very well, and at any rate it is her own
                  fault. Harry wished for nothing less than to expose her to this fatigue; but it
                  was all the fashion to have receptions, and she would have one.
               At last, just before eleven, the folding-doors of the third parlour are opened,
                  and the young couple walk in to supper. The groomsmen and bridemaids follow in
                  order, and then there is a general rush. Let us take a bumper of the Vanderlyn
                  madeira and evaporate. The glare of these hard polished white walls makes one's
                  eyes ache. We shall not lose sight of Henry and Clara for a very long
                  time. Just one week from to-day one of the Backuses gives them a dinner-party, and
                  the rest of their honeymoon will be a round of invitations. Rather soon to appear
                  in public, isn't it? But repose is not a natural state to an American man, still
                  less to an American woman. They like to be continually on the move.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER III.
               CATCHING A LION.
               WHEN Henry Masters had been married about four years, the Honourable Edward
                  Ashburner came to see him. They had known each other at Heidelberg, where Masters
                  once spent six months,—long enough to get some kind of a degree and pick up a good
                  deal of German, whether he learned any Latin and Greek or not. Ashburner had just
                  taken a first-class at Cambridge, and was touring with an older Cantab who knew
                  Carl Masters; hence the acquaintance. It was not a very long one: the young men
                  were together for part of two days; but in that time they grew very jolly and
                  comfortable over sundry bottles of Assmanshauser, and Harry gave the Englishman an
                  unlimited and pressing invitation to stop with him if he ever crossed the
                  Atlantic. Then they went their respective ways, and at this time Masters had a
                  very dim recollection of who Ashburner was.
               The first intimation he had of his arrival was in this wise. After passing nearly
                  the whole day on Long Island to eat terrapin soup and spring chickens at
                  Snedekor's, Harry, as he returned viâ the city
                  to his place in Westchester, on a fine June evening, stopped at his town-house in
                  Twenty-eighth Street. There, among a little heap of notes, and circulars, and
                  business communications—'Sir, Your note for 2500 dollars at the National Bank will
                  become due on the 10th inst.;' and 'Dear sir, Your interest will be ready on the
                  8th, if you will call for it at my counting-room' ('Confound the fellow', muttered
                  Masters, 'why can't he fix a time and call here, instead of making me tramp down
                  into the Swamp among his skins?'*
                  ); and 'Sir, You are requested to attend a meeting of the Central
                  Conservative Whig Young Men's Association next Monday;' and so forth—he found a
                  small card, with 'Mr. Ashburner' inscribed thereon. He showed it to Mrs. M. that
                  evening.
               
                  
                  *The Swamp is a part of the city principally inhabited by curriers and
                     tanners.
               
               'English?' asked Clara, looking not over-satisfied.
               'Rather,' said Harry, betraying no particular emotion either way.
               'Well, I'm sure I don't want to see any more Englishmen this way for a long while.
                  There was the scientific gentleman on his travels, who used to come to dinner in a
                  flannel shirt and use our house as if it was an inn. And there was that precious
                  young ensign on a furlough from Canada, who did you out of a thousand dollars, and
                  his father wouldn't pay a cent of it. And there was——'
               'But this is a good fellow,' said Harry, cutting short the list of disreputable
                  guests. 'Let me see; which of the Ashburners can it be? I knew three or four of
                  them. There was Captain Ashburner at Oldport, summer before last, you remember;
                  and his brother the Oxford man; and Lord Ashburner's son I knew at Heidelberg. I
                  shouldn't wonder if this is Lord Ashburner's son. But they are all very fair
                  men.'
               Whatever doubts Masters may have had on the matter were dissipated next morning by
                  the appearance of Ashburner himself. Our young tourist, having collected his letters of introduction, and spent
                  nearly a day in tramping through the 'above Bleecker' part of the city, was
                  gratified by finding that everybody was out of town (except one old gentleman who
                  had died recently); and learning that Masters, whose place fronted the thirteenth
                  milestone from City Hall, was the most comeatable of his acquaintances in esse or posse,
                  resolved to hunt him up the next day. Eleven miles of the expedition he performed
                  without difficulty on a tolerably well appointed, but not particularly fast
                  railroad. For the remaining two he was obliged to foot it, fortunately in the
                  morning of a not too warm day. The heats of May in this part of America are
                  usually succeeded by a week or fortnight of comparatively cool weather in the
                  beginning of June, before the sultry summer fairly sets in. So the guest reached
                  his host's abode rather dusty but otherwise in good trim.
               As Edward Ashburner will figure considerably in some of our sketches, it may not
                  be amiss here to say a few words about him. He was nearly three years younger than
                  Harry Masters, an eldest son, fond of classics, politics, and travelling, and had
                  attained to that complete state of bodily and mental training combined, which most
                  young Englishmen, who make a proper use of the advantages afforded them by their
                  universities, are sure to arrive at. He stood nearly six feet in his stockings,
                  could read twelve hours or walk twelve hours out of the twenty-four, according as
                  he was called on to do either, eat anything, drink any amount, sleep anywhere.
                  That he was awkward and shy in mixed society, and especially in ladies' society;
                  that he had a clumsy way of doing civil things; that he dressed badly, danced
                  badly, and spoke French badly, though fluently: all this follows of course from
                  his being a young Englishman.
               Masters' house at Devilshoof (which unromantic name the Masters place had
                  inherited from old Dutch times) was a wide, deep, wooden, two-story dwelling, of a
                  sunshiny yellow colour, with a spacious piazza running all round it, and three
                  rooms on a floor upon each side of a large hall. Into this hall Ashburner was
                  admitted, and found Masters in full enjoyment of the dolce
                     far niente. With cigarette in mouth and one foot in the air, the
                  master of the house reclined in a lumbering Chinese cane-chair, nearly as big as
                  an omnibus. He wore a magnificent shawl-pattern dressing-gown, orange cashmere
                  without, and rose silk within, confined at the waist by a tasselled cord that
                  looked like a very superior style of bell-pull; very wide light blue trowsers,
                  slippers of the same colour embroidered in gold, a blue and white silk cravat, and
                  a red smoking-cap, more for show than use, jauntily pitched on one side of his
                  head. From his whole attire emanated a combined odour of French sachets, German Cologne, and Turkish tobacco. A
                  beautiful child was sporting around him, playing bopeep behind the stupendous
                  chair, and crying out 'Bah, papa!' As the visitor entered he leaped up, scattering
                  the ashes and tobacco of his loosely rolled cigarette over himself, and Ashburner,
                  and the matting of the hall floor.
               'How are you, old fellow? I'm so glad you've found your way here.
                  Holla, baby! don't run away!' and catching the hope of the Masters by both
                  shoulders in the act of toddling off, he swung up the astonished urchin close to
                  the nose of the equally astonished Englishman. 'Here's the first curiosity of the
                  place, my boy! He's just three years old rising, can drive a horse on a straight
                  road, fears no manner of bug,*
                  eats everything he can
                     
                     *
                        Bug is the popular American designation of all insects except
                        butterflies.
                   get, and
                  drinks every liquid in the house except ink. Look at him! Isn't he a beauty? Isn't
                  he a whole team and one horse extra?'
               Ashburner duly praised young America, and at that moment Clara appeared, in a
                  dressing-gown also; but here was a tricolour pattern, lined with blue silk.
               'A very handsome young couple, certainly,' thought the Englishman, 'but how
                  theatrically got up? I wonder if they always go about in the country dressed this
                  way!' And he thought of the sensation, the mouvemens
                     divers that such a costume would excite among the guests of the
                  paternal mansion at Alderstave.
               Masters, with a rapid alteration of style and manner, and a vast elaboration of
                  politeness, introduced his wife and guest. Ashburner fidgeted a little, and looked
                  as if he did not exactly know what to do with his arms and legs. Mrs. Masters was
                  as completely at her ease as if she had known him all her life, and, by way of
                  putting him at his ease too, began to abuse England and the English to him, and
                  retail the old grievance of her husband's plunder by Ensign Lawless, and the
                  ungentlemanly behaviour of Lawless père on the
                  occasion, and the voluminous correspondence that took place between him and Harry,
                  which the Blunder and Bluster afterwards published in full, under
                  the heading 'American Hospitality and English Repudiation,' in extra caps; and so
                  she went on to the intense mystification of Ashburner, who couldn't precisely make
                  out whether she was in jest or earnest, till Masters came to the rescue.
               'When did you arrive, Ashburner?'
               'Yesterday morning.'
               'The first question an American generally asks an Englishman is, 'How do you like
                  our country?' and the second, 'What'll you take to drink?' I won't put the first
                  to you, for you have hardly been long enough here to answer it, but the second is
                  always appropriate.'
               'I have heard a great deal about sherry-cobbler, but did not order one at the
                  hotel for fear I might not obtain it there in perfection.'
               'You won't enjoy it anywhere in perfection just now. To be properly appreciated it
                  requires a hot day, of which we shall have some in a week or two. Will you put
                  yourself into my hands, and let me recommend for this weather some plain sherry?
                  There is some all ready in the refrigerator; I will fetch it myself.'
               And straightway Masters bustled off to the pantry, and speedily returned with a
                  decanter of very pale wine and three glasses, which he placed on a diminutive
                  stand.
               'This is Manzanilla, our favourite sherry,' and he poured out a bumper to
                  Ashburner, who made a doubtful face on tasting it, for with the bitter flavour of
                  Amontillado was combined in it a distinct taste of ether. 'You don't like it, I
                  see. No one does at first. When I came back in' 44 this wine was just becoming
                  fashionable. The first time I tasted it, it seemed like medicine; the second, I
                  thought the flavour peculiar, but not unpleasant; the third time I became
                  exceedingly fond of it. So it will be with you. And as you will very often have
                  Manzanilla put before you, I thought it well to initiate you into the mystery of
                  it at once. It is not a strong wine—all the better for that here. Our dry climate
                  does not allow the same fiery and heavy drinks as your moist one. You must give up
                  your ale and port, and brandied sherries. The very necessity of 'liquoring' so
                  often in our warm weather obliges us to weaken our liquor. You can't ice this
                  sherry too much. We dine at four or half-past, and you see this has been in ice
                  already. What time is it? Eleven. That reminds me. How long is your stay in
                  America to be?'
               
               'I do not intend to return till the end of the year, or perhaps till next
                  spring.'
               'Then of course you will do Niagara, and Canada, and the watering-places, this
                  summer, come back to New York for the season (our season begins iu November), and
                  go on to Washington in mid winter. You had better, then, put off all your
                  lionization of the city (there is not a great deal of it to do) until your return.
                  And now let me drive you down to your hotel; bring back your carpet-bag, and pass
                  a few days with us till the warm weather sets in. Then we can go to my brother's
                  place higher up the river, and after that shape our plans at leisure. Excuse me
                  for three minutes while I put on my boots.'
               Masters rushed to the back door, shouted out some rapid orders to his stable,
                  which, though partially concealed by trees, was within hailing distance of the
                  house, and then scampered upstairs, where his three minutes turned out to be
                  twenty or twenty-five: during which time Mrs. Masters and her husband's guest did
                  not inter-change much conversation, and Ashburner, in default of other amusement,
                  applied himself again to the Manzanilla, which he certainly found to improve on
                  acquaintance; so much so, that after finishing his first glass, he despatched a
                  second, and was dubitating on the propriety of a third when Masters reappeared. He
                  had exchanged his dressing gown for a dark brown cutaway, and his slippers for
                  prunella boots of feminine aspect, tipped with varnished leather at the toe.
               'Now, mon ami, I hear the wagon coming round;
                  come out on the stoop.'
               Ashburner remained stationary, not exactly understanding the invitation.
               'Oh you don't know what stoop means. It is one of the Dutch words we
                  Gothamites have retained. Well, then, come out on the front piazza.'
               So they went out, and Ashburner saw before the door two compact little dark brown
                  horses, with white faces and white hind-feet. They had on the very lightest
                  harness imaginable—slender collars, cobweblike traces and hip-straps, no winkers
                  or check-reins; and behind them was such a vehicle as he had never seen before,
                  even in dreams. At first he could discern nothing but four tall slender wheels of
                  a bright vermilion picked out in red, with a groom sitting among them; but a
                  closer inspection enabled him to perceive a scanty seat for two persons, with no
                  appreciable back. The box of the seat was varnished leather, except a dark green
                  wooden rim that rose about three inches from the gaily carpeted floor.
               'There's my wagon,' said Masters; 'it's not a regular trotting wagon—weighs three
                  hundred or more—but light enough for a team. Get in.'
               'But how do you get in?' asked the other, looking very dubiously at
                  the mysterious carriage, the front and hind wheels of which on the same side all
                  but touched each other.
               'So!' quoth Harry, who had meantime crowned himself with a very long-napped white
                  beaver, and fitted on his white driving-gloves; 'just this way!'
               And running behind, he leaped in over the back, or where the back might have been,
                  and took the whitewebbed reins from the groom, who, on his part, tumbled out half
                  over, half between, the wheels by an extraordinary gymnastic evolution.
               'Ah, that's the way, is it?' and Ashburner was preparing to follow
                  suit.
               
               'No, this is the way. Hold on.'*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *
                     Hold on is American for hold hard
               
               Masters hauled in his off-horse, slanting his front axle and locking his off
                  fore-wheel, by which means he left on the nigh side a considerable space between
                  the hind-wheel and the front, and Ashburner first became aware of the existence of
                  a practicable iron step, by which he ascended without much difficulty.
               'Hold fast, old fellow,' said Masters; and he drew up the reins, which had been
                  lying loose in his hand.
               Immediately the horses started off at a pace that nearly sent Ashburner backwards
                  out of the wagon. Out at the gate they flew, up the lane that led to the turnpike,
                  through another gate, and along the main road at their authenticated speed of 3'
                  20'', Masters settling himself further back in his seat and tightening his pull,
                  and the trotters going faster as he pulled more. Ashburner could hear nothing for
                  the clattering of the pole-chains and the patter of those eight hoofs as they
                  swept the ground in their tearing trot, nor see anything for the clouds of dirt
                  and gravel which the trotters' forefeet threw back over the low dashboard. He held
                  on with both hands, and trusted to Providence.
               'Wo-o!' ejaculated Masters at last, after proceeding for about two minutes at this
                  headlong rate; and as he spoke he slackened his reins gradually. The horses fell
                  into a steady gate of twelve miles an hour.
               'We must take them easy most of the way,' says Harry, 'for the roads are
                  heavy.'
               'Do you call this going easy?' replied his friend, with a glance at
                  the rapidly receding objects on each side the road. 'We must be making sixteen
                  miles an hour.'
               'Not thirteen. You always seem to be going faster with a team than you are,
                  because they make more noise.'
               'Well, I don't pretend to judge of pace just now, for my eyes are full of gravel.
                  Why don't you build your dashboards higher?'
               'Because it is necessary to see the horses' feet. Before a well-trained trotter
                  breaks, he usually gives warning by a skip or two. With a low dashboard you can
                  note this instantly, and hold him up in time; otherwise your horse might be
                  carried off his feet before you knew it.'
               So they rolled along merrily some five miles to Harlaem Bridge, over which the
                  team walked, not because they were tired, but because it was illegal to cross at a
                  faster gait,—an ordinance rendered necessary by the frail structure of most
                  American bridges; and then as they passed through the village of Harlaem, where
                  taverns, and stables, and fast trotters abound, Masters gave his horses another
                  brush, by way of astonishing the natives.
               'He-e-eh!' shouted a blacksmith, looking up from his work as the vermilion wheels
                  rattled by.
               The nigh horse made a skip, and his driver just caught him in time.
               'He-e-eh! G'lang!' shouted back Harry over his shoulder, in triumphant defiance,
                  as much as to say, 'You don't break up my team so easy, my boy!' And then growing
                  excited by the pace, he continued to scream at his horses and lift them, until he
                  had succeeded in aggravating the trotters to such an extent, that when he wanted
                  to pull up at the next milestone, they could not be made to stop, though it was on
                  the ascent of a pretty steep hill, until he had thrown one leg over the lines.
               
               'Your animals are not easily tired,' his friend remarked, as, for the first time,
                  they proceeded at an easy trot. 'Are these very fancy horse, or is it
                  common to have such a pair?'
               'There are several teams on the island that can beat me five or then seconds in a
                  mile, but few so well matched in looks or driving together so nicely. I have had
                  them a year, and they are pretty well used to my hand,—and to my wife's, for that
                  matter.'
               'And what does such a pair cost?'
               'I got these a bargain for 800 dollars from a friend, who was just married and
                  going abroad. Probably, a jockey would have charged me four figures*
                   for them. That was a year ago last month. I had twenty-six hundred then to
                  spend in luxuries, and invested it in three nearly equal portions. It may amuse to
                  know how. These horses I bought for myself, as I said, for 800 dollars; a grand
                  Pleyel for Mrs. Masters for 900 dollars; and a man for myself for the same
                  sum.'
               
                  
                  *
                     I. e. A thousand dollars or more.
               
               'A man?'
               'Yes, a coachman. You look mystified. Come, now, candidly, is New York a slave
                  State? Do you know, or what do you think?'
               'I had supposed it was not.'
               'You supposed right, and know more about it than all your countrymen take the
                  trouble to know. Nevertheless, it is literally true that I bought this man for the
                  other 900 dollars; and it happened in this wise. One fine morning there was a
                  great hue and cry in Washington. Nearly a hundred slaves of different ages, sexes,
                  and colours, most of them house-servants in the best families, had made a stampedo, as the Western men say.
               They had procured a sloop through the aid of some white men, and sailed off up the
                  Potomac,—not a very brilliant proceeding on their part. The poor devils were all
                  taken, and sentence of transportation passed upon them—for it amounts to that:
                  they were condemned (by their masters) to be sold into the south-western States.
                  Some of the cases were peculiarly distressing,—among others, a quadroon man, who
                  had been coachman to one of our government secretaries. He had a wife and five
                  children, all free in Washington; but two of his sisters were in bondage with
                  him,—very pretty and intelligent girls, report said. The three were sold to a
                  slave-trader, who kept them some time on speculation. The circumstance attracted a
                  good deal of attention in New York; some of the papers were full of it. I saw the
                  account one morning, and happening to have this 900 dollars on hand, I wrote
                  straight off to one of our Abolition members at Washington (I never saw him in my
                  life, but one doesn't stand on ceremony in such matters, and the whole thing was
                  done on the spur of the moment), saying that if either of the girls could be
                  bought for that sum I would give it. The gentleman who had the honour of my
                  correspondence put upon him, wrote to another gentleman—standing counsel, I
                  believe, for the Washington Abolitionists—and he wrote to the slave-trader, one
                  Bruin (devilish good name, that, for his business!) who sent back a glorious
                  answer, which I keep among my epistolary curiosities. 'The girls are very fine
                  ones,' said this precious specimen; 'I have been offered 1000 dollars for one of
                  them by a Louisiana gentleman. They cannot be sold at a lower price than 1200
                  dollars and 1300 dollars respectively. If I could be sure that your friend's
                  motives were those of unmixed philanthropy, I would make a considerable
                     reduction. The man, who is a very
                  deserving person, and whom I should be glad to see at liberty, can be had for 900
                  dollars; but I suppose your correspondent takes less interest in him.' The
                  infernal scamp thought I wanted a mistress, and his virtuous mind revolted at the
                  thought of parting with one of the girls for such a purpose—except for an extra
                     consideration.'*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *All the above incidents are literally true, and the extracts from Bruin's
                     letter almost verbatim copies.
               
               'It must have been a wet blanket upon your philanthropic intentions.'
               'Really I hardly knew whether to be most angry or amused at the turn things had
                  taken. As to Clara, she thought it a glorious joke, and did nothing for the next
                  month but quiz me about the quadroon girls, and ask me when she might expect them.
                  However, I thought, with the Ethiopian in the ballad, that 'it would never do to
                  give it up so,' and accordingly wrote back to Washington that I should be very
                  glad indeed to buy the man. Unfortunately, the man was half-way to Mississippi by
                  that time——Now we are well up that hill and can take a good brush down to the
                  next. G'l-lang, ponies! He-eh! Wake up, Firefly!'
               'And then?'
               'Oh, how he got off, after all! It was a special interference of Providence.
                  (G'lang, Star!) The Hon. Secretary felt some compunctions about the fate of his
                  coachman, and hearing that the money was all ready to pay for him, actually paid
                  himself the additional 50 dollars required to bring him back to Washington; so he
                  lives there now a free man with his family,—at least, for all I know to the
                  contrary, for I never heard any more about him since.'
               'And what became of the girls?'
               'There was a subscription raised for them here. My brother Carl gave something
                  towards it,—not that he cared particularly for the young ladies, but because he
                  had a strong desire to sell the gentleman from Louisiana. They were ransomed, and
                  brought here, and put to school somewhere, and a vast fuss made about them—quite
                  enough to spoil them, I'm afraid. And so ends that story. What a joke to think, of
                  a man being worth just as much as a grand piano, and a little more than a pair of
                  ponies!'
               Ashburner thought that Masters treated the whole affair too much as a joke.
               'Tell me,' said he, 'if these people came to New York, or you met them travelling,
                  would you associate with them on familiar terms?'
               'Not with Mr. Bruin, certainly,' replied Harry. 'To give the devil his due, such a
                  man is considered to follow an infamous vocation, even in his part of the
                  country.'
               'But the Honourable Secretary and the other gentlemen, who sell their men to work
                  on the cotton plantations, and their women for something worse?'
               'H-m! A-h! Did you ever meet a Russian?—in your own country, I mean.'
               'Yes, I met one at dinner once. I won't pretend to pronounce his name.'
               'Did you go out of the way to be uncivil to him, because he owned serfs?'
               'No, but I didn't go out of my way to be particularly genial with him.'
               'Exactly: the cases are precisely parallel. The Southerners are our Russians. They
                  come up to the North to be civilized; they send their boys here to be educated; they spend a good deal of money here. We
                  are civil to them, but not over genial,—some of us, at least, are not.'
               By this time the fast-stepping trotters had passed through Yorkville, and reached
                  the outskirts of the city. As soon as their feet touched the pavement they fell
                  into a walk.
               'You see it is impossible to drive fast over these terrible stones in a light
                  carriage, so we shall go easy for this last mile to your hotel,' said Masters. 'We
                  can afford it, for there wasn't much time lost on the road. See here (pulling out
                  his watch), twelve miles in forty-nine minutes, including a stoppage for toll! I
                  call that pretty good travelling.'
               And now Ashburner became sensible of a change in the temperature. They had been
                  making their own breeze previously by the rapidity of their motion, but now there
                  was scarcely a breath of air, and as the wagon was undefended by any sort of top
                  or head, he began to feel the heat of the sun more than was altogether
                  pleasant.
               'Surely it is hot enough now for a sherry-cobbler?' he remarked after
                  a pause.
               'Hardly, to enjoy one in perfection, but it will do. When we get to your hotel
                  I'll brew you a first-rate one.' And, the horses being stimulated to a gentle
                  trot, they soon arrived at Ashburner's temporary head-quarters, which were,
                  fortunately, 'above Bleecker.'
               'Now pack your bag,' said Masters, 'and the cobbler will be ready by that
                  time.'
               'But what do you do with your horses? asked the other, who saw no groom or other
                  person to whom they might be entrusted.
               'Tie them, to be sure,' was the reply; and handing the lines to Ashburner, as he
                  stopped his team. Masters leaped out, pulled a hitching-strap from under the seat,
                  and fastened his off-horse very neatly to a lamp-post. Then, after Ashburner had
                  descended, he tied his white hand pieces to an opening made for the purpose on one
                  side of the dashboard, and finally diving under the seat once more he produced two
                  sheets, with the names of his horses, Starlight and Firefly, showily worked thereon in red letters, and spread them carefully over
                  his team. Then, taking his whip with him for fear of casual appropriators, he
                  accompanied his friend into the hotel.
               When Ashburner returned to his sitting-room, after arranging his bag, he found
                  Masters in all his glory, surrounded by the sutorial requisites. Four large
                  tumblers, two wine-glasses, a couple of lemons, ditto of knives, a decanter of
                  sherry (not Manzanilla, but dark in colour and high in flavour), a saucer of
                  powdered sugar, and another of finely-pounded ice, were paraded on the table, and
                  among them sat Masters, on the table also, examining a bundle of fresh straws.
               'Now,' said he, 'take a knife and a lemon, and do as you see me do; don't mind
                  soiling your fingers. First you rub the lemon with the back of the knife—that
                  brings out the essential oil better; then you pare off the rind very carefully,
                  taking only the yellow, and not cutting into the white at all. Very well Imbed
                  your lemon-peel in as much sugar as you would use if making a similarly-sized
                  glass of punch. Sometimes you will see slices of lemon put into a
                  cobbler—nothing can be more destructive; avoid everything but the yellow peel. If
                  you will have something more, put in a slice of orange or pine-apple,
                  or a few strawberries. I think this may be done to good effect in a bowl, but not
                  in a single glass. Now fill your tumbler half-way with pounded ice. Good. And now pour in two wine-glasses of sherry.
                  You see we use dark sherry for this, both for the strength and the colour. It
                  makes the mixture of a beautiful golden hue; with Amontillado or Manzanilla it
                  would look too weak. Don't be impatient; we have to mix yet.' He took up one of
                  the spare glasses, covered with it the mouth of the tumbler which contained the
                  magic compound, and shook the cobbler back and forwards from one glass to the
                  other a dozen times without spilling a drop. 'There, now choose a perfect straw,
                  and then try it! I'll change glasses with you as yours is not yet mixed, and you
                  might not be handy at tossing it the first time.'
               Ashburner took a long draught of the cool liquid through the straw, and confessed
                  that he experienced a new sensation.
               'Now don't drink it too fast. You should take a quarter of an hour to each glass.
                  Three glasses a-piece will be enough, and we have an hour before us.'
               The decanter terminated with the hour. In the pauses of the cobbler, Masters
                  having caught Ashburner's flunkey as he looked in at the door, read him a lecture
                  on the best way of employing his time during his master's absence, by making
                  himself acquainted with the city,&c.; laying down the law so rapidly, that the
                  man, who was about of the average English flunkey intelligence, was completely
                  mystified, and Ashburner himself as much astonished as an Englishman ever permits
                  himself to be to her his servant tutored by another man.
               'I must be permitted to doubt your wisdom,' said Masters, as the servant retired,
                  'in bringing him with you. On the Continent one must have a courier,—it really
                  saves money as well as trouble, for the fellow cheats you a little and prevents
                  you being cheated a great deal; but a man-servant, who does not understand both
                  the customs and the language of the country the former quite as important a point
                  as the latter), is only in the way. To be sure, he is of some service as a valet
                  when you are at a city hotel, and he may learn enough of the streets
                  in a few days to go your errands for you (though I should doubt that unless he is
                  sharper than most English servants that I have seen); but when you get into the
                  country, especially in the West, you will find this man sitting at the same table
                  with you, riding in the same vehicle, paying the same fare,—in all respects
                  treated as your equal; and, since you have your wits about you more than he has,
                  you will, in fact, be obliged to take care of him, instead of his being of any
                  service to you. And now as the sherry is all gone we will, go too, especially as
                  we have but eighty minutes to get home and dress for dinner.'
               Masters' advice was very correct and proper in itself, but there was also a little
                  personal motive mixed with it. He had no intention of including Ashburner's
                  attendant in the invitation to stop a few days, lest the English body-servant
                  should quarrel with his own black cook and Irish grooms, whom he found it hard
                  enough to manage already. When Ashburner and he descended to their vehicle, the
                  former observed several idlers gazing at it, and remarked that the turn-out, which
                  would have attracted a crowd in London, was something to look at even in New
                  York.
               'That's on account of my red wheels,' exclaimed Masters. 'They are
                  rather rowdy, I must own; not exactly the thing for a gentleman. But the use of
                  them is this. I go to a trot on Long Island; there are some hundred wagons there,
                  all fastened close together to fences or under sheds. My wheels are so conspicuous
                     that I can pick them out at once in a
                  great crowd, and it saves much time and trouble in starting for home. Now I shall
                  drive round the corner to a livery stable and sponge out the ponies' mouths, and
                  then hey for Devils-hoof!'
               Back to Devilshoof they went, even faster than they had come; and before the clock
                  struck four Ashburner had full time to dress and rid himself of some pounds of the
                  Third Avenue and Westchester turnpike, which had been thrown into his ears and
                  eyes, down his cravat, into his trousers' pockets even, by the forefeet of
                  Starlight and Firefly.
               Dinner was served at four precisely. The table-service was of the plainest
                  description, not a vestige of plate except the silver forks; and the viands of no
                  very recherché, kind—home-raised chickens and a
                  Virginia ham constituting the staple of the meal; but everything, from the okra
                  soup to the orange fritters, was first-rate of its kind; the indispensable
                  Manzanilla was supported by excellent champagne, decanted and iced to the freezing
                  point (a test of good wine, for no inferior quality will bear it); and when, at
                  last, Masters commended to his guest a prime bottle of Latour, and a swelling
                  slendernecked decanter of the old Vanderlyn Madeira, Ashburner felt thoroughly
                  comfortable and content, as a man should, who is drinking well after having dined
                  well. He was a pretty fair hand at the bottle, as most Englishmen are; indeed, he
                  crowded his host very hard, who was a fastidious, but not a profuse drinker, and
                  liked to sip his Bordeaux leisurely. Before their united efforts the jug of claret
                  and the decanter of Madeira speedily vanished; and then came some sublime coffee,
                  during the discussion of which Masters extemporised a dissertation on the method
                  of preparing that beverage, 'which it is singular your countrymen never understand
                  how to make;' finally a chasse of white Curacoa
                  assisted the guest to swallow his host's lecture.
               Mrs. Masters, had joined freely in their conversation during the repast; indeed,
                  she may be said to have taken the largest share of it to herself. At first she was
                  barely within the bounds of civility; slighted or ridiculed everything about the
                  English unmercifully; and more than once puzzled Ashburner both as to how he was
                  to take her remarks, and how to reply to them. Gradually this sauciness, and
                  almost rudeness, refined itself down to a piquant raillery, with occasional
                  gracefully compensating compliments, till he found her discourse as agreeable as
                  it had at first been embarrassing. Still there was always in it an air of
                  half-defiance, and half-carelessness, that strangely affected the young
                  Honourable, who had always been petted and toadied at home, and was not used to
                  meet an untitled person who thought, and showed that she thought herself, at
                  least, as good as himself.
               After dinner, Masters carried off his guest to the stable, and had the stud
                  paraded before him.
               'That black is my blood colt, Daredevil: Mrs. Masters and her sister are the only
                  two men on the island that can ride him, Hibernically speaking. He threw me, the
                  other day. If you want to show your horsemanship, he will give you a good
                  opportunity of doing so, whenever you please. And this is my pet saddle-horse,
                  Charlie; he used to be a fast-trotter in harness, till I broke him over again for
                  riding; and this my wife's gray mare; and these my carriage horses. Aren't they
                  beauties, though I say it myself?'
               'Very handsome, and very well matched; but rather small, I think, according to our
                  standard. They are not sixteen hands, surely?'
               
               'Just fifteen three; and, do you know, my only fault with them is, that they are
                  rather large. We prefer middle-sized horses; we think that large ones generally
                  have less speed, and always knock themselves up sooner. On the first point there
                  may be a doubt, but on the second there is none, at least in this country. I gave
                  500 dollars for this team, and I could have bought more than one pair nearly three
                  inches taller, and as well matched, for less money. There are my ponies, whose
                  capacity you are acquainted with.'
               'How comes it that you call horses of that size ponies, when your average height
                  is below ours?—at least I judge it to be so, for I have seen nothing about your
                  city like our large dray-horses.'
               'I believe that any horse under carriage size is familiarly denominated a pony,
                  especially if he happens to be a trotter. I have heard Charlie called a pony
                  often, and he is nearly as big as my coach-horses.'
               Then they strolled round the place, which did not involve a very long walk, as
                  Masters' grounds were comprised within the limits of fourteen acres; accordingly
                  he extended their perambulation by diverging into the neighbours' premises on both
                  sides. The places had one general character. There was no attempt anywhere at
                  lawns, which, indeed, could not be kept up in perfection under the hot American
                  sun by any amount of care and labour; the open grass between the houses and the
                  river was suffered to grow long, and occasionally broken by natural banks and
                  terraces. The river views were beautiful; white sails specked the clear blue
                  water, and white clouds the clear blue sky, except where long lines of scarlet and
                  gold marked the downward progress of the setting sun. The gardens were formal,
                  more resembling Dutch than English; the hot-houses small, there being less
                  necessity for them, as grapes and melons flourish here in the open air. The
                  mansions were invariably built of wood, large and roomy. There were no hedges, and
                  few fences, except at the boundaries; what there were seemed, almost purposely, to
                  be allowed to fall into decay.
               Fatigued with his day's experiences, Ashburner was not sorry to take an early
                  opportunity of retiring. Masters himself played chamberlain, and showed him to his
                  room.
               'I believe your countrymen are addicted to feather beds and curtains,' he said;
                  'but we really have not either in the house. We use nothing but French bedsteads
                  and hair matresses.'
               Ashburner assured him that he was not so effeminate as to require anything
                  softer.
               'And we have not the Croton water-works here; but there is a portable
                  shower-bath,' pointing to a sort of ten in one corner of the apartment, 'which you
                  will find convenient in the morning. Buenas
                     noches!'
               Ashburner spent nearly a week at Devilshoof, as much pleased, perhaps, certainly
                  as much amused, as he had ever been at a country mansion in his own land, though
                  he was differently entertained, and had, in some respects, a very different sort
                  of host. The American was full of dash and à
                     plomb, and good-humoured braggadocia. Stiff, shy,
                  reserved, silent, modest, were words that might have had no existence in the
                  (English or American) language, so far as he was concerned with them. Ashburner
                  could not help wondering at the matter-of-course tone in which a young man, little
                  older than himself, and considerably under thirty, spoke of 'What I said to Daniel
                  Webster,' and 'When I was trustee of the Historical,' and 'The petition that we
                  are getting up to the Common Council to
                  open the Tenth Avenue,' and 'When I was seeing about Mary's settlements,' and
                  'Once, when I knew more about stocks than I do now, and used to write the money
                  articles for the Blunder and Bluster;' in short, he talked like a
                  man who had already been for years a well-established and important member of the
                  community. Whatever his establishment did not possess he made no attempt to
                  conceal the deficiency of; whatever he had was usually pretty good of its kind,
                  and he made no secret of that either. When Ashburner came to know him better, he
                  found the secret of this, which was twofold.
               Henry Masters was an orphan, as the reader may or may not remember. Since his
                  wedding he had lost his father-in-law and grandfather; married off his sister to a
                  rich Philadelphian; quarrelled with most of his cousins; and so, with the
                  exception of his brother Carl (and him he met, perhaps, six times in the course of
                  a year), he had no one to depend upon, look up to, or consult, and was entirely
                  left to his own energies and discretion. The death of his relatives had increased
                  his independence as well as his isolation, by doubling his income. During his
                  childhood he had seen a good deal of rough life in country boarding-schools—places
                  where instances have been known of boys being compelled to clean their master's
                  horse or boots, precisely à la Dotheboys Hall. His quick
                  apprehension and retentive memory made him a fit subject for the superficial and
                  miscellaneous, but very practical education, common in his country. His foreign
                  travel added to this a fair speaking acquaintance with three or four modern
                  languages, and a knowledge of the dishes, and dresses, and other obvious external
                  peculiarities of the principal nations in Europe. He made a first-rate match,
                  almost without an effort on his part. All these things put him in a position
                  nearly answering to the Greek idea of the man αυταρκης, or self-sufficient. He knew no subject very deeply or
                  accurately, but something about almost every subject in the schedule of human
                  knowledge; and whatever he did know was always at his command and ready to be made
                  the most of. He could write newspaper and magazine articles, critical, political,
                  or financial, with vast facility, being restrained by no modest doubts or
                  scruples; and could stand up and harangue any number of people about any topic,
                  without notice (a faculty, it may be here remarked, which comes by nature to all
                  Americans, educated or uneducated). He did his own marketing, and collected his
                  own rents and interests. He could show his cook how to prepare a new dish, and
                  draw patterns of carriages for his coach-maker. Half the time he cleaned his
                  gloves and varnished his dress-boots himself, being fully persuaded that he could
                  do them better than his man. He drove, about the country in his wagon without a
                  servant; and if he had occasion to stop at any place where the stable boy was out
                  of the way, or occupied, unharnessed his own trotter with little difficulty, and
                  less scruple. He was always well up in the prices of stocks and real estate. When
                  he chose to play Sybarite, he surrounded his friends with all the comforts that
                  wealth could procure, while he was still independent of all the ministers of
                  luxury, and could have roughed it at any moment with the most enterprising
                  traveller, though in the daily enjoyment of silken ease at home. Such a man's
                  consciousness of independence is apt, nay, sure to make him a little conceited;
                  and those young men, of whom Masters is a marked and favourable type, are
                  conceited, it must be owned, and talk in a way beyond their years, to judge by the
                  customs of any other country; but then, in no other country are young men
                  similarly circumstanced, educated, and developed.
               
               But the showy and flourishing style of Young America was, moreover, increased in
                  this particular instance by Masters' position as host. The Englishman is by nature
                  rather charitable than hospitable. Generous to the foreigner if he comes before
                  him in formâ pauperis, he is otherwise not
                  over-desirous of his company, or solicitous of his good opinion. Perfectly
                  satisfied with himself and his country, he relies for any future possible
                  improvement on the progressive idealization of his own character, not on the
                  adoption of any hints from abroad. When he travels, he generally contrives to
                  carry a little England of his own about with him; and therefore, seldom requiring
                  the assistance of others in a foreign land, he cannot fully appreciate the
                  difficulties of a foreigner in his. The American is naturally hospitable. The mere
                  name of 'stranger' makes a man to him an object not of suspicion, but of
                  sympathy—and this, too, though he has suffered from foreign impostors quite as
                  much in proportion as honest John Bull. Feeling that his country is a new one, and
                  yet making its position in the world; knowing, too, that everything connected with
                  it is apt to be misconceived and misrepresented in Europe, he is painfully anxious
                  to put his best foot foremost in the presence of strangers, and to prove to them,
                  not by words alone, but by deeds, that his countrymen are neither illiterate nor
                  uncivilized. His ambition extends further still; he delights to startle his
                  visitor with his fast trotters and elegantly-built carriages, miraculously-cut
                  coats, and sumptuous furniture, old Madeira, canvass-backs, beautiful women, and
                  other vanities of the world, in the highest perfection.
               Thus it happened, that whatever Masters said or did was said or done with a view
                  of showing off before Ashburner. He dressed half-a-dozen times a day, in fancy
                  cutaways, wonderful checked trousers, with cross-bars of different but
                  harmoniously blended colours, and an infinite variety of cravats and waistcoats;
                  and regularly put himself into a dress-coat and black continuations, diamond studs
                  and varnished boots, for their four o'clock dinner, at which he plied his guest
                  with choice vintages, the names of which were as puzzling to him as the flavours
                  were delicious. Then, again, to show that he was not a mere fine gentleman, he
                  would put on the seediest of summer paletots and moleskin trousers, with an old
                  straw hat or oilskin cap, and in that trim drive Ashburner to see the High Bridge,
                  or other lions within five or six miles, or ramble about the country with him
                  before breakfast. Though very fast for a short brush, he was evidently unused to
                  long walks, and terribly pounded by them; but having discovered that Ashburner
                  liked this kind of exercise, he accompanied him heroically for hours, at an almost
                  professional pace, consoling his fatigue afterwards as best he might by vast
                  potations of cobbler. He laboured hard, and not unsuccessfully, to beat Ashburner
                  at his own game of billiards.*
                   He always managed to have his magazine articles laid about on tables where
                  his friend would be pretty sure to read them; while, on the other hand, he was
                  careful to keep out of his way any less favourable specimens of the periodical
                  literature of the country: and Ashburner one detected him at a neighbour's house,
                  in the act of hiding a particularly scandalous number of The Sewer,
                  lest it might fall under the stranger's observation. Conscious that his Latin and
                  Greek was not on a par with the Englishman's, he branched out largely, whenever
                  occasion offered, into
                     
                     *The Americans usually play the four-ball game, scoring the losing hazards
                        against the party making them.
                   German, French,
                  and Spanish literature; particularly the last, where he had it all his own way;
                  still he did not abstain from bringing in a little classical allusion when an
                  obvious opportunity afforded itself. And generally he was sedulous to say smart
                  things, and tell good stories. In all which matters, except pedestrianism, his
                  wife imitated, or, it would be more correct to say, surpassed him; for she had
                  more art of concealing her art, and her efforts were less obvious. The couple were
                  never at a loss, never dull, never uninteresting, and, withal, showed such good
                  nature and sincere desire to make their guest at home, that in three days
                  Ashburner felt as if he had known them all his life.
               The knowledge that Harry Masters had a friend from abroad stopping with him, was
                  the signal for letting loose all the hospitality of the neighbourhood—not a very
                  large neighbourhood so for as it concerned Masters, though his country
                  acquaintance was somewhat less select than his town set. Small as it was,
                  Ashburner received invitations enough in that week to have lasted him two months,
                  and some of them without the formality of a previous introduction. He dined and
                  supped in all directions; but all his entertainers, though equally hospitable, did
                  not make so favourable an impression on him as his original host had done. The
                  younger men were mostly merchants, who came up daily from the city by a late
                  train; the older, retired bankers, who still amused themselves by little
                  speculations. Their talk was of wines and the stock-market, with an occasional
                  cross of trotting-horse. It was at one of their tables, that Ashburner learned
                  (what Harry himself had with difficulty refrained from telling him) that Masters
                  once, as a great favour, let a rich Southerner have some half-dozen bottles of the
                  Vanderlyn Sercial at twenty-five dollars per bottle. The women pleased him more;
                  most of the daughters were pretty, and some of the mothers retained beauty enough
                  to convince him that all American women do not grow old at thirty.
                  Both mothers and daughters were always ready to keep up the conversation, never
                  leaving him to make the running, as a sporting man might phrase it, but evidently
                  considering it their duty to try to amuse the stranger. When Ashburner next wrote
                  to his respected governor, he did not deem it unpatriotic, or beneath his dignity,
                  to admit that he had passed one of the pleasant weeks in his life under the roof
                  of his old Heidelberg acquaintance, Henry Masters.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IV.
               LIFE AT A WATERING-PLACE—ACCIDENTS; WILL HAPPEN.
               'HURRAH, old fellow!' shouted Ashburner's host, on the seventh morning of his
                  visit; 'here's a letter from Carl. I have been expecting it, and he has been
                  expecting us, some time. So prepare yourself to start to-morrow.'
               'He can't have been expecting me, you know,' suggested the guest,
                  who, though remarkably domesticated for so short a time, hardly felt himself yet
                  entitled to be considered one of the family.
               'Oh, us means Clara, and myself, and baby, and any friends we choose
                  to bring,—or, I should say, who will do us the honour to accompany us. We are
                  hospitable people, and the more the merrier. I know how much house-room Carl has;
                  there's always a prophet's chamber, as the persons call it, for such occasions.
                  You must come; there's no two ways about that. You will see two very
                  fine women there,—nice persons, as you would say: my sisters-in-law,
                  Miss Vanderlyn, and Mrs. Carl Masters.'
               'But, at any rate, would it not be better to write first, and apprize him of the
                  additional visitor?'
               'We should be there a week before our letter. Ecoutez! There is no post-office near us here, and my note would
                  have to go to the city by a special messenger. Then the offices along the Hudson
                  are perfectly antediluvian and barbarous, and mere mockery and delusion. Observe,
                  I speak of the small local posts; on the main routes letters travel fast enough.
                  You may send one to Albany in nine hours; to Carl's place, which is abut
                  two-thirds of the distance to Albany, it would take more than half as many
                  days,—if, indeed, it arrived at all. I remember once propounding this problem in
                  the Blunder and Bluster
                  :—'If a letter sent from New York to Hastings, distance 22 miles,
                  never gets there, how long will it take one to go from New York to Red Hook,
                  distance 110 miles?' We are shockingly behind you in our postal arrangements;
                     there I give up the country. 'No, you mustn't write, but come
                  yourself,' as Penelope said to Ulysses.'
               Ashburner made no further opposition, and they were off the next morning
                  accordingly. Before four a cart had started with the baggage,*
                   and directions to take up Ashburner's trunks and man-servant on the way.
                  Soon after, the coachman and groom departed with the saddle-horses, trotters, and
                  wagon; for Masters, meditating some months' absence, took with him the whole of
                  his stud, except the black colt, who was strongly principled against going on the
                  water, and had nearly succeeded in breaking his master's neck on one occasion,
                  when Harry insisted on his embarking. The long-tailed bays were left harnessed to
                  the Rockaway,—a sort of light omnibus open at the sides, very like a
                     char-à-banc, except that the seats run
                  crosswise, and capable of accommodating from six to nine persons: that morning it
                  held six, including the maid and nurse. Masters took the
                     
                     *An American never uses the conversational term luggage, but
                        always speaks of his impediments as baggage.
                   reins at a quarter-past five, and as the steamboat
                  dock was situated at the very southern extremity of the city, and they had three
                  miles of terrible pavement to traverse, besides nearly twelve of road, he arrived
                  there just seven minutes before seven; at which hour, to the second, the good boat
                  Swallow was to take wing. In a twinkling the horses were unharnessed and embarked;
                  the carriage instantly followed them; and Harry, after assuring himself that all
                  his property, animate and inanimate, was safely shipped, had still time to
                  purchase, for his own and his friend's edification, the Jacobin,
                  the Blunder and Bluster, the Inexpressible, and
                  other popular papers, which an infinity of dirty boys were crying at the top of
                  their not very harmonious voices.
               'Our people do business pretty fast,' said he in a somewhat triumphant tone. 'How
                  this would astonish them on the Continent! See there!' as a family, still later
                  than his own, arrived with a small mountain of trunks, all of which made their way
                  on board as if they had wings. 'When I travelled in Germany two years ago with
                  Mrs. M. and her sister we had eleven packages, and it used to take half an hour at
                  every place to weigh and ticket them beforehand, notwithstanding which one or two
                  would get lost every now and then. In my own country I have travelled in all
                  directions with large parties, never have been detained five minutes for baggage,
                  and never lost anything except once—an umbrella. Now we are going.'
               The mate cried, 'All ashore!' the newsboys and apple-venders disappeared; the
                  planks were drawn in; the long, spidery walking-beam began to play, and the
                  Swallow had started with her five hundred passengers.
               'Let us stroll around the boat; I want to show you how we get up these things
                  here.'
               The ladies' cabin on deck and the two general cabins below were magnificently
                  furnished with the most expensive material, and in the last Parisian style, and
                  this display and luxury were the more remarkable as the fare was but twelve
                  shillings for a hundred and sixty miles. Ashburner admitted that the furniture was
                  very elegant, but thought it out of place, and altogether too fine for the
                  purpose.
               'So you would say, probably, that the profuse and varied dinner we shall have is
                  thrown away on the majority of the passengers, who bolt it in half-an-hour. But
                  there are some who habitually appreciate the dinner, and the furniture: it does
                  them good, and it does the others no harm,—nay, it does them good,
                  too. The wild man from the West, who has but recently learned to walk on his hind
                  legs, is dazzled with these sofas and mirrors, and respects them more than he
                  would more ordinary furniture. At any rate, it's a fault on the right side. The
                  furniture of an English hotel is enough to give a traveller a fit of the blues,
                  such an extreme state of fustiness it is sure to be in. Did it ever strike you, by
                  the way, how behindhand your countrymen are in the matter of hotels? When a
                  traveller passes from England into Belgium (putting france out of the question) it
                  is like going from Purgatory into Paradise.'
               'I don't think I ever staid at a London hotel.'
               'Of course not; when your governor was out of town, and you not with him, you had
                  your club. This is exactly what all travellers in England complain of. Everything
                  for the exclusive use of the natives is good—except the water, and of that you
                  don't use much in the way of a beverage; everything particularly tending to the
                  comfort of strangers and sojourners—as the hotels, for instance, is bad, dear, and
                  uncomfortable. I don't think
                  you like to have foreigners among you, for your arrangements are calculated to
                  drive them out of the country as fast as possible!'
               'Perhaps we don't, as a general principle,' said Ashburner, smiling.
               'Well, I won't say that it is not the wisest policy. We have suffered much by
                  being too liberal to foreigners. But then you must not be surprised at what they
                  say about you. However, it is not worth while to lose the view for our discussion.
                  Come up-stairs and take a good look at the river of rivers.'
               Ashburner felt no disposition to deny the beauty and grandeur of the Hudson. At
                  first the shore was lined with beetling ramparts of traprock. After many miles of
                  this, the clear water spread out into a great lake with apparently no egress. But
                  on turning a promontory, the river stretched away nearly as wide as before, under
                  wooded cliffs not dissimilar to those of the Rhine. Then came the picturesque
                  Catskill mountains; and near these Harry was to stop, but Ashburner did not stop
                  with him. At West Point the boat had taken up, among other passengers, two young
                  officers of his acquaintance, then quartered in Canada. They were going to take
                  the tour of the lakes, including, of course, Niagara, and offered Ashburner, if he
                  would accompany them on this excursion first, to show him the lions of Canada
                  afterwards. On consulting with Masters, he found that the trip would not occupy
                  more than a month or five weeks, and that after that time the watering-place
                  season would be at its height.
               'And it will be an excuse for my staying with Carl till August,' Harry continued.
                  'The women are half crazy to be at Oldport already. I would rather stay at
                  Ravenswood. We shall expect you there at the end of
                     Ashburner's Introduction to benson.
                  
                   July. But,' and here, for the first time
                  since their acquaintance, Ashburner perceived a slight embarrassment in his
                  manner, 'don't bring your friends.'
               'Oh, dear, no!' said Ashburner, not comprehending what could have put such a thing
                  into the other's head, or what was coming next.
               'I don't mean to Ravenswood, but to Oldport; that is, if you can help their
                  coming. To tell you the truth, your university men, and literary men generally,
                  are popular enough here, but your army is in very bad odour. The young fellows who
                  come down among us 
                     frnm
                     from
                   Canada behave shockingly. They don't act like gentlemen or
                  Christians.'
               Ashburner hastened to assure him that Captain Blank and Lieutenant Dash were both
                  gentlemen and Christians, in the ordinary acceptation of the terms, and had never
                  been known to misconduct themselves in any way.
               'Doubtless, inasmuch as they are your friends, but the general principle remains
                  the same. So many of your young officers have misconducted themselves, that the
                     primâ facie evidence is always against one of
                  them, and he stands a chance of being coolly treated.'
               Ashburner wanted to know what the young officers had done.
               'Everything they could do to go counter to the habits and prejudices of the people
                  among whom they were, and to show their contempt of American society; to act, in
                  short, as if they were among uncivilized people. For instance, it is a custom at
                  these watering-place hotels, to dress for the table-d'hôte. Now I do not think it altogether reasonable that a man
                  should be expected to make his evening toilette by three in the afternoon, and,
                  indeed, I do not strictly conform to the rule myself. But these men came in flannel shirts and dirty
                  shoes, and altogether in a state unfit for ladies' company. Perhaps, however, we
                  were too fastidious in this. But what do you say to a youngster's seating himself
                  upon a piano in the public parlour, while a lady is playing on it?'
               Ashburner allowed that it was rather unceremonious.
               'By various similar acts, trivial, perhaps, individually, but forming a very
                  disagreeable aggregate, these young men made themselves so unpopular, that one
                  season the ladies, by common consent, refused to dance with any of them. But there
                  is worse behind. These gentlemen, so stupid in a drawing-room, are sharp enough in
                  borrowing money, and altogether oblivious of repaying it.'
               Ashburner remembered the affair of Ensign Lawless, and made up his mind to undergo
                  another repetition of it.
               'I don't speak of my individual case; the thing has happened fifty times. I could
                  tell of a dozen friends who have been victimized in this way during the last three
                  years. In fact, I believe that your jeunes
                     militaires have formed a league to avenge the Mississippi
                  bondholders, and recover their lost money under the form of these nominal loans.
                  You may think it poetic justice, but we New-Yorkers have no fancy to pay the
                  Mississippians' debts in this way.'
               It would be foreign to our present purpose to accompany Ashburner in his
                  Northwestern and Canadian tour. Suffice it to say, that he returned by the first
                  of August, very much pleased, having seen many things well worth seeing, and
                  experienced no particular annoyance, except the one predicted by Masters, that he
                  sometimes had to take care of his servant. Neither, shall we say much
                  of his visit to Ravenswood, where, indeed, he only spent a few hours, arriving
                  there in the morning and leaving it in the afternoon of the same day, and had
                  merely time to partake of a capital lunch, and to remark that his entertainer had
                  a beautiful place and a handsome wife, and was something like his younger brother,
                  but more resembling an Englishman than any American he had yet seen.
               The party to Oldport was increased by the addition of Miss Vanderlyn, a tall,
                  stylish girl, more striking than her sister, but less delicately beautiful. Though
                  past twenty, she had been out only one season, having been kept back three years
                  by various accidents. But though new to society, she had nothing of the
                  book-muslin timidity about her; nor was she at all abashed by the presence of the
                  titled foreigner. On the contrary, she addressed him with perfect ease of manner,
                  in French, professing, as an apology for conversing in that language, a fear that
                  he might not be able to understand her English,—Parce que
                     chez vous, on dit que nous autres Américaines, ne parlons pas l' Anglais comme
                     il faut.'
               As we are not writing a handbook or geographical account of the Northern States,
                  it will not be necessary to mention where the fashionable watering-place of
                  Oldport Springs is situated—not even what State it is in; suffice it to say, that
                  from Carl Masters' place thither was a day's journey, performed partly by
                  steamboat, partly by rail, and the last forty miles by stagecoach, or as the
                  Americans say, 'for shortness,' by stage. The water portion of their journey was
                  soon over, nor did Ashburner much regret it, for he had been over this part of the
                  route before on his way to Canada, and the river is not remarkable beautiful above
                  the Catskill range.
               
               On taking the cars, Masters seized the opportunity to enlighten his friend with a
                  quantity of railroad statistics and gossip, such as, that the American trains
                  averaged eighteen miles an hour, including stoppages,—about two miles short of the
                  steam-boat average; that they cost about one-fifth of an English road, or a dollar
                  for a pound, which accounted for their deficiency in some respects; that there
                  were more than seven thousand miles of railroad in the country; that there was no
                  division of first, second, and third class, but that some lines had ladies'
                  cars—that is to say, cars for the gentlemen with ladies, and the ladies without
                  gentlemen—and some had separate cars for the ladies and gentlemen of colour; that
                  there had been some attempts to get up smoking-cars after the German fashion, but
                  the public mind was not yet fully prepared for it; that one of the southern lines
                  had tried the experiment of introducing a restaurant, and other conveniences, with tolerable success; and
                  other facts of more or less interest. Ashburner, for his part, on examining his
                  ticket, found upon the back of it a list of all the stations on the route, with
                  their times and distances—a very convenient arrangement; and he was also much
                  amused at the odd names of some of the stations—Nineveh, Pompey, Africa, Cologne,
                  and others equally incongruous.
               'Don't be afraid of laughing,' said Masters, who guessed what he was smiling at.
                  'Whenever I am detained at a country tavern, if there duly happens to be a
                  good-sized map of the United States there, I have enough to amuse me in studying
                  the different styles of names in the different sections of the Union—different in
                  style, but alike in impropriety. In our State, as you know, the fashion is for
                  classical and oriental names. In New England there is a goodly amount of old
                  English appellations, but often sadly misapplied; for instance, an inland town
                  will be called Falmouth, or Oldport, like the place we are going to.' The
                  aboriginal names, often very harmonious, had been generally displaced, except in
                  Maine, where they are particularly long and jaw-breaking, such as Winnipiscogger and Chargogagog. Still we have some very pretty
                  Indian names left in New-York; Ontario, for instance, and Oneida, and Niagara, which you who have been there know
                  is 
                     
                        Pronounced Niágara,
                        To rhyme with staggerer,
                        And not Nigaára,
                        To rhyme with starer.'
                     
                  
               
               'What does Niagara mean?'
               'Broken water, I believe; but one gets so many different meanings
                  for these names, from those who profess to know more or less about the native
                  dialects, that you can never be certain. For instance, a great many will tell you,
                  on Chateaubriand's authority, that Mississippi means Father of waters. Some years ago, one of our Indian scholars stated that this
                  was an error; that the literal meaning of Mississippi was old-big-strong—not quite so poetic an appellation. I asked Albert Gallatin about
                  it at the time—he was considered our best man on such subjects—and he told me that
                  the word, or words, for the name is made up of two, signified the entire
                     river. This is a fair specimen of the answers you get. I never had the
                  same explanation of an Indian name given me by two men who pretended to understand
                  the Indian languages.'
               'What rule does a gentleman adopt in naming his country-seat when he acquires a
                  new one, or is there any rule?'
               
               'There are two natural and proper expedients, one to take the nearest aboriginal
                  name that is pretty and practicable, the other to adopt the name from some natural
                  feature. Of this latter we have two very neat examples in the residences of our
                  two greatest statesmen, Clay and Webster, which are called Ashland
                  and Marshfield—appellations exactly descriptive of the places. But
                  very often mere fancy names are adopted, and frequently in the worst possible
                  taste, by people too who have great taste in other respects. I wanted my brother
                  to call this place Carlsruhe—that would have been literally appropriate, though
                  sounding oddly at first. But as it belonged originally to his father-in-law, it
                  seemed but fair that his wife should have the naming of it, and she was
                     so fond of the Bride of Lammermoor! Well, I hope Carl will set up
                  a few crows some day, just to give a little colour to the name. But, after all,
                  what's in the name? We are to stop at Constantinople; if they give us a good
                  supper and bed there (and they will unless the hotel is much altered for the worse
                  within two years), they may call the town Beelzebub for me.'
               But Masters reckoned without his host. They were fated to pass the night, not at
                  Constantinople, but at the rising village of Hardscrabble, consisting of a large
                  hotel and a small blacksmith's shop.
               The contretemps happened in this wise. The
                  weather was very hot—it always is from the middle of June to the middle of
                  September—but this day had been particularly sultry, and towards evening oppressed
                  nature found relief in a thunder-storm, and such a storm! Ashburner, though
                  anything but a nervous man, was not without some anxiety, and the ladies were in a
                  sad fright; particularly Mrs. Masters, who threatened hysterics, and required a
                  large expenditure of Cologne and caresses to bring her round. At last the train
                  came to a full stop at Hardscrabble, about thirty-six miles on the wrong side of
                  Constantinople. Even before the usual three minutes' halt was over our travellers
                  suspected some accident; their suspicions were confirmed when the three minutes
                  extended to ten, and ultimately the conductor announced that just beyond this
                  station half-a-mile of the road had been literally washed away, so that further
                  progress was impossible. Fortunately by this time the rain had so far abated that
                  the passengers were able to pass from the shelter of the cars (there was no
                  covered way at the station) to that of the spacious hotel stoop
                  without being very much wetted. Masters recollected that there was a canal at no
                  great distance, which, though comparatively disused since the establishment of the
                  railroad, still had some boats on it, and he thought it probable that they might
                  finish their journey in this way—not a very comfortable or expeditious one, but
                  better than standing still. It appeared, however, on inquiry, that the canal was
                  also put hors de combat by the weather, and
                  nothing was to be done that way. Only two courses remained, either to go back to
                  Clinton from which they had started, or to remain for the night where they
                  were.
               'This hotel ought to be able to accommodate us all,' remarked a fellow-passenger
                  near them.
               He might well say so. The portico under which they stood (built of the purest
                  white pine, and modelled after that of a Grecian temple with eight columns)
                  fronted at least eighty feet. The house was several stories high, and, if the
                  front were anything more than a mere shell, must contain rooms for two hundred
                  persons. How the building came into its present situation was a mystery to
                  Ashburner; it looked as if it had been transported bodily from some large town, and set down alone in
                  the wilderness. The probability is, that some speculators, judging from certain
                  signs that a town was likely to arise there soon, had built the hotel so as to be
                  all ready for it.
               There was no need to question the landlord: he had already been diligently
                  assuring every one that he could accommodate all the passengers, who indeed did
                  not exceed a hundred in number.
               
                  
                     Logicans
                     Logicians
                   tell us, that a great deal of the trouble and misunderstanding which
                  exists in this naughty world, arises from men not defining their terms in the
                  outset. The landlord of Hardscrabble had evidently some peculiar ideas of his own
                  as to the meaning of the term accommodate. The real state of the
                  case was, that he had any quantity of rooms, and a tolerably liberal supply of
                  bedsteads, but his stock of bedding was by no means in proportion; and he was,
                  therefore, compelled to multiply it by process of division, giving the hair
                  mattress to one, the feather bed to another, the straw bed to a third; and so with
                  the pillows and bolsters as far as they would go. This was rather a long process,
                  even with American activity, especially as some of the hands employed were
                  temporarily called off to attend to the supper table.
               The meal, which was prepared and eaten with great promptitude, was a mixture of
                  tea and supper. Very good milk, pretty good tea, and pretty bad coffee,
                  represented the drinkables; and for solids, there was a plentiful provision of
                  excellent bread and butter, new cheese, dried beef in very thin slices, or rather
                     chips, gingerbread, dough-nuts, and other varieties of homemade
                  cake, sundry preserves, and some pickles. The waiters were young women—some of
                  them very pretty and lady-like. The Masters kept up a conversation with each other
                  and Ashburner in French, which he suspected to be a customary practice of 'our
                  set' when in public, as indeed it was, and one which tended not a little to make
                  them unpopular. A well-dressed man opposite looked so fiercely at them, that the
                  Englishman thought he might have partially comprehended their discourse and taken
                  an offence at it, till he was in a measure re-assured by seeing him eat pound-cake
                  and cheese together—a singularity of taste about which he could not help making a
                  remark to Masters.
               'Oh, that's nothing,' said Harry. 'Did you never, when you were on the lakes, see
                  them eat ham and molasses? It is said to be a western practice: I never was there;
                  but I'll tell you what I have seen. A man with cake, cheese,
                  smoked-beef, and preserves, all on his plate together, and paying attention to
                  them indiscriminately. He was not an American either, but a Creole Frenchman of
                  New Orleans, who had travelled enough to know better.'
               Soon after supper most of the company seemed inclined bedwards; but there were no
                  signs of beds for some time. Masters' party, who were more amused than fatigued by
                  their evening's experience, spread the carpet of resignation, and lit the cigar of
                  philosophy. All the passengers did not take it so quietly. One tall,
                  melancholy-faced man, who looked as if he required twice the ordinary amount of
                  sleep, was especially anxious to know 'where they were going to put him.'
               'Don't be afraid, sir,' said the landlord, as he shot across the room on some
                  errand; 'we'll tell you before you go to bed.' With which safe prediction the
                  discontented one was fain to content himself.
               At length, about ten, or half past, the rooms began to be in readiness, and their
                  occupants to be marched off to them in
                  squads of six or eight at a time,—the long corridors and tall staircases of the
                  hotel requiring considerable pioneering and guidance. Masters' party came among
                  the last. Having examined the room assigned to the ladies, Harry reported it to
                  contain one bed and half a washstand; from which he and Ashburner had some
                  misgivings as to their own accommodation, but were not exactly prepared for what
                  followed, when a small boy with a tallow candle and face, escorted them up three
                  flights of stairs into a room containing two small beds and a large spittoon, and
                  not another single article of furniture.
               'I say, boy!' quoth Masters, in much dudgeon, turning to their chamberlain,
                  'suppose we want to wash in the morning, what are we to do?'
               'I don't know, sir,' answered the boy; and depositing the candle on the floor, he
                  disappeared in the darkness.
               'By Jove!' ejaculated the fastidious youth, 'there isn't as much as a hook in the
                  wall to hang one's coat on. It's lucky we brought up our carpet-bags with us, else
                  we should have to look out a clean spot on the floor for our clothes.'
               Ashburner was not very much disconcerted. He had travelled in so many countries,
                  notwithstanding his youth, that he could pass his nights anyhow. In fact he had
                  never been at a loss for sleep in his life, except on one occasion, when, in
                  Galway, a sofa was assigned to him at one side of a small parlour, on the other
                  side of which three Irish gentlemen were making a night of it.
               So they said their prayers, and went to bed, like good boys. But their slumbers
                  were not unbroken. Ashburner dreamed that he was again in Venice, and that the
                  musquitoes of that delightful city, of whose venomousness ousness and assiduity he
                  retained shuddering recollections, were making an onslaught upon him in great
                  numbers; while Masters awoke towards morning with a great outcry: in apology for
                  which he solemnly assured his friend, that two seconds before he was in South
                  Africa, where a lion of remarkable size and ferocity had caught him by the leg.
                  And on rising, they discovered some spots of blood on the bed-clothes, showing
                  that their visions had not been altogether without foundation in reality.
               The Hardscrabble hotel, grand in its general outlines, had overlooked the trifling
                  details of wash-stands and chamber crockery. Such of these articles as it
                     did possess, were very properly devoted to the use of the ladies;
                  and accordingly Ashburner and Masters, and forty-five more, performed their
                  matutinal ablutions over a tin 
                     bason
                     basin
                   in the bar-room, where Harry astonished the natives by the production of
                  his own particular towel and pocket-comb. The weather had cleared up beautifully,
                  the railroad was repaired, and the train ready to start as soon as breakfast was
                  over. After this meal, as miscellaneous as their last night's supper, while the
                  passengers were discharging their reckoning, Ashburner noticed that his friend was
                  unusually fussy and consequential, asked several questions, and made several
                  remarks in a loud tone, and altogether seemed desirous of attracting attention.
                  When it came to his turn to pay, he told out the amount, not in the ordinary dirty
                  bills, but in hard, ringing half-dollars, which had the effect of drawing still
                  further notice upon him.
               'Five dollars and a quarter,' said Masters, in a measured and audible tone; 'and,
                  landlord, here's a quarter extra.'
               The landlord looked up in surprise; so did the two or three men standing nearest
                  Harry.
               
               'It's to buy beef with, to feed 'em. Feed 'em well now, don't forget!'
               'Feed 'em! feed who?' and the host looked as if he thought his customer crazy.
               'Feed who? Why, look here!' and bending over the counter, Harry
                  uttered a portentous monosyllable, in a pretended whisper, but really as audible
                  to the bystanders as a stage aside. Three or four of those nearest exploded.
               'Yes, feed 'em well before you put anybody into your beds again, or
                  you'll have to answer for the death of a fellow-christian some day, that's all.
                  Good morning!' And taking his wife under his arm, Masters stalked off to the cars
                  with a patronising farewell nod, amid a sympathetic roar, leaving the host
                  irresolute whether to throw a decanter after him, or to join in the general
                  laugh.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               LIFE AT A WATERING-PLACE—OLDPORT SPRINGS.
               'HOLD on a minute,' said Harry, as they were about to take the stage, after a very
                  fair three-o'clock dinner at Constantinople (the Occidental, not the Oriental city
                  of that name); 'there goes an acquaintance of ours whom you must know. He has
                  arrived by the Westfield train, doubtless.'
               Away sped Masters after the acquaintance, arm-in-arm with whom he shortly
                  returned, and with all the exultation of an American who has brought two lions
                  into the same cage, introduced M. le Vicomte Vincent Le Roi to the Hon. Edward
                  Ashburner.
               Ashburner was rather puzzled at Le Roi, whose personal appearance did not in any
                  way answer either to his originally conceived idea of a Frenchman, or to the live
                  specimens he had thus far met with. The Vicomte looked more like an Englishman, or
                  perhaps like the very best kind of Irishman. He was a middle-sized man of thirty
                  or thereabout, with brown hair and a florid complexion; and very quietly dressed,
                  his clothes being neither obtrusively new nor cut with any ultra-artistic
                  pretension. Except his wearing a moustache and (of course) not speaking English,
                  there was nothing continental about his outward man, or the first impression he
                  gave of himself. Fortunately, he was also bound for the springs, so that Ashburner would have abundant
                  opportunity to study his character, if so disposed.
               The stage in which our tourists were to embark was not unlike a French diligence,
                  except that it had but one compartment instead of three; in which compartment
                  there were three seats, and on each seat more or less room for three persons, and
                  two more could sit with the driver. All the baggage was carried on the top. The
                  springs were made like coach springs, or C-springs, as they are always called in
                  America (just as in England a pilot-coat is called a P-jacket), only they were
                  upright and perpendicular to the axeltree instead of curving; and the leathern
                  belts connected with them, on which the carriage swung, were of the thickest and
                  toughest description. As the party, with the addition of Le Roi, amounted to
                  eight, Masters managed, by a little extra expenditure of tin and trouble, to
                  secure the whole of one vehicle, and for the still greater accommodation of the
                  ladies and child, the gentlemen were to sit on the box, two at a time by turns.
                  Masters' first object was to get hold of the reins, for which end he began
                  immediately to talk around the driver about things in general. From the price of
                  horses they diverged to the prospects of various kinds of business, and thence
                  slap into the politics of the country. The driver was a stubborn Locofoco, and
                  Masters did not disdain to enter into an elaborate argument with him. Ashburner,
                  who then occupied the other box seat, was astonished at the man's statistical
                  knowledge, the variety of information he possessed upon local topics, and his
                  accurate acquaintance with the government and institutions of his country. It
                  occurred to him to prompt Masters, through the convenient medium of French, to
                  sound him about England and European politics. This Harry did, not immediately,
                  lest he might suspect the purport of their conversational interlude, but by a
                  dexterous approach to the point after sufficient preliminary; and it then appeared
                  that he had lumped 'the despotic powers of the old world' in a heap together, and
                  supposed the Queen of England to be on a par with the Czar of Russia as regarded
                  her personal authority and privileges. However, when Masters set him right as to
                  the difference between a limited and an absolute monarchy, he took the information
                  in very good part, listened to it attentively, and evidently made a mental note of
                  it for future reference.
               The four-horse team was a good strong one, but the stage with its load heavy
                  enough, and the roads, after the recent storm, still heavier, besides being a
                  succession of hills. The best they could do was to make six miles an hour, and
                  they would not have made three but for a method of travelling down hill, entirely
                  foreign to European ideas on the subject. When they arrived at the summit there
                  was no talk of putting on the drag, nor any drag to put on, but away the horses
                  went, first at a rapid trot, and soon at full gallop; by which means the equipage
                  acquired sufficient momentum to carry it part of the way up the next hill before
                  the animals relapsed into the slow walk which the steepness of the ascent imposed
                  upon them. Indeed, this part of the route would have been a very tedious one (for
                  the country about was almost entirely devoid of interest), had it not been for Le
                  Roi, who came out in great force. He laughed at everything and with everybody;
                  told stories, and good ones, continuously, and only ceased telling stories to
                  break forth into song. In fine, he amused the ladies so much that when he took his
                  turn on the box they missed him immediately, and sent Masters outside again on the
                  first opportunity; whereat the Vicomte, being very much flattered, waxed livelier and merrier
                  than ever, and kept up a constant fire of jest and ditty. As to Ashburner, who had
                  a great liking for fresh air, and an equal horror of a small child in a
                  stage-coach, he remained outside the whole time; for which the fair passengers set
                  him down as an insensible youth, who did not know how to appreciate good company:
                  until the evening becoming somewhat chilly by comparison with the very hot day
                  they had undergone, both he and Harry took refuge in the interior, and a very
                  jolly party they all made.
               While they were outside together, Masters had been giving Ashburner some details
                  about Le Roi—in fact, a succinct biography of him; for be it noted, that every
                  New-Yorker is able to produce off-hand a minute history of every person, native or
                  foreign, at all known in society: for which ability he is indebted partly to the
                  inquisitive habits of the people, partly to their communicative disposition,
                  partly to their remarkable memory of small particulars, and partly to a fine
                  imagination and power of invention, which must be experienced to be fully
                  appreciated. Masters, we say, had been telling his friend the story of his other
                  friend or acquaintance; how he was of good family and no fortune; how he had
                  written three novels and three thousand or more feuilletons; how he had travelled into some out-of-the-way part of
                  Poland, where no one had ever been before or since, and about which he was,
                  therefore, at liberty to say what he pleased; how, besides his literary
                  capabilities, such as they were, he played, and sang, and danced, and sketched—all
                  very well for an amateur; how he was altogether a very agreeable and entertaining
                  man, and, as such, was supposed to have been sent out by a sort of mutual-benefit
                  subscription-club, which existed at Paris for the purpose of marrying its members
                  to heiresses in different countries. Ashburner had once heard rumours of such a
                  club in Germany, but was never able to obtain any authentic details concerning it,
                  or to determine whether it was anything more than a traveller's traditionary
                  legend. Even Masters was at fault here, and, indeed, he seemed rather to tell the
                  club part of the story as a good joke than to believe it seriously himself.
               As they approached the termination of their journey, their talk naturally turned
                  more and more on the Springs. The Vicomte was in possession of the latest advices
                  thence; the arrivals and expected arrivals, and the price-current of stock; that
                  is, of marriageable young gentlemen, and all other matters of gossip; how the
                  whole family of the Robinsons was there in full force, with an unlimited amount of
                  Parisian millinery; how Gerard Ludlow was driving four-in-hand, and Löwenberg had
                  given his wife no end of jewelry; how Mrs. Harrison, who ought not to have been
                  (not being of our set), nevertheless was the great lioness of the
                  season; how Miss Thompson, the belle expectant, had renounced the Springs
                  altogether, and shut herself up at home somewhere among the mountains—all for
                  unrequited love of Hamilton Bell, as was charitably reported; last, but not least,
                  how Tom Edwards had invented six new figures for the German cotillon. Ashburner
                  did not at first altogether understand the introduction of this personage into
                  such good company, supposing from his familiar abbreviation and Terpsichorean
                  attributes, that he must be the fashionable dancing-master of Oldport, or perhaps
                  of New York; but he was speedily given to understand that, on the contrary, Mr.
                  Edwards was a gay bachelor of good family and large fortune, who, in addition to
                  gambling, intriguing, and other pleasant propensities, had an insatiable passion for the dance, and was
                  accustomed to rotate morning, noon, and night, whenever he was not gambling,
                  &c. as aforesaid. 'And,' continued Masters, 'I'll lay you any bet you please,
                  that the first thing we see on arriving at our hotel will be Tom Edwards dancing
                  the Polka; unless, indeed, he happen to be dancing the Redowa.'
               'Very likely,' said Mrs. Masters, 'seeing we shall arrive there at ten o'clock,
                  and this is a ball night.'
               Both Harry and his wife were right; they arrived at half-past ten, just as the
                  ball was getting into full swing. On the large portico in front of the large hotel
                  opened a large room, with large windows down to the floor,—the dining-room of the
                  establishment, now cleared for dancing purposes. All the idlers of Oldport, male
                  and female, black and white, congregated at these windows and thronged the
                  portico; and almost into the very midst of this crowd our party was shot, baggage
                  and all. While Ashburner was looking out of a confused heap of people and luggage,
                  he heard one of the assistant loafers say to another, 'Look at Mr. Edwards!'
                  Profiting by the information not originally intended for him, he followed the
                  direction of the speaker's nose, and beheld a little showily-dressed man flying
                  down the room with a large showily-dressed woman, going the poursuite of the Redowa at a terrific rate. So that,
                  literally, the first thing he saw in Oldport was Tom Edwards dancing. But there
                  was no opportunity to make a further study of this, 'one of the most remarkable
                  men among us,' for the party had to look up their night quarters. Masters had
                  dispatched in advance to Mr. Grabster, proprietor of the Bath Hotel at Oldport
                  Springs, a very particular letter, stating the number of his party, the time he
                  meant to be there, and the number of rooms he wanted, and had also sent his horses
                  on ahead; but though the animals had arrived safe and found stable-room, there was
                  no preparation for their master. Ashburner, at the request of the ladies, followed
                  Masters into the office (for the Bath Hotel being, nominally at least, the first
                  house in the place, had its bar-room and office separate), and found Harry in
                  earnest expostulation with a magnificently-dressed individual, whom he took for
                  Mr. Grabster himself, but who turned out to be only that high and mighty
                  gentleman's head bookkeeper. The letter had been dispatched so long beforehand,
                  that, even at the rate of American country posts, it ought to have arrived, but no
                  one knew anything about it. Both the young men suspected—uncharitably, perhaps,
                  but not altogether unnaturally—that Mr. Grabster and his aids, finding a prospect
                  of a full season, had not thought it worth their while to trouble themselves about
                  the application, or to keep any rooms. Ashburner suggested trying another hotel,
                  but the roads were muddy and vehicles scarce at that time of night, so that
                  altogether there seemed a strong probability of their being compelled to 'camp
                  out' on the portico. But it was not in Masters to 'give it up so.' He possessed,
                  as we have already hinted, that faculty so alarmingly common in his country, which
                  polite people call oratory, and vulgar people the 'gift of the gab;' and he was
                  not the man to throw away the opportunity of turning any of his gifts to account.
                  Warming with his subject, he poured out upon the gorgeously-attired Mr. Black such
                  a flood of conciliatory and expostulatory eloquence that that gentleman absolutely
                  contrived to find some accommodation for them. The ladies, child, and servants
                  were bundled together into one tolerably large room, in the third story. Masters
                  had a sort of corner-cupboard in the fourth, that might, perhaps, have accommodated a mouse with
                  a small family; and to Ashburner and Le Roi were assigned two small chambers in
                  the fifth. As to the baggage, that was all piled up in the office, with the
                  exception of a few indispensable articles. Supper was out of the question, there
                  being no room to eat it in because of the dancers. The ladies did not want supper;
                  they only regretted not being able to unpack their trunks and dress for the ball
                  then and there going on: their eyes lighted up at the sound of the music, and
                  their little feet began to beat the floor incontinently. The gentlemen took a
                  drink all round by way of substitute for something more solid. Ashburner had
                  mounted to his dormitory—no small journey—and was sitting on his bed, wishing he
                  had some contrivance for pulling off all his clothes at once without the trouble
                  of removing them piece by piece, when he heard in the passage the voice of Le Roi,
                     quantum matatus ab illo! The Vicomte had
                  sworn up all his own language, and was displaying a knowledge of English
                  expletives that quite surprised his fellow-traveller. On investigation, the cause
                  of his wrath proved to be this. A semi-civilized Irish waiter had shown him to No.
                  296, in accordance with Mr. Black's directions. But Mr. Black, in the multiplicity
                  of his affairs, had forgotten that No. 296 was already tenanted, to wit, by a
                  Western traveller, who did, indeed, intend to quit it by an early stage next
                  morning, but had not the least idea of giving up his quarters before that time;
                  and accordingly, as if from a presentiment that some attempt would be made to
                  dislodge him, had, in addition to the ordinary not very strong fastenings of the
                  door, so barricaded it with trunks and furniture, that it could have stood a
                  considerable amount of siege. The waiter had gone off, leaving Le Roi to shift for
                  himself. Bells were scarce in the upper stories of the Bath Hotel, nor was there
                  any light throughout the long corridor except the one tallow candle which his
                  useless guide had deposited on the floor. Utterly upset at the idea of having to
                  tramp down four pair of stairs and back again in search of accommodation, the
                  unlucky Gaul was seeking a momentary relief in the manner above stated, when
                  Ashburner came to the rescue. His bed happened to be rather a large one—so large,
                  comparatively, that it was a mystery how it had ever found its way into the little
                  room, the four walls of which seemed to have grown or been built around it; and
                  this bed he instantly proposed to share with Le Roi for the night. The Frenchman
                     merciéd, and couldn't thing of such a thing
                  for five minutes, edging into the room and pulling off his coat and boots all the
                  time; then he gave an exemplification of cessante
                     causa, for all his rage vanished in a moment, and he was the same
                  exuberantly good-natured and profusely loquacious man that he had been all day. On
                  he streamed in a perpetual flow of talk long after both were in bed, until
                  Ashburner began to feel as a man might to whom some fairy had given a magical
                  instrument which discoursed sweet music at first, but could never be made to stop
                  playing. And when at length the Vicomte, having lighted on the subject of women,
                  poured out an infinity of adventures with ladies of all countries, of all which
                  stories Vincent Le Roi was, of course, the hero, his fellow-traveller, unable to
                  help being disgusted at his vanity and levity, turned round to the wall, and
                  without considering whether he was acting in accordance with bienseance, fell fast asleep in the midst of one of
                  the most thrilling narratives.
               When Ashburner awoke next morning, the first thing he was conscious of was Le Roi
                  talking. It required very little
                  exercise of the imagination to suppose that he had been going on uninterruptedly
                  all night. Afterwards he became aware of a considerable disturbance, evidently
                  originating in the lower story of the house, but sufficiently audible all over it,
                  which he put down to the account of numerous new arrivals. By the time they had
                  completed their toilettes (which did not take very long, for the room being just
                  under the roof, was of a heat that made it desirable for them to evacuate it as
                  soon as possible), Masters made his appearance. He had obtained possession of his
                  baggage, and arrayed himself in the extreme of summer costume:—a white grass-cloth
                  coat, about the consistency of blotting-paper, so transparent that the lilac
                  pattern of his check shirt was distinctly visible through the arms of it; white
                  duck vest, white drilled trousers, long-napped white hat, a speckled cravat to
                  match his shirt, and highly varnished shoes, with red and white striped silk
                  stockings,—altogether very fresh and innocent-looking. He came to show them the
                  principal spring, which was not far from the hotel—just a pleasant walk before
                  breakfast, though it was not likely they would meet many people so early on
                  account of last night's ball.
               'I am afraid your quarters were not very comfortable,' said Harry, as the three
                  strolled arm-in-arm down a sufficiently sandy road; 'but we shall have better
                  rooms before dinner to day.'
               'The house must be very full,' Ashburner remarked; 'and were there not a great
                  many arrivals this morning? From the noise I heard, I thought at least fifty
                  people had come.'
               'No; I glanced at the book, and there were not a dozen names on it. 'Hallo!' and
                  Masters swore roundly in Spanish, apparently forgetting that his friend understood
                  that language.
               Ashburner looked up, and saw meeting them a large Frenchman and a small Irish boy.
                  The Frenchman had an immense quantity of hair of all sorts on his face, nearly
                  hiding his features, which, as what was visible of them had a particularly
                  villanous air, was about the best thing he could have done to them; and on his
                  head he carried a something of felt, which indisputably proved the proposition
                  that matter may exist without form. The Irish youth sported a well-meant but not a
                  very successful attempt at a moustache, and a black cloth cap pitched on one side
                  of his head. In other respects they were attired in the usual costume of an
                  American snob; that is to say, a dress-coat and a full suit of black at seven in
                  the morning. Ashburner noticed that Masters spit ostentatiously while passing
                  them; and after passing he swore again, this time in downright English.
               Le Roi had seen in his acquaintance with European watering-places a goodly amount
                  of scamps and black-legs, and Ashburner was not without some experience of the
                  sort, so that they were not disposed to be curious about one blackguard more or
                  less in a place of the kind; but these two fellows had such a look of unmitigated
                  rascality, that both the foreigners glanced inquiringly at their friend, and were
                  both on the point of asking some question, when he anticipated their desire.
               'God forgive me for swearing, but it is too provoking to meet these loafers in
                  respectable quarters. The ancients used to think their journey spoiled if they met
                  an unclean animal on starting, and I feel as if my whole stay here would go wrong
                  after meeting these animals the first thing in the first morning.'
               'Mais qui sont ils donc, ces vauriens?' asked Le
                  Roi.
               
               'The Frenchman is a deported convict, who is doing us the honour to serve out his
                  time here; the Irishman is a refugee, I believe. They have come here to report for
                     The Sewer.'
               They cooled their virtuous indignation in the spring, and were returning.
               'Hallo, Masters! hallo! I thought that was you!' shouted somebody, a quarter of a
                  mile off, from the hotel steps.
               'Ah,' said Harry,' I understand now why you heard so much noise this morning. Bird
                  Simpson has arrived.'
               Mr. Simpson, popularly known as 'the bird' (why no one could tell
                  exactly, but people often get such names attached to them for some inexplicable
                  reason), came on a half-run to meet them. He was a tall, showy, and rather
                  handsome, though not particularly graceful man; very flashily got up in a blue
                  cutaway with gilt buttons, wide blue stripes down the sides of his white trousers,
                  a check shirt of enormous crimson pattern, and a red and white cravat; no
                  waistcoat, and wide embroidered braces, the work of some lady friend. He seemed to
                  have dressed himself on the principle of the tricolor, and to have carried it out
                  in his face—his cheeks being very red, his eyes very blue, and his hair very
                  white. After having pump-handled Masters' arm for some time, he made an attack on
                  Le Roi, whom he just knew by name, and inquired if he had just come de l'autre côté, meaning the other side of the
                  Atlantic, according to a common New-York idiom; but the Vicomte not unnaturally
                  took it to mean from the other side of the road, and gave a corresponding answer
                  in English as felicitous as Mr. Simpson's French. Then he digressed upon
                  Ashburner, whom he saw to be an Englishman, in so pointed a manner that Masters
                  was obliged to introduce them; and the introduction duction was followed by an
                  invitation on Simpson's part to the company to take a drink, which they did,
                  somewhat to the consternation of the Frenchman, who knew not what to make of iced
                  brandy and mint before breakfast. Then Simpson, having primed himself for the
                  morning meal, set about procuring it, and his departure visibly relieved Masters,
                  who was clearly not proud of his acquaintance. Le Roi also went after his
                  breakfast, taking care to get as far as possible from the corner of the room where
                  Simpson was.
               'There,' said Masters, 'is a very fair specimen of 'second set.' He is B, No. I,
                  rather a great man in his own circle, and imports French goods. To hear him talk
                  about French actresses and eating-houses you would think him a ten years' resident
                  of that city, instead of having been there perhaps four times in his life, a week
                  each time. But you know we Americans have a wonderful faculty of seeing a great
                  deal in a little time. Just so with Italy; he was there two months, and professes
                  to know all about the country and the people. But he doesn't know the set abroad
                  or at home. Sometimes you meet him at a ball, where he does his duty about supper
                  time; but you will never see him dancing with, or talking to, the ladies who are
                  'of us.' Nevertheless, they will avail themselves of his services sometimes, when
                  they want to buy silks at wholesale prices, or to have something smuggled for
                  them; for he is the best-natured man in the world. And, after all, he is not more
                  given to scandal than the exquisites, and is a great deal honester and truer. Once
                  I caught a fever out on the north-eastern boundary, and had not a friend with me,
                  or any means of getting help. This man nursed me like a brother, and put himself
                  to no end of trouble for me until we could fetch Carl on. I would certainly rather
                  have been under such an obligation to
                  some other men I know than to Simpson; but having incurred it, I do not think it
                  can be justly paid off with a 'glad-to-know-you-when-I'm-at-Bath-again'
                  acquaintance; and I feel bound to be civil to him, though he does bother me
                  immensely at times with his free-and-easy habits.—walking into my parlour with his
                  hat on and cigar in his mouth; chaffing me or my wife, in language about as
                  elegant as an omnibus driver's; or pawing ladies about in a way that he takes for
                  gallantry. Talking of ladies, I wish mine would show themselves for breakfast. Ah,
                  here are two men you must know; they are good types of two classes of our
                  beaux—the considerably French and the slightly English—the former class the more
                  numerous, you are probably aware. Mr. Bell, Mr. Ashburner—Mr. Ashburner, Mr.
                  Sumner.'
               Hamilton Bell was a tall, handsome man, some few years on the wrong side of
                  thirty, broader-shouldered and deeper-chested than the ordinary American model,
                  elaborately but quietly dressed, without any jewellery or showy patterns. The was
                  something very Parisian in his get-up and manner, yet you would never take him for
                  a Frenchman, still less for a Frenchified-Englishman. But he had the look of a man
                  who had lived in a gay capital, and quite fast enough for his years; his fine hair
                  was beginning to go on the top of his head, and his face wanted freshness and
                  colour. His manner, slightly reserved at first, rapidly warmed into animation, and
                  his large dark eyes gave double expression to whatever he said. His very smallest
                  talk was immensely impressive. He would tell a stranger that he was happy to make
                  his acquaintance with an air that implied all the Spaniard's mi casa a la disposition de usted, and meant about as
                  much; and when you saw him from the parquet of
                  the Opera talking to some young lady in the boxes, you would have imagined that he
                  was making a dead set at her, when in fact he was only uttering some ordinary
                  meteorological observation. Apart from his knack of looking and talking sentiment,
                  he had no strongly-marked taste or hobby: danced respectably, but not often; knew
                  enough about horses to pick out a good one when he wanted a mount for a
                  riding-party; drank good wine habitually, without being pedantic about the
                  different brands of it; and read enough of the current literature of the day to be
                  able to keep up a conversation if he fell among a literary circle. He was not a
                  marrying man, partly because his income, sufficient to provide him with all
                  bachelor luxuries, was not large enough to support a wife handsomely; partly
                  because that a man should tie himself to one woman for life was a thing he could
                  not conceive, much less practise: but he very much affected the society of the
                  softer sex, and was continually amusing himself with some young girl or young
                  wife. He rather preferred the latter—it was less compromising; still he had no
                  objection to victimize an innocent débutante,
                  and leave her more or less broken-hearted. (It must be observed, however, for the
                  credit of American young ladies, that they are not addicted to dying of this
                  complaint, so often fatal in novels; many of Hamilton's victims had recovered and
                  grown absolutely fat upon it, and married very successfully.) Wherever there was a
                     fiancée, or a probable fiancée, or a married belle with an uxorious
                  husband,—in short, wherever he could make himself look dangerous and another man
                  jealous or foolish, he came out particularly strong; at the same time, being very
                  adroit and not over belligerent, he always contrived to stop or get out of the way
                  in time if the other party showed open signs of displeasure.
               
               Frank Summer was rather shorter then Bell, rather younger, and rather more
                  dressed. He had the same broad shoulders, which in America, where most of the
                  beaux are either tall and thin or short and thin, find favour with the ladies;
                  just as blondes create a sensation in southern countries, because they are so
                  seldom seen. In almost all other particulars the two men were totally unlike, and
                  Sumner might have passed for an English gentleman put into French clothes. He was
                  reserved in his conversation, and marked in the expression of his likes and
                  dislikes. With no more intention of marrying than Bell, he took care never to make
                  love to any woman, and if any woman made love to him he gave her no encouragement.
                  He was not richer than Bell, not so good-looking, and certainly not so clever, but
                  more respected and more influential; for the solid and trustworthy parts of his
                  character, backed by a bull-dog courage and an utter imperturbability, got the
                  better in the long run of the other's more brilliant qualities.
               Some of these things Ashburner observed for himself, some of them Masters told him
                  after Bell and Sumner, who did not ask the stranger to take a drink,
                  had passed on. He had noticed that the latter's manner, though perfectly civil,
                  was very cold compared with the empressement
                  which the former had exhibited.
               'He doesn't like your countrymen,' said Harry, 'and nothing can vex him more than
                  to be told, what is literally the truth, that he resembles an Englishman in many
                  respects. I believe it is about the only thing that can vex him. What
                  an immovable man it is! I have seen a woman throw a lighted cigar into his face,
                  and another cut off one end of his moustache (that was when we were both younger,
                  and used to see some queer scenes abroad), and a servant drop half a tureen of
                  soup over him, and none of these things stirred him. Once at Naples, I recollect,
                  he set our chimney on fire. Such a time we had of it; every one in the house
                  tumbling into our room, from the piccolo, with
                  no coat and half a pair of pants, to the proprietor in his dressing-gown and
                  spectacles—women calling on the Virgin, men running after water—and there sat
                  Frank, absolutely radiating off so much coolness that he imparted a portion of it
                  to me, and we sat through the scene as quietly as if they had only been laying the
                  cloth for dinner. A rum pair they must have thought us! The day before we had
                  astonished the waiter by lighting brandy over a pudding. I suppose we left them
                  under the impression that the Anglo-Saxons had a propensity to set fire to
                  everything they came in contact with.'
               'It is very odd that so many of your people should be afraid of resembling us, and
                  take the French type for imitation in preference to the English. The original
                  feeling of gratitude to France for having assisted you in the war of independence
                  does not seem sufficient to account for it.'
               'Certainly not; for that feeling would naturally diminish in each succeeding
                  generation, whereas the Gallicism of our people is on the increase,—in fact its
                  origin is of comparatively recent date. But we really are more like
                  the French in some senses. Politically, the American is very Anglo-Saxon. So he is
                  morally; but socially, so far as you can separate society from morals, he is very
                  French. The Englishman's first idea of his duty in society is non-interference;
                  the Frenchman's and American's, amusement. An Englishman does not think it his
                  business to endeavour to amuse the company in which he happens to be; an
                  Englishwoman does not think it her duty
                  to make any attempt to entertain a man who is introduced to her. A Frenchman will
                  rather talk trash, knowing that he is talking trash, than remain
                  silent and let others remain silent. So will an American. But an Englishman,
                  unless he is sure of saying something to the point, will hold his tongue. The
                  imperturbable self-possession of the English gentleman is not generally understood
                  by us, any more than it is by the French. His minding his own business is
                  attributed to selfish indifference. The picture that half our people form of an
                  Englishman is, a heavy, awkward man, very badly dressed, courageous, and full of
                  learning; but devoid of all the arts and graces of life, and caring for nobody but
                  himself. It is a great pity that there is not a better understanding; but,
                  unfortunately, the best Englishmen who come here seldom stay long enough to be
                  appreciated, and the best Americans who go to England seldom stay there long
                  enough to appreciate the country. Whenever an American chances to stay some years
                  among you, he ends by liking England very much; but it is very seldom that he has
                  any provocation, unless compelled by business, to stay some years, for
                  acquaintances are harder to make in London than in any other city, while it has
                  less resources for a man without acquaintances than any other city—besides being
                  so dear. But here comes the ladies at last; now for breakfast.'
               Breakfast was the best managed meal at the Bath Hotel. The table d'hôte began at half-past seven, but fresh relays of rolls and
                  eggs, ham, chops, and steaks, were always to be obtained until half-past ten or
                  eleven by those who had interest with the waiters. After breakfast the company
                  went to work promenading. There was a very wide hall running through the hotel,
                  and up and down this, and up and down the two broadest est sides of the portico,
                  all the world walked—'our set' being conspicuous from the elegance of their
                  morning costume. One side of the portico was devoted to the gentlemen and their
                  cigars, and there Ashburner and Masters took a turn, leaving with the ladies Le
                  Roi and a small beau or two who had joined them. Suddenly Masters pressed his
                  friend's arm.
               'Here comes really 'one of the most remarkable men'—the very god of
                  the dance; behold Tom Edwards!'
               Ashburner beheld a little man, about five feet and a half high. If he could have
                  stood on his bushy black beard it would have lifted him full three inches higher.
                  Besides this beard he cherished a small moustache, very elaborately
                  curling-tongsed at the ends into the shape of half a lyre. Otherwise he had not
                  much hair on his head, but what he had was very carefully brushed. His features
                  were delicate, and not without intelligence, but terribly worn by dissipation. To
                  look at his figure you would take him for a boy of nineteen; to look at his face,
                  for man of thirty: he was probably, about halfway between the two ages. Everything
                  about him was wonderfully neat: a white coat and hat, like Masters';
                  cream-coloured waistcoat, and pearl-coloured trousers; miraculously small feet in
                  resplendent boots, looking more like a doll's extremities than a man's; a French
                  kid glove on one of his little hands and on the other a sapphire ring, so large
                  that Ashburner wondered how the little man could carry it, and thought that he
                  should, like Juvenal's dandies, have kept a lighter article for summer wear. Then
                  he had a watch-chain of great balls of blue enamel, with about two pounds of
                  chatelaine charms dependent therefrom; and delicate little enamelled studs, with
                  sleeve-buttons to match. Altogether he was a wonderful derful lion, considering his size. Even Masters had
                  not the courage to stop and introduce his friend until he passed the great dancer
                  more than once, in silent admiration, and with a respectful bow.
               And as they passed he detailed to Ashburner, with his usual biographical accuracy,
                  the history of Tom Edwards, which he had begun in the stage-coach. Tom had been
                  left in his infancy with a fortune, and without a father, to be brought up by
                  relatives who had an unlucky preference of Parisian to American life. Under their
                  auspices and those of other Mentors, whom he found in that gay capital, his
                  progress was so rapid, that at a very early age he was known as the banker of two
                  or three distinguished lorettes, and the pet
                  pupil of the renowned Cellarius. Indeed, he had lived so much in the society of
                  that gentleman and his dancing-girls, that he took the latter for his standard of
                  female society, and had a tendency to behave to all womankind as he behaved to
                  them. To married ladies he talked slightly refined double-entendre: to young ladies he found it safest to say very
                  little, his business and pleasure being to dance with them; and if they did not
                  dance, he gave them up for uncivilized beings, and troubled himself no further
                  about them. Of old people of either sex he took no further notice than to order
                  them out of the way when they impeded the polkers, or danced bodily over them when
                  they disobeyed. Still it must be said, in justice to him, that dancing was not his
                  sole and all-absorbing pursuit. Having an active turn of mind and body, he found
                  leisure for many other profitable amusements. He was fond of that noble animal the
                  horse, gambled habitually, ate and drank luxuriously,—in short, burned his candle
                  at a good many ends: but the dance was, though not his sole, certainly his
                  favourite passion; and he was never supremely ly happy but when he had all the
                  chairs in the house arranged in a circle, and all the boys and women of 'our set'
                  going around them in the German cotillon, from noon to midnight at a (so-called)
                     matinée, or from midnight to daybreak at a
                  ball.
               'And now,' said Masters, 'I think my cousin Gerard must be up by this time; he and
                  Edwards are generally the last to come down to breakfast. Perhaps we shall find
                  him at the ten-pin alley; I see the ladies are moving that way.'
               To the ten-pin alley they went. Down stairs, men were playing, coat off, and cigar
                  in mouth; while others waited their turn, with feet distributed in various
                  directions. Above, all was decorum; the second story being appropriated to the
                  ladies and their cavaliers. And very fond of the game the ladies were, for it
                  afforded them an opportunity of showing off a handsome arm, and some times a neat
                  ankle. Gerard was not there; they had to wait some time for alleys; although
                  Masters was a little bored, and whispered to his friend that he meant to console
                  himself by making a little sensation.
               'By your play? asked Ashburner.
               'No, but by taking off my coat.'
               'Why, really, considering the material of your coat, I think it might as well be
                  on as off. Surely you can't find it an impediment?'
               'No, but I mean to take it off for fun,—just to give the people here something to
                  talk about; they talk so much about so little. They will be saying all over by
                  to-morrow that Mr. Masters was in the ladies' room half undressed.'
               After an hour's rolling they returned hotel-wards again, and as they did so, a
                  very spicy phaeton, with an equally spicy unicorn, a dark chestnut leading two
                     light bays, drove up to the door. A
                  tall, handsome man, handed out a rather pretty and very showily-dressed little
                  woman; and Ashburner recognised Gerard Ludlow.
               It was not the first time he had seen Gerard. They had travelled over half Greece
                  together, having accidentally fallen upon the same route. As the Honourable Edward
                  had all the national fear of compromising himself, and Gerard was as proud and
                  reserved as any Englishman, they went on for days together without speaking,
                  although the only Anglo-Saxons of the party. At last, Ludlow having capsized,
                  horse and all, on a particularly bad road, Ashburner took the liberty of helping
                  to pick him up, and then they became very good friends. Gerard was at that time in
                  the full flush of youth and beauty, and the lion of the Italian capital, which he
                  had made his head quarters, where it was currently reported that a certain very
                  desirable countess had made desperate love to him, and that a rich nobleman (for
                  there are some rich noblemen still left on the continent) had tried
                  very hard to get the handsome foreigner for a son-in-law. Knowing this, and some
                  other similar stories about him, Ashburner was a little curious to see Mrs.
                  Ludlow, and confessed himself somewhat disappointed in her: he found her rather
                  pretty, and certainly not stupid; lively and agreeable in her manners, like most
                  of her countrywomen; but by no means remarkably distinguished either for beauty or
                  wit. Masters explained to him that his cousin 'had married for tin.'
               'But Ludlow always talked of his father as a rich man, and his family as a small
                  one. I should have supposed money about the last thing he would have married
                  for.'
               'Yes, he had prospects of the best; but he wanted ready money and a settled
                  income. He was on a small allowance; he knew the only way to get a handsome one
                  was to marry, and that the more money his wife brought the more his father would
                  come down with. So as Miss Hammersley had eight thousand a-year, old Ludlow
                  trebled it; and Gerard may build as many phaetons as he likes. I don't mean to say
                  that the match is an uncongenial one,—they have many tastes alike; but I do mean
                  to say that love had nothing to do with it.'
               'Well, I used to think that in your unsophisticated republican country, people
                  married out of pure love; but now it looks as if the fashionables, at least, marry
                  for money about as often as we do.'
               'They don't marry for anything else,' replied Masters, using one of the slang
                  phrases of the day.*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *This is the strongest American (slang) way of putting an affirmation; and,
                     probably, the strongest instance of it on record is that of the Bowery boy,
                     who, when asked by the clergyman, 'Wilt thou have this woman?' replied, 'I
                     won't have any one else.'
               
               While the two friends were gossiping, Sumner and Le Roi had carried off the
                  ladies; and an assemblage of juvenile beaux and young girls, and some few of the
                  younger married women, had extemporized a dance in the largest of the public
                  parlours, which they kept up till two o'clock and then vanished,—to dress, as it
                  appeared, for the three o'clock dinner. Masters' party had obtained their
                  apartments at last,—a parlour and two bed-rooms for the ladies on the first floor,
                  and chambers for the three men in the second story, of a recently built wing,
                  popularly known as 'the Colony,' where most of the gay bachelors, and not a few of
                  the young married men, slept. At dinner the ladies presented themselves as much
                  dressed as they could be without being décolletées; and the men had doffed their grass-cloth or linen garments, and put on dress-coats, or,
                  at least, black coats. Ashburner was a good-looking young man enough, and had
                  sufficient vanity to take notice, in the course of the morning, that he was an
                  object of attention; at dinner many looks were directed towards him, but with an
                  expression of disappointment which he did not exactly understand at the time, but
                  afterwards learned the reason of from his friend. Though making no pretensions to
                  the title of exquisite, he happened to have a very neat shooting jacket,
                  unexceptionable in material and fit; and 'our set,' having approved of this, were
                  curious to see what sort of costume he would display at dinner. When, therefore,
                  he came to table, 
                     Avec les mêmes bas et la même cravate,
                   and the shooting-jacket unchanged, they were visibly disappointed. Masters,
                  to keep him in countenance, had retained his white coat, on the plea of its being
                  most wanted then, as they were in the hottest part of the day, which excuse did
                  not enable him to escape some hints from his sister-in-law, and a direct scolding
                  from his wife.
               Our Englishman thought the dinner hardly worth so much dressing for. The dishes,
                  so far as he had an opportunity of judging, were tolerably cooked; but their
                  number was not at all proportionate to that of the guests,—in short, it was a
                  decided case of short commons, and the waiters were scarce to match. There were
                  but two parties well attended to. One was the family of an old gentleman from the
                  South, who was part owner of the building, and who, besides this advantage,
                  enjoyed the privilege of letting his daughter monopolize the piano of the public
                  parlour half the day, to sing Italianarias
                  shockingly out of tune, much to the disgust of the boarders generally, and
                  especially of the dancing set, who were continually wanting the instrument
                  themselves for polking purposes. The other was——the reporters of The
                     Sewer; who had a choice collection of dishes and waiters always at
                  their command. To be sure they had their end of the table to themselves, too, for
                  not a person sat within three chairs of them On either side; but this they, no
                  doubt, accepted as a complimentary acknowledgment of their formidable reputation.
                  Every one else was famished. The married women grumbled, and scolded their
                  husbands,—those convenient scape-goats of all responsibility; the young ladies
                  tried to look very sentimental, and above all such vulgar anxiety as that of meat
                  and drink, but only succeeded in looking very cross; the men swore In various
                  dialects at the waiters whenever they could catch them flying, and the waiters
                  being used to it didn't mind it; and Ashburner, as a recollection of a former
                  conversation flitted across his mind, could not help letting off a tu quoque at his friend.
               'I say, Masters,' quoth he, 'is this one of the hotels that are so much better
                  than ours, and that our people ought to take a lesson from?'
               Harry looked half-a-dozen bowie-knives at him. Besides the natural irritation
                  produced by hunger, his wife and sister-in-law had been whipping him over each
                  other's shoulders for the last half-hour, and now this last remark made him ready
                  to boil over. For a few seconds his face wore an expression positively dangerous,
                  but in another moment the ridiculous side of the case struck him. With a
                  good-humoured laugh he called for some wine—the only thing one was sure to get, as
                  it was an extra, and a pretty expensive one too, on the bills—and they drowned
                  their hunger in a bumper of tolerable champagne.
               
               The fact was, that the Bath Hotel had been a most excellent house three or four
                  summers previous, and the 'enterprising and gentlemanly' landlord (to borrow an
                  American penny-a-liner's phrase) having made a fortune, as he deserved, had sold
                  out his lease, with the goodwill and fixtures of the establishment, to Mr.
                  Grabster. The latter gentleman was originally a respectable farmer and
                  market-gardener in the vicinity of Oldport; and having acquired by his business a
                  fair sum of money, was looking about for some speculation in which to invest it.
                  He commenced his new profession with tolerable good intentions, but having as much
                  idea of keeping a hotel as he had of steering a frigate, and finding a balance
                  against him at the end of the first season, from sheer mismanagement, he had been
                  endeavouring ever since to make up for it by screwing his guests in every way.
                  People naturally began to complain. Two courses were open to him, to improve his
                  living, or to tip an editor to puff him. He deemed the latter course the cheaper,
                  and bought The Sewer, which, while uttering the most fulsome
                  adulation of everything connected with the Bath Hotel, frightened the discontented
                  into silence through dread of its abuse. Ludlow, and some of the other exclusives,
                  had, in the beginning of the present season, contrived a remedy which, for the
                  time, was perfectly successful. They held a private interview with the cook, and
                  made up a weekly contribution for him, on condition of their having the best of
                  everything, and enough of it for dinner; and the waiters were similarly retained.
                  For a time this worked to a marvel, and the subscribers were as well fed as they
                  could desire. But the other guests began to make an outcry against the aristocracy
                  and exclusiveness of private dishes on a public table, and the servants soon hit
                  upon a compromise of their own, which was to take the money without rendering the
                     quid pro quo. This, of course, soon put an
                  end to the payments, and things were on the old starvation footing again.
               After dinner, everybody who had horses rode or drove. The roads about Oldport were
                  heavy and sandy, and terrible work the dust made with the ladies' fine dresses and
                  the gentlemen's fine coats.
               'Rather different from the drives about Baden-Baden,' said Masters.
               'Yes; but I suppose we must console ourselves on moral grounds, and remember, that
                  there we owe the beautiful promenades to the gambling-table, while here we are
                  without the roads, and also without the play.'
               'Ah, but isn't there play here? only all sub
                     rosâ. Wait a while, and you'll find out.'
               And Ashburner did find out before many nights, when the footsteps and oaths of the
                  young gamblers returning at four in the morning to their rooms in the 'colony,'
                  woke him out of his first sleep. After the drive, tea—still at the table d'hôte—and after tea, dressing for the ball,
                  which this night was at the Bellevue House, appropriately so-called from
                  commanding a fine view of nothing. As the Bellevue was not a fashionable hotel
                  (although the guests were sufficiently fed there), some of the exclusive ladies
                  had hesitated about 'assisting' on the occasion; but the temptation of a dance was
                  too strong to be resisted, and they all ultimately went. Le Roi accompanied the
                  Masters in the all accommodating Rockaway. The Bellevue had a 'colony,' too, in
                  the second story of which was the ball-room. As they ascended the stairs, the
                  lively notes of La Polka Sempiternelle, composée par Josef
                     Bungel, et dédiée à M. T. Edwards, reached their ears; and hardly
                  were they over the threshold when Edwards himself hopped up before them, and without other preface or
                  salutation than a familiar nod, threw his arm round Mrs. Masters' waist, and swung
                  her off in the dance; while Sumner, who had simultaneously presented himself to
                  Miss Vanderlyn, took similar possession of her.
               'Do you dance?'
               'No, I thank you.'
               While Masters asked the question, Le Roi dived at a girl and whirled her away:
                  almost before Ashburner had answered it, his friend shot away from him, making
                  point at a young married lady in the distance; and his bow of recognition ended in
                  the back-step of the polka, as the two went off together at a killing pace. In
                  five seconds from the time of entrance, Ashburner was left standing alone at one
                  end of the room, and his companions were twirling at the other. For so habituated
                  were the dancers to their fascinating exercise, that they were always ready to go
                  at the word, like trained horses. And certainly the dancing was beautiful. He had
                  never seen gentlemen move so gracefully and dexterously in a crowded room as these
                  young Americans did. Le Roi and Löwenberg, who, by virtue of their respective
                  nationalities, were bound to be good dancers, looked positively awkward alongside
                  of the natives. As to the ladies, they glided, and swam, and realized all the
                  so-often-talked-of-and-seldom-seen 'poetry of motion.' Indeed Ashburner thought
                  they did it too well. He thought of Catiline's friend commemorated by Sallust, who
                  'danced better than became a modest woman.' He thought some of their displays were
                  a little operatic, and that he had seen something like them at certain balls in
                     Paris—not the balls of the Faubourg St. Germain. He thought that
                  the historian's aphorism might be extended to the male part of the company,—and
                  that they danced better than became intelligent men. He thought—but as he
                  prudently kept thoughts to himself, as some of his foreign prejudices may have
                  been at the bottom of them, we will not stop to record them all. By-and-bye there
                  was a quadrille for the benefit of the million, during which the exclusives
                  rested, and Ashburner had full opportunity of observing them. The first thing that
                  struck him was the extreme youth of the whole set, and more especially the
                  masculine portion of it. Old men there were none. The old women, that is to say,
                  the mammas and aunts, were stuck into corners out of the way, and no one took any
                  notice of them. Hamilton Bell was quite an old beau by comparison—almost
                  superannuated. Sumner would have been nearly off the books but for his very
                  superior dancing. Even Masters seemed a middle-aged man compared with the majority
                  of 'our set,' who averaged between boys of seventeen and young men of twenty-four.
                  And the more juvenile the youth, the larger and stiffer was his white tie. Some of
                  these neck-fastenings were terrific to behold, standing out a foot on each side of
                  the wearer. All the Joinvilles that Ashburner had ever seen, on all the gents in
                  London or elsewhere, faded into insignificance before these portentous cravats. He
                  could not help making some observation on this fashion to Masters, as he
                  encountered him promenading with a fair polkiste.
               
               'Did you ever notice the whiffle-trees of my team-trotting-wagon, how they extend
                  on each side beyond the hubs of the wheels? They serve for feelers in a tight
                  place; wherever you clear your whiffle-trees, you can clear your wheels; and these
                  cravats are built on the same principle—wherever you clear your tie, you can clear
                  your partner.'
               'By one in the morning the democracy of the ballroom room had had enough of four hours' dancing and
                  looking on. 'Our set' was left in full possession of the floor. Forthwith they
                  seized upon all the chairs, the interminable German cotillon commenced. It lasted
                  two hours—and how much longer Ashburner could not tell. When he went away at
                  three, the dancers looked very deliquescent, but gave no symptoms of flagging. And
                  so ended his first day's experience of an American watering-place.
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               LIFE AT A WATERING-PLACE—THE LIONNE.
               ONE day at Oldport Springs went off pretty much like another. There was the same
                  continual whirl, and flurry, and toiling after pleasure—never an hour of
                  repose—scarcely enough cessation for the two or three indispensable meals. When
                  they had walked, and flirted, and played ten-pins, and driven, and danced all day,
                  and all night till two in the morning, the women retired to their rooms, and the
                  men retired to the gambling-house (which being an illegal establishment had, on
                  that account, a greater charm in their eyes), and kept it up there till broad
                  daylight; notwithstanding which, they always contrived to appear at breakfast a
                  few hours after as fresh as ever, and ready to begin the same round of
                  dissipation. Indeed, it was said that Tom Edwards and his most ardent followers
                  among the boys never went to bed at all, but on their return from 'fighting the
                  tiger,' bathed, changed their linen, and came down to the breakfast-room, taking
                  the night's sleep for granted. It was a perpetual scene of excitement, relieved
                  only by the heavy and calm figure of Sumner, who, silent and unimpassioned,
                  largely capacious of meat and drink, a recipient of every diversion, without being
                  excited by any, went through all the bowling, and riding, and polking, and
                  gambling, with the gravity of a commis
                  performing the national French dance at
                  the Mabille. There was much rivalry in equipages, especially between Ludlow,
                  Masters, and Löwenberg, who drove the three four-in-hands of the place, and
                  emulated one another in horses, harness, and vehicles—even setting up attempts at
                  liveries, in which they found some imitators (for you can't do anything in
                  America, however unpopular, without being imitated); and every horse, wagon,
                  man-servant, and livery, belonging to every one, was duly chronicled in the
                  Oldport correspondence of the Sewer and the Jacobin,
                  which journals were wont one day to Billingsgate the 'mushroom aristocracy of
                  wealth,' and the next to play Jenkins for their glorification. Le Roi, who owned
                  no horses, and had given up dancing as soon as he found that there were many of
                  the natives who could out-dance him, and that the late hours were bad for his
                  complexion, attached himself to any or every married lady who was at all
                  distinguished for beauty or fortune; and then went about asking, with an
                  ostentatious air of mystery—'Est-ce qu'on parle beaucoup
                     de moi et Madame Chose?' Sometimes he deigned to turn 
                     asside
                     aside
                   for an heiress; and as he was a very amusing and rather ornamental man,
                  the girls were always glad to have his company; but the good speculations took
                  care not to fall in love with him, or to give him sufficient encouragement
                  (although a Frenchman does not require a great deal) to justify a declaration on
                  his part. Perhaps the legend about the mutual-benefit-subscription club hurt his
                  prospects, or it may have been his limited success in dancing. The same reason—as
                  much, at least, as the assumed one of their vulgarity—kept Mr. Simpson, and other
                  'birds' of his set, out of the exclusive society. For dancing was the one great
                  article in the code of the fashionables to which all other amusements or
                  occupations were subordinate. There was a grand dress-ball once a-week at one or
                  other of the hotels, and two undress-balls—hops they were called;
                  but most of the exclusives went to these also in full dress, and both balls and
                  hops usually lasted till three or four in the morning. Then on the off-nights 'our
                  set' got up their own-little extempore balls in the large public parlour, to the
                  music of some volunteer pianist, and when the weather was bad they danced in the
                  same place all day; when it was good these informal matinées did not generally last more than two or three hours. Then
                  there were serenades given about daybreak, by young men who were tired of the
                  tiger'—nominally to some particular ladies, but virtually, of course, to the whole
                  hotel, or nearly so—and the only music they could devise for these occasions were
                  waltzes or polkas. Ashburner made a calculation that counting in the serenades the
                  inhabitants of Oldport were edified by waltz, polka, and redowa music (in those
                  days the Schottisch was not), eleven hours out
                  of the twenty-four daily. And at last, when M. Monson, the Cellarius of New-York,
                  came down with various dancing-girls, native and imported, to give lessons to such
                  aspiring young men as might desire it, first Mrs. Harrison and other women, who,
                  though wealthy and well known, were not exactly 'of us,' used to drop in to look
                  at the fun; and, finally, all the exclusives, irresistibly attracted by the sound
                  of fiddles and revolving feet, thronged the little room up-stairs, where the
                  dancing class was assembled, and from looking on, proceeded to join in the
                  exercises. Ladies, beaux, and dancing-girls, were all mingled together, whirling
                  and capering about in an apartment fifteen feet square, which hardly gave them
                  room to pass one another. Masters was the only person who entered his protest
                  against the proceeding. He declared that it was a shame that his countrywomen should degrade
                  themselves so before foreigners; but his expostulations were only laughed at: nor
                  could he even persuade his wife and sister-in-law to quit the place, though he
                  stalked off himself in high dudgeon, and wrote a letter to the Episcopal
                     Banner, inveighing against the shameless dissipation of the
                  watering-places. For Harry was on very good terms with the religious people in
                  New-York, and was professedly a religious man, and had some sort of idea that he
                  mixed with the fashionables to do them good; which was much like what we sometimes
                  hear of a parson who follows the hounds to keep the sportsmen from swearing, and
                  about as successful. Trying with all his might to serve God, and to live with the
                  exclusives, he was in a fair way to get a terrible fall between two stools.
               Talking of religion brings us naturally to Sunday, which at Oldport was really
                  required as a day of rest. But whether it would have been so or not is doubtful,
                  only that the Puritan habits of the country made dancing on that day impossible.
                  It was a violation of public opinion, and of the actual law of the land, which no
                  one cared to attempt. The fashionables were thus left almost without resource. The
                  young men went off to dine somewhere in the vicinity, not unfrequently taking with
                  them some of M. Monson's dancing-girls; the married men, and the women generally,
                  were in a sad state of listlessness. Some of them literally went to bed and slept
                  for the rest of the week; others, in very despair of something to do, went to
                  church and fell asleep there. Ashburner took advantage of the lull to fill up his
                  journal, and put down his observations on the society about him, in which he had
                  remarked some striking peculiarities, apart from the dancing mania and other
                  outward and open characteristics.
               The first thing that surprised him was the great number of misunderstandings and
                  quarrels existing among the not very large number of people who composed the
                  fashionable set. They seemed to quarrel with their relatives in preference, as a
                  matter of course, and to admit strangers very readily to the privilege of
                  relatives. The Robinsons were at feud with all their cousins; Masters with most of
                  his, except Ludlow. Ludlow, Bell, Sumner, every man he knew, had his set of
                  private enemies, with whom he was not on speaking or bowing terms. Mrs. Harrison,
                  who was very friendly to most of the men, scarcely spoke to a single woman in the
                  place; but this was, perhaps, only carrying the war into Africa, as the ladies of
                  'our set' generally had intended not to recognize her as one of them. These
                  numberless feuds made it very difficult to arrange an excursion, or get up a
                  dinner at the restaurant of a 'coloured
                  gentleman' whose timely settlement in Oldport had enabled Mr. Grabster's guests to
                  escape in some measure the pangs of hunger. On studying the causes of these
                  disagreeable hostilities, he found that, among relatives, they were often caused
                  by disputes upon money matters; that between persons not related they frequently
                  sprung from the most trivial sources—frivolous points of etiquette, petty
                  squabbles at cards, imaginary jealousies—but that in both cases the majority of
                  them could be traced to the all-pervading spirit of scandal. His purely
                  intellectual education, if it had not made him somewhat of a 
                     misogonist
                     misogynist
                  , had at least prevented him from gaining any accurate knowledge or
                  appreciation of women: he set them down en masse
                  as addicted to gossip, and was not surprised to find in the American ladies what
                  he assumed as a characteristic of the whole sex. But he was surprised
                  to find the same quality so prevalent among the men. Not that they were in the habit of killing
                  reputations, to give themselves bonnes fortunes,
                  as Frenchmen might have done under similar circumstances; their defamatory gossip
                  was more about men than about women, and seemed to arise partly from a general
                  disbelief in virtue and partly from inability to maintain an interesting
                  conversation on other than personal topics. And though much of this evil speaking
                  was evidently prompted by personal enmities, much also of it seemed to originate
                  in no hostile feeling at all; and it was this that particularly astonished
                  Ashburner, to find men speaking disparagingly of their friends—those who were so
                  in the real sense of that much abused term. Thus there could be no reasonable
                  doubt that the cousins, Masters and Ludlow, were much attached to each other, and
                  fond of each other's society; that either would have been ready to take up the
                  other's quarrel, or endorse his notes, had circumstances required it. Yet Harry
                  could never refrain from laughing before third parties at Gerard's ignorance of
                  books, and making him the hero of all the Mrs. Malapropisms he could pick up or
                  invent; or, as we have seen, speaking very disrespectfully of the motives which
                  had led him to commit matrimony; and Gerard was not slow to make corresponding
                  comments on various foibles of Harry. But the spirit of detraction was most fully
                  developed in men who were not professionally idle, but had, or professed to have,
                  some little business on hand. Of this class was Arthur Sedley, an old acquaintance
                  and groomsman of Masters, and a barrister—(they are beginning to talk about
                  barristers now in New-York, though it is a division of labour not generally
                  recognised in the country)—of some small practice. Really well-educated,
                  well-read, and naturally clever, his cleverness and knowledge were vastly more
                  disagreeable than almost any amount of ignorance or stupidity could have been.
                  When he cut up right and left every man or woman who came on the tapis, his sarcasms were so neatly pointed that it was
                  impossible to help laughing with him; but it was equally impossible to escape
                  feeling that, as soon as your back was turned, he would be laughing at you. Riches
                  and rich people were the commonest subject of his sneers, yet he lost no
                  opportunity of toadying a profitable connexion, and was always supposed to be on
                  the look-out for some heiress.
               The next thing which made Ashburner marvel was the extreme youth of the
                  fashionable set, particularly the male portion of it; or to speak more critically,
                  the way in which the younger members of the set had suppressed their elders, and
                  constituted themselves the society. A middle-aged man, particularly
                  if, like Löwenberg, he happened to be rich, might be admitted to terms of
                  equality, but the papas and mammas were absolutely set aside, and became mere
                  formulas and appendages. The old people were nowhere; no one looked after their
                  comfort in a crowd, or consulted them about any arrangement till after the
                  arrangement was made. They had no influence and no authority. When Miss Friskin
                  rode a wild colt bareheaded through the streets of Oldport, or danced the redowa
                  with little Robinson in so very château-rouge a
                  style, that even Mrs. Harrison turned away, poor Mrs. Friskin could interpose no
                  impediment to the young lady's amusement; and even her father, the respected
                  senior of the wealthy firm, Friskin and Co., who must have heard from afar of his
                  daughter's vagaries (for all these things were written in the note-book of the
                     Sewer), seemed never to have dreamed of the propriety or
                  possibility of coming up to Oldport to put a stop to them. When Tom Edwards was
                  squandering his fortune night after
                  night at the faro-table, and his health day after day in ceaseless dissipation,
                  there was no old friend of his family who dared to give him advice or warning, for
                  there was none to whose advice or warning he would have listened. Once when
                  Ashburner was conversing with Masters on some subject which brought on a reference
                  to this inverse order of things, the latter gave his explanation of it, which was
                  to this effect:—
               'The number of foreigners among us, either travelling for pleasure, or settled for
                  purposes of business, is so great, that they become an appreciable element in our
                  society. It is, therefore, requisite that a fashionable should be able to
                  associate easily with foreigners; and for this it is necessary that he or she
                  should have some knowledge of foreign customs and languages, and, in the first
                  place, of the French language. Now, if we go back a generation, we shall find that
                  the men of that day were not educated to speak French. Go into the Senate Chamber
                  at Washington, for instance, and you will not meet with many of the honourable
                  senators who can converse in the recognised language of courts. Many of our most
                  distinguished statesmen and diplomats can speak
                  no tongue but their own. And to descend to private life, with which we have more
                  particularly to do, when a foreigner presents himself with his letters at the
                  dwelling of an old city merchant or professional man, it is generally the younger
                  branches of the family who are called on to amuse him and play interpreters for
                  the rest. This gives the young people a very decided advantage over their elders,
                  and it is not surprising that they have become a little vain of it. And similarly
                  with regard to foreign dresses, dances, cookery, and habits generally. The young
                  men, having been the latest abroad, are the freshest and best informed in these
                  things. It does not require any great experience or wisdom to master them, only
                  some personal grace and aptitude for imitation to start with, and an aplomb to which ignorance is more conducive than
                  knowledge. Hence the standard of excellence has become one of superficial
                  accomplishment, and the man of matured mind who enters into competition with these
                  handsome, showy, and illiterate boys, puts himself at a discount. Look at
                  Löwenberg. All his literary acquirements and artistic tastes (and he really has a
                  great deal of both) go for nothing. The little beaux can speak nearly as many
                  languages as he can, and dance and dress better. The only thing they can
                  appreciate about him is his money, and the horses and dinners consequent there on.
                  If little Robinson, there, with his ne plus
                     ultra tie and varnished shoes, were to have the same fortune left him
                  to-morrow, he would be the better man of the two, because he can polk better, and
                  because, being neither a married man nor the agent of a respectable house, he can
                  gamble and do other things which Löwenberg's position does not allow him to
                  do.'
               This was a great confession for Masters to make against the country; nevertheless,
                  it was not perfectly satisfactory to Ashburner, who thought that it did not
                  explain all the phenomena of the case. It seemed to him that there was at work a
                  radical spirit of insubordination, and a principle of overturning the formerly
                  recognised order of domestic rule. The little children ate and drank what they
                  liked, went to bed when they liked, and altogether were very independent of their
                  natural rulers. Masters' boy rode rough-shod over his nurse, bullied his mother,
                  and only deigned to mind his father occasionally. The wives ruled their husbands
                  despotically, and acted as if they had taken out a patent for avenging the
                  inferiority of their sex in other parts of the world. Masters did not like dancing: he only danced at all
                  because he thought it his business to know a little of everything, and because
                  society thought it the duty of every young man who was not lame to understand the
                  polka. But his wife kept him going at every ball for six hours, during five of
                  which he was bored to death. Ludlow, whose luxurious living made violent exercise
                  necessary for his health, and who, therefore, delighted in fencing, boxing, and
                  'constitutionals' that would have tired a Cantab, was made to drive about Mrs.
                  Ludlow all day till he hated the sight of his own horses. As to Mrs. Harrison, she
                  treated her husband, when he made his appearance at Oldport (which was not very
                  often) as unceremoniously as one would an old trunk, or any other piece of baggage
                  which is never alluded to or taken notice of except when wanted for immediate
                  use.
               Ashburner first met this lady a very few days after his arrival at Oldport;
                  indeed, she was so conspicuous a figure in the place that one could not be there
                  long with out taking notice of her. About midday there was usually a brief
                  interval between the ten-pin bowling and the informal dance; and during one of
                  these pauses he perceived on the smoking-piazza, where ladies seldom ventured, a
                  well-dressed and rather handsome woman smoking a cigarette, and surrounded by a
                  group of beaux of all sizes, from men like Bell and Sumner to the little
                  huge-cravated boys in their teens. She numbered in her train at least half-a-dozen
                  of these cavaliers, and was playing them off against one another and managing them
                  all at once, as a circus-rider does his four horses, or a juggler his four balls.
                  In a country where beauty is the rule rather than the exception, she was not a
                  remarkable beauty—at least she did not appear such to Ashburner from that
                  distance; nor was her dress, though sufficiently elegant and becoming, quite so
                  artistically put on as that of Mrs. Masters and the other belles of the set; still
                  there was clearly something. Very attractive and striking about her, and he was
                  immediately induced to inquire her name, and, on learning that she was a real lady
                  (though not of 'our set' of ladies), to request an Introduction to her. But
                  Masters; to whom he first applied, instead of jumping at the opportunity with his
                  usual readiness to execute or anticipate his friend's wishes, boggled exceedingly,
                  and put off the introduction under frivolous and evidently feigned pretences. It
                  was so uncommon for Masters to show any diffidence in such matters, and his whole
                  air said so plainly, 'I will do this out of friendship if you wish it, but for my
                  own part I would rather not,' that Ashburner saw there was something in the wind,
                  and let the subject drop. Ludlow, to whom he next had recourse, told him, with the
                  utmost politeness but in very decided terms, that 'his family' (he was careful not
                  to insist on his own personality in the affair) 'had not the honour of Mrs.
                  Harrison's acquaintance.' The next man who happened to come along was Mr. Simpson,
                  and to him Ashburner made application, thinking that, perhaps, the fair smoker
                  might more properly belong to the 'second set,' though so surrounded by the beaux
                  of the first. But even Simpson, though the last man in the world to be guilty of
                  any superfluous delicacy, hesitated very much, and made some allusion to Mrs.
                  Simpson; and then Ashburner began to comprehend the real state of the case,—that
                  most of the married women had declared was against Mrs. Harrison, that she had
                  retaliated upon them all, and that the husbands were drawn into their wives'
                  quarrels, and obliged to fight shy of her before strangers. It was clear, then,
                  that he must apply to a bachelor; and accordingly he waylaid Sumner, who 'was too happy' to introduce him at
                  once in due form.
               As Ashburner came up to Mrs. Harrison she began to play off her eyes at him, and
                  he then perceived that they constituted her chief beauty. They were of that deep
                  blue, which in certain lights, passes for black,—large, expressive, and
                  piercing,—the sort of eyes that go right through a man and look him down to
                  nothing. Indeed, they had such an effect on him that he lost all distinctive idea
                  of her other features. Her manner, too, had something very attractive, though he
                  could not have defined wherein it consisted. She did not exhibit the empressement with which most of her countrywomen seek
                  to put a stranger at his ease at once; or the exigence of a spoiled lady waiting to be amused; or the haughtiness
                  of a great lady who does not care if she is amused herself and deigns no effort to
                  amuse others. Neither did she attack him with raillery and irony, as Mrs. Masters
                  had done on their first meeting. But she behaved as if she were used to seeing men
                  like Ashburner every day of her life, and was willing to meet them half way and be
                  agreeable to them, if they were so to her, without taking any particular trouble,
                  for there was no appearance of effort to please, or even of any strong desire to
                  please, in her words and gestures; yet she did please and attract
                  very decidedly.
               'So I saw you in Mrs Harrison's train!' said Masters, when they next met.
               'Yes, and I fancy I know why you hesitated to introduce me.'
               As Ashburner spoke he glanced towards the parlour, where 'our set'—Mrs. Masters,
                  of course, conspicuous among them—were engaged in their ordinary occupation of
                  dancing.
               'Oh, I assure you, madame is not disposed to be
                  jealous, nor am I a man to take part in women's quarrels. I don't like the lady
                  myself, to begin with; and were I a bachelor, should have as little to say to her
                  as I have now. In the first place she is too old—'
               'Too old! she cannot be thirty.'
               'Of course a lady never is thirty, until she is fifty, at least; but
                  at any rate I may say, without sacrilege, that Mrs. H. is pretty high up in the
                  twenties. Now at that age a woman ought—not to give up society, that would be an
                  absurdity in the other extreme, but—to leave the romping dances and the young men
                  to the girls, who want them more, and whom they become better. Then I don't like
                  her face. You must have taken notice that all the upper part of it is fine and
                  intellectual, and she has glorious eyes——'
               'Yes,' said Ashburner.
               'But all the lower part is heavy and over-sensuous. Now, not only does this, in my
                  opinion, entirely disfigure a woman's looks, but it suggests unpleasant ideas of
                  her character. A man may have that ponderous chin and voluptuous mouth, without
                  their disturbing the harmony of an otherwise handsome face. I do not think a woman
                  can; and as in the physical so in the moral. A man can stand a much greater amount
                  of sensuousness in his composition than a woman. I do not mean to allude to the
                  different standards of morality for the two sexes admitted by society; for I don't
                  admit it, and think it very unjust; and I am proud to say that our people
                  generally entertain more virtuous as well as more equitable views on this point
                  than the Europeans. I mean literally, that a man having so many opportunities for
                  leading an active life, and being able to reason himself into or out of a great
                  many things to or from which a woman's
                  only guide is her feelings, may be very sensuous without its doing any positive
                  harm to himself or others; but with a woman, who is compelled to lead a
                  comparatively idle life, such an element predominating in her character is sure to
                  bring her into mischief.'
               'Do you mean to say, then, that——,' and Ashburner stopped short, but his look
                  implied the remainder of his interrupted 
                     qustion
                     question
                  .
               'Do you ask me from a personal motive?'
               Ashburner coloured, and was proceeding to disclaim any such motive with an air of
                  injured innocence.
               'No, I don't mean anything of the sort,' said Masters, who felt that he had gone
                  rather too far, and might unintentionally have slandered his countrywoman. 'I
                  believe the lady is as pure as—as my wife, or any one else. The number of her
                  beaux, and the equality with which she treats them, prove conclusively to my mind
                  that her flirting never runs into anything worse. I don't think a woman runs any
                  danger of that kind when she has such a lot of cavaliers; they keep watch on her,
                  and on one another. I remember when my brother lived in town, he once was away
                  from home for two or three weeks, and when he came back an old maid who lived in
                  his street, and used to keep religious watch over the goings-out and comings-in of
                  every one in the vicinity, said to him, 'How very gay your wife is, Mr. Masters?
                  she has been walking with a different gentleman every day since you were gone.'
                  'Dear me!' says Carl; 'a different man every day! How glad I am! If you had told
                  me she was walking with the same man every day I might have been a
                  little scared.' But a woman may be perfectly chaste herself, and yet cause a great
                  deal of unchasteness in other people. Here is this Mrs. Harrison, smoking
                  cigarettes—and cigars, too, sometimes, in the open air—drinking grog at night, and
                  sometimes in the morning; letting Tom Edwards and the foolish boys who imitate him
                  talk slang to her without putting them down; always ready for a walk or drive with
                  the last handsome young man who has arrived; and utterly ignoring her husband,
                  except when she makes some slighting mention of him for not sending her money
                  enough;—what is the effect of all this upon the men? The foreigners—there are
                  plenty of them here every season; I wonder there are so few this time: instead of
                  one decent Frenchman like Le Roi, you usually find half-a-dozen disreputable ones;
                  Englishmen many, not always of the best sort; Germans, Russians, and Spaniards,
                  occasional;—they all inclined to look upon her—especially considering her
                  belligerent attitude towards the rest of the female population—as something
                     très légère, and to attempt to go a little
                  too far with her. Then she puts them down fast enough, and they in spite say
                  things about her, the discredit of which extends to our ladies generally—in short,
                  she exposes the country before foreigners. Then for the natives, she catches some
                  poor boy just loose upon the world, dances with, flatters him—for she has a knack
                  of flattering people without seeming to do so, especially by always appearing to
                  take an interest in what is said to her,—keeps him dangling about her for a while;
                  then some day he says or does something to make a fool of himself, and she
                  extinguishes him. The man gets a check of this sort at his entry into society that
                  is enough to make him a misogynist for life. And the little scenes that she used
                  to get up last summer with married men, just to make their wives jealous!'
               'Which, I suppose, is the reason none of your wives will let you speak to her?' said Ashburner, who
                  began to feel, he hardly knew why, a sentiment of partisanship for Mrs. Harrison.
                  'But granting that her face, as you describe it, is an index of her character, I
                  should draw from that exactly the opposite inference. I believe that the women who
                  make mischief in the way you mention are your unsensuous and passionless ones—that
                  the perfect flirt, single or married, must be a perfectly cold woman, because it
                  is only one of such a temperament who can thus trifle with others without danger
                  to herself. I speak hesitatingly, for all women are a mystery, and my experience
                  is as yet very limited; but such opportunities of observation as have fallen to my
                  lot confirm me in the theory.'
               Somewhat to Ashburner's surprise, his friend made no attempt to controvert his
                  argument. He only turned it aside, saying,—
               'Well, I don't like her at any rate. If I had no other reason, the way she talks
                  of her husband would be enough to make me.'
               'Oh, there is a Mr. Harrison, then? One hears so little of him——'
               'And sees so nothing of him, you may say.'
               'Exactly—that I took him for a mythological personage—a cousin of our Mrs.
                  Harris.'
               'Nevertheless I assure you Mr. Harrison exists very decidedly—a Wall Street
                  speculator, and well known as such by business people; a capital man behind a
                  trotter, an excellent judge of wine. Probably he will come here from the city once
                  or twice before we leave, and I shall find an opportunity to introduce you to him,
                  for he is really worth knowing, and considerable of a man, as we say—no fool at
                  all, except in the way he lets his wife bully him.'
               'If he made an unsuitable match that does not show his wisdom conspicuously.'
               'It was an unsuitable match, enough, Heaven knows. But when he proposed, he was in
                  the state of mind in which sensible people do the most foolish things. He was a
                  great man in stocks—controlled the market at one time—had been buying largely just
                  before the election of '44, when we all expected Henry Clay would get in with
                  plenty to spare. When Polk was elected, great was the terror of all respectable
                  citizens. My brother caught such a fright then, that I don't think he has fairly
                  recovered from it to this day. How the stocks did tumble down! Harrison had about
                  nine millions on his hands; he couldn't keep such a fund, and was forced to sell
                  it at any price, and lost just one-third. Just as he was beginning to pick himself
                  up after the shock, and wonder, like the sailor whom the conjurer blew up, what
                  was to come next, Mr. Whitey, of the Jacobin, now the Honourable
                  Pompey Whitey—and one doesn't see why he shouldn't be, for after all an editor is
                  not, generally speaking, a greater blackguard than most of our Congress
                  men—Whitey, I say, who for our sins is nominally attached to the Conservative
                  party, conceived the bright idea of overbidding the enemy for popular favor, and
                  proposed—no, he didn't actually propose in so many words, but only strongly hinted
                  at the desirableness of the measure—that there should be no more paying rent, and
                  a general division of property. I am not sure but there were some additional
                  suggestions on the expediency of abolishing the Christian religion and the
                  institution of matrimony, but that has nothing to do with politics. This last drop
                  in the bucket quite overflowed poor Harrison; so, as if he had said to himself,
                  'Let us eat and drink and get married, for to-morrow we shall have a proscription and novæ tabulæ,' he rushed off and proposed to Miss
                  Lewison.'
               'Then, if she accepted him after he lost his fortune, it shows she did not marry
                  for money, at any rate.'
               'There you have missed it. He lost the whole of a fortune, but not
                  the whole of his. He must have a million of dollars left, and a man
                  with that is not poor in any country—certainly it was a great catch for Miss
                  Lewison, without a red cent of her own. She jilted a Frenchman for him: the
                  unfortunate, or fortunate cast off had ordered much jewellery and other wedding
                  presents, and when left in the lurch he quietly proposed that, as he had no longer
                  any use for the articles, Harrison, who had, should take them off his hands; and
                  this offer was accepted. Very French in him to make it—don't you think so?—and
                  rather American in the other to take it. Well, I hope Harrison will come this way
                  soon; I should really like you to know him.'
               One or two days after this conversation Ashburner met his friend walking up and
                  down the interminable piazza of the Bath hotel, arm-in-arm with a middle-aged man,
                  who presented as great a contrast to Masters' usual associates, and to Masters
                  himself, as could well be imagined. The new-comer was short in stature and
                  square-built, rather ugly, and anything but graceful; he wore very good clothes,
                  but they were badly put on, and looked as if they had never undergone the brush
                  since leaving the tailor's hands; he wore no gloves, and in short had altogether
                  an unfashionable appearance. But though indubitably an unfashionable man, he did
                  not give you the impression of a vulgar one; there was nothing snobbish or
                  pretentious in his ugliness, and his cavernous black eye could have belonged only
                  to an intelligent and able man. Masters was joking or pressing him upon some
                  matter which he seemed unwilling to explain.
               'But do tell me,' said Harry, as they passed Ashburner, 'what have
                  you been doing to yourself? Sprained your finger by working too hard the night
                  before last packet day? or tumbled down from running too fast in Wall Street, and
                  not thinking which way you were going?' And he took in his own delicate white hand
                  the rough paw of the stranger, which was partly bound up as if suffering from some
                  recent injury.
               'If you must know,' said the other, stopping short in his walk, 'I broke my
                  knuckles on an Irish hackman's teeth. Last week the fellow drove me from the North
                  River boat to my house in Union Square, and I offered him seventy-five cents. He
                  was very insolent, and demanded a dollar. If I had had a dollar-note about me I
                  might have given it him, but it happened that I had only the six shillings in
                  change; and so, knowing that was two shillings more than his legal fare, I became
                  as positive as he. At last he seized my trunk, and then I could not resist the
                  temptation of giving him a left-hander that sent him clean down the steps into the
                  gutter.'
               'And then?'
               'He made a great bawling, and was beginning to draw a crowd about the house, when
                  I walked off to the nearest police-station; and as it turned out that my gentleman
                  was known as a troublesome character, they threatened to take away his license and
                  have him sent to Blackwell's Island if he didn't keep quiet: so he was too glad to
                  make himself scarce.'
               'By Jove; you deserve a testimonial from the city! I once got twenty dollars
                  damages from an omnibus-driver for running into my brougham, knocking off a wheel,
                  and dumping my wife and child into the street; and I thought that it was a great
                  exploit; but this performance of yours throws me into the shade.'
               
               Just then Masters caught sight of Ashburner, and excusing himself to the other,
                  rushed up to him.
               'Let me tell you now, before I forget it. We are going over to the glen to-morrow
                  to dine, and in fact spend the day there. You'll come, of course?'
               'With great pleasure,' said Ashburner; 'but pray don't let me take you away from
                  your friend.'
               'Oh, that's only Harrison.'
               'We' meant, of course, our set, with such foreign lions as the place afforded,
                  foremost among whom stood Ashburner and Le Roi. Masters, Ludlow, and some of the
                  other married men undertook to arrange it, always under the auspices of the
                  Robinsons.
               These Robinsons were evidently the leaders in every movement of the fashionables,
                  but why they were so was not so clear—at least, to Ashburner, though he had
                  abundant opportunities of studying the whole family. There was a father in some
                  kind of business, who occupied the usual position of New-York fathers; that is to
                  say, he made the money for the rest of the family to spend, and showed himself at
                  Oldport once a fortnight or so—possibly to pay the bills. There was a mother,
                  stout and good-humoured, rather vulgar, very fussy, and no end of a talker: she
                  always reminded Ashburner of an ex-lady mayoress. There were three or four young
                  men, sons and cousins, with the usual amount of white tie and the ordinary
                  dexterity in the polka; and two daughters, both well out of their teens. The
                  knowing ones said that one of these young ladies was to have six thousand a-year
                  by her grandfather's will, and the other little or nothing; but it was not
                  generally understood which was the heiress, and the old lady manœuvred with them
                  as if both were. This fact, however, was not sufficient to account
                  for their rank as belles, since there were
                  several other girls in their circle quite as well, or better off. Nor had their
                  wit or talent any share in giving them their position; on the contrary, people
                  used to laugh at the bêtises of the Robinsons,
                  and make them the butt of real or imaginary good stories. And, in point of birth,
                  they were not related to the Van Hornes, the Masters, the Vanderlyns, or any of
                  the old Dutch settlers; nor, like Bell, Ludlow, and others of their set, sprung
                  from the British families of long standing in the city. On the very morning of the
                  proposed excursion, Sedley was sneering at them for parvenus, and trying to amuse Ashburner at their expense with some
                  ridiculous stories about them.
               'And yet,' said the Englishman, 'these people are your leaders of fashion. You
                  can't do anything without them. They are the head of this excursion that we are
                  just going upon. Masters tells me 'the Robinsons are to be there,' as if that
                  settled the propriety and desirability of my being there also.'
               'As to that,' replied Sedley, 'fashionable society is a vast absurdity anywhere,
                  and it is only natural that absurd people should be at the head of it. The
                  Robinsons want to be fashionable—it is their only ambition—they try hard for it;
                  and it is generally the case that those who devote themselves to any pursuit have
                  some success in it, and only right that it should be so. Then they are hopelessly
                  good-natured folks, that you can't insult or quarrel with.' Sedley had so little
                  of this quality himself that he looked on the possession of it as a weakness
                  rather than a virtue. 'Then they are very fond of good living.'
               'Yes, I remember hearing Masters say that he always liked to feed Mrs. Robinson at
                  a ball,—it was a perfect pleasure to see her eat; and that when Löwenberg,in the pride of his heart, gave a three
                  days' déjeûner, or lunch, or whatever it was,
                  after his marriage, she was seen there three times each day.'
               'And he might have told you that they are as liberal of their own good things as
                  fond of those of others. Old Robinson has some first-rate Madeira, better by a
                  long chalk than that Vanderlyn Sercial that Harry Masters is always cramming down
                  your throat—metaphorically, I mean, not literally. The young men like to drop in
                  there of an evening, for they are sure to find a good supper and plenty of
                  materials ready for punch and polka. Then they always manage to catch the newest
                  lions. When I first saw you in their carriage alongside of Miss Julia, I said to
                  myself, 'That Englishman must be somebody, or the Robinsons would not have laid
                  hold of him so soon.' But their two seasons in Paris were the making of them,—and
                  the unmaking, too, in another sense; for they ate such a hole in their fortune—or,
                  rather, their French guests did for them—that it has never recovered its original
                  dimensions to this day. They took a grand hôtel, and gave magnificent balls, and
                  filled their rooms with the Parisian aristocracy. My uncle, who is an habitué of Paris, was at the Jockey Club one day, and
                  heard two exquisites talking about them. 'Connaissez-vous
                     ce Monsieur Robinson?' asked one. 'Est-ce que
                     je le connais!' replied the other, shrugging his shoulders. 'Je mange ses diners, je danse à ses bals; v'là tout.' Voilà
                     tout, indeed! That is just all our people get by keeping open house
                  for foreigners.'
               Just then Masters and Ludlow came up, the former under much excitement, and the
                  latter in a sad state of profanity. As they both insisted on talking at once, it
                  was some time before either was intelligible; at length Ashburner made out that
                  the excursion had met with a double check. In the first place, all the bachelors
                  had demanded that Mrs. Harrison should be of the party, in which they were
                  sustained by Löwenberg, who, though partly naturalized by his marriage, still
                  considered himself sufficiently a stranger to be above all spirit of clique. All
                  the other married men had objected, but the Harrisonites ultimately carried their
                  point. Of the two principal opponents, Ludlow was fairly talked off his feet by
                  the voluble patois of Löwenberg, and Masters
                  completely put down by the laconic and inflexible Sumner. So far so bad, but worse
                  was to follow; for after the horses had been ordered, and most of the ladies,
                  including the Robinsons, bonneted and shawled for the start, the lionne, who had, doubtless, heard of the unsuccessful
                  attempt to blackball her, and wished to make a further trial of her power,
                  suddenly professed a headache, whereupon her partisans almost unanimously declared
                  that, as she couldn't go, they didn't want to go; and thus the whole affair had
                  fallen through. Such was the substance of their melancholy intelligence, which
                  they had hardly finished communicating when a dea ex
                     machina appeared in the person of Mrs. Masters. She declared that it
                  was 'a shame,' and 'too bad,' and she 'had never,' &c.; and brought her
                  remarks to a practical conclusion by vowing that she would go, at any
                  rate, whoever chose to stay with that woman; 'and if no one else goes with us I'm
                  sure Mr. Ashburner will:' at which Ashburner was feign to express his readiness to
                  follow her to the end of the world, if necessary. Then she followed up her
                  advantage by sending a message to Sumner, which took him captive immediately; and
                  as she was well seconded by the Robinsons, who on their part had brought over Le
                  Roi, the party was soon reorganized pretty much on its original footing. When the
                  cause of all the trouble found herself
                  likely to be left in a minority, her headache vanished immediately, in time for
                  her to secure beaux enough to fill her barouche, and Mr. Harrison was put into a
                  carriage with the musicians. Mrs. Masters' vehicle was equally well filled; and
                  Harry, who, by his wife's orders, and much against his own will, had lent his
                  wagon and ponies to a young Southerner that was doing the amiable to Miss
                  Vanderlyn, had nothing left for it but to go on horseback; in which Ashburner
                  undertook to join him, having heard that there was a good bit of turf on the road
                  to the glen.
               'If you go that way,' said Mrs. Robinson, when he announced his intention, 'you
                  will have another companion. Mr. Edwards means to ride.'
               Ashburner had seen Edwards driving a magnificent trotter about Oldport, but could
                  not exactly fancy him outside of a horse, and conjectured that he would not make
                  quite so good a figure as when leading the redowa down a long ball-room. But the
                  hero of the dance was not forthcoming for some time, so they mounted, Masters his
                  pet Charlie, and the Englishman the best horse the stables of Oldport could
                  furnish, which it is hardly necessary to say was not too good a one, and were
                  leaving the village leisurely to give the carriages a good start of them, when
                  they heard close behind the patter of a light-stepping horse, and the next moment
                  Tom Edwards ranged up alongside. The little man rode a bright bay mare, rising
                  above fifteen hands, nearly full-blooded, but stepping steadily and evenly,
                  without any of that fidget and constant change of gait which renders so many
                  blood-horses anything but agreeable to ride, and carrying her head and tail to
                  perfection. He wore white cord trousers, a buff waistcoat, and a very natty white
                  hair-cloth cap. His coat was something between a summer sack and a cutaway,—the
                  colour, a rich green of some peculiar and indescribable shade. His spurs were very
                  small, but highly polished; and, instead of a whip, he carried a little red cane
                  with a carved ivory head. In his marvellously-fitting white buckskin glove he
                  managed a rein of some mysterious substance that looked like a compound of
                  indian-rubber and sea-weed. He sat his mare beautifully—with a little too much aim
                  at effect, perhaps; but gracefully and firmly at the same time. Ashburner glanced
                  at his own poor beast and wished for Daredevil, whose antics he had frequently
                  controlled with great success at Devilshoof; and Masters could not help looking a
                  little mortified, for Charlie was not very well off for tail, and had
                  recollections of his harness-days, which made him drop his head at times, and pull
                  like a steam-engine; besides which, Harry—partly, perhaps, from motives of
                  economy, partly, as he said, because he thought it snobbish to ride in handsome
                  toggery—always mounted in the oldest clothes he had, and with a well-used bridle
                  and saddle. But there was no help for it now, so off the three went together at a
                  fair trot, and soon overtook most of the party, Edwards putting his spurs into the
                  bay mare and showing off her points and his horsemanship at every successive
                  vehicle they passed.
               The piece of turf which Masters had promised his friend was not quite so smooth as
                  Newmarket heath, but it was more than three quarters of a mile long, and
                  sufficiently level to be a great improvement on the heavy and sandy road. So
                  unaccustomed, however, are Americans to 'riding on grass,' that Edwards could not
                  be persuaded to quit the main path until Masters had repeatedly challenged him to
                  a trot on the green. As soon as the two horses were fairly alongside they went
                  off, without waiting the signal from their riders, at a pace which kept Ashburner at a hand-gallop. For awhile
                  they were neck-and-neck, Masters and Charlie hauling against each other, the rider
                  with his weight thrown back in the stirrups and labouring to keep his 'fast crab'
                  from breaking, while the mare struck out beautifully with a moderate pull on the
                  rein. Then as Masters, who carried no whip, began to get his horse more in hand,
                  he raised a series of yells in true jockey fashion to encourage his own animal and
                  break up Edwards's. The mare skipped—Tom caught her in an instant, but she fell
                  off in her stroke from being held up, and Charlie headed her a length; then he
                  gave her her head, and she broke—once, twice, three times; and every time Masters
                  drew in his horse, who was now well settled down to his work, and waited for
                  Edwards to come on. At last, his mare and he both lost their tempers at once. She
                  started for a run, and he dropped the reins on her neck and let her go. At the
                  same instant Masters struck both spurs into Charlie, who was a rare combination of
                  trotter and runner, and away went the two at full gallop. Ashburner's hack was
                  left behind at once, but he could see them going on close together, tooling their
                  horses capitally; Edwards's riding being the more graceful, and Masters' the more
                  workmanlike; the mare leading a trifle, as he thought, and Charlie pressing her
                  close. Suddenly Edwards waved his cane as in triumph, but the next moment he and
                  his mare disappeared, as if the earth had swallowed them up, while Masters' horse
                  sheered off ten feet to the left.
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               LIFE AT A WATERING-PLACE.—THE DOG OF ALCIBIADES.
               WE left Tom Edwards mysteriously swallowed up, like a stage ghost down a
                  trap-door. And do you know, reader, I am very near leaving him so for good and
                  all, and suspending these sketches indefinitely—yea, even to the time of the
                  Mississippi dividends, or any other period beyond the Greek Calends that your
                  imagination can conjure up. For the wise men—and the wise women, too—of Gotham are
                  wroth with me, and one says that I am writing on purpose to libel this man or puff
                  that woman, and another charges me with sketching my own life in Fraser for self-glorification, and a third holds up the last number of
                     Pendennis at me and says, 'If you could write like
                     that, there would be some excuse for you, but you won't as long as
                  you live.' 'Alas, no!' said I, and was just going to burn my unfinished papers,
                  and vow that I would never again turn aside from my old craft of reviewing. But
                  then came reflection in the shape of a bottle of true Dutch courage—genuine
                  Knickerbocker Madeira—and said 'Why should you be responsible for resemblances you
                  never meant, if people will insist on finding them? Consider how prone readers,
                  and still more hearers who take their reading at second hand, are to suppose that
                  the author, be he great or small, must have represented himself in some one of
                     his personages.' True enough, Mr.
                  Bottle; for instance, any one of our fashionables will tell you that, 'our
                     spirituel and accomplished friend (as
                  Slingsby calls him), M. Le Vicomte Vincent Le Roi, is the hero of his thrilling
                  romance, Le Chevalier Bazalion—why they should, or
                  what possible resemblance they can find between the real man in New-York, and the
                  ideal one in the novel, it passeth my poor understanding to discover. Bazalion is
                  a stalwart six-footer, who goes about knocking people's brains out, scaling
                  inaccessible precipices, defending castles single-handed against a regiment or
                  two, and, by way of relaxation after this hard work, victimizing all the fair
                  dames and blooming damsels that come in his way—breaking the hearts of all the
                  women when he has broken the heads of all the men. Le Roi is a nice gentlemanly
                  man, of the ordinary size, who sings prettily and talks well, and makes himself
                  generally agreeable, and not at all dangerous in society—much the more Christian
                  and laudable occupation, it seems to me. If ever he does bore you, it is with his
                  long stories, not with a long pike as Bazalion used to do. Be the absurdity, then,
                  on the head of him who makes it; Qui vult decipi
                     decipiatur: if any one chooses to think that I am bodied forth under
                  the character of Harry Masters, and am, in consequence, a handsome young man, who
                  can do a little of everything instead of——but never mind what; your actor has not
                  yet sufficient standing to come down before the footlights, and have his little
                  bit of private chaff with the audience. Only this will I say, so help me N. P.
                  Willis, I mean to go on with these sketches till they are finished, provided
                  always that Fraser will take them so long, and that you continue to
                  read them, or fall into a sweet and soothing slumber over them, as the case may
                  be. For if we are all to shut up shop until we can write as well as Mr. Titmarsh,
                  there will be too extensive a bankruptcy of literary establishments.
               Before Ashburner could form any conjecture to account for the evanishment of
                  Edwards—indeed, before he could altogether realize it to himself—the little man's
                  head re-appeared above the ground, though there were no signs of his horse; and at
                  the same time Masters began to ride round the scene of the catastrophe, at an easy
                  canter, laughing immoderately. The Englishman shook up his brute into the best
                  gallop he could get out of him, and a few more strides brought him near enough to
                  see the true state of things. There was a marsh at no great distance, which
                  rendered the grass in the immediate vicinity moist and sloppy, and just in this
                  particular spot the action of the water had caved away a hole precisely large
                  enough to receive a horse and rider—it could hardly have made a more accurate
                  grave had they been measured for it—and so masked by a slight elevation in front,
                  that it was ten to one any person riding over the ground at such a rate, and
                  unacquainted with the position of this trap, but must fall headlong into it, as
                  Edwards had done. There was some reason to suspect that our friend Harry, who was
                  an habitual rider, and knew the environs of Oldport pretty well, and was fonder of
                  all short cuts and going over grass than most American horsemen are, had not been
                  altogether ignorant of the existence of the pitfall; it looked very much as if he
                  had led Edwards, who was no particular friend of his, purposely into it: but if
                  such was the case, he kept his own counsel. When the fallen man and mare had
                  scrambled out of the hole, which they did before Masters had offered to help them,
                  or Ashburner had time to be of any assistance, it appeared that she had sprained
                  her off fore-ankle, and he his nigh wrist. But they were close to the main road;
                  by good luck a boy was found to conduct
                  the animal home, and by a still greater piece of good luck the Robinsons' carriage
                  happened to be coming along just then, so the little man, who did not take up much
                  room, was popped into it, and as much pitied and mourned over by the lady
                  occupants as was père Guilleri in the French
                  song. And, to do him justice, even without this consolation, he had taken his
                  mishap very quietly from the first, as soon as he found himself not injured in any
                  vital, i. e. dancing part.
               Having finished their road at a more leisurely pace, our two horsemen arrived at
                  the glen after most of the company were assembled there. And as the place was one
                  of general resort, they noticed traces of other parties, people of the Simpson
                  class, hail-fellow-well-met men, who didn't dance but took it out in drinking, and
                  who, in their intercourse with the other sex, betrayed more vulgar familiarity and
                  less refined indecency than characterized the men and boys of Bell, Edwards,
                  Robinson, and Co.'s set. But of these it may be supposed that the set took no
                  heed. There was some really pretty scenery about the glen, but they took no heed
                  of that either—to be sure, most of them had seen it at least once before. They had
                  gone straight to the largest parlour of the house, and led, as usual, by the
                  indefatigable Edwards, had begun their tricks with the chairs. Booted and spurred
                  as he was, and with his arm in a sling, the ever-ready youth had already arranged
                  the German cotillon, taking the head himself, and constituting Sumner his second
                  in command. Masters was left out of this dance for coming too late, one of the
                  ladies told him; but he did not find the punishment very severe, as he rather
                  preferred walking with Ashburner, and showing him the adjacent woods. As they
                  passed out through several specimens of the Simpson species, who were smoking and
                  lounging around the door, Ashburner nearly ran over a very pretty young woman who
                  was coming up the steps. She was rather rustically, but not unbecomingly dressed,
                  and altogether so fresh and rosy that it was a treat to see her after the fine
                  town ladies, even the youngest of whom were beginning to look faded and jaded from
                  the dissipation of the season. But when she opened her mouth in reply to Masters'
                  affable salutation, it was like the girl in the fairy tale dropping toads and
                  adders, so nasal, harsh, and inharmonious was the tone in which she spoke.
               'That's Mrs. Simpson,' said Harry, as they went on, 'the Bird's wife. Pretty
                  little woman: what a pity she has that vulgar accent! She belongs to New England
                  originally: one finds many such girls here, every way charming until they begin to
                  talk. But I suppose you saw no difference between her and any of us. In your ears
                  we all speak with a barbarous accent—at least you feel bound to think so.'
               'What do you think, yourself? You have known a good many of my countrymen, and
                  heard them talk, and are able to make the comparison. Do you, or do you not, find
                  a difference?'
               'To say the truth, I do; it is a thing I never think seriously of denying, for it
                  seems to me neither singular nor to be ashamed of. You can tell an Irishman from a
                  Londoner by his accent: so you can a Scotchman: or a Yorkshireman for that matter:
                  why should you not be able to tell an American? The error of your countrymen
                  consists in attributing to all our people the nasal twang, which is almost
                  peculiar to one section of the country. If I were asked the peculiar
                  characteristic of a New-Yorker's speech, I should say monotone.
                     Notice any one of our young men—you
                  will find his conversational voice always pitched in the same key. Sumner goes on
                  at the same uniform growl, Edwards in an unvaried buzz. When I first landed in
                  England, I was struck with the much greater variety of tone one hears in ordinary
                  conversation. Your women, especially, seemed to me always just going to sing. And
                  I fancied the address of the men affected—just as, very likely, this monotone of
                  ours seems affected to you.'
               'What I remark most is a hardness and dryness of voice, as if the extremes of
                  climate here had an injurious effect on the vocal organs.'
               'Perhaps they do; and yet I think you will find a better average of singers, male
                  and female, in our society than in yours, notwithstanding our fashionables are so
                  engrossed by dancing. Holla! here's Harrison. How are you, old fellow? and how are
                  the Texas Inconvertible?'
               It was indeed the broker, wandering moodily alone. What had he in common with the
                  rest of the company—the fops and flirts, the dancing men and dancing women? The
                  males all snubbed and despised him, from tall Bell, down to little Robinson; the
                  women were hardly conscious of his existence. He knew, too, that he could thrash
                  any man there in a fair stand-up fight, or buy out any three of them, ay, or talk
                  any of them down in the society of sensible and learned people; and this very
                  consciousness of superiority only served to embitter his position the more. There
                  were other sets, doubtless, who would have welcomed him gladly, but either they
                  were not sufficiently to his taste to attract him, or he was in no mood to receive
                  consolation from their sympathy. So he wandered alone, untouched by the charming
                  scenery about him—a man whom nobody cared for; and when Masters addressed him
                  genially, and in an exuberance of spirits threw his arm over the other's neck as
                  they walked side by side, the broker's heart seemed to expand towards the man who
                  had shown him this slight profession of kindness, his intelligent eyes lighted up,
                  and he began to talk out cheerfully and unassumingly all that was in him.
               Harrison's own narrative of his personal prowess, as well as the qualified
                  panegyric pronounced upon him by Masters, had led Ashburner to expect to find in
                  him a manly person with some turn for athletic sports and good living, but no
                  particular intellectual endowments beyond such as his business demanded. He was,
                  therefore, not a little astonished at (inasmuch as he was altogether unprepared
                  for) the variety of knowledge and the extent of mental cultivation which the
                  broker displayed as their conversation went on. They talked of the hills and
                  valleys, and ravines and water-courses around them, and Harrison compared this
                  place with others in a way that showed a ready observer of the beauties of nature.
                  They talked of Italy, and Harrison had at his fingers' ends the principal palaces
                  in every city, and the best pictures in every palace. They talked of Greece, and
                  Harrison quoted Plato. They talked of England and France, and Harrison displayed a
                  familiar acquaintance, not merely with the statistics of the two countries, but
                  also with the habits and characteristics of their people. Finally, they talked on
                  the puzzling topic of American society—puzzling in its transition state and its
                  singular contrasts—and, whether the broker's views were correct or not, they were
                  anything but commonplace or conventional.
               'Our fashionable society has been all a mistake hitherto,' said Harry (Ashburner
                  could not well make out whether there
                  was a spice of irony in his observation); Mrs. Masters and some others are going
                  to reform it indifferently. The women thus far have been lost sight of after
                  marriage, and have left the field to the young girls. Now they are beginning to
                  wake up to their rights and privileges.'
               'They will not remedy any of the present evils in that way,' answered Harrison,
                  apparently addressing himself to Ashburner, but he seemed to be talking at
                  Masters, and through him at Masters' wife, or his own, or both of them. 'Our
                  theory and practice was that a young girl should enjoy herself in all freedom;
                  that her age and condition were those of pleasure and frolic—of dissipation, if
                  you will—that after her marriage she, comparatively speaking, retired from the
                  world, not through any conventional rule or imaginary standard of propriety, but
                  of her own free will and the natural course of things; because the cares of
                  maternity and her household gave her sufficient employment at home. A woman who
                  takes a proper interest in her family gives them the first place in her thoughts,
                  and is always ready to talk about them. Now these domestic details are the
                  greatest possible bore to a mere fashionable casual drawing-room acquaintance.
                  Hence you see that the French, whose chief aim is to talk well in a drawing-room
                  or an opera box, utterly detest and unmercifully ridicule everything connected
                  with domesticity or home life. On the other hand, if a married woman never talks
                  about these things or lets you think of them, she does not take a proper interest
                  in her family. No, the fault of youth is with the other sex. There are too few men
                  about, and too many boys. And the more married belles there are the more will the
                  boys be encouraged. For your married belles like to have men about them younger
                  than themselves selves—it makes them appear younger, or at least they think so;
                  and besides, such youths are more easily managed and more subservient. But, still
                  worse, the more these boys usurp the place of men in society, the more boyish and
                  retrograde will the few men become who continue to divide the honours of society
                  with them. When Plato enumerated among the signs of a republic in the last stage
                  of decadence, that the youth imitate and rival old men, and the old men let
                  themselves down to a level with the youth, he anticipated exactly the state of
                  things that has come to pass among us. Look at that little friend of yours with
                  the beard—I don't mean Edwards, but an older man about his size.'
               'Dicky Bleecker, I suppose you mean,' growled Masters: 'he's as much your
                  friend—or your wife's—as he is mine.'
               'Well, he is my contemporary, I may say; perhaps five years at most my junior.
                  What perceptible sign of mature age or manliness is there about him? In what is he
                  superior to or distinguishable from young Snelling, who but this season rejoices
                  in his first white tie and first horse, and the fruits of his first course of
                  dancing lessons?'
               'Well, but consider,' says Masters, who was always ready to take up any side of an
                  argument—it is one of the first criticisms Ashburner made on American
                  conversation, that the men seemed to talk for victory rather than for truth—'it
                  stands to reason, that an intelligent married woman must be better able than a
                  girl to converse with a mature man, and her conversation must have more attraction
                  for him. As to our boys coming out too soon, doubtless they do, but that depends
                  not on the persons ready to receive them, but on the general social system of the
                  country which pushes them into the
                  world so early. For instance, I was left my own master at twenty-one. So, too,
                  with the want of proper progress and growth in knowledge of the men. It is and
                  must be so with the man of fashion everywhere, for he is not occupied in learning
                  things that have a tendency to develope or improve his mind, but the contrary. I
                  myself have seen Frenchmen of fifty as easily amused and as eager after trifles as
                  boys.'
               'Frenchmen!' sneered the other; 'yes, but they are boys all their
                  lives, except in innocence.'
               'Very amusing and pleasant, at any rate; the best people for travelling 
                     accquaintances
                     acquaintances
                   that I know.'
               'Exactly—very pleasant to know for a little while. I have met with a great many
                  Frenchmen who impressed me favourably, and I used to think as you say, what
                  amusing people they were, but I never had occasion to live with one for any length
                  of time without finding him a bore and a nuisance. A Frenchman turns himself
                  inside out, as it were, at once. He shows off all that there is to show on first 
                     accquaintance
                     acquaintance
                  . You see the best of him immediately, and afterwards there is nothing
                  left but repetitions of the same things, and eternal dissertations on himself and
                  his own affairs. He is like a wide shallow house, with a splendid front externally
                  and scanty furniture inside.'
               'Very true, and an Englishman (don't blush, Ashburner) is like a suite of
                  college-rooms in one of his own university towns—a rusty exterior, a dark narrow
                  passage along which you find your way with difficulty; and when you do get in,
                  jolly and comfortable apartments open suddenly upon you; and as you come to
                  examine them more carefully, you discover all sorts of snug, little,
                  out-of-the-way closets and recesses, full of old books and old wine, and all
                  things rich and curious. But the entrance is uninviting to a casual 
                     accquaintance
                     acquaintance
                  . Now, when you find an American of the right stamp' (here Masters' hands
                  were accidentally employed in adjusting his cravat), 'he hits the proper medium,
                  and is accessible as a Frenchman and as true as an 
                     Englishnan
                     Englishman
                  .'
               Ashburner was going to express a doubt as to the compatibility of the two
                  qualities, when Harrison struck in again.
               'On that account I never could see why Frenchmen should be dreaded as dangerous in
                  society. They fling out all their graces at once, exhaust all their powers of
                  fascination, and soon begin to be tiresome. How many cases I have seen where a
                  Frenchman fancied he was making glorious headway in a lady's affections, and that
                  she was just ready to fall into his arms, when she was only ready to fall asleep
                  in his face, and was civil to him only from a great sacrifice of inclination to
                  politeness.'
               'Very pleasant it must be to a lady,' said Ashburner, 'that a man should be at the
                  same time wearying her to death with his company, and perilling her reputation out
                  of doors by his language.'
               'By Jove, it's dinner time!' exclaimed Masters, pulling out a microscopic Geneva
                  watch. 'I thought the clock of my inner man said as much.' And back they hurried
                  through the woods to the Glen House, but were as late for the dinner as they had
                  been for the dance. Harrison and Masters found seats at the lower end of the
                  table, where they established themselves to ether, and began, à propos of Edwards's misadventure, to talk horse,
                  either because they had exhausted all other subjects, or because they did not
                  think the company worthy a better one. Mrs. Masters beckoned Ashburner up to a
                  place by her, but, somehow, he found himself opposite Mrs. Harrison's eyes, and though he could not
                  remember anything she said ten minutes after, her conversation, or looks, or both,
                  had the effect of transferring to her all the interest he was beginning to feel
                  for her husband—of whom, by the way, she took no more notice than if he did not
                  belong to her.
               'Poor Harrison!' said Masters, as he and Ashburner were walking their horses
                  leisurely homeward that evening (they both had too much sense to ride fast after
                  dinner), 'he is twice thrown away! He might have been a literary gentleman and a
                  lover of art, living quietly on a respectable fortune; but his father would make
                  him go into business. He might be a model family man, and at the same time a very
                  entertaining member of society; but his wife has snubbed and suppressed him for
                  her own exaltation. If, instead of treating him thus, she would only show him a
                  little gratitude as the source of all her luxury and magnificence, her dresses and
                  jewellery, her carriage and horses (what a pair of iron-greys she does drive!) and
                  all her other splendours,—if she would only be proud of him as the great
                  broker—not to speak of his varied knowledge, of which she might also well be
                  proud,—if she would take some little pains to interest herself in his pleasures
                  and to bring him forward in society,—how easily she could correct and soften his
                  little uncouthness of person and dress, if she would take the trouble! Why should
                  she be ashamed of him? He is older than she—how much? ten years perhaps, or twelve
                  at most. He is not a beauty; but in a man, I should say, mind comes before good
                  looks; and how infinitely superior he is in mind and soul to any of the frivolous
                  little beaux, native or foreign, whom she delights to draw about her!'
               'I fear I never shall be able to regard Mr. Harrison with as much respect as you
                  do. It may be ignorance, but I never could see much difference between a
                  speculator in stocks and a gambler.'
               'When a man is in his predicament domestically there are three things, to one,
                  two, or all of which he is pretty sure to take—drink, gambling, and horses.
                  Harrison is too purely intellectual a man to be led away by the vulgar animal
                  temptation of liquor, though he has a good cellar, and sometimes consoles himself
                  with a snug bachelor dinner. Stock-jobbing is, as you say, only another sort of
                  gambling, and this is his vice: at the same time you will consider that it is his
                  business, to which he was brought up. Then, for absolute relaxation, he has his
                  'fast crab.' Put him behind his 2'45" stepper, and he is happy for an hour or two,
                  and forgets his miseries—that is to say, his wife.'
               'But you talk as if his marriage was the cause of his speculations, whereas you
                  told me the other day that his speculations were the indirect cause of his
                  marriage.'
               'You are right: I believe the beginning of that bad habit must be set down to his
                  father's account; but the continuance of it is still chargeable on his wife. I
                  have heard him say myself, that he would have retired from business long ago but
                  for Mrs. Harrison—that is to say, he had to go on making money to supply her
                  extravagance.'
               One fine morning there was a great bustle and flurry; moving of trunks, and paying
                  of bills, and preparations for departure. The fashionables were fairly starved
                  out, and had gone off in a body. The brilliant equipages of Ludlow and Löwenberg,
                  the superfine millinery of the Robinsons, the song and story of the Vicomte, the
                  indefatigable revolutions of Edwards, were all henceforth to be lost to the
                  sojourners at Oldport. Mr. Grabster heeded not this practical protest against the
                  error of his ways. He had no difficulty
                  in filling the vacant rooms, for a crowd of people from all parts of the Union
                  constantly thronged Oldport, attracted by its reputation for coolness and
                  salubrity; and he rather preferred people from the West and South, as they knew
                  less about civilized life, and were more easily imposed upon. To be sure, even
                  they would find out in time the deficiencies of his establishment, and report them
                  at home; but meanwhile he hoped to fill his pockets for two or three seasons under
                  cover of The Sewer's puffs, and then, when business fell off, to
                  impose on his landlord with some plausible story, and obtain a lowering of his
                  rent.
               Some few—a very few—of 'our set' were left. Our friend Harry stayed, because the
                  air of the place agreed remarkably with the infant hope of the Masters; and a few
                  of the beaux remained—among them Sumner, Bell, and Sedley—either out of friendship
                  for Masters or retained by the attractions of Mrs. Masters, or those of Mrs.
                  Harrison; for the lionne stayed of course, it
                  being her line to do just whatever the exclusives did not do. But though Masters
                  remained, he was not disposed to suffer in silence. All this while The
                     Sewer had been filled with letters lauding everything about the Bath
                  Hotel; and communications equally disinterested. and couched in the same tone, had
                  found their way into some more respectable prints. Masters undertook the thankless
                  task of undeceiving the public. He sat down one evening and wrote off a spicy
                  epistle to The Blunder and Bluster, setting forth how things really
                  were at Oldport. Two days after when the New-York mail arrived, great was the
                  wrath of Mr. Grabster. He called into council the old gentleman with the melodious
                  daughter, The Sewer reporters, and some other boarders who were in
                  his confidence; and made magnificent but rather vague promises, of what he would
                  do for the man who should discover the daring individual who had thus bearded him
                  in his very den: simultaneously he wrote to The Blunder and
                     Bluster, demanding the name of the offender. With most American
                  editors, such a demand (especially if followed up with a good dinner or skilfully
                  applied tip to the reporter or correspondent) would have been perfectly
                  successful. But he of The Blunder and Bluster was a much higher
                  style of man. As Masters once said of him, he had, in his capacity of the first
                  political journalist in the country, associated so much with gentlemen, that he
                  had learned to be something of a gentleman himself. Accordingly he replied to Mr.
                  Grabster, in a note more curt than courteous, that it was impossible to comply
                  with his request. So the indignant host was obliged to content himself for the
                  time with ordering The Sewer to abuse the incognito. Before many
                  days, however, he obtained the desired information through another source, in this
                  wise.
               Oldport had its newspaper, of course. Every American village of more than ten
                  houses has its newspaper. Mr. Cranberry Fuster, who presided over the destinies of
                     The Oldport Daily Twaddler, added to this honourable and amiable
                  occupation the equally honourable and amiable one of village attorney. Though his
                  paper was in every sense a small one, he felt and talked as big as if it had been
                     The Times, or The Moniteur, or The Blunder
                     and Bluster. He held the President of the United States as something
                  almost beneath his notice, and was in the habit of lecturing the Czar of Russia,
                  the Emperor of Austria, and other foreign powers, in true Little Pedlington style.
                  Emboldened by the impunity which attended these assaults, he undertook to try his
                  hand on matters nearer home, and boldly essayed one season to write down the polka and redowa as indecent and
                  immoral. But here he found, as Alexander, Napoleon, and other great men, had done
                  before him, that there is a limit to all human power. He might better have tried
                  to write off the roof of the Bath Hotel, which was rather a fragile piece of work,
                  and might have been carried away by much less wind than usually served to distend
                  the columns of The Twaddler. The doughty Tom Edwards snapped his
                  heels, so to speak, in the face of the mighty editor, and the exclusives continued
                  to polk more frantically than ever in the teeth of his direst fulminations. One
                  practical effect, however, these home diatribes had, which his luminous sallies on
                  foreign affairs altogether failed to effect—they put money into his pocket. The
                  next thing the Americans like to hearing themselves well praised, is to hear
                  somebody, even if it be themselves, well abused; and accordingly, on the mornings
                  when Mr. Fuster let out an anti-polka article, the usually small circulation of
                  his small sheet was multiplied by a very large factor—almost every stranger bought
                  a copy, the million to see the abuse of the fashionables, the fashionables to see
                  the abuse of themselves.
               Masters in the course of his almost annual visits to Oldport Springs, had been
                  frequently amused by the antics of this formidable gentleman, and had laudably
                  contributed to make them generally known. Once, when Mr. Fuster had politely
                  denominated the Austrian emperor 'a scoundrel,' Harry moved The Blunder and
                     Bluster to say, that it was very sorry for that potentate, who would
                  undoubtedly be overwhelmed with mortification when he learned that The
                     Twaddler entertained such an opinion of him. Whereupon Fuster, who was
                  of a literal dulness absolutely joke-proof, struck off a flaming article on 'the
                  aristocratic sympathies of The Blunder
                  and Bluster, which, like a British Whig and Federal journal as it
                  was, always came to the rescue of tyrants and despots,' &c. &c. On another
                  occasion—the very morning of a state election—The Twaddler had
                  announced, with a great flourish, 'that before its next sheet was issued Mr. Brown
                  would be invested with the highest honours that the state could confer upon him.'
                  But even American editors are not always infallible; Mr. Brown came out sadly in
                  the minority, and the day after The Blunder and Bluster had a
                  little corner paragraph to this effect:—
               'We sincerely regret to see that our amusing little contemporary, THE
                  OLDPORT DAILY TWADDLER, has suspended publication.'
               At this Mr. Fuster flared up fearfully, and threatened to sue The Blunder
                     and Bluster for libel.
               Now this magniloquent editor, who professed to be a great moral reformer at home,
                  and to regulate the destinies of nations abroad, was in truth the mere creature
                  and toady of Mr. Grabster, the greater part of the revenue of his small
                  establishment being derived from printing the bills and advertisements of the Bath
                  Hotel. As in duty bound, therefore, he set to work to abuse the anonymous
                  assailant of that 
                     actrociously
                     atrociously
                  -kept house, calling him a quantity of heterogeneous names, and more than
                  insinuating that he was a person who had never been in good society, and did not
                  know what good living was, because he found fault with the living at
                  the Bath Hotel. The leader wound up with a more than ever exaggerated eulogy of
                  Mr. Grabster and his 'able and gentlemanly assistants.' Masters happened to get
                  hold of this number of The Twaddler one evening when he had nothing
                  to do, and those dangerous implements, pen, ink, and paper, were within his reach.
                  Beginning to note down the absurdities
                  and non sequiturs in Mr. Fuster's article, he
                  found himself writing a very chaffy letter to The Twaddler. He had
                  an unfortunate talent for correspondence had Masters, like most of his countrymen;
                  so, giving the reins to his whim, he finished the epistle, making it very spicy
                  and satirical, with a garnish of smiles and classical quotations—altogether rather
                  a neat piece of work, only it might have been objected to as a waste of
                  cleverness, and building a large wheel to break a very small bug upon. Then he
                  dropped it into the post-office himself, never dreaming that Cranberry would
                  publish it, but merely anticipating the wrath of the little-great man on receiving
                  such a communication. It chanced, however, not long before, that Masters, in the
                  course of some legal proceedings, had been to sign papers and 'take fifty cents'
                  worth of affidavit,' as he himself phrased it, before Mr. Fuster in his legal
                  capacity. The latter gentleman had thus the means of identifying, by comparison,
                  the handwriting of the pseudonymous letter. In a vast fit of indignation, not
                  unmingled with satisfaction, he brought out next day Harry's letter at full
                  length, to the great peril of the Latin quotations, and then followed it up with a
                  rejoinder of his own, in which he endeavoured to take an attitude of sublime
                  dignity, backed up by classical quotations also, to show that he understood Latin
                  as well as Masters. But the attempt was as unsuccessful as it was elaborate, for
                  his anger broke through in every other sentence, making the intended 'smasher' an
                  extraordinary compound of superfine writing and vulgar abuse.
               
                  When, in the course of human events (he began) it becomes necessary for men
                     holding our lofty and responsible position to stoop to the chastisement of
                     pretentious ignorance and imbecility, we shall not be found to shrink from the
                     task. The writer of the above letter is Mr. Henry Masters, a young man of
                     property, and a Federal Whig. He insinuates that we are very stupid. It's no
                     such thing; we are not stupid a bit, and we mean to show Mr. M. as much before
                     we have done with him. Mr. Masters is a pompous young aristocrat, and Mr.
                     Grabster is more of a gentleman than he is—and so are we too for that matter.
                     He says the Bath Hotel is a badly kept house. We say it isn't, and we know a
                     great deal better than he does. We have dined there very often, and found the
                     fare and attendance excellent; and so did the Honourable Theophilus Q. Smith,
                     of Arkansas, last summer, when he came to enjoy the invigorating breezes of
                     this healthful locality. That distinguished and remarkable man expressed
                     himself struck with the arrangements of the Bath Hotel, which left him no
                     cause, he said, to regret the comforts of his western home. But this
                     establishment cannot please the fastidious Mr. Masters! O tempora, O Moses! as Cicero said to Cataline, quosque tandem?
                  
               
               And so on for three columns.
               Likewise The Sewer, which had begun to blackguard The
                     Blunder and Bluster's correspondent while he remained under the shelter
                  of his pseudonym, now that his name was known, came out with double virulence, and
                  filled half a sheet with filthy abuse of Harry, including collateral assaults on
                  his brother, grandmother, and second cousins, and most of the surviving members of
                  his wife's family. But as Masters never read The Sewer, this part
                  of the attack was an utter waste of Billingsgate so far as he was concerned. What
                  did surprise and annoy him was to find that The Inexpressible,
                  which though well-known to be a stupid, was generally considered a decent paper,
                  had taken the enemy's side, and published some very impertinent paragraphs about
                  him Afterwards he discovered that he had been the victim of a principle.
                     The Inexpressible and Blunder and Bluster had a
                  little private quarrel of their own, and the former felt bound to attack
                  everything in any way connected with the latter.
               Nevertheless Masters was not very much distressed even at this occurrence, for a reason which we
                  shall now give at length, and which will at the same time explain the propriety of
                  the heading we have given to this number. While 
                     evreybody
                     everybody
                   was reading The Sewer and The Twaddler,
                  and the more benevolent were pitying Harry for having started such a nest of
                  editorial and other blackguards about his ears, and the more curious were
                  wondering whether he would leave the hotel and resign the field of battle to the
                  enemy, our friend really cared very little about the matter, except so far as he
                  could use it for a blind to divert attention from another affair which he had on
                  hand, and which it was of the greatest importance to keep secret, lest it should
                  draw down the interference of the local authorities: in short, he had a defiance
                  to mortal combat impending over him, which dangerous probability he had brought
                  upon himself in this wise.
               Among the beaux who remained after the Hegira of the fashionables, was a Mr.
                  Storey Hunter, who had arrived at Oldport only just before that great event, for
                  he professed to be a traveller and a travelling man, and, to keep up the
                  character, never came to a place when other people did, but always popped up
                  unexpectedly in the middle, or at the end, of a season, as if he had just dropped
                  from the moon, or arrived from the antipodes. He had an affectation of being
                  foreign—not English, or French, or German, or like any particular European nation,
                  but foreign in a general sort of way, something not American; and always, on
                  whichever side of the Atlantic he was, hailed from some locality; at one time
                  describing himself in hotel books as from England, at another as from Paris, at
                  another from Baden—from anywhere, in short, except his own native village in
                  Connecticut. In accordance with this principle, moreover, he carefully eschewed
                  the indigenous habits of dress; and while all the other men appeared at the balls
                  in dress coats, and black or white cravats, he usually displayed a flaming scarlet
                  or blue tie, a short frock coat, and yellow or brown trousers. A man six feet
                  high, and nearly as many round, is a tolerably conspicuous object in most places,
                  even without any marked peculiarities of dress; and when to this it is added, that
                  Mr. Hunter exhibited on his shirt-front and watch-chain trinkets enough to stock a
                  jeweller's shop, and that he was always redolent of the most fashionable perfumes,
                  it may be supposed that he was not likely to escape notice at Oldport. His age no
                  one knew exactly; some of the old stagers gave him forty years and more, but he
                  was in a state of wonderful preservation, had a miraculous dye for his whiskers,
                  and a perpetually fresh colour in his cheeks. Sedley used to say he rouged, and
                  that you might see the marks of it inside his collar; but this may have been only
                  an accident in shaving. He rather preferred French to English in conversation; and
                  with good reason, for when he used the former language, you might suppose (with
                  your eyes shut) that you were talking to a very refined gentleman, whereas, so
                  soon as he opened his mouth in the vernacular, the provincial Yankee stood
                  revealed before you. As to his other qualities and merits, he appeared to have
                  plenty of money, and was an excellent and indefatigable dancer. Ashburner, when he
                  saw him spin round morning after morning, and night after night, till he all but
                  melted away himself, and threatened to drown his partner, thought he must have the
                  laudable motive of wishing to reduce his bulk, which, however, continued
                  undiminished. Notwithstanding his travels and accomplishments, which, especially
                  the dancing, were sufficient to give
                  him a passport to the best society, there were some who regarded him with very
                  unfavourable eyes, more particularly Summer and Masters. Supposing this to be
                  merely another of the frivolous feuds that existed in the place, and among 'our
                  set,' Ashburner was not over anxious or curious to know the cause of it. Nor, if
                  he had been, did the parties seem disposed to afford him such information. Masters
                  had, indeed, observed one day that that Storey Hunter was the
                  greatest blackguard in Oldport, except The Sewer reporters; but as
                  he had already said the same thing of half-a-dozen men, his friend was not
                  deterred thereby from making Hunter's acquaintance—or rather, from accepting it;
                  the difficulty at Oldport being, not to make the acquaintance of any
                  man in society. And he found the fat dandy, to all appearance, an innocent and
                  good-natured person, rather childish for his years, and well illustrating
                  Harrison's assertion, that the men in fashionable life rather retrograded than
                  developed from twenty to forty; but in no apparent respect formidable, save for a
                  more than American tendency to gossip. He had some story to the prejudice of every
                  one, but seemed to tell all these stories just as an enfant terrible might, without fully understanding them, or at all
                  heeding the possible consequences of repeating them.
               The glory of the balls had departed with Edwards and the Robinsons, but the
                  remaining fashionables kept up their amusement with much vigour; and the absence
                  of the others, though detracting much from the brilliancy of the place, was in
                  some respects the gain of a loss. Bell came out in all his glory now that most of
                  the young men were gone. With his graceful figure, neat dress, and ever-ready
                  smile and compliment, he looked the very ideal of the well-drilled man of fashion.
                  Sumner ner, though he could not have talked less if he had been an English heavy
                  dragoon-officer, or an Hungarian refugee, understanding no language but his own,
                  was very useful for a quiet way he had of arranging everything beforehand without
                  fuss or delay, and, moreover, had the peculiar merit (difficult to explain, but
                  which we have all observed in some person at some period of our lives) of
                     being good company without talking. Masters, with less pretence
                  and display than he had before exhibited, showed an energy and indefatigableness
                  almost equal to Le Roi's; whatever he undertook, he 'kept the pot a boiling.' In
                  short, the people of 'our set,' who were left, went on among themselves much
                  better than before, because the men's capabilities were not limited to dancing,
                  and the women had less temptation to be perpetually dressing. Besides, the removal
                  of most of the fashionables had encouraged the other portions of the transient
                  population to come more forward and exhibit various specimens of primitive
                  dancing, and other traits worth observing. One evening there was a 'hop' at the
                  Bellevue. Ashburner made a point of always looking in at these assemblies for an
                  hour or so, and scrutinizing the company with the coolness and complacency which
                  an Englishman usually assumes in such places, as if all the people there were made
                  merely for his amusement. Masters, who had literally poked the heel off one of his
                  boots, and thereby temporarily disabled himself, was lounging about with him,
                  making observations on men, women, and things generally.
               'You wouldn't think that was only a girl of seventeen,' said Harry, as a
                  languishing brunette, with large, liquid, black eyes, and a voluptuous figure,
                  glided by them in the waltz. 'How soon these Southerners develope into women! They
                  beat the Italians even.'
               
               'I wonder the young lady has time to grow, she dances so much. I have watched her
                  two or three evenings, and she has never rested a moment except when the music
                  stopped. Something must suffer, it seems to me. Does her mind develope uniformly
                  with her person? She is a great centre of attraction, I observe; is it only for
                  her beauty and dancing?'
               'I suppose a beautiful young woman, with fifty or sixty thousand a-year, may
                  consider mental accomplishments as superfluous. She knows, perhaps, as much as a
                  Russian woman of five-and-twenty. How much that is, you, who have been on the
                  Continent, know.'
               'Ah, an heiress; acres of cotton-fields; thousands of negroes, and so on.'
               'Exactly. I put the income down at half of what popular report makes it; these
                  Southern fortunes are so uncertain; the white part of the property (that is to
                  say, the cotton) varies with the seasons; and the black part takes to itself legs
                  and runs off occasionally. But, at any rate, there is quite enough to make her a
                  great prize, and an object of admiration and attention to all the little men—not
                  to the old hands, like Bell and Summer; they are built up in their own conceit,
                  and wouldn't marry Sam Weller's 'female marchioness,' unless she made love to them
                  first, like one of Knowles's heroines. But the juveniles are crazy about her.
                  Robinson went off more ostentatiously love-sick than any man of his size I ever
                  saw; and Sedley is always chanting her praises—the only man, woman, or child, he
                  was ever known to speak well of. I don't think any of them will catch her. Edwards
                  might dance into her heart, perhaps, if he were a little bigger; but as it is, she
                  will, probably, make happy and rich some one in her own part of the world. She
                  says the young men there suit her better, because they are 'more gentlemanly' than
                  we 
                     Notherners
                     Northerners
                  .'
               'I have heard many strangers say the same thing,' said Ashburner, prudently
                  refraining from expressing any opinion of his own, for he knew Masters'
                  anti-Southern feelings.
               'If education has anything to do with being a gentleman, then, whether you take
                     education in the highest sense, as the best discipline and
                  expansion of the mind by classical and scientific study; or in the utilitarian
                  sense, as the acquisition of useful knowledge, and a practical acquaintance with
                  men and things; or in the fine-lady sense, as the mastery of airs, and graces, and
                  drawing room accomplishments; or in the moralist's sense, as the curbing of our
                  mischievous propensities, and the energizing of our good ones—in every case, we
                  are more of gentlemen than the Southerners. If the mere possession of wealth, and
                  progress in the grosser and more material arts of civilization, have anything to
                  do with it, then, too, we are more of gentlemen. Their claims rest on two grounds:
                  first, they live on the unpaid labour of others, while we all work, more or less,
                  for ourselves, holding idleness as disgraceful as they do labour; secondly, they
                  are all the time fighting duels.'
               'Are there no duels ever fought in this part of the country?'
               'Scarcely any since Burr shot Hamilton. Alexander Hamilton was one of our greatest
                  men, and his death excited a feeling throughout the Northern States which put down
                  the practice almost entirely; and I certainly think it a step forward in real
                  civilization.'
               'Do you mean to say that it is with you as with us, where, if a man becomes so
                  involved in a quarrel that he is challenged, it is against him and almost ruin to
                     him whether he fights or does not
                  fight? Or is public opinion decidedly in favour of the man who does not fight, and
                  against the man who does? For instance, suppose you were challenged yourself?'
               'A man can't say beforehand what he would do in an emergency of the kind; but my
                  impression is that I should not fight, and that the opinion of society would bear
                  me out.'
               'But suppose a man insulted your wife, or sister?'
               'It is next door to impossible that an American gentleman should do such a thing;
                  but if he did, I should consider that he had reduced himself to the level of a
                  snob, and should treat him as I would any snob in the streets,—knock him down, if
                  I was able; and if I wasn't, take the law of him: and if a man had wronged me
                  irreparably, I fancy I should do as these uncivilized Southerners themselves do in
                  such a case,—shoot him down in the street wherever I could catch him. What sense
                  or justice is there in a duel? It is as if a man stole your coat, and instead of
                  having him put into prison, you drew lots with him whether you or he should
                  go.'
               'But suppose a man was spreading false reports about you; suppose he said you were
                  no gentleman, or that you had cheated somebody?'
               'Bah!' replied Masters, dexterously evading the most important part of the
                  question, 'if I were to fight all the people that spread false reports about me, I
                  should have my hands full. There is a man in this room that slandered me as
                  grossly as he could four years ago, and was very near breaking off my marriage.
                  That fat man there with all the jewellery—Storey Hunter.'
               'Indeed!' exclaimed the other, really surprised, for he had just seen Mrs. Masters
                  conversing with the ponderous exquisite apparently on most amicable terms.
               'Yes, and it was entirely gratuitous. I never gave the scamp any provocation. By
                  Jupiter!' Masters turned very white and then very red, 'if he isn't dancing with
                  my wife! His impudence is too much, and——I believe one of our women would put up
                  with anything from a man here if he can only dance well. They have no
                  self-respect.'
               Masters appeared to have very little himself at that moment, and not to care much
                  what he said or did. He trembled all over with rage, and his friend expected to
                  see an immediate outbreak; but, as if recollecting himself, he suddenly stammered
                  out something about the necessity of changing his boots, and limped off
                  accordingly for that purpose. He was not gone more than five minutes, but in that
                  time had contrived not only to supply his pedal deficiency, but also to take a
                  drink by way of calming himself; and after the drink he took a turn with Miss
                  Friskin, and whirled her about the room till he knocked over two or three innocent
                  bystanders, all which tended very much to compose his feelings. Ashburner had a
                  presentiment that something would happen, and stayed longer that night than his
                  wont; indeed till the end of the ball, which, as there was now no German cotillon,
                  lasted only till one in the morning.
               But the universal panacea of the polka had its mollifying effect on Masters, and
                  everything might have passed of quietly but for an unlucky accident. Some of the
                  young Southerners had ordered up sundry bottles of champagne, and were drinking in
                  the same corner. Hunter who was much given to toadying Southerners (another reason
                  for Masters' dislike of him), mingled among them and partook of the inspiring
                  beverage. In vino veritas is true as gospel, if
                  you understand it rightly
                  as meaning that wine developes a man's real nature. Hunter, being by nature
                  gossipy and mendacious, waxed more and more so with every glass of Heidseck he
                  took down. Ashburner chancing to pass near the group, had his attention arrested
                  by hearing Masters' name. He stopped and listened; Hunter was going on with a
                  prolix and somewhat confused story of some horse that Masters had sold to
                  somebody, in which transaction Sumner was somehow mixed up, and the horse hadn't
                  turned out well, and the purchaser wasn't satisfied, and so on.
               'If Masters hear this!' thought Ashburner.
               And Masters did hear it very promptly, for Sedley was within ear-shot, and,
                  delighted at having a piece of mischief to communicate, he tracked Harry out at
                  the further extremity of the room, to inform him of the liberties Storey Hunter
                  was taking with his name. Whereupon the slandered one, with all his wrath
                  reawakened, traversed the apartment in time to hear the emphatic peroration that,
                  'bad as Sumner was, Masters was a thousand times worse.'
               'I can't stand this,' exclaimed he. 'Where's Frank Sumner?' Sumner was not
                  visible. 'Ashburner, will you stand by me if there's a row?'
               By this time the ball was breaking up, and Masters, on going back to look for his
                  party, found that Mrs. M., like a true watering-place belle, had gone off without waiting for him. This was exactly what
                  he wanted.—Keeping his eye on Hunter, he followed him out to the head of the
                  staircase, where he had just been bidding good night to some ladies. No one was in
                  sight but Ashburner, who happened to be standing just outside the door-way. The
                  fat man nodded to Harry as if they had been the best friends in the world.
               
                  
                     Benson and Ashburner at the Ball.
                  
               
               
               'Curse his impudence!' exclaimed Masters, now fairly boiling over. 'Holla, you
                  Hunter! did you know you were an infernal scoundrel? Because you are.'
               'What for?' quoth the individual in question, half sobered and half disconcerted
                  by this unceremonious address.
               'And a contemptible blackguard,' continued Masters following up
                  his verbal attack.
               'You're another,' retorted Hunter.
               Ashburner wondered if the two men were going to stand slanging each other all
                  night.
               'I ought to have pulled your nose three years ago, and now take that!' and
                  Masters, who had been working at his glove ever since the parley began, twitched
                  it off and slapped Hunter in the face with it.
               When an Irishman sees two people fighting, or going to fight, his natural impulse
                  is to urge them on. A Scotchman or an American tries to part them. A Frenchman
                  runs after the armed force. An Englishman does nothing but look quietly on, unless
                  one side meets with foul play. Thus it was with Ashburner in the present instance.
                  He took Masters' request 'to stand by him in case of a row,' au pied de la lettre. He stood by him, and that was
                  all.
               As soon as Hunter felt the glove in his face he struck out at Masters, who stopped
                  the blow very neatly, and seemed about to return it with a left-hander; then
                  suddenly changing his style of attack, he rushed within the other's guard, and
                  catching him by the throat with both hands, did his best to strangle him. Hunter,
                  unable to call for help to loosen the throttling grasp of his assailant, threw
                  himself bodily upon him. As he was about twice Masters' size and weight, the
                  experiment succeeded. Harry was thrown off his feet and precipitated against the banisters, which being of
                  slight material, gave way like so much paper, and both men tumbled over into the
                  landing-place below amid a great scattering of splinters. Lighting on their feet,
                  they began to pommel each other without doing more damage than a couple of
                  children, for they were at such close quarters, and so blinded by rage, that they
                  hit wild; but Masters had caught his man by the throat again and was just getting
                  him into chancery, when Bell, Sedley, and some of the Southerners, attracted by
                  the noise, ran down stairs, calling on the 'gentlemen' to 'behave as such,' and
                  words proving ineffectual, endeavouring to pull them apart; which was no easy
                  matter, for Masters hung on like grim death, and when his hand was removed from
                  Hunter's collar, caught him again by the nose, nor would he give up till Mr.
                  Simpson, who was one of the stoutest and most active men in the place, caught him
                  from behind and fairly carried him off to the hall below. Then he seemed to come
                  to himself all at once, and recollected that he had invited the remains of 'our
                  set' to supper that night. And accordingly, after taking a rapid survey of himself
                  in a glass, and finding that his face bore no marks of the conflict, and that his
                  dress was not more disordered than a man's usually is when he has been polking all
                  the evening, he went off to meet his company, and a very merry time they had of
                  it. Ashburner was 
                     snrprised
                     surprised
                   to find that the spectators of the fray were able to ignore it so
                  completely. If they had been old men and old soldiers, they could not have acted
                  with more discretion, and it was impossible to suspect from their conversation or
                  manner that anything unpleasant had occurred. 'These people do know how to hold
                  their tongues sometimes,' thought he.
               Next morning, while strolling about before breakfast (he was the earliest riser of
                  the young men in the place, as he did not dance or gamble), he heard firing in the
                  pistol-gallery. He thought of his conversation with Masters and the occurrences of
                  last night, and then recollected that he was out of practice himself, and that
                  there would be no harm in trying a few shots. So he strode over to the gallery,
                  and there, to his astonishment, found on one side of the door the keeper, on the
                  other Frank Sumner (who had given a most devoted proof of friendship by getting up
                  two hours earlier in the morning than he had ever been known to before); and
                  between them Masters, blazing away at the figure, and swearing at himself for not
                  making better shots.
               'Take time by the forelock,' you see, said he, as he recognized Ashburner.
                     'Nunquam non paratus. The fellow will send me
                  a challenge this morning, I suppose, and I want to be ready for him. I shall
                  practise till the very moment I go out.'
               'But do you know,' said the Englishman, 'if after that you should kill your man,
                  we in our country should call it something very like murder?'
               'That may be,' answered Harry, as he let fly again, this time ringing the bell;
                  'but we only call it practice.'
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VIII.
               LIFE AT A WATERING-PLACE.—THE LION IN THE TOILS.
               WHAT followed the events related in our last number gave Ashburner a lesson
                  against making up his mind too hastily on any points of character, national or
                  individual. A fortnight after his arrival at Oldport he would have said that the
                  Americans were the most communicative people he had ever fallen in with, and
                  particularly, that the men of 'our set' were utterly incapable of keeping secret
                  any act or purpose of their lives, anything that had happened, or was going to
                  happen. Now he was surprised at the discretion shown by the men
                  cognizant of the late row (and they comprised all the fashionables left in the
                  place, and some of the outsiders, like Simpson); their dexterity and skilful
                  management, first, to prevent the affair from coming to a fight, and then, if that
                  were impossible, to keep it from publicity until the parties were safe over the
                  border into Canada, where they might 'shoot each other like gentlemen,' as a young
                  gentleman from Alabama expressed it. Sedley himself, whose officiousness had
                  precipitated the quarrel, did all in his power to prevent any further mischief,
                  and was as sedulous for the promotion of silencio and misterio, as if he
                  had been leader of a chorus of Venetian Senators. The Sewer
                  reporters, who, in their eagerness to collect every bit of gossip and scandal,
                  would have given the ears which an outraged community had permitted them to retain
                  for a knowledge of the fracas and its probable consequences, never had the least
                  inkling of it. Indeed, so quietly was the whole managed, that Ashburner never made
                  out the cause of the old feud, nor was able to form any opinion on the probability
                  of its final issue. On the former point he could only come to the conclusion, from
                  what he heard, that Hunter had been mythologizing, as his wont was, something to
                  Masters' discredit several years before, and had been trying to make mischief
                  between him and some of his friends or relations; but what the exact offence was,
                  whether Sumner was involved in the quarrel from the first, and if so, to what
                  extent; and whether the legend about the horse was a part of, or only an addition
                  to the original grievance;—on these particulars he remained in the dark. As to the
                  latter, he knew that Hunter had not challenged Masters, and that he had left the
                  place, but whether to look up a friend or not, no one seemed to know, or if they
                  did, no one eared to tell. At any rate, he did not return for a week and more,
                  during which time Ashburner had full opportunity of studying the behaviour and
                  feelings of a man with a duel in prospect.
               Those who defend and advocate the practice of duelling, if asked to explain the
                  motives leading a gentleman to fight, would generally answer somewhat to this
                  effect:—in the first place, personal courage, which induces a man to despise
                  danger and death, in comparison with any question affecting his own honour, or
                  that of those connected with him; secondly, a respect for the opinion of the
                  society in which he moves, which opinion, to a certain extent, supplies and fixes
                  the definition of honour. Hence it would follow that,—given a man who is neither
                  physically brave, nor bound by any particular respect for the opinion of his daily associates and the world
                  he moves in, such a man would not be likely to give or accept a challenge.The case
                  under Ashburner's observation afforded a palpable contradiction to this
                  conclusion.
               Henry Masters was not personally valorous; what courage he possessed was rather of
                  a moral than a physical kind. Where he appeared to be daring and heedless, it
                  proved on examination to be the result of previous knowledge and practice, which
                  gave him confidence and armed him with impunity. Thus he would drive his trotters
                  at anything, and have through 'tight places' on rough and crowded roads, his
                  whiffle-trees tipping and his hubs grazing the surrounding wheels in a way that at
                  first made Ashburner shudder in spite of himself; but it was because his
                  experience in wagon-driving enabled him to measure distances within half-an-inch,
                  and to catch an available opening immediately. On the other hand, in their
                  pedestrian trips across country in Westchester, he was very chary of jumping
                  fences or ditches till he had ascertained by careful practice his exact capacity
                  for that sort of exercise. He would ride his black horse, Daredevil, who was the
                  terror of all the servants and women in his neighbourhood, because he had made
                  himself perfectly acquainted with all the animal's stock of tricks, and was fully
                  prepared for them as they came; but he never went the first trip in a new
                  steamboat or railroad line. He ate and drank many things considered unhealthy,
                  because he understood exactly from experience what and how much he could take
                  without injury; but you could not have bribed him to sit fifteen minutes in wet
                  boots. In short, he was a man who took excellent care of himself,
                     canny as a Scot or a New-Englander, loving the good things of
                  life, and not disposed to hazard them on slight grounds. Then as to the
                  approbation bation or disapprobation of those about him, he was almost entirely
                  careless of it. On any point beyond the cut of a coat, the decoration of a room,
                  the concoction of a dish, or the merits of a horse, there were not ten people in
                  his own set whose opinion he heeded. To the remarks of foreigners he was a little
                  more sensitive, but even these he was more apt to retort upon by a tu quoque than to be influenced by. Add to all this,
                  that he had the convenient excuse of being a communicant at church, which in
                  America implies something like a formal profession of religion. Yet at this time
                  he was not only willing, but most eager to fight. The secret lay in his state of
                  recklessness. A moment of passion had overturned all his instincts, principles,
                  and common-sense, and inspired him with the feverish desire to pay off his old
                  debts to Storey Hunter, at whatever cost. And as neither the possession of
                  extraordinary personal courage, nor a high sense of 
                     coventional
                     conventional
                   honour, nor a respect for the opinion of society, necessarily induces a
                  feeling of recklessness, so neither does the absence of these qualities prevent
                  the presence of this feeling, exactly the most favourable one to make a man engage
                  in a duel. Moralists have called such a condition one of temporary madness, and it
                  has probably as good grounds to be classed with insanity as many of the pleas
                  known to medical and criminal jurisprudence.
               Be this as it may, Ashburner had a good opportunity of observing—and the example,
                  it is to be hoped, was of service to him—the demoralization induced upon a man by
                  the mere impending possibility of a duel. Masters seemed careless what he did. He
                  danced frantically, and drank so much at all hours, that the Englishman, though
                  pretty strong-headed himself, wondered how he could keep sober. He was openly seen
                  reading The
                  
                  Blackguard's Own, a weekly of The Sewer species. He
                  made up trotting-matches with every man in the place who owned a 'fast crab,' and
                  with some acquaintances at a distance, by correspondence. He kept studiously out
                  of the way of his wife and child, lest their influence might shake his
                  determination. All this time he practised pistol-shooting most religiously.
                  Neither of the belligerents had ever given a public proof of skill in this line.
                  Hunter's ability was not known, and Masters' shooting so uncertain and variable
                  when any one looked on, that those in the secret suspected him of playing dark and
                  disguising his hand. All which added to the interest of the affair.
               But when eleven days had passed without signs or tidings of Hunter, and it seemed
                  pretty clear that he had gone away 'for good,' Masters started up one morning, and
                  went of himself to New-York, at the same time with Harrison, whose brief and not
                  very joyous holidays had come to a conclusion. He accompanied the banker, in
                  accordance with the true American principle, always to have a lion for your
                  companion when you can; and as Harrison was still a man of note in Wall-street,
                  however small might be his influence in his own household, Masters liked to be
                  seen with him, and to talk anything—even stocks—to him, though he had no
                  particular interest in the market at that time. But whether an American is in
                  business himself or not, the subject of business is generally an interesting one
                  to him, and he is always ready to gossip about dollars. The unexampled material
                  development of the United States is only maintained by a condition of society
                  which requires every man to take a share in assisting that development, and the
                  most frivolous and apparently idle men are found sharp enough in pecuniary
                  matters. This trait of national character lies on the surface, and foreigners have
                  not been slow to notice it, and to draw from it unfavourable conclusions. The
                  supplementary and counterbalancing features of character to be observed in these
                  very people,—that it is rather the fun of making the money than the money itself
                  which they care for; that when it is made, they spend it freely, and part with it
                  more readily than they earned it; that they are more liberal both in their public
                  and private charities (considering the amount of their wealth, and of the claims
                  upon it) than any nation in the world,—all these traits strangers have been less
                  ready to dwell upon and do justice to.
               Masters was gone, and Ashburner stayed. Why?—He had been at Oldport nearly a
                  month; the place was not particularly beautiful, and the routine of the amusements
                  not at all to his taste. Why did he stay? He had his secret, too.
               It is a melancholy but indisputable fact, that even in the most religious and
                  moral country in the world, the bulwark of evangelical faith, and the home of the
                  domestic virtues (meaning, of course, England), a great many mothers who have
                  daughters to marry, are not so anxious about the real welfare, temporal and
                  eternal, of their 
                     youg
                     young
                   ladies, as solicitous that they should acquire riches, titles, and other
                  vanities of the world,—nay, that many of the daughters themselves act as if their
                  everlasting happiness depended on their securing in matrimony a proper combination
                  of the aforesaid vanities, and put out of account altogether the greatest prize a
                  woman can gain—the possession of a true and loving heart, joined to a wise head.
                  Now, Ashburner being a very good parti at home,
                  and having run the gauntlet of one or two London seasons, had become very skittish
                  of mammas, and still more so of daughters. He regarded the unmarried female as a most dangerous and
                  altogether to-be-avoided animal, and when you offered to introduce him to a young
                  lady, looked about as grateful as if you had invited him to go up in a balloon. He
                  expected to be rather more persecuted, if anything, in America than he had been at
                  home; and when he met Miss Vanderlyn at Ravenswood, if his first thought had found
                  articulate expression, it would probably have been something like this:—'Now that
                  young woman is going to set her cap at me; what a bore it will be!'
               Never was a man more mistaken in his anticipations. He encountered many pretty
                  girls, not at all timid, ready enough to talk, and flirty enough among their own
                  set, but not one of them threw herself at him, and least of all did Miss
                  Vanderlyn. Not that the young lady was the victim of a romantic attachment, for
                  she was perfectly fancy free and heart whole; nor, on the other hand, that she was
                  at all insensible to the advantages of matrimony, for she kept a very fair
                  look-out in that direction, and had, if not absolutely down on her books, at least
                  engraved on the recording tablets of her mind, four distinct young gentlemen,
                  combining the proper requisites, any of whom would suit her pretty well, and one
                  of whom—she didn't much care which—she was pretty well resolved to marry within
                  the next two years. And as she was stylish and rather handsome, clever enough, and
                  tolerably provided with the root of all evil, besides having that fortunate good
                  humour and accommodating disposition which go so far towards making a woman a
                  belle and a favourite, there was a sufficient probability that before the
                  expiration of that time, one of the four would offer himself. But all her
                  calculations were founded on shrewd common sense; her imagination took no flights,
                  and her aspirations only extended to the ordinary and possible. That this young
                  and strange Englishman, travelling as a part of education, the son of a great man,
                  and probably betrothed by proxy to some great man's daughter, or going into
                  parliament to be a great man himself, and remain a bachelor for the best part of
                  his life,—that between him and herself there should be anything in common, any
                  point of union which could make even a flirtation feasible, never entered into her
                  head. She would as soon have expected the King of Dahomey to send an embassy with
                  ostrich feathers in their caps, and rings in their noses, formally to ask her hand
                  in marriage. Nay, even if the incredible event had come to pass, and the young
                  stranger had taken the initiative, even then she would not by any means have
                  jumped at the bait. For in the first place, she was fully imbued with the idea
                  that the Vanderlyns were quite as good as any other people in the world, and that
                  (the ordinary conceit of an American belle) to whatever man she might give her
                  hand, all the honour would come from her side, and all the gain be his; therefore
                  she would not have cared to come into a family who might suspect her of having
                  inveigled their heir, and look down upon her as something beneath them, because
                  she came from a country where there were no noblemen. Secondly, there is a very
                  general feeling among the best classes in America, that no European worth anything
                  at home comes to America to get married. The idea is evidently an imperfect
                  generalization, and liable to exceptions; but the prevalence of it shows more
                  modesty in the 'Upper Ten's' appreciation of themselves than they usually have
                  credit for. As soon, therefore, as a foreigner begins to pay attention to a young
                  lady in good society, it is primâ facie ground
                  of suspicion against him. The reader will see from all this how little chance
                  there was of Ashburner's running any
                  danger from the unmarried women about him. With the married ones the case was
                  somewhat different. It may be remembered that at his first introduction to Mrs.
                  Henry Masters, the startling contrast she exhibited to the adulation he had been
                  accustomed to receive, totally put him down; and that afterwards she softened off
                  the rough edge of her satire, and became very piquante and pleasing to him. And as she greatly amused him, so he
                  began to suspect that she was rather proud of having such a lion in her train, as
                  no doubt she was, notwithstanding the somewhat rough and cub-like stage of his
                  existence.So he began to hang about her and follow her around in his green,
                  awkward way, and look large notes of admiration at her; and she was greatly
                  diverted, and not at all displeased at his attentions. I don't know how far it
                  might have gone; Ashburner was a very correct and moral young man as the world
                  goes, but rather because he had generally business enough on hand to keep him out
                  of mischief than from any high religious principle; and I am afraid that, in spite
                  of the claims of propriety, and honour, and friendship, and the avenging Zeus of
                  hospitality, and every other restraining motive, he would have fallen very much in
                  love with Mrs. Masters but for one thing.
               He was hopelessly in love with Mrs. Harrison. How or when it began he couldn't
                  tell; but he found himself under the influence imperceptibly, as a man feels
                  himself intoxicated. Sometimes he fancied that there had been a kind of love at
                  first sight—that with the first glimpse he had of her, something in his heart told
                  him that that woman was destined to exert a mastery over him; yet his feelings
                  must have undergone a change and growth, for he would not now have listened to any
                  one speaking of her as Masters had done at that time. Why it was, he
                  could still less divine. His was certainly no blind admiration which sees no fault
                  in its idol; he saw her faults plainly enough, and yet could not help himself. He
                  often asked himself how it happened that if he was doomed to endure
                  an illicit and unfortunate passion, it was not for Mrs. Masters rather than Mrs.
                  Harrison; for the former was at least as clever, certainly handsomer, palpably
                  younger, indubitably more lady-like, and altogether a higher style of woman. Yet
                  with this just appreciation of them, there was no comparison as to his feelings
                  towards the two. The one amused and delighted him when present; the other, in her
                  absence, was ever rising up before his mind's eye, and drawing him after her; and
                  when they met, his heart beat quicker, and he was more than usually awkward and
                  confused. Perhaps there had been, in the very origin of his entanglement and
                  passion, some guiding impulse of honour, some sense that Masters had been his
                  friend and entertainer, and that to Harrison he was under no personal obligations.
                  For there are many shades of honour and dishonour in dishonourable thoughts, and a
                  little principle goes a great way with some people, like the wind commemorated by
                  Joe Miller's Irishman, of which there was not much, but what there was, was
                     very high.
               
               Be this as it may, he was loving to perdition—or thought so, at least; and it is
                  hard to discriminate in a very young man's case between the conceit and the
                  reality of love. His whole heart and mind were taken up with one great,
                  all-pervading idea of Mrs. Harrison, and he was equally unable to smother and to
                  express his flame. He was dying to make her a present of something, but he could
                  send nothing without a fear of exciting suspicion, except bouquets, and of these
                  floral luxuries, though they were only to be procured at Oldport port with much trouble and expense, she had always
                  a supply from other quarters. He did not like to be one of a number in his
                  offerings; he wanted to pay her some peculiar tribute. He would have liked to
                  fight some man for her, to pick a quarrel with some one who had said something
                  against her. Proud and sensitive to ridicule as he was, he would have laid himself
                  down in her way, and let her walk over him, could he have persuaded himself that
                  she would be gratified by such a proof of devotion, and that it would help his
                  cause with her.
               Had Masters been in Oldport now, there might have been trouble, inasmuch as he was
                  not particular about what he said, and not too well disposed towards Mrs.
                  Harrison, while Ashburner was just in the state of mind to have fought with his
                  own father on that theme. But Masters was away, and his absence at this time was
                  not a source of regret to Ashburner, who felt a little afraid of him, and with
                  some reason, for our friend Harry was as observant as if he had a fly's allowance
                  of eyes, and had a knack of finding out things without looking for them, and of
                  knowing things without asking about them; and he would assuredly have noticed that
                  Ashburner began to be less closely attached to his party, and to follow in the
                  train of Mrs. Harrison. As for Clara Masters she never troubled herself about the
                  Englishman's falling off in his attentions to her; if anything, she was rather
                  glad of it; her capricious disposition made her tire of a friend in a short time;
                  she could not endure any one's uninterrupted company—not even her husband's, who
                  therefore wisely took care to absent himself from her several times every
                  year.
               Moreover, though Ashburner was seen in attendance on the lioness, it was not
                  constantly or in a pointed manner. He was still fighting with himself, and, like a
                  man run away with, who has power to guide his horse though not to stop him, he was
                  so far able to manage his passion as to keep it from an open display. So
                  absolutely no one suspected what was the matter with him, or that there was
                  anything the matter with him, except the lady herself. Catch a woman not finding
                  out when a man is in love with her! Sometimes she may delude herself with
                  imagining a passion where none exists, but she never makes the converse mistake of
                  failing to perceive it where it does. And how did the gay Mrs. Harrison, knowing
                  and perceiving herself to be thus loved, make use of her knowledge? What
                  alteration did it produce in her conduct and bearing towards her admirer?
                  Absolutely none at all. Precisely as she had treated him at their first
                  introduction did she continue to treat him—as if he were one of her everyday
                  acquaintances, and nothing more. And it is precisely this line of action that
                  utterly breaks down a man's defences, and makes him more hopelessly than ever the
                  slave of his fair conqueror. If a woman declares open hostilities against him,
                  runs him down behind his back, snubs him to his face, shuns his society,—this at
                  least shows that she considers his attachment of some consequence—consequence
                  enough to take notice of, though the notice be unfavourable. His self-respect may
                  come to the rescue, or his piqued vanity may save him by converting love into
                  enmity. But a perseverance in never noticing his love, and feigning to be ignorant
                  of its existence, completely establishes her supremacy over him.
               A Frenchman, who has conceived designs against, a married lady, only seeks to
                  throw dust in the husband's eyes, and then if he cannot succeed in his final
                  object, at least to establish sufficient intimacy to give him a plausible pretext
                  for saying that he has succeeded; for in such a matter he is not scrupulous about lying a
                  little—or a great deal. An American, bad enough for a similar intention (which
                  usually pre-supposes a considerable amount of Parisianization), acts
                  much like a Frenchman—if anything, rather worse. An Englishman is not usually
                  moved to the desire of an intrigue by vanity, but driven into it by sheer passion,
                  and his first impulse is to run bodily off with the object of his misplaced
                  affection; to take her and himself out of the country, as if he could thereby
                  travel out of his moral responsibilities. Reader, did you ever notice, or having
                  noticed, did you ever ponder upon the geographical distribution of morals and
                  propriety which is so marked and almost peculiar a feature of the Anglo-Saxon
                  mind? In certain outward looks and habits, the English may be unchangeable and
                  unmistakeable all over the globe; but their ethical code is certainly not the same
                  at home and abroad. It is pretty much so with an American, too, before he has
                  become irreparably Parisianized. When he puts on his travelling habits he takes
                  off his puritan habits, and makes light of doing things abroad which he would be
                  the first to anathematize at home. Observe, we are not speaking of the deeply
                  religious, nor yet of the openly profligate class in either country, but of the
                  general run of respectable men who travel; they regard a great part of their
                  morality and their manners as intended solely for home consumption, while a
                  Frenchman or a German if his home standard is not so high, lives better up to it
                  abroad. And yet many Englishmen, and some Americans, wonder why their countrymen
                  are so unpopular as foreign travellers!
               Ashburner, then, wanted to run away with Mrs. Harrison. How he could have
                  supported her never entered into his thoughts, nor did he consider what the effect
                  would be on his own prospects. He did not reflect, either, how miserably selfish
                  it was in him, after all, to expect that this woman would give up her fortune and
                  position, her children, her unbounded legitimate domination over her husband, for
                  his boyish passion, and how infinitesimally small the probability that she would
                  do so crazy a thing. Nor did Harrison ever arise before his mind as a present
                  obstacle or future danger; and this was less frantic than most of his
                  overlookings. The broker was a strong and courageous man, and probably had been
                  once very much in love with his wife; but at that time, so far from putting a
                  straw in the way of any man who wanted to relieve him of her, he would probably
                  have been willing to pay his expenses into the bargain.
               But how to declare his passion—that was the question. He saw that the initiatory
                  steps, and very decided ones, must be taken on his part; and it was not easy to
                  find the lady alone ten minutes together. People lived at Oldport as if they were
                  in the open air, and the volunteer police of ordinary gossip made private
                  interviews between well-known people a matter of extreme difficulty. A Frenchman
                  similarly placed would have brought the affair to a crisis much sooner: he would
                  have found a thousand ways of disclosing his feelings, and at the same time
                  dexterously leaving himself a loop-hole of escape. Very clever at these things are
                  the Gauls; they will make an avowal in a full ball-room, under cover of the music,
                  if there is no other chance to be had. But tact in love affairs is not the
                  characteristic of the Englishman, especially at Ashburner's age. He had none of
                  this mischievous dexterity; perhaps it is just as well when a man has not, both
                  for himself and for society. He thought of writing, and actually began many
                  letters, or notes, or billet-doux, or whatever they might be called; but they always seemed so absurd
                  (as they truly were), that he invariably tore them up when half-finished. He
                  thought of serving up his flame in verse (for about this time the unhappy youth
                  wrote many verses, which on his return to sanity he very wisely made away with);
                  but his emotion lay too deep for verse, and his performances seemed even to
                  himself too ridiculous for him to dream of presenting them. Still he must make a
                  beginning somehow; he could not ask her to run away with him apropos of
                  nothing.
               One of his great anxieties, you may be sure, was to find out if any other man
                  stood in his way, and who that man might be. His first impulses were to be
                  indiscriminately jealous of every man he saw talking or walking with her; but on
                  studying out alone the result of his observations, he could not discover that she
                  affected any one man more than another. For this was one of her happy arts, that
                  she made herself attractive to all without showing a marked preference to any one.
                  Bell, who among his other accomplishments, had a knack of quoting the standard
                  poets, compared her to Pope's Belinda—saying, that her lively looks disclosed a
                  sprightly mind, and that she extended smiles to all, and favours to none. So that
                  Ashburner's jealousy could find no fixed object to light on. At one time he had
                  been terribly afraid of Le Roi, chiefly from having heard the lady praise him for
                  his accomplishments and agreeable manners. But once he heard Sedley say, that Mrs.
                  Harrison had been worrying Le Roi half out of his wits, and quite out of his
                  temper.
               'How so?'
               'Oh, she was praising you, and saying how much she liked the English character,
                  and how true and honest your countrymen were—so much more to be depended upon than
                  the French—and more manly, too; and altogether she worked him up into such a rage
                  against ces insulaires, that he went off ready
                  to swear.'
               And then Ashburner suspected what he afterwards became certain of—that this was
                  only one of the pleasant little ways the woman had of amusing herself.—Whenever
                  she found two men who were enemies, or rivals, or antagonists in any way, she
                  would praise each to the other, on purpose to aggravate them: and very successful
                  she was in her purpose; for she had the greatest appearance of sincerity, and
                  whatever she said seemed to come right out of her heart. But if any lingering
                  fears of Le Roi still haunted the Englishman's mind, they were dispelled by his
                  departure along with the main body of the exclusives. Though always proud to be
                  seen in the company of a conspicuous character like Mrs. Harrison, the Vicomte
                  more particularly cultivated the fashionables proper, and gladly embraced the
                  opportunity of following in the train of the Robinsons.
               Perhaps, after all, Ashburner would have preferred being able to concentrate his
                  suspicions upon one definite person, to feeling a vague distrust of somebody he
                  knew not whom, especially as the presence of a rival might have brought the affair
                  to a crisis sooner. To a crisis it was approaching, nevertheless, for his passion
                  now began to tell on him. He looked pale, and grew nervous and weak—lay awake at
                  nights, which he had never done before, except when going in for the Tripos at
                  Cambridge—and was positively off his feet, which he had never been at any previous
                  period of his life. He thought of tearing himself away from the place—the wisest
                  course, doubtless; but, just as he had made up his mind to go by the next stage,
                  Mrs. Harrison, as if she divined what he was about, would upset all his plans by a few words, or a look or smile—some
                  little expression which meant nothing, and could never be used against her; but
                  which, by a man in his state, might be interpreted to mean a great deal.
               One morning the crisis came—not that there was any particular reason for it then
                  more than at any other time, only he could hold out no longer. It was a beautiful
                  day, and they had been strolling in one of the few endurable walks the place
                  afforded—a winding alley near the hotel, but shrouded in trees, and it was just at
                  the time when most of the inhabitants were at ten-pins, so that they were
                  tolerably alone. Now, if ever, was the time; but the more he tried to introduce
                  the subject, the less possible he found it to make a beginning, and all the while
                  he could not avoid a dim suspicion that Mrs. Harrison knew perfectly what he was
                  trying to drive at, and took a mischievous pleasure in saying nothing to help him
                  along. So they talked about his travels and hers, and great people in England and
                  France, and all sorts of people then at Oldport, and the weather even—all manner
                  of ordinary topics; and then they walked some time without saying anything, and
                  then they went back to the hotel. There he felt as if his last chance was slipping
                  away from him, and in a sudden fit of desperate courage he followed her up to her
                  parlour without waiting for an invitation. Hardly was the door closed—he would
                  have given the world to have locked it—when he begged her 'to listen to him a few
                  minutes on a subject of the greatest importance.' The lady opened her large round
                  eyes a little wider; it was the only sign she gave of anything approaching to
                  surprise. Then the young man unbosomed himself just as he stood there—not upon his
                  knees; people used to do that—in books, at least—but nobody does now. He told her
                  how long he had been in love with her—how he thought of her all day and all night,
                  and how wretched he was—how he had tried to subdue his passion, knowing it was
                  very wrong, and so forth; but really he couldn't help it, and—and—there he stuck
                  fast; for all the time he had been making this incoherent avowal, like one in a
                  dream, hardly knowing what he was about, but conscious only of taking a decisive
                  step, and doing a very serious thing in a very wild way—all this time,
                  nevertheless, he had most closely watched Mrs. Harrison, to anticipate his
                  sentence in some look or gesture of hers. And he saw that there did not move a
                  line in her face, or a muscle in her whole figure—not a fibre of her dress even
                  stirred. If she had been a great block of white marble, she could not have shown
                  less feeling, as she stood up there right opposite him. If he had asked her to
                  choose a waistcoat-pattern for him, she could not have heard him more quietly. As
                  soon as he had fairly paused, so that she could speak without immediate
                  interruption, she took up the reply. It was better that he should go no further,
                  as she had already understood quite enough. She was very sorry to give him pain—it
                  was always unpleasant to give pain to any one. She was also very sorry that he had
                  so deceived himself and so misapprehended her character, or misunderstood her
                  conversation. He was very young yet, and had sense enough to get over this very
                  soon. Of course, she would never hear any repetition of such language from him;
                  and, on her part, she would never mention what had occurred to any one—especially
                  not to Mr. Harrison (it was the first time he had ever heard her allude to the
                  existence of that gentleman); and then she wound up with a look which said as
                  plainly as the words could have done, 'Now, you may go.'
               Ashburner moved off in a more than usual state of confusion. As he approached the door it opened
                  suddenly, and he nearly walked over one of the little Bleeckers, a flourishing
                  specimen of Young New-York, with about three yards of green satin round his
                  throat, and both his hands full of French novels, which he had been commissioned
                  to bring from the circulating library. Ashburner felt like choking him, and it was
                  only by a great effort that he contrived to pass him with a barely civil species
                  of nod. But as he went out, he could not refrain from casting one glance back at
                  Mrs. Harrison. She had taken off her bonnet (which in America is denominated a
                  hat), and was tranquilly arranging her hair at the glass.
               Somehow or other he found his way down stairs, and rushed off into the country on
                  a tearing walk, enraged and disgusted with everything, and with himself most of
                  all. When a man has made up his mind to commit a sin, and then has been
                  disappointed in the fruition of it—when he has sold the birthright of his
                  integrity, without getting the miserable mess of pottage for it which he expected,
                  his feelings are not the most enviable. Ashburner was angry enough to marry the
                  first heiress he met with. First, he half resolved to get up a desperate
                  flirtation with Mrs. Masters; but the success of his first attempt was not
                  encouraging to the prosecution of a second. To kill himself was not in his line;
                  but he felt very like killing some one else. He still feared he might have been
                  made a screen for some other man.—But if the other man existed, he could only be
                  reached by fighting successively all the single men of 'our set,' and a fair
                  sprinkling of those in the second set. Then he thought he must at least leave the
                  place; but his pride still revolted at the idea of running away before a woman.
                  Finally, after walking about ten miles, and losing his dinner, he sobered down
                  gradually, and thought what a fool he had been; and the issue of his cogitations
                  was a very wise double conclusion. He formed a higher opinion of the virtue of
                  American women, and he never attempted any experiments on another.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IX.
               A TROT ON THE ISLAND.
               ASHBURNER did leave Oldport after all, before the end of the season, being
                  persuaded to accompany a countryman and schoolmate of his (whom he had last seen,
                  two years before, in Connaught, and who now happened to pass a day or two at
                  Oldport, on his way Canada-ward from the south) in a trip to the White Mountains
                  of New Hampshire; though his American acquaintances, especially the ladies, tried
                  hard to dissuade him from starting before the grand fancy ball, with which the
                  season terminated, assuring him that most of 'our set' would come back if only for
                  that one night, and that it would be a very splendid affair, and so forth. Nature
                  had more charms for him than art, and he went away to New Hampshire, making an
                  appointment with Masters by letter to meet him at Ravenswood early in September.
                  But a traveller cannot make sure of his movements a fortnight ahead. On his return
                  from the White Mountains, Ashburner had his pocket picked at a railway station
                  (these little incidents of highly civilized life are beginning to happen now and
                  then in America; the inhabitants repudiate any native agency therein, and
                  attribute them all to the swell-mob emigrants from England), and, in consequence,
                  was obliged to retrace his steps as far as New-York to visit his banker. Almost
                  the first person he ran against in the street was Henry Masters.
               'This is an unexpected pleasure!' exclaimed the New-Yorker. 'I never
                  thought to see you here; and you, I presume, didn't expect to meet me.' Ashburner
                  explained his mishap. 'Well, I meant to go straight over to Ravenswood after the
                  ball; but we had to come home—all of us this time—on business. Lots of French
                  furniture arrived for our town-house. Mrs. M. couldn't rest till she had seen it
                  all herself, and had it properly arranged. So here have I been five days, fussing,
                  and paying, and swearing (legally, you understand, not profanely) at the
                  custom-house, and then 'hazing'—what you call slanging—upholsterers; and now that
                  the work is all over. I mean to take a little play, and am just going over to see
                  Lady Suffolk and Trustee trot on the island. Come along. It's a beautiful drive of
                  eight miles, and I have a top-wagon. It is to meet me at the Park in a quarter of
                  an hour.' Ashburner assented. 'I want to buy some cigars; you have no objection to
                  accompany me a moment?'
               So they turned down one of the cross-streets running out of the lower part of
                  Broadway (which, it may be here mentioned, for the benefit of English readers and
                  writers, is not called the Broadway), and entered a 'store' five or
                  six stories high, with two or three different firms on each floor; and Masters led
                  the way up something between a ladder and a staircase into a small office, with
                  'Bleecker Brothers' dimly visible on a tin plate over the door. Three-fourths of
                  the apartment were filled up with all manner of inviting samples, every wine,
                  liquor and liqueur under the sun, in every variety of bottle or vial, thick with
                  the dust of years, or open for immediate tasting; and through the dingy panes of a half-glass door a
                  multitudinous array of bottles might be seen loading the numerous shelves of a
                  large store-room beyond. In a small clearing at one corner, where a small desk was
                  kept in countenance by a small table, and three or four old chairs, with a
                  background of shelves groaning under the choicest brands of the fragrant weed, sat
                  the presiding deities of the place—the two little Bleeckers,—the dark brother of
                  thirty-five, and the light brother of twenty, like two sketches of the same man in
                  chalk and charcoal; both elegantly dressed—white trousers, patent leather shoes,
                  exuberant cravats, massive chains, and all the usual paraphernalia of Young
                  New-York—altogether looking as much in place as a couple of butterflies in an
                  ant-hill.
               'Good morning, gentlemen,' said Masters. 'Here's our friend Ashburner;' and he
                  pushed forward the Englishman. The brothers rose, laid down the morning journals
                  over which they had been lounging, and welcomed the stranger to their place of
                  business. 'What's the news this morning?'
               'Nothing at all, I believe,' replied the elder. 'South Carolina has been
                  threatening to dissolve the Union again—and that's no news. Stay here, you can see
                  for yourself;' and he handed one mammoth sheet to Masters, and the other to
                  Ashburner. The first thing that struck the Englishman's eye in his, was an article
                  which, from its being written in lines of unequal length, he judged to be verse,
                  so, being a bold man, he went at it, and read as follows:—
               
                  
                     
                        
                           'FEEGRAVE'S WRATH.
                           
                              The Archbishop sits in his easy chair,
                              Best mahogany, padded with care,
                              After as nice and cosy a dinner
                              As ever comforted saint or sinner.
                              Why should he look cross,
                              And his head often toss?
                              Was there anything wrong in the Tartare sauce?
                              After so good a meal why should he be grave?
                              What is the matter with Archbishop Feegrave?
                           
                           
                              Ah, well may Johnny look sour and frown,
                              And bring his fist on the table down
                              With such a fling
                              That the glasses ring!
                              For this very evening has brought him news
                              Enough to give him a fit of the blues.
                              He had laid out a burying-ground of his own—
                              That is of his Church's—and there alone
                              Had ordered his flock to take their repose
                              When their earthly woes were brought to a close;
                              And a paper mendacious,
                              Of humbug voracious,
                              (Perhaps you have seen it or heard the fame of it;
                              An Anti-Saxon, Papist journal:

                              A paper of which he had the discredit or
                              Doubtful renown of being the editor,
                              Took up the song all the day long,

                              But still there were few to Williamsburgh ferried;

                     All, all, to a man, determined to try at
                     Practising 'private judgment' a little,
                     Resolved not to care for Johnny F.'s fiat,
                     Nor heed of his mandate a single tittle,
                     But they and their families buried would be
                     Under the shady Greenwood tree.
                  
                  
                     This obstacle placed in the Archbishop's path
                     Awakened his innate and national wrath,
                     (For Coelum of old said a poet most
                        wary,
                     
                        Non animum mutant qui currunt trans
                        mare),
                     In Latin suspicious, and English as bad,
                     He let off the very worst oaths to be had:
                     'Per pokerum sanctum! per illud et hoc!
                     
                     Now haven't I, sure, got an illigint flock!
                     And all their remonstrance such impudent gabble is,
                     
                        Efficiat me meliorem Diabolus!
                     
                     Scelestissimi scelestorum!
                     Heretecissimi hereticorum!
                     Bring me my inkstand and see how I'll floor'em!'
                  
               
               Ashburner having gone thus far into the doggerel found it utterly impossible to go
                  any further, partly, because he did not in the least understand what it was about,
                  partly for other obvious reasons, so he looked up for explanation, and had not to
                  look long or far.
               'Ah, I see you've hit upon something of mine,' said Masters, whose glance had
                  already taken in Ashburner and the paper and what he was reading, and apparently
                  at least half of what he was thinking. 'Of course you are not up to the allusions.
                  Feegrave is the Popish archbishop here: there is a big cemetery at Greenwood, Long
                  Island,—one of our lions, the New-York Père la
                     Chaise—I must take you there some day—where all people of all
                  religions are buried; and it turned out a good investment for the company that
                  owned it, and Feegrave thought that it would pay to have a cemetery of his own;
                  accordingly he set one up, and ordered all the faithful to be buried there at six
                  dollars a head and upwards, 
                     
                        Under pain of citation,
                        Excommunication,
                        And something still awfuller ending in ation.
                     
                   But some of the sheep were not so sheepish, and grew contumacious, and hinted
                  that whereas in several European countries Catholics and Protestants were buried
                  side by side, and still more, whereas the archbishop himself had consecrated
                  graves in Greenwood, therefore, &c.—in short they wouldn't be done. Then
                  Feegrave waxed wrath, and made a vast splutter, and called them liars, and other
                  hard names, just as your Irish patriots do.'
               'Exactly,' said Ashburner, who had had some experience of such gentry. 'Your
                  thorough-going Papist's rule is, to tell as many lies as he can himself, and call
                  all his opponents liars as often as possible. It's a figure of speech that answers
                  very well with a certain class of hearers and readers. And who has got the best of
                  this dispute?'
               'No one as yet,' said the elder Bleecker, 'but you may bet your life on the
                  archbishop in the end. He is a clever old scamp, and generally manages to carry
                  his point. He don't get put down often.'
               'Except when he meets Thunderbolt in a rail-car,' said Masters. 'Did you ever hear
                  that story? '✗John of New-York,'—cross John, as my brother Carl used
                  to call him—was in the

                     same
                   rail-car with Thunderbolt, coming from Philadelphia to New-York; and the
                     Congressman gressman didn't know who
                  he was, but probably suspected he was a priest.
               'You can generally tell a priest by his looks. Even an intelligent horse will do
                  that. Once I was riding with one of our bishops near Boston, and his nag shied
                  suddenly at a man in a broad-brimmed hat. Says the right reverend (we don't call
                  'em 'my lord' in this country, you know, Ashburner), 'I shouldn't wonder if that
                  was a Romish priest;' and we looked again, and it was. There was a Protestant
                  horse for you! What a treasure he would have been to an Orangeman!
               'So Thunderbolt began to abuse the Roman Catholics generally, and the priests
                  particularly, and 'that brawling bigot, Johnny Feegrave,' most particularly.
                  Feegrave, who is a wary man, polite, and self-possessed, sat through it all
                  without saying a word; till another gentleman in the car asked Thunderbolt if he
                  knew who that was opposite him. He didn't know. 'It's Bishop Feegrave,' says the
                  other, in a half whisper. 'Are you Bishop Feegrave?' exclaims the native, quite
                  off his guard. 'They call me so,' answered the other, with a quiet smile,
                  expecting to enjoy the humiliating confusion of his denouncer; and the other
                  passengers shared in the expectation, and were prepared for a titter at
                  Thunderbolt's expense. But instead of attempting any apology, or showing any
                  further embarrassment, he pulled out an eye-glass, and after looking at the Jesuit
                  through it for some time, thus announced the result of his inspection—'Oh, you
                  are, are you? Well, you're just the kind of looking loafer I should have expected
                  Johnny Feegrave to be.'
               'Is that story true, Masters?' asked the elder brother.
               'I read it in a newspaper,' said Harry, looking as innocent and sanctimonious as a
                  Jesuit caught in a—reservation.
               The two Bleeckers roared. It is a standing American joke to say of the biggest
                  possible hoax or canard 'I read it in a
                  newspaper, and it must be true.'
               'I don't believe Feegrave was much disconcerted either,' said the head of the
                  firm; 'he doesn't lose his balance easily. I never heard of his being put out but
                  once, and that was when Governor Bonkers met him. He was a jolly old Dutchman, Mr.
                  Ashburner, who used to go about electioneering, and asking every man he came
                  across—how he was, and how his wife and family were. When Bishop Feegrave was
                  introduced to him, they thought the governor would know enough to vary the usual
                  question a little; but he didn't, and asked after the Romish bishop's wife and
                  family with all possible innocence; and Feegrave, for once in his life, was
                  nonplussed what to answer.'
               'Ah, but you haven't told the end of that,' put in Masters. 'When the governor's
                  friends tried to explain to him the mistake he had made, and the category the
                  Romish ecclesiastics were in, he said, 'O yas, I see, I should have asked after
                  his lady and not after his wife.' As you say, Feegrave generally has his wits
                  about him, no doubt. He played our custom-house a trick that they will not forget
                  in a hurry. Soon after General Harrison and the Whigs came in, and Danielson was
                  made collector of our port, there arrived a great lot of what the French call
                     articles de religion, robes, crucifixes, and
                  various ornaments for Feegrave's cathedral. Now these were all French goods, and
                  subject to duty, and a notification to that effect was sent to the proper quarter.
                  Down comes Feegrave in a great rage. 'Mr. Danielson, Mr. Danielson, we never had
                  to do this before. Your predecessor, Mr. Hoyt, always let our articles of religion
                  in free of duty.' 'Can't help what my predecessor, Mr. Hoyt, used to do,' says Danielson; 'the law is so
                  and so, as I understand it, and these articles are subject to duty. If you like,
                  you may pay the duties under protest, and bring a suit against Uncle Sam*
                   to recover the money.' (You see, the Loco Focos had always favoured the
                  Romish priests to get the Irish vote. The Whigs didn't in those days—it was before
                  our side had been corrupted by Seward, and such miserable demagogues; and
                  Danielson wasn't sorry to see his political opponent the Bishop in a tight place.)
                  After Feegrave had blustered awhile, and found it did not good, he tried the other
                  tack, and began to expostulate. 'Is there no way at all, Mr. Danielson,' says he,
                  'by which these articles may be passed free of duty?' 'None at all,' says the
                  other, 'unless'—and he paused, hardly knowing whether it would do to hint at such
                  a thing, even in jest—'unless, bishop, you are willing to swear that these are
                     tools of your trade.' 'And sure they are that!' quoth Feegrave,
                  snapping him up, 'bring on your book;' and he had the goods sworn through in less
                  than no time, before Danielson could recover himself.'
               
                  
                  *The United States government (U. S.)
               
               'Not a bad hit,' said the Englishman. 'Tools of his trade! So they were, sure
                  enough; but one would not have expected him to own it so coolly.'
               'Unless there was something to be got by it,' continued Masters. 'Now this is
                  true—every word of it, though it has been in the newspapers; and the
                  way I came to find it out was this. One day I saw in the advertising columns of
                     The Blunder and Bluster, a circular from the Secretary of the Treasury, stating that 'crucifixes, whether of silver or
                  copper, images, silk and velvet vestments, and theological books, did not come
                  under the head of tools of trade, but were subject to duty.' It was a
                  funny-looking notice, and there was evidently something behind it; so I took the
                  trouble to inquire, and found that the cause of the order was this clever stroke
                  of Feegrave. Going to the trot to-day?'
               The younger brother was going, and it was near the time when he expected his
                  wagon. Dicky wasn't. He had given up trots ten years ago—thought them low.
               'Give me a few cigars before we go,' said Masters. 'What have you here that's
                  first-rate? Carbajal, Firmezas, Antiguedad. H—m. I'll take a dozen Firmezas, and
                  you may send me the rest of the box.'
               'Don't you want some champagne—veritable Cordon Bleu—only fourteen dollars a
                  dozen, and a discount if you take six cases?'
               'And if you wish to secure some tall Lafitte, we bought some odd bottles at old
                  Van Zandt's sale the other day. You remember drinking that wine at Wilson's last
                  summer?'
               Masters remembered it perfectly, and would take the Lafitte by all means. 'Put
                  that down, Mr. Snipes;' and for the first time Ashburner was aware of the clerk—a
                  very young gentleman, who appeared from behind the desk, and booked the order at
                  it. 'And how about the champagne?'
               'J'y penserai. Time to go. Vamos.' And Masters carried off his friend.
               'You were a little taken aback, weren't you?' he asked, as they went in quest of
                  the wagon. 'When you saw these men figuring in the German cotillon, and helping to
                  lead the fashion at Oldport, you hardly expected to encounter them in such a
                  place. Well, now, let me tell you something that will astonish you yet more. So far from its being against these
                  brothers in society that they are, what you would call in plain English, a
                  superior order of grocers, it is positively in their favour; that is to say, they
                  are more respected, better received, and stand a better chance of marrying well,
                  than if they did nothing. They might do nothing if they chose. They had enough to
                  live very well on en garçon. The Bleeckers are
                  one of our best known and most thoroughly respectable families. The sons had no
                  taste for books; they have a very good taste for wine and cigars, and have
                  undertaken what they are best fit for. It's better than being nominal
                  lawyers.'
               'Pecuniarily, no doubt: but is it as good for the whole development of the
                  individual? Was it you, or your friend Harrison, who instanced Richard Bleecker as
                  a man who had made no progress in anything manly for fifteen years?'
               'That is the fault of his natural disposition, which would not be bettered by his
                  making believe to be a professional man, or being an avowedly idle one. He is
                  frivolous and ornamental for a part of his time—during the rest he has his
                  business to occupy him. If he had not that, he would spend all his time in elegant
                  idleness, and know no more than he does now. His pursuits bring him in money,
                  which will be a comfort to his wife and family when he marries—though, to be sure,
                  he is rather ancient for that; a single man at thirty-five is with us a confirmed
                  old bachelor. But his brother is in a fair way to form a nice establishment.'
               'Now tell me another thing. Suppose the Bleeckers had chosen to become jewellers
                  or merchant tailors—they might be good judges of either business, and make money
                  by it—how would that effect their position?'
               'Unfavourably, I confess,' replied Masters. 'But we Gothamites have so thorough a
                  respect for, and appreciation of, good wine and cigars, that the importation of
                  them is considered particularly laudable.'
               'Do you know, I was once confounded near going into this very business myself? I
                  had a chance of being one of three partners who are making thirty thousand a year
                  clear now among them, and their office is the nicest lounging place down town,
                  where you hear all that is going on and a great deal more sometimes; and they hung
                  out the best dry champagne in the country; Bleecker's isn't a circumstance to it.
                  I missed a great chance then, but the fact was, it happened about five years ago,
                  just about the time of my marriage, and I wanted to take Clara—or she me,
                  rather—over to Paris.'
               'Well,' said Ashburner, 'I don't mean to flatter, but it really seems to me that
                  there is something not exactly very elevated in a state of society which leads a
                  man of your education and accomplishments to regret that he wasn't a
                  wine-merchant.'
               Masters coloured up, hesitated a moment, and then, re-assuming his nonchalant air, returned to the charge.
               'My dear fellow, you can't put yourself in my position, nor can I have your
                  feelings on the subject—indeed I should be a great fool if I could. Your ancestors
                  for such a time, that the memory of man runneth not to the contrary, have never
                  done anything more approaching to business than making a book for the Derby, or
                  overhauling their stewards' accounts. But who among us can go back to four
                  generations of non-producers in his family? Take any of our set—myself as the
                  nearest example—my grandfather, the governor's father that is, was one of the real
                  'lords of the land, a regular
                  hard-fisted, straitforward—dirty, if you like—Dutch farmer, who sold his cabbages,
                  and took them to market himself, for all that I remember. I do
                  remember once, when a very small juvenile, helping his Irish labourer in the
                  kitchen-garden for a whole summer morning, and the old fellow giving me a
                  five-cent piece after our mid-day dinner, which I then thought something
                  Californian. My mother's father used to sell peanuts—ground-nuts you call them, I
                  believe,—I don't mean that he carried them round in a tin measure to the b'hoys at
                  the Bowery Theatre, but he used to import them from the Mediterranean, or Africa,
                  or somewhere. And finally he made a pretty tall fortune by it: but once he was
                  near failing outright, because some of his cargoes came in late when he had a good
                  many notes out. Think of the grandeur and destiny of a family depending on the
                  arrival of five ship-loads of peanuts!'
               'Fortune in a nut-shell,' said Ashburner.
               'Why the deuce should we try to be above our origin, especially when every one
                  knows it, or pretend to have any scruples about money-making? And that reminds me
                  of how I served out the Robinsons once. Mrs. R. had been trying to poke fun at us,
                  behind our backs of course, on the subject of cabbages and pea-nuts. Well, not
                  long after she gave a big ball, and we, being punkins,*
                   were of course among the invited. So I went to a clever working jeweller
                  that I knew, and gave him an order to be filled up in all haste from a design of
                  my own, ear-rings imitating pea-nuts in dead gold, and shirt buttons in green
                  enamel, to be the counterfeit presentment of two cabbages; and Clara and I wore
                  our ornaments at the ball (where they were much admired for their originality),
                  and made a point of bringing them under Mrs. Robinson's notice.'
               
                  
                  *A slang expression of young New-York for people of value and
                     consequence.
               
               Any further discussion was stopped by their arriving at that dreary triangular
                  square (more hibernico loqui) called the Park,
                  where Masters' wagon awaited him—not the red-wheeled one; this vehicle was of a
                  uniform dark green, furnished with a top (a desirable appendage when the
                  thermometer stands 85° in the shade) and lined throughout with drab. The ponies
                  were carefully enveloped to the very tips of their ears in white flynets. As the
                  groom saw Masters approaching, he put himself and the top through a series of
                  queer evolutions, which ended in the latter being lowered—a very necessary
                  operation, to allow any one to get in with comfort; and after Masters and
                  Ashburner were in, he put it up again with some ado, and then went his way, the
                  concern only holding two. Then Masters turned the wagon round by backing and
                  locking, and making it undergo a series of contortions as if he wanted to double
                  it up into itself, and run over himself with his own wheels, and drove to the
                  Fulton Ferry; for to arrive at the Centreville Course on Long Island—familiarly
                  designated as the island—you first pass through Brooklyn, that
                  trans-Hudsonian suburb of New-York, which thirty years ago was a miserable little
                  village, and now contains upwards of ninety thousand inhabitants.
               'And how did the ball go off?' asked Ashburner, as they rolled up the main avenue
                  of Brooklyn, at the slowest possible trot, according to the well-known rule,
                  always to take a fast horse easy over pavement. On board the ferry-boat there had
                  not been much conversation, the horses being so worried by the flies as to require
                  all Masters' attention.
               'Oh, it was rather a fiasco, but we had some
                  fun. Some predicted that the fashionables would come back, but they didn't, except a few of the young men; and
                  all of our set that were there threatened to go out of costume; but then we
                  recollected that would have been a very Irish way of serving out Mr. Grabster, as
                  by the established regulation in such cases, we should have had to pay double for
                  tickets; so most of us took sailors' or firemen's dresses—the cheapest and
                  commonest disguises we could get; and the ladies made some trivial addition to
                  their ordinary ball-dresses—a wreath or a few extra flowers—and called themselves
                  brides, or Floras, and so on. And some of the crack Bostonians blasphemed the
                  expense, and went in plain clothes. So we had the consolation of making fun of all
                  the outsiders, and their attempts at costume—such supernumeraries as most of them
                  were! And none of the comme-il-faut people would
                  serve on the committee, so Grabster had nobody to get up the room in proper style,
                  and it looked like a 'Ripton' ball room; and The Sewer reporters
                  were there in all their glory. The Irishman had borrowed or stolen a uniform
                  somewhere, and the Frenchman was appropriately arrayed in red, as a devil, and he
                  went about taking notes of all the people's dresses, especially the ladies'; and
                  as our ladies were not in costume, he thought he must have something to do with
                  them, and so presented some of them with bouquets, which they wouldn't take, of
                  course; and the young men trod on his toes and elbowed him off till he swore he
                  would put them all in his paper. And we danced away, notwithstanding The
                     Sewer and all its works. Tom Edwards was accoutred as Mose the fireman,
                  and Sumner had an old French débardeur dress of
                  his, just the thing for the occasion, only his shoes were too big; and after
                  tripping up himself and his partner four times, he kicked them off clean into the
                  orchestra, and fearfully aggravated the fiddlers; but he took it as coolly as he
                  does everything—put on a pair of ordinary boots, and was polking away again in
                  five minutes. And we kept it up till two in the morning, polka chiefly, with a
                  sprinkling of deux-temps, and then had a very
                  bad supper, and some very bad wine, of Mr. Grabster's providing—genuine New Jersey
                  champagne. How we looked after the dancing! Sumner's débardeur shirt might have been wrung out, it was so wet; and Mrs.
                  Harrison—she had got herself up as Undine—was dripping enough for a half-a-dozen
                  water-nymphs; and Miss Friskin had a shiny green silk dress; we had been polking
                  together, and my white waistcoat, and pants, and cravat, were all stained green,
                  as if I had been playing with a gigantic butterfly. And then after supper, when
                  there was no one but our German cotillon set left, and just as we had put the
                  chairs in order, the musicians struck work, and would not play any more (you know
                  what an impracticable, conceited, obstinate brute a third-rate German musician
                  is), saying that they were only bound to play just so long; so I gave them a good
                  slanging in their own tongue (I know German enough to blow up a man, and a fine
                  strong language it is for the purpose); and Bell swore it was too bad, and Edwards
                  tried to make them a conciliatory speech—only he was too tipsy to talk straight;
                  and Sumner offered them fifty dollars to go on playing. Thereupon, up and spake
                  the big bass-viol,—'We ton't want your money; we want to be dreated like
                  chentlemens;' and then Frank lost his temper. 'I'll treat you,' says he; and with
                  that he delivered right and left into the bass-viol, and knocked him through his
                  own instrument; and then some one knocked Sumner over the head with a
                  trombone;—then we all set to, and gave the musicians their change (we owed them a
                  little before, for it wasn't the first time they had been saucy to us), and we thrashed them
                  essentially, and comminuted a few of their instruments. And half-a-dozen of the
                  Irish waiters came out, with their sleeves rolled up, to fight for the honour of
                  the house, and protect Mr. Grabster's property—meaning the musicians, I
                  suppose,;—and Haralson of Alabama, one of your Regular
                  six-feet-two-in-his-stockings South Western men, who had come North to learn the
                  polka, and become civilized—Haralson pulled out a Bowie, and swore he would
                  whittle them up if they didn't make themselves scarce. By Jove! you should have
                  seen the Paddies scud! And I caught The Sewer reporter (the Irish
                  one) in the mêlée, and let him have a kick that
                  landed him in the middle of the floor, telling him he might put that into his next
                  letter, and afterwards go to a place worse even than The Sewer
                  office. Then, after all the enemy were fairly routed, we adjourned to my parlour.
                  I had some good champagne of my own, and a pâté
                  or two, and some Firmezas, and we held a jolly revel till four o'clock, and then
                  the ladies retired, and we quiet married men did the same, and the boys went to
                  fight the tiger, and Edwards lost 1400 dollars, and some of them took to running
                  foot-races for a bet on the postroad. Haralson outran all the rest—and his senses
                  too—and was found next evening about five miles up the road with no coat or hat,
                  and one stocking off and the other stocking on, like my son John in the nursery
                  rhyme, and his watch and purse gone. 'And The Sewer and
                     Inexpressible said that it was the most brilliant ball that had
                  occurred within the memory of the oldest inhabitant. And that's a pretty fair
                  synopsis of the whole proceeding.'
               By this time they were off the pavement,—a change very sensible and desirable to
                  man and horse, for an American pavement is something beyond imagination or
                  description, and must be experienced to be understood. The ponies, without waiting
                  for the word, went off on their long steady stroke at three-quarters speed, and
                  though the day was warm and the road heavy, stepped over the first three miles in
                  twelve minutes, as Masters took care to show Ashburner by his watch. They
                  challenged wagon after wagon, but no one seemed inclined to race at this stage of
                  the proceedings, and they glided quietly by every thing. Only once was heard the
                  sound of competing feet, when a black pacer swept up, with two tall wheels behind
                  him, and a man mysteriously balanced between them. 'After the sulky is manners,'
                  said Harry, slackening his speed, and giving the pacer a wide berth; and the man
                  on the wheels whizzed by like a mammoth insect, and was soon lost to view amid a
                  cloud of dust.
               And now they arrived at a tavern where the owners of 'fast crabs' were wont to
                  repose, to water their horses, and brandy-and-water themselves. The former
                  operation is performed very sparingly, the supply of liquid afforded to the
                  animals consisting merely of a spongeful passed through their mouths; the latter
                  is usually conducted on more liberal principles. But as our friends felt no
                  immediate desire for liquor, Masters amused himself while the horses rested by
                  putting down his top, for the sky had slightly clouded over,—a favourable
                  circumstance, he remarked, for the trot. Just as he was starting his ponies, with
                  a chirrup, a tandem developed itself from under the shed, and its driver greeted
                  him with a friendly nod.
               'Good afternoon, Mr. Losing,' quoth Harry, raising his whip-hand in answer to the
                  salute; then, sotto voce to Ashburner, 'a
                  Long-Island fancy man: lots of money, and no end of fast horses.'
               
               Mr. Losing had a thin hatchety face, and a very yellow complexion, with hair and
                  beard to match. He wore a yellow straw-hat, and a yellowish-grey summer paletot,
                  with yellowish-brown linen trousers. His light gig (of the kind technically called
                  a double-sulky) was painted a dingy yellow ochre; the horses were duns, the
                  fly-nets drab, and what little harness there was, retained the original law-calf
                  colour of its leather; in short, the whole concern had a general pervading air of
                  dun, which but for the known wealth of its owner might have been suggestive of
                  unpleasant Joe-Millerisms. The only exception was his companion, a gay
                  horse-dealer and jockey, who acted as amateur groom on this occasion. Mr. Van Eyck
                  had sufficient diversity of colour in his dress to relieve the monotony of a whole
                  landscape,—blue coat and gilt buttons, lilac waistcoat and ditto, red cravat and
                  red-striped check shirt, white hat and trousers. His apparel might have been a
                  second-hand suit of Bird Simpson's. As the gig came out close at the wheels of the
                  wagon, the two whips interchanged glances, as much as to say, 'Here's at you!' and
                  'Come on!' and Losing tightened his reins; then, as his leader ranged up alongside
                  Masters' horses, the latter drew up his lines also, and the teams went off
                  together.
               A good team race is more exciting to both the lookers-on and the performers than
                  any contest of single horses; there is twice as much noise, twice as much skill in
                  driving, and apparently greater speed, though in reality less. Neither had started
                  at the top of their gait, but they kept gradually and proportionably crowding the
                  pace, till they were going about seventeen miles an hour, and at that rate they
                  kept for the first half-mile exactly in the same relative position as they had
                  started. No one spoke a word; the close contact of horses in double harness
                  excites them so, that they require checking, rather than encouragement; but
                  Masters with a rein in his hand was feeling every inch of his ponies, and watching
                  every inch of the road. Losing sat like a statue, and his horses seemed to go of
                  themselves. Then as the ground began to rise, Losing drew gradually ahead, or
                  rather Masters' team came back to him; still it was inch by inch; in the next
                  quarter the wheeler instead of the leader was alongside the other team, and that
                  was all Losing had gained. Then Harry, with some management, got both reins into
                  one hand, and lifted his nags a little with the whip. At the same time Losing
                  altered his hold for the first time, and shook up his horses. There was a
                  corresponding increase of speed in both parties, which kept them in the same
                  respective position, and so they struggled on for a little while longer, till just
                  before the road descended again, Masters made another effort to regain his lost
                  ground. In so doing, he imprudently loosened his hold too much, and his off horse
                  went up.
               The moment Firefly lost his feet Masters threw his whole weight upon the horses,
                  and hauled them across the road, close in behind Losing's gig, the break having
                  lost him just a length, so that when they struck into their trot again they were
                  at the Long-Islander's wheel. Down the hill they went, faster than ever; the wagon
                  could not gain an inch on the gig, or the gig shake the wagon off. But Losing had
                  manifestly the best of it, as all his dust went into the face of Masters and
                  Ashburner, enveloping and powdering them and their equipage completely. Their only
                  consolation was, that they were bestowing a similar favour on every wagon that
                  they passed. As both teams were footing their very best, Masters' only chance of
                  getting by was in case one of the
                  tandem nags should happen to break, a chance which he kept ready to take advantage
                  of. By and by the leader went up, but Losing, who had his horses under perfect
                  command, let him run a little way, and caught him again into his trot without
                  losing anything. Nevertheless Masters, who had seen the break, made a push to go
                  by, and with a great shout crowded his team up to the wheeler, but there they
                  broke,—this time both horses,—and before he could bring them down he was two
                  lengths in the rear. Then Losing drew on one side, and slackened his speed, and
                  Masters also pulled up almost to a walk.
               'His double-sulky is lighter than my wagon,' said Harry, 'even without the top,
                  and the top makes fifty pounds difference. My machine is built a little heavier
                  than the average purposely, because it rides easier, and shakes the horses less
                  when there are inequalities in the road, so that besides being pleasanter to go
                  in, a team can take it along about as fast as anything lighter for a short brush,
                  but when the horses are so nearly equal, and you have some miles to go on a heavy
                  road, the extra weight tells. However, it is no disgrace to be beaten by Losing,
                  anyway, for his horses are his study and specialité. Every fortnight the bolts and screws of his wagon are
                  re-arranged; his collars fit like gloves; he has a particular kind of watering-pot
                  made on purpose to water his horses' legs. Every trifle is rigorously attended to.
                  You ought to visit his, or some other sporting man's stable here just to note the
                  difference between that sort of thing with us and with you. Instead of hunters and
                  steeple-chasers, you will see five or six trotters together, that can all beat 2'
                  50''.'
               Ashburner began to have some dim recollection of hearing Losing's name before.
                  Some one, probably Sedley ley, had mentioned him as a person who considered women
                  only made to be mothers of men, and men only made to be trainers of horses.
               The road happened just then to be pretty clear, so they proceeded leisurely for
                  some miles further, till just as they were quitting the turnpike for a lane which
                  led to the course, the rattle of wheels and the shouts of drivers came up behind
                  them. Masters not disposed to swallow any more of other people's dust if he could
                  help it, waked up his horses at once, and they clattered along the lane, up hill
                  and down, and over a railroad track, and passed numerous wagons, at a faster rate
                  than ever. 'Do get out of the way!' shouted Henry to one primitive
                  gentleman, with a very tired horse, who was occupying exactly the centre of the
                  road. 'You go to ——.' The individual addressed was probably about to say something
                  very bad, when Masters, who was a moral man, and had the strongest wheels, cut
                  short any possible profanity for the moment by driving slap into him, and knocking
                  him into the ditch, with the loss of a spoke or two. This collision hardly delayed
                  their speed an instant; and though some of the pursuers were evidently gaining, no
                  one overhauled them for three-quarters of a mile, at the end of which Starlight
                  and Firefly swept proudly up to the course, with a long train in their rear.
               All the vicinity of the Centreville Course—not the stables and sheds merely, but
                  the lanes leading to it, the open ground about it, the whole adjacent country, one
                  might almost say—was covered with wagons stowed together as closely as cattle in a
                  market. If it had been raining wagons and trotters the night before just over the
                  place, like the showers of frogs that country editors short of copy fill a column
                  with, or if they had grown up there ready harnessed, there could not have been a more plentiful supply. Wagons,
                  wagons, wagons everywhere, of all weights, from a hundred and eighty pounds to
                  four hundred, with here and there a sulky for variety,—horses of all styles;
                  colours, and merits,—no sign of a servant or groom of any kind, but a number of
                  boys, mostly blackies, about one to every ten horses, who earned a few shillings
                  by looking after the animals, and watching the carpets, sheets, and fly-nets. The
                  only other moveables, the long-handled and short-lashed whips, were invariably
                  carried off by their proprietors. Whips and umbrellas are common property in
                  America; they are an exception to the ordinary law of meum and tuum, and strictly
                  subject to socialist rules. We to the owner of either who lets his property go one
                  second out of his sight!
               'Now then, Snowball!' quoth Masters, as a young gentleman of colour rushed up on
                  the full grin, stimulated to extra activity by the recollection of past and the
                  prospective 'quarters,'—'take care of the fliers, and don't let any one steal
                  their tails! I ought to tell you,' he continued to Ashburner, leading the way
                  towards the big, dilapidated,*
                   unpainted, barn-like structure, which appeared to be the rear of the grand
                  stand, 'you won't find any gentlemen here,—that is, not above half-a-dozen at
                  most.'
               
                  
                  *A very critical friend wants to know if the term dilapidated
                     can, with strict propriety, be applied to a wooden
                     building.
               
               'I was just wondering whether we should see any ladies.'
               Masters pointed over his left shoulder; and they planked their dollar apiece at
                  the entrance.
               Ashburner's first impression, when fairly inside, was that he had never seen such
                  a collection of disreputable looking characters in broad daylight, and under the
                  open sky. All up the rough broad steps, that were used indifferently to sit or
                  stand upon; all around the oyster and liquor stands, that filled the recess under
                  the steps; all over the ground between the stand and the track, was a throng of
                  low, shabby, dirty men, different in their ages, sizes, and professions; for some
                  were farmers, some country tavern-keepers, some city ditto, some horse-dealers,
                  some gamblers, and some loafers in general; but alike in their slang and 'rowdy'
                  aspect. There is something peculiarly disagreeable in an American crowd, from the
                  fact that no class has any distinctive dress. The gentleman and the workingman, or
                  the 'loafer,' wear clothes of the same kind, only in one case they are new and
                  clean, in the other, old and dirty. The ragged dress-coats, and crownless beavers
                  of the Irish peasants have long been the admiration of travellers; now, elevate
                  these secondhand garments a stage or two in the scale of preservation—let the
                  coats be not ragged, but shabby, worn in seam, and greasy in collar; the hats
                  whole, but napless at edge, and bent in brim; supply them with old trousers of the
                  last fashion but six, and you have the general costume of a crowd like the
                  present. But ordinary collections of the οι
                     πολλοι are relieved by the very superior appearance of the women:
                  pretty in their youth, ladylike and stylish even when prematurely faded, always
                  dressed respectably, and frequently dressed in good taste, they form a startling
                  relief and contrast to their cavaliers; and not only the stranger, but the native
                  gentleman, is continually surprised at the difference, and says to himself, 'Where
                  in the world could such nice women pick up those snobs!' Here, where there is not
                  a woman within a mile (unless that suspicious carriage in the corner contains some
                  gay friends of Tom Edwards'), the
                  congregated male loaferism of these people, without even a decent-looking dog
                  among them, is enough to make a man button his pockets instinctively.
               Amid this wilderness of vagabonds may be seen grouped together at the further
                  corner of the stand, the representatives of the gentlemanly interest, numbering,
                  as Masters had predicted, about half-a-dozen. Losing, with his yellow blouse and
                  moustache to match; Tom Edwards, in a white hat and trousers, and black velvet
                  coat; Harrison, slovenly in his attire, and looking almost as coarse as any of the
                  rowdies about, till he raises his head, and shows his intelligent eyes; Bleecker,
                  who has just arrived; and a few specimens of Young New-York like him. Masters
                  carries his friend that way, and introduces him in due form to the Long Islander,
                  who receives him with an elaborate bow. Ashburner offers a segar to Losing, who
                  accepts the weed with a nod of acknowledgment (for he rarely opens his mouth
                  except to put something into it, or to make a bet), and offers one of his in
                  return, which Ashburner trying, excoriates his lips at the first whiff, and is
                  obliged to throw it away after the third, for Charlie Losing has strong tastes,
                  will rather drink brandy than wine, any day, and smokes tobacco that would knock
                  an ordinary man down.
               The stranger glances his eye over the scene of action. A barouche and four does
                  not differ more from a trotting wagon, or a blood courser from a Canadian pacer,
                  than an English race-course from an American 'track.' It is an ellipse of hard
                  ground, like a good and smooth piece of road, with some variations of ascent and
                  descent. The distance round is calculated at a mile, according to the scope of
                  turning requisite for a horse before a sulky—that being the most usual form of
                  trotting; for a saddle horse that has the pole,*
                   it comes practically to a little less; for a harness horse (especially if
                  to a wagon) with an outside place, to a little, or sometimes a good deal more.
                  Around the enclosure, within the track (which looks as if it were trying hard to
                  grow grass, and couldn't), a few wagons, which obtained entrance by special
                  favour, are walking about; they belong to the few men who have brought their
                  grooms with them. Harrison's pet trotter is there, a magnificent long-tailed bay,
                  as big as a carriage-horse, equal to 2' 50" on the road before that wagon, and
                  worth 1500 dollars, it is said. Just inside the track, and opposite the main stand
                  outside, is a little shanty of a judge's stand, and marshalled in front of it, are
                  half-a-dozen notorious pugilists, and similar characters, who, doubtless on the
                  good old principle of 'set a thief,' &c., are enrolled for the occasion as
                  special constables, with very special and formidable white bludgeons to keep
                  order, and precise suits of black cloth to augment their dignity.
               
                  
                  *A horse 'will go to the pole' in such a time, means that he will go in
                     double harness. A horse 'has the pole,' means that he has drawn the place
                     nearest the inside boundary-fence of the track,
               
               'To come off at three o'clock,' said the hand-bills. It is now thirty-five minutes
                  past three, and no signs of beginning. An American horse and an American woman
                  always keep you waiting an hour at least. One of the judges comes forward, and
                  raps on the front of the stand with a primitive bit of wood resembling a broken
                  boot-jack. 'Bring out your horses!' People look towards the yard on the left. Here
                  is one of them just led out; they pull off his sheets, his driver climbs into the
                  little seat behind him. He comes down past the stand at a moderate gait. 'Hurrah for old
                  Twenty-miles-an-hour! Trustee! Trustee!'
               The old chestnut is half-blood; but you would never guess it from his personal
                  appearance, so chunky, and thick-limbed, and sober-looking is he. His action is
                  uneven, and seemingly laborious; you would not think him capable of covering
                     one mile in three minutes, much less of performing twenty at the
                  same rate. No wonder he hobbles a little behind, for his back sinews are swelled,
                  and his legs scarred and disfigured—the traces of injuries received in his youth,
                  when a cart ran into him and cut him almost to pieces. Veterinary surgeons, who
                  delight in such relics, will show you pieces of sinew taken from him after the
                  accident. That was six or seven years ago: since then he has solved a problem for
                  the trotting world.
               'There,' says Benson, with a little touch of triumph, 'is the only horse in the
                  world that ever trotted twenty miles in an hour. I saw it done myself. He was
                  driven nearly two miles before he started, to warm him up, and make him limber.
                  When the word was given, he made a skip, and though his driver (not the same that
                  he has now) caught him before he was fairly off his feet, he was more than three
                  minutes doing the first mile, which looked well for the backers of time; but as
                  the old fellow went on, he did every mile better than the preceding, and the last
                  in the best time of all, winning with nearly half a minute to spare.'
               'Has the experiment been often tried?'
               'Not more than two or three times, I believe; and the horses who attempted it
                  broke down in the eighteenth or nineteenth mile. Nevertheless, I think that within
                  the last twelve years, we have had two or three horses besides Trustee who could
                  have accomplished the feat; but as such a horse is worth 2000 dollars, or upwards,
                  a heavy bet would be required to tempt a man to risk killing or ruining his
                  animal; and our sporting men, though they bet frequently, are not in the habit of
                  betting largely. That is one reason why it has not been tried oftener; and I am
                  inclined to think that there is another and a better motive. The owner of a
                  splendid horse does not like to risk his life; and it is a risk of life to attempt
                  to trot him twenty miles an hour.'
               Pit, pat! pit, pat! The old mare is coming down to the score. A very ordinary
                  looking animal in repose, the magnificence of her action converts her into a
                  beauty when moving. How evenly her feet rise and fall, regularly as a machine, 
                     thongh
                     though
                   she is nearly at the top of her speed! She carries her head down, and
                  her neck stretched out, and from the tip of her nose to the end of her long white
                  tail, that streams out in the breeze made by her own progress, you might draw a
                  straight line, so true and right forward does she travel. Perched over her tail,
                  between those two tall, slender wheels, sits her owner, David Bryan, the only man
                  that ever handles her, in something like a jockey costume, blue velvet jacket and
                  cap to match, and his white hair, whiter than his horse's tail, streaming in the
                  wind—a respectable and almost venerable looking man; but a hard boy for all that,
                  say the knowing ones. Great applause from the Long-Island men, who swear by 'the
                  Lady,' and are always ready to 'stake their pile' on her, for her owner is a
                  Long-Islander, and she is a Suffolk county, Long-Island mare. Some eight years ago
                  Lady Suffolk was bought out of a baker's cart for 112 dollars: and since then she
                  has won for 'Dave' upwards of 30,000 dollars. That is what the possessor of a fast
                  trotter most prides himself on—to have bough the animal for a song on the strength
                  of his own eye for his points, and then
                  developed him into a 'flier.' When a colt is bred from a trotting stallion, put
                  into training at three or four years old, and sold the first time for a high
                  price, if he turns out well there is no particular wonder or merit in it; if he
                  does not, the disappointment is extreme.
               Ah, here comes Pelham at last—a clean little bay, stepping roundly, and lifting
                  his legs well: you might call it a perfect action, if we had not just seen Lady
                  Suffolk go by—but so wicked about the head and eyes! Behind the
                  little horse sits a big Irishman, in his shirt sleeves; and they are hauling away
                  at each other, pull Pat, pull Pelham, as if the man wanted to jerk the horse's
                  head off, and the horse to draw the man's arm out. You see the driver is holding
                  by little loops fastened to the reins, to prevent his grasp from slipping. Pelham
                  is a young horse for a trotter, say seven years old, and has already done the
                  fastest mile ever made in harness; but his temper is terribly uncertain, and
                  to-day he seems to be in a particularly bad humour.
               Trustee, who requires much warming up, goes all round the track, increasing his
                  speed as he goes, till he has reached pretty nearly his limit. Pelham also
                  completed the circuit, but more leisurely. The Lady trots about a quarter of a
                  mile, then walks a little, and then brushes back. Her returning is even faster and
                  prettier than her going. '2/ 33//,' says Losing, speaking for the first time, as
                  she crosses the score (the line in front of the judge's stand). His eye is such
                  that, given the horse and the track, he can tell the pace at a glance within half
                  a second.
               The gentry about 
                     are are
                     are
                   beginning to bet on their respective favourites, and some upon
                  time—trifling amounts generally—five, ten, or twenty dollars; and there is much
                  pulling out, and counting, and depositing of greasy notes. Bang! goes the broken
                  boot-jack again. This time it is not 'Bring out your horses!' but,
                  'Bring up your horses!'—a requisition which the drivers comply with
                  by turning away from the stand. This is to get a start, a
                     flying start being the rule, which obviously favours the backers
                  of time, and is, in some respects, fairer to the horses, but is very apt to create
                  confusion and delay, especially when three or four horses are entered. So it
                  happens in the present instance; half way up the quarter, the horses turn, not
                  altogether, but just as they happen to be; and off they go, some slower and some
                  faster, trying to fall into line as they approach the score. 'Come back!' It's no
                  go, this time; Pelham has broken up, and is spreading himself all over the track.
                  Trustee, too, is a length or more behind the gray mare, and evidently in no hurry.
                  They all go back, the mare last, as she was half way down the other quarter before
                  the recall was understood.
               'What a beauty she is!' says Harry. 'And she has the pole, too.'
               'Will you bet two to three on her against the field?' asks Edwards, who knew very
                  well that Trustee is the favourite. Masters declines. 'Then you will go on time?
                  Will you bet on 7/ 42//, or that they don't beat 7/ 47//?' (three-mile heats, you
                  will recollect, reader). No, Harry won't bet at all; so Edwards turns to Losing.
                  'Will you bet three to five in hundreds on the Lady?' Losing will. They neither
                  plank the money, nor book the bet, but the thing is understood.
               Pelham's driver has begged the judges to give the word, even if he is two lengths
                  behind; he would rather do that than have his horse worried by false starts. So
                  this time, perhaps, they will get off. Not yet! Bryan's mare breaks up just before they come to the score.
                  Harrison hints that he broke her on purpose, because Trustee was likely to have
                  about a neck advantage of him in the start. 'Of course they never go the first
                  time,' says Masters, 'and very seldom start the second.'
               'I saw nine false starts once, at Harlem,' says Bleecker, 'where there were but
                  three horses. Better luck next time.'
               It is better luck. Pelham lays in the rear full two lengths, but Trustee and the
                  mare come up nose and nose to the score, going at a great pace. 'Go!' At the word,
                  Trustee breaks. 'Bah! Take him away! Where's Bridges?' The superior skill of his
                  former driver is painfully remembered by the horse's friends. But he soon
                  recovers, and catches his trot about two lengths behind the mare, and as much in
                  advance of Pelham; for the little bay is going very badly, seems to have no trot
                  in him, and his driver dares not hurry him. In these respective positions they
                  complete the first quarter.
               As they approach the half mile, the distance renders their movements indistinct,
                  and their speed, positive or relative, difficult to determine. You can only make
                  out their position. Pelham continues to lose, and Trustee has gained a little; but
                  the gray mare keeps the lead gallantly.
               'I like a trot,' says Masters, 'because you can watch the horses so long. In a
                  race they go by like a flash, once and again, and it's all over.'
               In the next quarter they are almost lost to view, and then they appear again
                  coming home, and you begin once more to appreciate the rate at which they are
                  coming. Still it is not the very best pace; the Lady is taking it rather easy, as
                  if conscious of having it all her own way; and her driver looks as careless and
                  comfortable as if he were only taking her out to exercise, when she glides past
                  the stand.
               '2' 35'',' says Losing. He doesn't need to look at his watch; but there is great
                  comparing of stop-watches among the other men for the time of the first mile.
                  Hardly half a length behind is Trustee; he has been gradually creeping up without
                  any signs of being hurried, and clumsily as he goes, gets over the ground without
                  heating himself.
               'John Case knows what he's about after all,' Edwards observes. 'He takes his time,
                  and so does the old horse; wait another round, and, at the third mile, they'll be
                     there.'
               But where's Pelham? Is he lost? No, there he comes; and, Castor and Pollux, what a
                  burst! Something has waked him up after the other horses have passed the stand,
                  and while he is yet four or five lengths from it. There's a brush for you! Did you
                  ever see a horse foot it so?—as if all the ideas of running that he may ever have
                  had in his life were arrested, and fastened down into his trot. How he is closing
                  up the gap! If he can hold to that stroke he will be ahead of the field before the
                  first quarter of this second mile is out. A mighty clamour arises, shouts from his
                  enemies, who want to break him, cheers from his injudicious friends. There, he has
                  lapped Trustee—he has passed him; tearing at the bit harder than ever, he closes
                  with Lady Suffolk. Ryan does not begin to thrash his mare yet, he only shows the
                  whip over her; but he yells like a madman at her, and at Pelham, whose driver
                  holds on to him as a drowning man holds on to a rope. They are going side by side
                  at a terrific pace. It can't last; one
                  of them must go up. The bay horse does go up just at the quarter pole, having made
                  that quarter, Masters says, in the remarkably short time of thirty-six seconds and
                  a half.
               Pelham's driver can't jerk him across the track; by doing so he would foul
                  Trustee, who is just behind; so he has to let the chestnut go by, and then sets
                  himself to work to bring down his unruly animal; no easy matter—for Pelham,
                  frightened by the shouting, and excited by the noise of the wheels, plunges about
                  in a manner that threatens to spill or break down the sulky; and twice, after
                  being brought almost to a full stop, goes off again on a canter. Good bye, little
                  horse! there's no more chance for you. By this time, the Lady is nearly a quarter
                  of a mile ahead, and going faster than ever. Somehow or other, Trustee has
                  increased his speed too, and is just where he was, a short half-length behind her.
                  The way in which he hangs on to the mare begins to frighten the Long-Islanders a
                  little, but they comfort themselves with the hope that she has something left, and
                  can let out some spare foot in the third mile, or whenever it may be
                  necessary.
               Some forty seconds more elapse: a period of time that goes like a flash when you
                  are training your own flier, or 'brushing' on the road, but seems long enough when
                  you are waiting for horses to come round, and then they appear once more coming
                  home. The mare is still leading, with her beautiful, steady, unfaltering stroke;
                  but she is by no means so fresh-looking as when she started; many a dark line of
                  sweat marks her white hide. Close behind her comes Trustee; the half-length gap
                  has disappeared, and his nose is ready to touch Bryan's jacket. There is hardly a
                  wet hair discernible on him; he goes perfectly at his ease, and seems to be in
                  hand. 'He has her now,' is the general exclamation, 'and can pass her when he
                  pleases.' As the mare crosses the score (in 2' 34", according to Edwards's
                  stop-watch), Bryan 'looks over his left shoulder,' like the knights in old
                  ballads, and becomes aware for the first time that the horse at his wheel is not
                  Pelham, as he had supposed, but Trustee.
               The old fellow is another man. His air of careless security has changed to one of
                  intense excitement. Slash! slash! slash! falls the long whip, with half-a-dozen
                  frantic cuts and an appropriate garnish of yells. Almost any other trotter would
                  go off in a run at one such salute, to say nothing of five or six; but the old
                  mare, who 'has no break in her,' merely understands them as gentle intimations to
                  go faster—and she does go faster. How her legs double up, and what a rush she has
                  made! There is a gap of three lengths between her and Trustee. He never hurries
                  himself, but goes on steadily as ever. See, as he passes, how he straddles behind
                  like an old cow, and yet how dexterously he paddles himself along, as it were with
                  one hind foot. What a mixture of ugliness and efficiency his action is! At the
                  first quarter the Lady has come back to him. Three times during this, the last and
                  decisive mile, is the performance repeated. You may hear Bryan's voice and whip
                  completely across the course, as he hurries his mare away from the pursuer; but
                  each succeeding time the temporary gap is shorter and sooner closed.
               Now they are coming down the straight stretch home. The mare leads yet. Case
                  appears to be talking to his horse, and encouraging him; if it is so, you cannot
                  hear him, for the tremendous row Lady Suffolk's driver is making. She had the pole
                  at starting, has kept it throughout, and Trustee must pass her on the outside. This circumstance is her only hope of
                  winning. All her owner's exertions, and all the encouraging shouts of her friends,
                  which she now hears greeting her from the stand, cannot enable her to shake off
                  Trustee an inch, but if she can only maintain her lead for six or seven lengths
                  more, it is enough. The chestnut is directly in her rear; every blow gets a little
                  more out of her.—Half the short interval to the goal is passed, when Trustee
                  diverges from his straight course, and shows his head alongside Bryan's wheel.
                  Catching his horse short, Case puts whip upon him for the first time, shakes him
                  up with a great shout, and crowds him past the mare, winning the heat by a
                  length.
               The little bay was so far behind at the end of the second mile, that no one took
                  any notice of him, and he was supposed to have dropped out somewhere on the road.
                  His position, however, improved sensibly on the third mile; still, as there was a
                  strong probability of his being shut out, the judges despatched one of their
                  number to the distance-post with a flag; a very proper proceeding, only they
                  thought of it rather late, for the judge arrived there only just before Pelham,
                  and also just before Trustee crossed the score; in fact, the three events were all
                  but simultaneous; the judge dropped the flag in Pelham's face, and Pelham in
                  return nearly ran over the judge. This episode attracted no attention at the time
                  of its occurrence, all eyes being directed to the leading horses; but now it
                  affords materials for a nice little row, Pelham's driver protesting violently
                  against the distance. There is much thronging, and vociferating, and swearing
                  about the judge's stand, into which one burly Irishman endeavours to force his
                  way. One of the specials favours him with a rap on the head, that would astonish a
                  hippopotamus. Pat doesn't seem to mind it, but he understands it well enough (the
                  argument is just suited to his capacity), and remains tolerably quiet. Finally, it
                  is proclaimed that 'Trustee wins the heat in 7' 45", and Pelham distanced.'
               'Best three miles ever made in harness,' says Harrison, 'except when Dutchman did
                  it in 7' 41".'
               Edwards doubts the fact, and they bet about it, and will write to the
                     Spirit of the Times (the American Bell's
                  Life).
               Ashburner and Masters descended from the stand. The horses, panting and pouring
                  with sweat, are rubbed and scraped by their attendants, three or four to each.
                  Then they are clothed, and walked up and down quietly. They have a rest of
                  nominally half-an-hour, and practically at least forty minutes. Some of the crowd
                  are eating oysters, more drinking brandy-and-water, and a still greater number
                  'loafing' about without any particular employment. There are two or three thimble
                  riggers on the ground, but they seem to be in a barren county; nobody there is
                  green enough for them; the very small boys take sights at them. There is a
                  tradition that Edwards once in his younger days tried his fortune with them. He
                  looked so dandified, green, and innocent, that they let him win five dollars the
                  first time, and then, on the rigger's proposing to bet a hundred, his supposed
                  victim applied the finger of scorn to the nose of derision, and strutted off with
                  his V.,*
                   to the great amusement of the bystanders. Tom is very proud of this story,
                  and likes to tell it himself. That, and his paying a French actress with a check
                  when he had nothing at his banker's, are two of the great exploits of his
                  life.
               
                  
                  *A five-dollar bill is so called from the designation in Roman numerals upon
                     it.
               
               'This is rather a low assemblage certainly,' says Ashburner burner, after he had contemplated it
                  from several points of view, and observed a great many different points of
                  character. 'Do they ever have races here?'
               'Yes, every spring and fall, here, or on the Union Course adjoining. They are
                  rather more decently attended, but not over respectable, much less fashionable. At
                  the South it is different; the ladies go, and the club races are some of the most
                  marked features of their city life. I recollect when I was a boy, that these
                  trotting matches were nice things, and gentlemen used to enter their own horses;
                  but gradually they have gone down hill to what they are now, and the names of the
                  best trotters are associated with the hardest characters and the most disreputable
                  species of balls.'
               'And when they race, do the horses run on ground like this?' asked
                  Ashburner, stamping on the track, which was as hard as Macadam.
               'Precisely on this, and run four-mile heats, too, and five of them sometimes.'
               'Five four-mile heats on ground like this?' The Englishman looked
                  incredulous.
               'Exactly. It has happened that each of three has won a heat, and then there was
                  one dead heat. You will remember, though, that we run old horses, not colts. There
                  is no extra weight for age; they begin at four or five years old, and go on till
                  twelve or fourteen.'
               'But they must be very liable to accidents, going on such hard soil.'
               'Yes, they do break their legs sometimes, but not often. Our horses are tougher
                  than yours.'
               As they stroll about, Masters points out several celebrated fliers that have
                  gained admission inside of the stand, but prefer remaining outside of the track;
                  some pretty well worn-out and emeriti, like
                  Ripton, an old rival of Lady Suffolk (the mare has outlasted most of her early
                  contemporaries), some in their prime, like the trotting stallion, Black Hawk,
                  beautifully formed as any blood-horse, but singularly marked, being white
                  stockinged all round to the knee. 'There,' says Harry, 'is a fellow that belies
                  the old horse dealer's rhyme, 
                     
                        'Four white legs and a white nose,
                        Take him away, and throw him to the crows.'
                     
                  
               
               Time is up, and they return to the stand. Edwards is bantering Losing, and asks
                  him if he will repeat his bet on this heat. He will fast enough, and double it on
                  the final result. Edwards wants nothing better.
               This time, for a wonder, the horses get off at the first start, and a tremendous
                  pace they make, altogether too much for Trustee, who is carried off his feet in
                  the first half-quarter, and the Lady goes ahead three, four, five lengths, and has
                  taken the pole before he can recover. Bryan continues to crowd the pace. The mare
                  comes round to the score in 2' 33", leading by four lengths, and her driver
                  threshing her already. 'She can't stand it,' says the knowing ones; 'she must drop
                  out soon.' But she doesn't drop out in the second mile, at least, for at the end
                  of that she is still three lengths in advance, and Trustee does not appear so
                  fresh as he did last heat. The Long-Islanders are exultant, and the sporting men
                  look shy. When they come home in the last quarter, the chesnut has only taken one
                  length out of the gap; nevertheless, he goes for the outside, and makes the best
                  rush he can. It's no use. He can't get near her; breaks up again, and crosses the
                  score a long way behind. Much manifestation of boisterous joy among the farmers.
                  Edwards looks sold, and something like a smile passes over Losing's unimpassioned
                  countenance. It is plain sailing for
                  the judges this time. 'Lady Suffolk has the heat in 7' 49'',' and there is no
                  mistake or dispute about it.
               Another long pause. Eight minutes' sport and three quarters of an hour
                  intermission among such a company begins to be rather dull work. All the topics of
                  interest afforded by the place have been exhausted. Harrison and Masters begin to
                  talk stocks and investments; the juveniles are comparing their watering-place
                  experiences during the summer. Ashburner says nothing, and smokes an indefinite
                  number of cigars; Losing says rather less, and smokes more. Edwards has
                  disappeared; gone, possibly, to talk to the doubtful carriages. It is growing dark
                  before they are ready for the third and decisive heat.
               One false start, and at the second trial they are off. The mare has the inside, in
                  right of having won the preceding heat. She crowds the pace from the start as
                  usual; but Trustee is better handled this time, and does not break. Case allows
                  the Lady to lead him by three lengths, and keeps his horse at a steady gait, in
                  quiet pursuit of her. For two miles their positions are unaltered; Bryan's friends
                  cheer him vociferously every time as he comes round; he replies by a flourish of
                  his long whip and additional shouts to his mare. In the third mile, Trustee begins
                  to creep up, and in the third quarter of it, just before he gets out of sight from
                  the stand, is only a length and a half behind. When they appear again, there are
                  plenty of anxious lookers-out; and men like our friend Edwards, who have a
                  thousand or more at stake on the result, cannot altogether restrain their
                  emotions. Here they come close enough together! Trustee has lapped the mare on the
                  outside; his head is opposite the front rim of her wheel. Bryan shouts and whips
                  like one possessed; Case's small voice is also lifted up to encourage Trustee. The
                  chesnut is gaining, but only inch by inch, and they are nearly home. Now Case has
                  lifted him with the whip, and he makes a rush and is at her shoulder. Now he will
                  have her. Oh, dear, he has gone up! Hurrah for the old gray! Stay; Case has caught
                  him beautifully; he is on his trot again opposite her wheel. One desperate effort
                  on the part of man and horse, and Trustee shoots by the mare; but not till after
                  she has crossed the score. Lady Suffolk is quite done up; she could not go another
                  quarter; but she has held out long enough to win the heat and the money.
               And now, as it was somewhere in the neighbourhood of seven, and neither Ashburner
                  nor Masters had eaten anything since eight in the morning, they began to feel very
                  much inclined for dinner, or supper, or something of the sort; and the team
                  travelled back quite as fast as it was safe to go by twilight; a little faster,
                  the Englishman might have thought, if he had not been so hungry. Then after
                  crossing the Brooklyn ferry, Masters announced his intention of putting up his
                  horses for the night at a livery stable, and himself at Ashburner's hotel, as it
                  was still a long drive at that time of night to Devilshoof; which being agreed
                  upon, they next dived into an oyster cellar, of which there are about two to a
                  block all along Broadway, and ordered an unlimited supply of the agreeable
                  shell-fish, broiled;—oyster chops, Ashburner used to call them; and
                  the term gives a stranger a pretty good idea of what these large oysters look
                  like, cooked as they are with crumbs, exactly in the style of a cotelette panée. And they make very nice eating, too;
                  only they promote thirst and induce the consumption of numerous glasses of
                  champagne or brandy-and-water, as the case may be. Whether this be an objection to them or not, is matter of opinion.
                  Then having adjourned to Ashburner's apartment in the fifth story of the Manhattan
                  Hotel (it was a room with an alcove, French fashion), and smoked numerous Firmezas
                  there, the Englishman turned in for the night; and Masters, who had no notion of
                  paying for a bed when he could get a sofa for nothing, disposed himself at full
                  length upon Ashburner's, without taking off anything except his hat, and was fast
                  asleep in less time than it would take The Sewer to tell a lie.
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               A COUNTRY GENTLEMAN AT HOME.
               IT was a lovely October day; the temperature perfectly Elysian,—not half a degree
                  too hot or too cold,—and the air moister than is usual in the dry climate of the
                  Northern States, altogether reminding one of Florence in early autumn, only less
                  enervating. Ashburner and Harry Masters were gliding up the Hudson in a 'floating
                  palace,' which is American penny-a-liner for a north-river steamboat. Gerard
                  Ludlow was on board, handsome and distingué as
                  ever, but a little thinned and worn by numberless polkas. He had got rid of his
                  wife by a mighty effort, and was going to play le Mari à
                     la Campagne,—not at Ravenswood, however, but with some of the Van
                  Hornes, who lived higher up the river. While the young exquisite was rattling on
                  in a sort of Macaronic French to Mrs. Masters about the mountains of Switzerland
                  and the pictures of Italy, the ascent of the Nile and 'that glorious Clos-Vougeot Blanc Mousseux at the Anglais',—every topic, in short, that had not the
                  least connection with America,—Ashburner was witnessing for the third time, with
                  unabated admiration, the magnificent scenery of the classic American river,—for
                  classic it is to a New-Yorker since Washington Irving has immortalized its
                  legends.
               'I am glad to see you are not ashamed to show a little enthusiasm,' said Masters,
                  as he marked his friend leaning over
                  the forward railing, absorbed in the view before him. 'Some people don't care much
                  for this sort of thing. There's my cousin Ludlow, how supremely indifferent he is
                  to it all! He is talking to my wife about the last comic opera he saw in Paris,
                  which represents Shakspeare and Queen Bess getting very jolly together.'
               'Certainly one would hardly be able to tell what countryman Ludlow was, without
                  previous knowledge. He seems, like many of your fashionables, very much out of
                  place here.'
               'That's true enough; and the man most out of place among them all is my brother
                  Carl, whom we are just going to visit.'
               Ashburner's recollection and knowledge of Carl Masters were pretty much comprised
                  in a certain luncheon at Ravenswood, which he had found very much in place, and a
                  very good place for. Henry went on to explain himself.
               'He prides himself on a regard for two things—sincerity and equity—two very
                  estimable virtues, no doubt, but capable of being ridden to death like all
                  hobbies.'
               Masters further proceeded to state that he was afraid they would find his brother
                  in no very genial mood,—that, in fact, he had two special reasons at that time for
                  being in bad humour. The anti-rent epidemic had broken out in the vicinity, and
                  his place was threatened with perforation by a railroad. The former, however
                  perilous to some of his acquaintances, was no very terrible danger to Carl
                  himself, he having as many tenants in the country as his brother had in town—to
                  wit, just one. The latter was considerably more serious in itself, and rendered
                  particularly aggravating by attendant circumstances ces. An equally convenient and
                  much safer inland route for the railway had been originally proposed; but Mr.
                  Jobson, the chief engineer, started the project of a new one close along the
                  shore, running through the beautiful private grounds that lined the whole east
                  bank of the river for a hundred and fifty miles. The true motive for this change
                  was, that the company would thus have to pay less for right of way, since the
                  inland route would have passed through the corn-fields and vegetable-grounds of
                  farmers, to whom they must have made full compensation at the market value of the
                  land, whereas by cutting through a private lawn, they could take the ground at a
                  merely nominal rate, the damage caused to a gentleman by the destruction of his
                  place for all the purposes of a country seat being a 'fancy value,' which jurors
                  and commissioners chosen from the mass of the people, and regarding the
                  aristocratic landholder with an envious eye, would never pay the least attention
                  to. But, either from a lingering regard for outward decency, or from some other
                  motive, this, the real reason, met with only a passing allusion in Mr. Jobson's
                  report. He came out boldly, and recommended the river route as calculated to
                  improve the appearance of the shore, by filling up bays and cutting off sharp
                     points.*
                   What made it worse was, that the majority of these very gentlemen
                  proprietors had been induced to subscribe largely to the road under the solemn
                  assurance from leading members of the company (which took care not to make itself
                  officially and corporately responsible) that the inland route would be adopted,
                  which assurance was thrown to the winds as soon as the books were filled up.
                     
                     *A literal fact. Washington Irving's residence was among those disfigured by
                        this operation, which made havoc of all the oldest and most beautiful
                        properties in the State.
                   Carl was not to be taken in so; he had
                  refused to subscribe to the road, and opposed it to the extent of his small
                  influence from the first; he might be the victim of such people, but he would not
                  be their dupe. This was one consolation to him. Another was, that the railway,
                  when it did come upon him, which would not be for two years yet, would not
                  absolutely ruin his place. It would not go through his house, or across the lawn
                  in front of it, or break down his terrace, for which Nature was to be thanked, and
                  not Mr. Jobson. Ravenswood was partly within one of the to-be-improved bays, and,
                  consequently, the rails would cut it close along the water and under the terraced
                  bank. It merely stopped his access to the river, which, as he did not yacht, and
                  had room for the little boating he wanted in the adjoining bay, was no great
                  deprivation. At any rate, the danger anticipated by Harry turned out all
                  moonshine. When they stopped at Van Burenopolis (the landing nearest Ravenswood),
                  Carl's rockaway was on the ground, and in ten minutes their host received them at
                  his front door, both his hands outstretched, and his face lighted up with
                  unfeigned pleasure.
               Carl Masters was an unflattered likeness of his brother, with a larger nose, large
                  feet, that got into every one's way, coarser hair, and narrower chest; altogether
                  a rougher and inferior type of form; but he had a fresh and ruddy complexion, and
                  though he was Henry's senior by six years, there did not seem to be more than a
                  twelvemonth between them. In dress he was as quiet as Harry was gay; never cared
                  how old his clothes were, so long as he had plenty of clean linen; was often two
                  years behind the fashion; affected black coats and gray trousers; eschewed
                  enamelled chains, jewelled waistcoat-buttons, and other similar fopperies of Young
                  New-York York; preferred shoes (not of patent leather) to boots, and usually tied
                  his cravat in the smallest possible bow. Nor was the contrast in manner between
                  the two brothers less marked; the elder was shy and retiring before strangers, and
                  would have been called a very awkward man anywhere but in England. You might
                  easily guess from his way of behaving himself on a first introduction, the
                  uncertain style of his movements, and his 'butter-finger' fashion of taking hold
                  of things, that he had none of that dexterity in the little every-day occasions of
                  life which distinguished Harry; who, for instance, could harness a horse about as
                  soon as his groom, while Carl would have been half the day about it, and not have
                  done it well after all: Harry could carry out a complicated affair of business at
                  one interview, without coming off worst; but his elder brother would have pottered
                  about it three days, and probably been cheated in the end. In fact Harry, though
                  the junior, worked most of the financial and legal arrangements of the family,
                  which fact, combined with the way he had of making Carl a stalking-horse for his
                  stories, had more than once caused Carl to be regarded as a purely mythical
                  personage—This inaptitude for small business, this want of promptitude and
                  dexterity, of presence of mind and body, so to speak, is not very detrimental in
                  Europe, where a gentleman with a tolerably well-filled purse can have so much done
                  for him; but in America, where the richest man has to do so much for himself, it
                  is a constantly recurring inconvenience, and it struck the Englishman almost
                  immediately that this, though not especially alluded to by Henry, was one of the
                  things that made Carl out of place in his own fatherland.
               The mansion at Ravenswood, which had braved the storms of eighty-five winters (a
                  venerable age for an American house),
                  was pitched on a hill commanding a view of the Hudson for forty miles. Without, it
                  was built of rough stone, with an ample wooden stoop running all
                  round it, and a great variety of vines and creepers running round all the pillars
                  of the stoop;—within, it branched off into large halls and spacious rooms, filled
                  with antediluvian furniture, and guiltless of the ambitious upholstery attempts of
                  Young New-York, which in such matters goes ahead of Paris itself. The library
                  alone, in which Carl lived,—that is to say, he did everything but dining and
                  sleeping there,—was fitted up in modern style, furnished with luxurious arm-chairs
                  and sofas, the walls and ceiling neatly painted in oak, and the principal window
                  composed of one oval pane of glass set in a frame, to which the external landscape
                  supplied an exquisite picture. The hill swept down to the water's edge almost,
                  where it terminated abruptly in a lofty terrace, ninety feet above the level of
                  the shore. The woodlands all about—on Masters' place, on the places adjoining, on
                  the opposite bank—would have been beautiful at any time of the year; now, when the
                  foliage was changing colour, in anticipation of the coming frost, they were
                  surpassingly so. As the trees change not all at once, but different ones assume
                  different tints successively, the natural kaleidoscope is varied from day to day.
                  The sumach leaf is one of the first to alter; it becomes a vivid scarlet; then the
                  maple assumes a brilliant red and gold; then others put on a rich sienna, and
                  others a warm olive. Here and there were interspersed patches of evergreens, pines
                  looking almost blue, and cedars looking quite black from the contrast of the
                  gorgeous and fiery colouring that surrounded them. The river water was deep blue;
                  in the little bay north of Ravenswood it shaded off into a soft olive from the
                  reflection of the foliage and grass about it; while beyond the further bank of the
                  Hudson rose the Kaatskill*
                   chain, richly wooded to their summits, and painted with the myriad dyes of
                  autumn,—a fitting background to the landscape. Of course the finest part of this
                  view was beyond the limits of Ravenswood, but so much of it as belonged to Carl
                  (and his grounds covered some two hundred acres) was cleverly disposed with the
                  help of an ingenious landscape-gardener; the trees were cut into picturesque
                  clumps and vistas, opened at the desirable points. Henry, who bragged for all the
                  family as well as for himself, took care to inform Ashburner how, when the place
                  came into Carl's possession (or rather into his wife's, for by the laws of
                  New-York, the wife's property is absolutely hers, and out of her husband's
                  control) by the demise of his father-in-law, there was hardly a carriage-road on
                  it, and how he had devoted all his spare income to it for seven years, 'and made
                  it what you see.'
               
                  
                  *Commonly written Catskill; but I believe the above is the
                     genuine Dutch orthography.
               
               As the Englishman had nothing to do for some days but to ramble about Ravenswood,
                  and talk to the owner of it, he had full opportunity of ascertaining how far his
                  brother's estimate of him was correct, and also how far the difference between the
                  two, particularly in their practical aptitude for business, was attributable to
                  the fact, that one of them had finished his education in England, and the other in
                  America, which, for a New-Yorker, means in Paris, in Germany, half over the
                  continent of Europe, in short. His conclusion was, that some of the qualities
                  which made his host so 'out of place' were natural, and that others had been
                  superinduced upon these by his English education.
               Harry Masters had truly stated, that his brother's prominent trait of character was sincerity. He used
                  to say of himself, that the fairy had bestowed on him true Thomas's gift, 'the
                  tongue that ne'er could lie,' and that the consequent incapacities predicted by
                  the Scottish minstrel had fallen upon him; he could neither buy nor sell, nor pay
                  court to prince or peer (that is, in America, to the sovereign people), nor win
                  favour of fair lady. Certainly this is a dangerous quality in any country, unless
                  tempered with an exquisite tact, which was not among Carl's possessions; but it is
                  peculiarly dangerous in America, for there is no public (not excepting the French
                  or Irish) that feeds so greedily on pure humbug as the American. Populus vult decipi there with a vengeance; and when
                  the general current of feeling has set towards any show or phantasm, moral,
                  political, literary, or social, woe to the individual who plants himself in its
                  way.
               Equally correct was the assertion that equity was a leading idea of his mind.
                  'Give the devil his due,' was one of his favourite proverbs; and when he said that
                  a thing 'was not fair,' it seemed to him a conclusive argument against it. His
                  conception of the virtues was the genuine Aristotelian one—a medium between two
                  extremes. Not that he was a lukewarm partisan on all subjects; but of the people
                  he most disliked—and he was a really 'good hater' of some classes, Romanists for
                  instance, and Frenchmen, and Southern slaveholders—he could not bring himself to
                  take any unfair advantage. Now it is no news to any one who knows anything of the
                  Americans, that they are a nation of violent extremes; the different political
                  parties, theological sects, geographical divisions—the literati of different
                  cities even,—vituperate and assail one another fearfully, hardly respecting the
                  laws of the land, much less the principles of natural justice. Add to all this,
                  that Carl had a naturally elegant and fastidious taste, certain to make him
                  aristocratic in sentiment, however democratic he might be in principle, and it
                  will be seen that he had a tolerable stock of incompatibilities to start with
                  before having anything to do with England.
               But, as if to settle his business completely, and prevent him from ever becoming a
                  contented and contenting citizen of his own country, it chanced that just at the
                  period of his youth, when, according to the wont of Young America, dress and
                  billiards formed the main topic of his conversation, and he was aspiring to the
                  possession of a fast trotter, accident took him to England, and a series of
                  accidents kept him there, and caused him to make it his home for several years,
                  and his standpoint for all his continental excursions. He grew up to mature
                  manhood among and along with a generation of Englishmen. He acquired a taste for
                  classical studies, and for that literary society, and those habits of literary and
                  ethical criticism which are nowhere else found in such perfection. His life had
                  always been strictly, even prudishly moral; and while casting off the frivolities
                  and fopperies of his boyhood, he also parted with much of the impulsive and
                  imperfectly understood religion of his younger days, and replaced it by a more
                  sedate and permanent feeling, which never rose to ecstasy of emotion, but was
                  always present to him as a daily habit, and was deeply earnest, with little
                  outward show.
               Such a man's tendencies were visibly towards the Church; and had Carl been an
                  Englishman, or continued his sojourn in England, he would have taken orders
                  naturally and inevitably, and might have made a tolerable parson. But at home he
                  soon found it impossible to assimilate himself to that Evangelical party which constitutes the great bulk of the
                  American religious community.
               The three leading tendencies of his character already alluded to, fostered as they
                  were by his residence abroad, had ended by making him very eclectic and very
                  unconventional. He took what seemed good to him from every quarter, without
                  reference to antecedents; and the fact that all the world about him were going one
                  way, was just the reason to make him go the other. The Puritan denunciations of
                  all who differed from them on points of transcendental theology, or of social
                  institutions, seemed to him illiberal and uncharitable. His religion acted upon
                  him somewhat like the Socratic Dæmon; it restrained him from actions, rather than
                  prompted him to them. He abhorred all parade of godliness, and shrunk from
                  disclosing his religious experiences, as he would have done from disclosing his
                  loves, to a mixed assemblage. There were many things about these people besides
                  their abhorrence of the fine arts, that shocked his æsthetic sensibility, and
                  their inquisitive censoriousness he deemed ungentlemanly in point of manners, and
                  little short of persecution in point of principle. What most of all repelled him
                  was their unmitigated 'seriousness.' A certain notorious personage, whom it is no
                  scandal to call the greatest of living charlatans, is reported to have taken for
                  his motto (literally taken, and half spoiled in the appropriation,
                  from a Bishop of old), 'Praise God, and be merry.' Now this was exactly what Carl
                  wanted to do, to praise God, and be merry; and he did not think the latter clause
                  of the device implied any necessary incompatibility with the former. He held
                  strongly to the 'neque semper arcum,' and
                  thought that a man was all the better man, and better Christian, for an occasional
                  season of healthy enjoyment ment. He did not think 'teetotalism' necessa prevent
                  gentlemen from becoming drunkards, and he took his regular exercise on Sunday as
                  well as on other days. His sincere nature revolted equally from the idea of
                  dissembling a merriment which he felt, and from that of simulating a religious
                  enthusiasm which he did not feel. With all personal respect for such men, and all
                  reverence for the service they had done to the cause of vital religion, and civil,
                  no less than religious liberty, he very soon found that he could not amalgamate
                  with them, and gave up all intention of going into the church. Thus it came to
                  pass, that letting himself slide into the place which his fortune and connexions
                  had marked out for him, he became a man of society, and a gentleman of the world.
                  It proved that he was not entirely free from the national error of quitting one
                  extreme for another; it could only be said in his defence, that his new rôle rather came to, than was sought for by him.
                  Perhaps his fastidiousness partly led him into it; but this trait of his mind
                  showed itself more in intellectual criticism than in material Sybaritism, and more
                  in the choice of companions than either. Certainly he had no great qualifications
                  for the part, especially in New York, and very wild work he made of it with his
                  peculiar ideas, some of which were rather English, and all of which were
                  considerably the reverse of American.
               The first offence that Carl gave was by getting married in church as quietly as
                  anything can be done in New-York, and going out of the way immediately afterwards,
                  instead of standing his bride up for eight hundred people to look at. He was
                  shamefully negligent of his duties to society in not having given 'a reception.'
                  Carl said that he married for the present happiness and future comfort of himself
                  and his wife, not for the amusement of
                  society; and that was all the explanation he deigned to give his fashionable
                  acquaintances.
               His next eccentricity was refusing to read The Sewer, to let it
                  enter his house, or to talk about it. He said, that in Europe, scandalous
                  newspapers were not taken in by respectable families, that even young men read
                  them at their clubs, and by stealth, and never mentioned them before ladies; that
                  people making pretensions to superior morality and decency ought not to patronize
                  an immoral and blasphemous print—and more to the same effect. Men and women who
                  referred to France as the standard of half the things they did, taunted him with
                  referring to England. Masters did not think it worth while to discuss the merits
                  of that case, but answered by a quotation from Aristophanes, how 'clever folks
                  learn many things from their enemies,'—which he had to translate before his
                  auditors understood it,—and by another of like purport from a Latin bard, which
                  they were less slow to comprehend, as it has become part of the stock in trade of
                  our public speakers, and even the editors know what it means. Then one man liked
                     The Sewer because it had the best reports of trotting matches;
                  and another, because it published the news from Washington half-an-hour sooner
                  than any of its contemporaries; and they all said, that all the papers were so
                  bad, it was merely a question of degree, and not of kind. Nobody agreed with Carl,
                  not even the people who were abused by The Sewer, and he made no
                  converts out of his own family—his wife, brother, and sister.
               But his great crime was blaspheming the polka, for which I believe Young New-York
                  thought him absolutely insane, and would gladly have put him into a strait-jacket.
                  He thought that a matinée which lasted from noon to midnight was an
                  absurd and wicked waste of time; that even six hours a day was too much for a
                  reasonable being to devote to the redowa; that at a ball or party there should be
                  some place for people who like to converse, and a non-dancing man should not be
                  stuck into a corner all the evening on pain of being knocked over by the waltzers;
                  that the tipsy excesses of the young gentlemen who lorded in the ball room
                  rendered their society not the most edifying for ladies; and as whatever he
                  thought he gave utterance to in pretty plain language, he made himself
                  prodigiously unpopular, and was a great nuisance to the exclusives.
               On the other hand he found things enough to annoy him. He had no like-minded, and
                  it seemed no like-bodied men to associate with; no gentlemen to
                  converse with on classical subjects, no 
                     acqaintances
                     acquaintances
                   to join him in his long walks and drives. He was not over fond of the
                  French. 'They made the best coffee and gloves in the world,' he used to say, 'but
                  coffee and gloves, after all, are a very small part of life.' Therefore it was
                  irksome to him to hear the French always appealed to as the standard of dress,
                  furniture, and manners. Above all, it worried him to find their language the
                  recognised one of the salon and the opera. That
                  two or three persons, whose native tongue was English, should go on talking
                  imperfect French (for the knowledge acquired by a two years' residence in Paris
                  must be comparatively imperfect), though no foreigners were present, struck him as
                  a mischievous absurdity, and directly calculated to hinder mental growth. But all
                  these were petty troubles compared to the misery he endured from the gossiping and
                  scandalous propensities of his fashionable acquaintance. He now found his error in
                  supposing that there is any peculiar illiberality and uncharitableness in a
                  religious community, as distinguished from a worldly one; and discovered, that in avoiding the Evangelical
                  connexion, he had not escaped the spirit of inquisitive censoriousness. A common
                  error of young men is this: they fancy that because people of the world talk of
                  their liberality, and parade it ostentatiously, they must possess an extra share
                  of it. And doubtless they are more charitable towards their favorite propensities;
                  the 'jolly good fellow' will judge leniently of his bottle companion's trippings,
                  and so on through the calendar of vices: though even this proposition is not to be
                  received absolutely. Cataline will sometimes be found complaining of sedition;
                  most offenders have some lingering sense remaining of original right and wrong;
                  not enough to keep them straight, but enough to blame others for the self-same
                  obliquities. But to try the question correctly, we should examine the worldly, not
                  in their judgments of one another, but in their judgments of the religious, and
                  see how much liberality they show them. We should watch the hatred of virtue and
                  purity, and the envy of fair fame, developing themselves in every form of slander
                  and detraction, from the sly innuendo to the open falsehood. All merely
                  fashionable society has a necessary tendency to be scandalous; fashionable people
                  must talk a great deal without any definite purpose, and personal topics are
                  always the readiest at hand for small talk, in a momentary dearth of others—this
                  one's dress and appearance—that one's style of living—who is attentive to whom—and
                  so on; so that besides the gossip which springs from deliberate wickedness, there
                  is a great deal that is the result of mere thoughtlessness and vacuity. And
                  New-York fashionable society is probably more scandalous than any other, because
                  there are fewer public amusements for persons of leisure than in the continental
                  cities of Europe, while the men have not that vent in political life, or the women
                  in out-door exercise, which Londoners find.
               Now Carl was imbued with the idea (I believe it was one of his acquired English
                  ones) that the first duty of a gentleman is to mind his own business. He had a
                  horror of interfering with any one's private affairs, and an equal horror of any
                  one interfering with his. It sickened him, therefore, to be among people who were
                  always speaking ill of one another, and fetching and carrying stories. He grew
                  tired of every one in the not very large circle of his acquaintance, which his
                  fastidiousness, before adverted to, had always kept small; for he hated immoral
                  people, and had a very imperfect sympathy for vulgar ones; and the man who begins
                  by excluding these two classes, will make a large hole in his visiting list. He
                  was in danger of becoming morbid and misanthropic. The natural and proper resource
                  for a person so situated, is to take up some active and steady occupation—ride
                  some hobby, if he can do nothing better,—at any rate, give himself enough to do.
                  Carl was not a man of hobbies, and all the available ones were ridden to death
                  already. The first resort of a young Englishman, with good fortune and connexions,
                  is politics: it is the very last resort of a New-Yorker similarly situated. He
                  usually has enough of it at college; is a violent politician at sixteen, and by
                  nineteen gives up all thoughts of shining in that way. Why this is
                  so, I will not stop to explain at present, as I have no intention of writing a
                  treatise à la De Tocqueville on the working of
                  democratic institutions in America. I only mention the fact; perhaps you will find
                  some further light thrown on it before we get to the end of this paper.
               Two refuges lay open before him—business and literature erature. 'Business'—banking, or commerce of some
                  sort, is the shortest way for a New-York to dispose of himself; but Carl had
                  neither taste nor ability for trading or finance, and was too frank and
                  unsuspecting to make his way profitably in a very sharp mercantile community. To
                  literature his ideas naturally turned; and in some countries a productive literary
                  life might have been his happy destiny. He was not necessitated to write for a
                  livelihood, and was just the sort of man to write for reputation. It was the
                  occupation for which his tastes and his education fitted him.
               But he had been too well educated for an American littérateur. His standard of excellence was pitched too high. The
                  popular novels provoked his criticism, not his emulation. The exaggerated flattery
                  of newspaper puffs, and the Little-Peddlingtonism of sectional cliques disgusted
                  him. He would not toady others, and disliked being toadied himself. He had too
                  correct an appreciation of newspaper editors, and too much candour to disguise
                  this appreciation. His accurate taste was shocked by little mechanical
                  deficiencies—the carelessness of compositors and proof readers—the impossibility
                  of getting a Greek quotation set up correctly. He wrote for elegantly and
                  thoroughly educated men, such as had been the associates of his youth, and found
                  few of his countrymen to read, and fewer to understand him; consequently, after a
                  brief experience, he gave up all writing for publication except one species of
                  authorship, which had only a semblance of doing others any good, and which did
                  himself a great deal of harm.
               This was the controversial and satirical, to which he was prompted by an honest
                  abhorrence of shams, and in which he was encouraged by the morbid public appetite
                  for anything savouring of personality or approaching to a 'row' upon paper. Carl
                  had a knack of saying disagreeable things in a disagreeable way, with some point
                  and smartness—was clever in prose parody, in the reductio
                     ad absurdum, in quoting a man against himself,—in short, up to all
                  the 'dodges' of belligerent criticism, and had a lively sense and keen perception
                  of the ridiculous; but not priding himself as a gentleman and a Christian on these
                  accomplishments, he did his best to keep them down, just as he did to keep down
                  any tendency to say ill-natured things in social intercourse, and only gave them
                  play when provoked by any flagrant exhibition of imposture. But having once found
                  by experiment how this sort of writing took, how an hour's ebullition of sarcasm
                  would command attention when two months of research and polish were unheeded, and
                  having no lack of material to tempt him, he was seduced into it again and again.
                  If a sciolist undertook to put forth a new theory of the Platonic philosophy
                  without having mastered his Greek grammar, Carl Masters was at hand to turn him
                  inside out, and show up his pretensions. If a demagogue took up the formulas and
                  watchwords of other times and countries, to malign his betters, and stir up one
                  class against another, Carl was the first to dissent from the popular voice of
                  panegyric, and demonstrate in plain terms what mischievous nonsense the lecturer
                  had been uttering. If a radical magazine blazoned out the discovery of some
                  prodigious mare's nest—some awful conspiracy of England against American liberty
                  or letters, who was so ready as Carl to point out that the editor could not spell
                  the most ordinary foreign name straight, and did not exactly know the difference
                  between Fraser and the Edinburgh? Booksellers and
                  periodicals were glad enough to publish these squibs, and the reading public read
                  them fast enough, with considerable
                  siderable amusement, and no profit or intention of profiting by them; it was
                     parvis componere magna, like Aristophanes and
                  Cleon; the bystanders cheered the exposer, and followed the exposed as fast as
                  ever. Carl began to set up for a professed satirist,—one of the worst things that
                  can befall a man, for the benefit he confers on others is very problematical, and
                  the evil he inflicts on himself positive and inevitable.
               He who had been the merriest of young men found himself growing ill-natured and
                  morbid when he should have been in the prime of life. It was hard to say which he
                  disliked most, the exclusives or the democracy, and he uttered his mind about both
                  pretty freely. He was sick of the newspapers, with their bad print and worse
                  principles—of the endless debates about the same old questions in Congress—of
                  literary pretenders, and the thousand and one 'most remarkable men among us,'—of
                  all the continuously succeeding popular delusions; of the gossiping young men in
                  illimitable cravats, and all the personal intelligence about Mr. Brown and Miss
                  Jones. Still he clung to old Gotham for a reason that influenced few people in it.
                  He had strong conservative feelings and local attachments; his childhood (unlike
                  his brother's) had been spent in the city, and the scenes of his childhood were
                  dear to him, however little interest he might feel in the new characters that
                  peopled them. But when in the rapid march of 'up town' progress, the house which
                  his father built, where his parents had died, and he and his brother and sister
                  played as children, became so surrounded by shops and stores, and manufactories,
                  that he was fairly driven out of it, then he withdrew from the city altogether,
                  and established himself for all the year round at his—that is to say, at his
                  wife's—place on the Hudson. His contemporaries speedily forgot him, or if they
                  ever thought of him, it was only as an unhappy recluse, Bellerophon-like, eating
                  his own heart, and shunning the ways of men.
               He was nothing of the sort. In quitting the town, he quitted most of his sources
                  of discontent. He had great capacity of self-amusement when fairly left to
                  himself, and could always find interesting occupation in his library. He now
                  reaped the fruit of his early studies, though not exactly in the way he had once
                  hoped and anticipated. His place, too, amused him greatly, and not keeping up two
                  establishments, he had money in abundance to spend on it. He revelled in
                  out-of-door exercise; it was a constant pleasure to him to gallop his blood mare
                  (a taste for horses ran in the family) over fresh grass, where there were no
                  omnibuses or fast trotters in his way. Nor was he without society; those who are
                  unpopular with the majority can generally boast of a few of the warmest personal
                  friends, and it was so in his case. They came to visit him by intervals and
                  relays,—real worthies of literature, who had been his father's friends before they
                  were his,—quiet men of general tastes and accomplishments like Philip Van Horne;
                  now and then a like-minded stranger, such as Ashburner, or his sister and her
                  husband, a good-natured, gentlemanly ornamental Philadelphian; or his brother
                  Harry. But most of all was he happy in his family circle; a man of the warmest
                  domestic affections, he rejoiced in the society of his children and the cheering
                  presence of his wife. We owe this lady an apology for not bringing her forward
                  sooner: it would have been more in accordance with the grammar of gallantry to
                  'put the more worthy person first.' And yet, reader, may it not be better to keep
                  the good wine till the last, and after telling you a great deal about a man whom
                  you may not like, then to tell you
                  something about a woman whom you must, or, at least, you ought to like? So let me
                  present you to Mrs. Carl Masters.
               Henry Masters used to say that Carl had carried out his eclectic principles in the
                  choice of his wife, for she was something between a blonde and a brunette, and had
                  dark eyes and light hair. She was a tall woman (according to the American standard
                  of female height—I am not sure that she would have been considered so in England),
                  and her figure rose up straight and springy as a reed. Altogether, she was in
                  beautiful preservation, which is more than can be said for every American woman
                  who has mounted into 'the thirties,' and is the mother of three children. Her
                  shoulders were magnificent, her bust good, her arms and hands exquisitely moulded,
                  her feet and ankles neatly turned, her features regular, yet not wanting in
                  expression, and her complexion almost perfect. Still with all these elements of
                  beauty, and though of good family (she was one of the Van Hornes), and sufficient
                  worldly prospects, she had never been a great belle, and this was an additional
                  charm in her husband's eyes, who would never have deeply loved a woman that all
                  the world ran after. Indeed she had not belle accomplishments or tastes, preferred
                  singing English ballads to Italian arias, and galloping over the country all the
                  morning to dancing at a ball all the night. And she was so insensible to the
                  advantage of a cavalier per se, that she would
                  rather talk to an amusing woman than to a stupid man, however handsome and
                  fashionable. Of toilet mysteries she knew enough to keep her from dressing badly,
                  but not enough to make her dress well and effectively. Her talents were not of the
                  showy order, and did not fit her for shining in the salon. She had good (not extraordinary ordinary) natural abilities,
                  and had been beautifully 'coached,' first by her father, and afterwards by her
                  husband, so that without any pedantry or bas-bleu-ism, she displayed an extensive acquaintance with literary
                  topics, but she was not brilliant in small talk, in playful raillery, or
                  cut-and-thrust repartee. When she was in Paris (as Miss Louisa Van Horne), the
                  French could make nothing of her; they thought her a handsome bit of marble, cold,
                  unimpassioned, and uninteresting. And when more lately Vincent Le Roi came, as
                  Henry's umbra, to pass a few days at Ravenswood,
                  the Vicomte went away saying that Madame Carl Masters was undoubtedly an angel,
                  but, for his part, he didn't like angels; they were misty and insipid; he much
                  preferred les filles d' Eve. And all who knew Le
                  Roi agreed that he would not know well what to do with an angel. On the other
                  hand, it must be set off against the deficiencies above mentioned, that she was a
                  true and a loving wife, a fond mother, a benevolent lady, and a sincere
                  Christian.
               Such was—no, such was not the mistress of Ravenswood. I feel the attempted
                  portrait is inadequate. A passing description cannot do justice to the woman any
                  more than a passing interview. Her superficial blemishes—want of ease in her
                  conversation, or of crinoline in her dress,—were obvious to the casual observer;
                  but the sterling qualities of her character, her truth and honesty, her constancy
                  of affection, her unworldly disposition, her loftiness of soul—all these, as they
                  could only be properly appreciated by those who had known her for years, so can
                  they only be generally and vaguely hinted at in a brief sketch like this. The
                  great mystery was, how she came to marry Carl. Every one said she was too good for
                  him, and he would have been the last man to deny it. Perhaps she was pleased with
                  his simple integrity, and foresaw that
                  he would make a most affectionate husband, though it was not in his nature to be a
                  passionate lover. Perhaps she pardoned his awkwardness in regard for his honesty.
                  Perhaps it was one of the singular cases (occurring, however, so often in society
                  that they can hardly be called singular) where a woman marries a man not half good
                  enough for her, or, vice versa, without any one
                  being able to explain why.
               After all, I would not claim that she was morally perfect; very few of us are. I
                  am afraid she was rather censorious, and judged harshly of sinners; that in her
                  own comfortable position she did not always weigh accurately the temptations of
                  others It is a common practice of very good and moral people to indemnify
                  themselves for their virtue by depreciation of others; 'tis an error that lurks at
                  the heels of Christian duty; for are we not commanded to hate sin?
                  and the transition from the abstract to the concrete is so easy.
               I fancy, too, she did not harmonize altogether with Mrs. Henry Masters. Indeed,
                  the two sisters-in-law made little secret of their mutual incompatibility. Clara
                  said that Louisa was very proper and very stupid, regular as a machine, and with
                  no fun or frolic in her—that the only man she ever had about her, her cousin
                  Philip, was as dull as herself,—that she dressed badly, and talked bad
                  French,—that she went to church in the morning, and gossiped in the afternoon, and
                  was more charitable to the bodies of her inferiors than to the souls of her
                  equals. Louisa looked down upon Clara as a worldly and frivolous little creature,
                  who fostered her beauty to attract admirers, and worried her husband to death by
                  her caprices, who wasted her time in dancing and flirting, and her money in
                  Parisian nick-nacks, or in giving parties to people who did not care for her. In
                  short, the two ladies said many hard things of each other when separate, and were
                  painfully amiable when together.
               But these bickerings did not greatly impair the happiness of our party at
                  Ravenswood. The brothers loved each other as much as if they had not
                  been brothers, and had not had to divide a large family estate between them. Even
                  their wives' quarrels could not make them quarrel.
               Many a jolly turn had they and their guest, lounging with their cigars after
                  breakfast on the vine-trellised stoop, or under the spreading horse-chesnuts at
                  one corner of the house, watching the white sails that glided by on the sunny
                  water, and the fantastic cloudlets that floated in the clear sky; strolling
                  through the winding walks, or across the terrace at evening, when the setting sun
                  had piled red clouds like a huge volcano over the Hudson, and the Kaatskills
                  looked like great blocks of lapis lazuli, their summits half veiled in fiery mist;
                  riding through the adjacent country in bright moonlight nights, now threading
                  their way among the uncertain bridle-paths of a dense wood, and anon startling a
                  village with their clattering hoofs and boisterous merriment as they swept by it
                  at full gallop; driving four-in-hand a live-long day to visit friends, who lived
                  north or south of them on the rivers, by roads that rose up over the hills and
                  showed all the glorious panorama of the Hudson, and then dipped down inland among
                  picturesque glens and water-courses and mill-streams. Capital game breakfasts they
                  had, which the women were not too sentimental to help them in doing justice to;
                  and excellent plain dinners, with oceans of iced champagne; and when the cloth was
                  drawn, Carl would chirp over his claret with as comfortable a melancholy as ever
                  any 'ruined' Protectionist gentleman in
                  Old England gave utterance to.
               At a very early period of their acquaintance, Henry Masters had put Ashburner up
                  to the way of getting at the dark side of things in America. 'Never assail
                  anything,' he said; 'if you do, the people will tackle you, from the highest to
                  the lowest. Let an American gentleman talk; give him his head, and he
                  will soon lead you on the track you want.' Acting on this hint, the Englishman let
                  his host talk; what little he said himself would come in the form of a query or
                  suggestion. 'You lead a very nice life here,' he would say, 'but it is rather
                  quiet. I should think an active man like yourself would choose some more stirring
                  form of existence.' Then Carl blazed out.
               'Go into politics I suppose! A nice business that for an honest man and a
                  gentleman! Why, Ashburner, the democracy of our State, who are always in fear of
                  being reduced to vassalage by a few thousand easy and unambitious rich men, have
                  lost their liberties without perceiving it to hundreds of thousands of alien
                  settlers with their foreign priests. A successful politician here is either a hack
                  lawyer of thirty years' standing, who has had opportunity enough of getting
                     used to the devil's work in his first business, or an
                  upstart demagogue, who has made his way by dint of sheer brass; either a blind
                  partisan, who knows nothing outside of 'the regular ticket,' or a 'non-committal'
                  man, who says everything to everybody, and never gave an intelligible, manly,
                  straightforward opinion in his life. One party would sell us body and soul to the
                  Slaveholders, and the other to the Anti renters, and both to the Irish. If I could
                  bring myself to enter the lists with such people, I should have to start with the
                  dead weight of being a 'millionaire' (as they call every man here who has two or
                  three hundred thousand dollars) and an 'aristocrat,' (as they call every man who
                  has the habits and education of a gentleman). There is not a voter in this country
                  that has less influence than I have:—to be sure, I don't try for any, because I
                  well know that by doing so, I should only make myself more unpopular, without
                  becoming any more influential. Or be a leader of fashion, perhaps—one of those
                  people who talk scandal about one another all day long when they are not dancing,
                  who try to pursue pleasure in a place where every one else is at work, and are so
                  destitute of resources, that they quarrel for pure want of something to do. See
                  what they have made of my brother, who is a clever fellow and a well-educated man,
                  though I say it. He is becoming a third-rate dancer—one of Tom Edwards' corps; is growing frivolous and scandalous, and
                  getting his earnest honesty knocked out of him every day. Or profess literature,
                  possibly—Henry does a little of that too; you may see him in the magazines
                  sandwiched between the last learned cobbler and the newest Laura Matilda of the
                  West. No, I don't want to belong to any 'Mutual Admiration' Society, and if I did,
                  it's too late now. My mind has been spoken so often and so freely, that were I to
                  write a book as good as one of Fenimore Cooper's (if you can imagine the
                  possibility of a thing even in hypothesis), no editor would notice it, and no one
                  read it—unless it contained something personal. Here I shall stay and amuse my
                  self in what one of our ex-great men used to call 'dignified retiracy;' and if
                  this railroad drives me out, why then, ingens iterabimus
                     cequor—to England, were I a bachelor, but my wife couldn't live
                  there; no American woman can, after the attention she has been used to at home,
                  except the ambassador's wife—so it will probably be to Italy, or perhaps to Paris, for a man can
                  find occupation there, whatever be his peculiar bent, and fill up his time well in
                  the place without knowing or liking the people.
               'It does surprise me,' said Ashburner, 'that the terminus of a refined American's
                  dream should always be Paris,—that whenever a man has means and leisure, he runs
                  off thither, and stays as long as he can; and if not there, in some other
                  place—anywhere but at home.'
               'Come now,' broke in Henry Masters—he had retired with the ladies after dinner,
                  and now rejoined the men to have some claret—'don't you English run over to Paris
                  perpetually, and all round the continent? Don't we meet you everywhere in the four
                  quarters of the globe? You don't like to stay at home any more than we do; only we
                  are franker than you, and avow it'
               'We go away from home, but we don't like to stay away,'
                  replied the Englishman.
               'Exactly; and if we had a pied-à-terre close to
                  the continent as you have, we should not like to stay away from home either—more
                  than half the year. Here has Carl been making his moan to you about our
                  unappreciated condition; it's always his way over the decanters—one of his
                  amusements merely. (Carl, old fellow, pass the Lafitte this way.) Well, I think,'
                  and he paused to fill a brimming glass, 'that we are very jolly victims; and for
                  my part, I am quite disposed to play, regardless of my doom. Look at our wives and
                  children, our houses and horses, our whole style of living. Ponder well on this
                     Bordeaux; ruminate on these woodcocks we have
                  been discussing. What miserable misused fellows we are! We do live in
                  a great country—we have such civil and religious liberty as is enjoyed in only one
                  other country in the world; and if we don't have the management of the government,
                  why no one here or abroad holds us responsible for what the government does, and
                  that is just the condition Plato thought a philosopher should pray for. Fill up
                  again, brother mine, and thank your stars that you have your time to yourself, and
                  are not a parliament man, as Ashburner is going to be, and are not set to work
                  twelve hours a day among blue books and red tape.'
               And now, reader, these papers, which have been running on for a year or more, are
                  wound up. I did not begin them intending to give you anything marvellous, or new,
                  or profound about the aspect, prospects, and destiny, political, religious, or
                  literary, of the great people among whom I am a small unit. I only intended to
                  present you with some phases of outward life and manners—such things as would
                  strike or interest a stranger in our beloved Gotham, and in the places to which
                  regular Gothamites—American cockneys, so to speak—are wont to repair. For I am but
                  a cockney in my own country; I have never travelled far in it,—good reason why,
                  when they are apt to hang up a man at one end of the Union for what is a sort of
                  religion at the other. They did not aspire to be 'Sketches of American Society'
                  (that was an honorary prefix of yours, Mr. Editor), nor even Sketches of New-York
                  Society, but only of a very small class of persons in New-York; and therefore I
                  had originally headed them 'The Upper Ten Thousand,' in accordance with a phrase
                  established by Mr. Willis, though even that is an exaggeration, for the people so
                  designated are hardly as many hundreds. In truth, I began the series chiefly to
                  amuse some Can-tab friends of mine, who were curious to know how the gentlemen that were their
                  contemporaries and representatives in our Atlantic cities, lived, and eat, and
                  dressed, and amused themselves; what their habits and pursuits and propensities
                  were. The last thing that I expected was that any of them should be read, much
                  less republished, on my side of the water. To a New-Yorker, many things which they
                  contain must necessarily appear stale, stupid, and commonplace. For instance, in
                  one number half a page is taken up with the description of a trotting-wagon; to an
                  American I should as soon think of describing a pair of boots; the one is as
                  familiar an object to him as the other. But at the very first number some clever
                  folks took it into their heads that they were to be very personal,—that every
                  character described or even alluded to in them was to represent a real living
                  prototype; that was enough to make them sought after. And it really did happen
                  that in that first number I had described a sleigh which actually existed in real
                  wood and iron somewhere about the city; and the inference above detailed was
                  obvious. It is not every story in Gotham that has so much foundation; in fact,
                  they get them up frequently without any foundation to speak of, only unfortunately
                  the narratives don't fall to the ground as readily as the houses do. It is hardly
                  worth while contradicting such idle rumours, but to my American readers (since I
                  have some, much to my own amazement) I wish to say one thing once for all—that
                  Harry Masters is not meant to represent any living individual whatsoever, and that
                  his wife, house, horses, and other accessories, are not designed after the
                  corresponding appurtenances of any real person. And the same remark applies with
                  equal force to all the appendages of Carl Masters, as delineated in this very
                  sketch.
               Still, I suppose I ought to be obliged to the members of 'our set' who got up this
                  idea; for the factitious interest thus communicated to these papers has caused
                  them to be reprinted (in the cheap and multitudinous style of American reprints),
                  and thus to become known to the outsiders both of our own city and of other parts
                  of the country, who could, perhaps, judge them more fairly on their own merits,
                  from having no knowledge of, or interest in, the local celebrities supposed to be
                  portrayed in them. Some have been disposed to accept them as what they were really
                  meant for—light sketches of life and manners in a certain circle; some have had
                  the bad taste to wax furious at them. I understand that a few southern editors
                  have departed from their usual stoical calmness and dignified reserve on the
                  subject, to assail me for my occasional allusions to 'the peculiar institution;'
                  and am told (life is too short, and time too precious, to read such things
                  oneself, but there are always good-natured friends to put you up to them) that a
                  correspondent of the Ochlocratic Review and No Government Advocate,
                  who probably never wore a decent coat in his life, and regards every man in a
                  clean shirt as an oppressor of the people, has seriously taken me to task for
                  representing some of my characters as elegantly dressed! If this individual could
                  find nothing worse to say of my papers, after nine months' examination of
                     them, methinks he might have continued to hold his tongue; but I suppose
                  any trash will do for the Ochlocratic.
               
               Whether the abuse of these persons, or the praise of others, or my own
                  inclination, may tempt me hereafter to essay something more definite and
                  connected, I will not say at present. Of the things that 'lie on the knees of the Gods,' it
                  becomes no man to speak prematurely. Meanwhile, make a long arm across the
                  Atlantic—So,—shake hands, and good-bye!
