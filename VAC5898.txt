            PREFACE.
            These stories were written years ago, and have been collected and printed not for
               general circulation, but simply to preserve them. If they afford entertainment to
               others they will have served a double purpose, as their composition has been only a
               source of pleasure to me.

            DAY DREAMS.
            
               POOR PHIL.
               ANY one passing down —— street, Philadelphia, on a bleak winter night, some
                  twenty-five years ago, would probably have noticed at the side of the marble steps
                  of one of its handsomest houses a dark object, that might have been mistaken for a
                  large dog or a bundle of rags, but which upon examination would have proven to be
                  a very small child curled up in a very dirty blanket.
               Under cover of that blanket, the product of a game of pitch-penny with a friendly
                  chimney-sweep, in which my swarthy opponent had lost, I must beg leave to
                  introduce to you the hero of this little narrative,—myself,—Poor Phil.
               Home I had none, and never had had so far back as I could remember. Through the
                  day I gained a precarious livelihood by begging or stealing, and amused myself by
                  playing or quarrelling with the other beggar children; and at night I either went
                  home with them and took my share of their floor, or stretched myself, wrapped in
                  my precious blanket, on or under any convenient door-step that might offer. I
                  shudder now as I think of that forlorn childhood, but then I felt myself by no
                  means an object of pity. I was quite accustomed to being cold and hungry, and
                  when, as did sometimes happen, I got a good warming and a comfortable meal, my spirits were proportionately
                  high, and I simply felt as I then would have expressed it, that I was "in
                     luck."
               With no care for the future, happy like a poor little animal as I was, if not
                  suffering under some present bodily discomfort, it is probable that I frequently
                  munched my hard crust with a far keener relish and more contented mind than some
                  of the owners of those handsome homes whose doorstep served me for a table, could
                  ever again enjoy.
               On the evening to which I refer, however, I felt, to use another technical phrase,
                  somewhat "down-hearted." Within the week I had been turned from the door of my
                  only available beggar comrade, and warned from the beat of the
                  night-policeman—sworn enemy of all homeless wanderers—in whose district I had
                  found temporary refuge, and I had literally nowhere to lay my head.
               I had chosen my present position from the fact that there was a child's party
                  going on inside the house, and had enjoyed most thoroughly the excitement of
                  seeing the arrival of the little guests in their bright-colored dresses, and of
                  listening to the strains of music that floated out upon the night air; but now the
                  music began to grow strangely indistinct from time to time, and I found myself
                  struggling vainly with the drowsiness that I knew must not be allowed to overtake
                  me in my present quarters, lest the "Night-Hawk," as I irreverently termed that
                  guardian of the public peace whose pet aversion I seemed to be, should swoop upon
                  me and carry me off to the unknown region where all wicked homeless children were
                  sent to be punished. As I rose, with a sigh, chilled and benumbed, to start on
                  what I feared would be a useless search for lodgings, I laid my hand somewhat
                  heavily upon the wire-grating that protected the side of the steps, when to my
                  dismay the woodwork, decayed by long exposure to the weather, yielded to my touch
                  and fell inward with a loud crash. Terrified at the mischief I had done, my first
                  impulse was flight, but the scrambling life I had led had sharpened every faculty,
                  and the second and more practical one was to turn the accident to my own
                  advantage. With a quick look around, to assure myself that I was unobserved, I
                  crawled into the aperture. It was but the work of a moment to fit the grating into
                  its place again, and then, with a satisfied chuckle, I rubbed my hands gleefully,
                  feeling that for that night at least the question of free lodgings was decided.
                  Still more was my satisfaction increased when I found that the cellar-window that
                  opened into my new home had been left unglazed, probably to increase the draught
                  of the huge furnace into whose crimson, glowing mouth I could look, and whose warm
                  breath curled gratefully around my poor frozen limbs; and that, moreover, I could
                  command a view of the kitchen in the rear, from which appetising vapors were
                  wafted temptingly from time to time. Those were happy children up-stairs
                  doubtless, whose merry feet were keeping time to the beat of the music; but I do
                  not believe that among them all there was a heart more utterly free from care,
                  more entirely content, than that which throbbed in the breast of the poor little
                  outcast who lay resting his grimy chin upon his hands, watching the fat old cook
                  and her satellites in their busy preparations for the banquet, listening with a
                  keen relish to the kitchen gossip and witticisms, and finally, wrapped in his old
                  blanket, overcome by fatigue, slept the dreamless sleep of innocent childhood,
                  regardless of the cruel blast that swept down the street, searching his
                  lodging-place pitilessly.
               There is an old saying, "that there is a special Providence that watches over
                  children." However that may be, I can attribute it to little short of a miracle
                  that I was not frozen to death in my hiding-place during the course of that bitter
                  winter. Night after night I repaired to it, as, fortunately for me, the damage the
                  grating had sustained remained undiscovered by the master of the house. I would
                  watch my opportunity when the street was clear of passengers, then swiftly crawl
                  behind the grating, replacing it carefully, feeling each time that I had
                  successfully completed the perilous undertaking, a sense of triumphant security
                  that added to the charm of my position. In the morning I would awake with the
                  earliest dawn, and creep forth again before any one was stirring, to spend the day
                  as my fancy or necessities might dictate. Many a time I was awakened in the night
                  by the howling of the storm around me,
                  and more than once I was compelled to force my way out through the drifted snow,
                  piled high above my grating, and yet that Providence whose "special care" of
                     me I certainly have every reason to acknowledge, watched over the
                  spark of life in that poor little frozen form, reserving it for better things than
                  to perish thus ignobly.*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *A fact.
               
               I felt as time passed on to have quite a householder's right in my place of
                  refuge. It was my home, and I rather prided myself on the elegance of
                  its position on the most fashionable street of the city, and assumed airs of
                  mysterious importance among the beggar children who lived in the crowded narrow
                  alleys around. The old fat cook and the various servants of the house became to me
                  familiar friends, and many a time I laughed to myself to think how surprised they
                  would be to know that the little beggar to whom they gave the "cold bits" in the
                  morning, sat quietly listening to their careless talk as he ate them, learning new
                  lessons of life from the refined society in which he found himself. I never
                  remember through all this time one questioning thought why such a life had been
                  dealt out to me, one comparison arising between my condition and the condition of
                  those more favored. I lived like a little animal, accepting what came, not
                  patiently—that word would express too much—but as a matter of course. Society had
                  so completely ignored my rights that I never thought of preferring a claim upon
                  it. I lived on day by day, hoping for nothing but sufficient food to keep away the
                  pangs of hunger, and sufficient shelter to preserve me from death, fearing nothing
                  but personal ill-treatment and policemen.
               I have often wondered how those who deny God's constant superintendence of our
                  lives explain the small, seemingly accidental circumstances by which they cannot
                  fail to see those lives are absolutely controlled. I slept an hour later than
                  usual one morning, a fact unimportant enough to state, and yet the seed of a
                  result that altered my destiny for time and eternity. With the true artist there
                  are no useless touches of the brush upon the canvas. Each stroke is the cause of
                  an effect to be produced in the perfected whole. Thus, to Him who designs the
                  solemn mysteries of our lives, seeing the end from the beginning, there are no
                  chances, no accidents, nothing unimportant.
               I was awakened from my sleep by a sound that sent the blood curdling through my
                  veins in an agony of terror. The slow, heavy strokes of the hammer just above my
                  head carried a sufficiently clear explanation of their meaning to my brain—the
                  grating was being repaired, and I was a prisoner. I sat watching my jailor at his
                  work in a kind of dumb despair. I realised that I must face one of two terrible
                  possibilities—slow starvation behind that grating, or discovery. Which was the
                  worse I could not determine. What the punishment for such a crime as mine might be
                  I dared not estimate—I shall never forget that half-hour of hopeless agony. Those
                  cruel nails seemed driven not into the wood, but into my living heart. But at
                  last, as I saw that the work was completed and that my enemy was collecting his
                  tools for departure, my distress could no longer be endured silently, and I sprang
                  against the grating with the wild cry of, "Oh, please, Sir, please Sir, let me
                  out, and I'll never come under these yer steps again long as I live and
                  breathe!"
               The carpenter was not a brave man, if one might judge by his frightened start and
                  the terrified expression that came into his eyes, but as after a moment's
                  astonished survey he became a war of the inconsiderable proportions of his
                  assailant, his look of blank surprise changed into one of wrath. "Undo my whole
                  morning's work for the sake of the likes of you, you little imp of darkness!" he
                  replied. "That's a likely story. I guess you are as well there as anywhere. You'll
                  be out of mischief for awhile, at all events."
               "How now, how now, Mr. Brown?" said a cheery voice from above, as a gentleman came
                  out of the front door, leading a little girl by the hand. "What is the
                  matter?"
               "Nothing, Sir," answered the man, touching his hat respectfully, "except that I
                  seem to have caged some kind of a wild animal under your steps this morning."
               "Is it a dog?" he asked, coming down the steps quickly. "Why, no, as I live it is a child!" he said as, Mr.
                  Brown having finally loosed the grating, I crept forth, dragging my precious
                  blanket after me, with a mind divided between regret at leaving my pleasant home
                  and fear of the long cane the gentleman carried in his hand.
               "Now, give an account of yourself, if you can," said the carpenter,
                  as he shook me vigorously, very much to the detriment of the neatly-cleaned
                  sidewalk, "and mind you speak the truth, if you know what that means. I tell you,
                  Sir," he added, turning to the gentleman, "he's a little street Arab; there are
                  hundreds of them in the city. They live by stealing through the day, and at night
                  sleep wherever they can find a hole to creep into."
               I looked up at my enemy with flashing eyes, with an intense wish that he were of
                  my size that I might "hammer him."
               "Ain't no street 'Rab!" I cried. "I'm a 'spectable beggar boy—'spectable as you
                  are."
               The gentleman smiled, much amused. "Well, my man," he said, "perhaps you will
                  condescend to tell us your name."
               "Name's Phil," I answered, shortly.
               "Phil? Phil what?"
               "Phil, that's all. Poor Phil, if you like."
               "Have you parents?"
               "Ain't got nothing but this blanket," I said, holding on to it tightly.
               "I mean have you a father or mother?"
               "No; never had none sich. Don't want them nuther. Ain't good for nothin' but to
                  kick up rows and 'buse a body."
               "Where do you live?"
               "Nowhere, I reckon, 'cept I sleeps under there," I answered, pointing to the
                  steps.
               "How long have you slept there?"
               "Pretty much all winter, I guess," I replied, with an apprehensive look at the
                  cane.
               "He has been sleeping under our steps all winter! Oh, father! do you hear?" It was
                  the child, who spoke for the first time, and something in her tone made me turn
                  and look at her curiously ously. I was used enough to threatening and abuse, but
                  the heart-felt pity that her voice expressed was strangely new to me. Her large
                  violet eyes were filled with tears and her tiny mouth trembled with feeling.
                  Something in the expression of that pure little face, in its golden setting of
                  curls, stirred the very depths of my poor darkened soul, although I vaguely
                  wondered what it was that made the little lady cry—no one had been hurting her, I
                  was sure. So absorbed was I in gazing at her that I quite forgot to answer the
                  gentleman's questions, until a sharp rap of the carpenter's rule recalled me to
                  myself. "Speak when you're spoken to," he said," or I'll teach you manners!"
               In a moment the child sprang forward with flashing eyes. "For shame!" she cried.
                  "You only dare to strike him because you think he has no friends. But you
                     shall not! Father, send this wicked man away."
               "Softly, softly, Margy," said the gentleman, as he drew her to his side. "The
                  question is, what shall I do with the poor little scamp? Can you help me?"
               "We couldn't take him into our house?" she said,
                  half-interrogatively, though in a tone that showed her sense of the fitness of
                  things was somewhat outraged by her own proposition.
               "Scarcely, Margy," answered her father, in a voice that fully endorsed her
                  doubt.
               "Oh!" she cried eagerly, after a moment's thought, "there's Girard College. That
                  is just the place for him. I remember I went there once, and everything was so
                  comfortable, and the Matron was so kind. Get him in there, father. You can if you
                  will, and I am sure you will."
               The gentleman shook his head doubtfully. "It would be attended with considerable
                  difficulty, I fear," he said. "I think the House of Refuge would be better."
               "Oh, no, father! That is only for wicked boys, and he is not wicked, I am sure he
                  is not. Do, do try! I think you can if you try. You can do
                  everything, you know."
               Her father smiled as he looked tenderly down into the little beseeching, upturned
                  face. "Well, well," he said, "I will try what I can do. I may as well give in at once. Things
                  always have to be as Margy says, you know." Then turning to me, he said with a
                  change of tone: "And so, my boy, if you will come to my office to-day at three
                  o'clock, I will be ready to attend to you. See that you do come, and
                  don't trick me, after all my trouble."
               After giving me explicit directions as to where the office was to be found, he
                  turned again to the carpenter, who had applied himself vigorously to his work,
                  with the grumbling comment "That in his judgment it would be much better to hand
                  the little rascal over to the police," and whilst his attention was diverted, the
                  child crept timidly to my side.
               "You will be sure to go to father's office, will you not?" she said.
                  "You need not be afraid of him, he is very kind." And then she proceeded to tell
                  me, in an eager, childish way, of the nice home that would be provided for me.
                  "Such a beautiful marble house!" she said, "so much handsomer than the one she
                  lived in, where I would get three nice meals a day, and a comfortable bed to sleep
                  in;" and in her earnestness she laid her little white hand on mine, and for the
                  first time in my life I experienced a feeling of shame as I saw how doubly black
                  and soiled mine looked by comparison. Her father's half-impatient "Why, Margy,
                  Margy, child! what are you about?" recalled her to his side, though
                  she paused long enough to press into my hand a tiny purse containing some small
                  silver coin—"That she had quite a right to give, as they were her very own," she
                  whispered. And then she took his hand, and with a pleasant little smile to me and
                  a "Don't forget," passed down the street with him, pausing before she turned the
                  corner to look back again and smile at me.
               There was little likelihood that I would forget. My poor brain was in a whirl of
                  excitement at the most unexpected turn in the tide of affairs, and I sat down
                  quite bewildered on the lowest step of my patron's house, vaguely counting over
                  and over again the silver pieces in the little lady's purse, entirely neglecting
                  to be angry with my enemy, the carpenter, who was relating the whole circumstance,
                  with some very aggravating comments, to a crony who had paused for a talk.
               "Ah, well, Mr. Brown," said that latter worthy, with a benevolent look at me as he
                  turned away, "it's as well, I guess, if they do take the poor little chap in hand.
                  The State's bound to provide free lodgings for him at one time or another in his
                  life—better an asylum now than a prison ten years later."
               For the second time that day my mind received an idea. The prison.
                  Yes, that I knew very well was what all dirty, ragged beggar boys came to, and I
                  did not like the prospect at all. I would certainly go and see what the gentleman
                  would do for me. The sweet little lady I was very sure would never have advised
                  anything that was not for my good; and besides, my imagination was quite excited
                  at the thought of living in a marble house, and having a bed to sleep
                  on. My vagrant life had been of necessity, not choice, and I was willing enough to
                  have a home provided for me.
               So thus it chanced that within a few days I was numbered among the Girard College
                  boys. I well remember the first morning I was entered there, how the lady teacher
                  under whose care I was placed took me into a room where there was a large mirror
                  and stood me up before it, and how I shrank back half-afraid of the wild, uncouth
                  little figure, with its grimy hands and face. And how, after a vigorous
                  application of soap and water, when I was dressed in the uniform of the
                  institution, she brought me back again and stood me up before the same glass, and
                  to my surprise I found that my hair, now neatly cut and brushed, was no longer a
                  dull smoke color, but a glossy golden brown; that my skin had lost its dingy hue,
                  and though darkened by exposure, was clear and smooth, and that the dark eyes had
                  no longer the vicious, look that their setting of rags and dirt had given them—in
                  fact that a transformation as complete had been effected as though my poor little
                  soul had passed into another body. Indeed, for the first few moments I gazed at
                  the pretty boy, who looked back at me so complacently, without feeling that he had
                  the least reference to myself, and when at last the conviction slowly forced
                  itself upon me, I glanced up into my teacher's face with a sudden flash of delight
                  in my eyes.
               
               "Is it really me?" I cried. "Why, I'm a little
                     gentleman!"
               "Well, see that you always behave like one," she answered, with an amused smile,
                  and then, as it was a leisure hour, she drew me to her side and began to talk to
                  me in a kind motherly way of myself, my past life, and the new one upon which I
                  was entering. For the first time I heard the name of God spoken reverently, and
                  when she asked me "If I had ever heard that holy name before," I answered with a
                  complacent little nod—
               "Oh, yes, I know that. We swears by him. Would you like to hear me
                  swear?" I went on with animation. "I can do it as well as any of the boys. The men
                  at the tavern used to give me sips of brandy, and pennies too sometimes. They said
                  it made them hurt their sides with laughing to hear a little chap like me swearing
                  like a trooper. Shall I swear for you?"
               "No, no," she answered with a shudder; and then in a simple and earnest way she
                  tried to impress on my poor darkened mind some faint definite idea of God, of
                  heaven and the angels. With but small success I fear, however, for when she paused
                  at last and asked, "And now do you think you understand at all what I have been
                  saying to you?" I answered with another complacent nod:
               "Oh, yes, I know about the angels—she's one."
               "Who?" she inquired, with some interest.
               "The little lady with the pretty curls that had me put here."
               My kind friend sighed and strove to make her explanation more lucid, but her words
                  only succeeded in effecting a compromise. "Well," I said at last, in a determined
                  tone, "if she's not one, she's like them anyhow," and from that
                  conviction nothing could shake me.
               And through the lapse of years, as I think of that sweet, pure face, with its
                  loving look of tender compassion, I am inclined to think so still.
               It would be weary work to follow the gradual steps of the process by which I was
                  raised from a mere little animal to the scale of a human being. At first the
                  obedience to rules and the confinement to study were irksome enough; but after the
                  first rudiments were acquired, and my brain once thoroughly aroused into action,
                  it seized with avidity every species of knowledge within its reach. It really
                  seemed as though its long starvation had rendered its desire for food the keener,
                  and I very soon took my place among those by several years my senior. To the
                  tender motherly care of the earnest Christian woman who from the moment of my
                  entrance took me under her especial charge, I owe more than a lifetime of
                  gratitude could repay—were repayment possible. She, however, passed to her reward
                  more than a year before I left the institution, but her work still lives in me,
                  and her life is still bearing fruit through the little twig she grafted.
               Margy and her father came occasionally to visit me, and at first I hailed those
                  visits as the happiest of my moments; but as years passed on, and I learned to
                  comprehend, with a hot indignant sense of shame, the state of fearful degradation
                  from which I had been raised, I shrank with sensitive pride from the pitying eyes
                  of the young girl to whom I was still "Poor Phil." And though appalled at my base
                  ingratitude, I acknowledged to God after each visit with tears of thankfulness the
                  weight of obligation that I owed her, feeling at the same time that I would not
                  willingly remove one tithe of that obligation, still it was a fact that I could
                  not controvert that the sight of her occasioned me pain rather than pleasure. This
                  her girlish tact soon perceived, guessing more accurately than I perhaps the real
                  source of my discomfort, and afterwards my patron came alone. He always seemed to
                  feel himself in a measure responsible for me, Providence having thrown me so
                  strangly under his protection; and had he lived, would I believe have interested
                  himself to provide me with employment when the time came for me to commence life
                  for myself, but his sudden death whilst I was still a member of the institution
                  deprived me of this hope for the future, and I felt that I had only my own
                  exertions to depend upon.
               It was not thus ordered, however. I had early developed an extraordinary talent
                  for drawing, and as I grew older the taste became an all-absorbing passion, and I
                  devoted every moment of my leisure time that I could spare from sleep or study to
                  this favorite pursuit. It so chanced that shortly before the expiration of my last term, that the attention of an
                  artist of some eminence, who was passing through the Museum that still exists, I
                  believe, in the upper story of the main building, was attracted by one of my
                  little sketches, and becoming interested in the account the teacher gave of me,
                  expressed a desire to see its author. The short conversation that we held together
                  I suppose impressed him favorably, for before he left he made me the astounding
                  offer that at the close of the term I should enter his studio as half-student,
                  half-assistant, compensating by my services for such instruction as I might
                  gain.
               "You may find your position a little arduous at first," he said, "but thus I
                  believe you will secure your future, for you possess genius, boy, and genius of no
                  mean order."
               I had no words to thank him with. My very brain seemed to reel under the pressure
                  of this sudden joy—the realisation of the dreams of a lifetime. But he understood
                  the silence that my brimming eyes made eloquent, and taking my hand, wrung it
                  warmly. "We understand each other, then. It is a bargain."
               "Yes," I said simply, looking up at him. "God has given me another friend." And
                  thus it was that the second phase in my life commenced.
               The next few years were quiet ones enough. My earnest devotion to and intense love
                  of art awakened the interest of my kind friend and instructor, Mr. G——, and I
                  found as time passed on my duties lightened and my opportunities for improvement
                  constantly increased. Industry, and patient study, I felt were to be the talismans
                  by which I was to succeed, and the knowledge that I had my position to win,
                  instead of depressing my ambition, excited it. Self-made, I realised, means, in
                  its highest sense, made by God, not man. He had given me talent by which to
                  conquer the shameful accident of birth, and conquer I felt I could and would.
                  There was much to be done, but the power to do was strong within me.
                  I had no fear for the future.
               Courage, it is true, failed me once, when in my twenty-first year my only friend
                  lay prostrated for many weeks upon a bed of sickness, which both he and I believed
                  would prove a bed of death. Night after night I watched beside him, with a bitter
                  rebellion in my heart against God, who seemed to raise up friends for me only to
                  withdraw them so soon as I had learned their value. I dared not face the thought
                  of the utter desolation that must fall upon my life when the only hand that met
                  mine with a cordial grasp lay still and cold, and the only eyes that gazed kindly
                  upon me were closed forever. Let death rob those who have more to lose, I said, in
                  thought if not in word; it is cruel, unjust that my all should be taken.
               What a patient God we have! Whilst I was murmuring against Him, He was preparing
                  the pathway in which He meant I should tread. I think it is always
                  so. He seems to seek to break our stubborn hearts and wills by His mercies, not
                  His judgments; and though He sometimes sends our blessings to us masked, and we
                  know them first by the name of sorrows, patient waiting will show us the
                  angel-face that the mask conceals. We believe this, and yet strangely enough we
                  seldom become familiar with that mask, and shrink appalled each time we meet it
                  standing in our way, fearing and doubting. He knows how weak our hearts are, and
                  chides us only by proving Himself to us again and again, until
                  sometimes faith grows by that proving, and the grim face loses its terror for us,
                  and we meet it humbly, trustfully, even though we realise that the grimness will
                  never be transfigured into beauty again, save on the shores of eternity.
               Those long painful weeks, and the genuine grief that I vainly strove to conceal
                  from the watchful eyes of my benefactor, seemed to cement and strengthen the ties
                  of friendship that years of daily intercourse had formed; and when with returning
                  health, physicians prescribed change of air, and his heart turned longingly to the
                  bright Italian skies under which his early manhood had been passed, he bade me
                  prepare to accompany him thither. "You need not hesitate to incur this seeming
                  obligation, Philip," he said, with that generous tact with which he ever strove to
                  remove the thought of dependence from my mind. "You have become one of the
                     necessities of my life; and even if this were not so, how could I
                  risk the chances of another illness, friendless and alone in a strange land? You must either come with me, or I
                  must remain with you."
               And I answered with a swelling heart; "I shall not hesitate. I owe my
                  artist life to you, and that debt can only be repaid in perfecting
                  it. It would be a false pride indeed that would shrink from accepting this
                  crowning obligation from the one to whom it is indebted for all that it already
                  possesses."
               These were the only words that passed between us, but, as in that first interview,
                  which I had such reason to gratefully remember, there was a warm hand-clasp and a
                  long, eloquent look into each other's eyes, and I felt myself thoroughly
                  understood, and realised that dependence upon a truly generous nature may become a
                  happiness instead of a pain—may strengthen instead of humbling.
               And so that painful illness, which we had regarded as so terrible a misfortune,
                  proved the doorway through which we entered upon the pleasant, wandering, though
                  far from idle, life which covered the space of the next five years. Both in living
                  and remembering them, those years seemed to be one long dream of happiness.
                  Wherever the beautiful was to be studied we were students. God in granting us the
                  power of appreciation had placed within our hands the "open sesame," the mystic
                  key with which to unlock His great treasure-house of beauty; and we entered it
                  reverently, not as a temple in which to idly dream and worship, but as a
                  storehouse in which we sought to gather materials by which our dreams might become
                  realities, our worship might expand into the highest praise, which is work.
                  Untrammelled by a single care, free to wander at will among scenes that must stir
                  the blood and awaken the enthusiasm of the coldest nature; enriched by the
                  inheritance which the genius of the past has left as the portion of the genius of
                  the present; drinking in inspiration from all that was sublime in nature and
                  wonderful in art; luxuriating in an atmosphere saturated, as it would seem, with
                  the exquisite conceptions of all former ages—what wonder that the germ within me
                  grew and strengthened, developing at last into expression, and I stood revealed to
                  myself, owned by the world, an artist.
               
               How well I remember the first picture which, with a shrinking terror at my own
                  temerity, and yet with a certain tremulous consciousness of merit, I placed upon
                  exhibition in Rome, that city of painters. With what anxiety I awaited the
                  result—hoping, fearing and doubting! What joyous exultation filled my soul when,
                  with tears of pleasure in his eyes, Mr. G—— informed me of the favorable
                  criticisms of some of the most eminent artists of the time!
               "Your life is a success, boy," he said, "the path is straight before you, onward
                  and upward. You will reach the topmost round of the ladder of fame yet. I have
                  toiled for years, and already you have left me far behind: I am proud of my
                  pupil."
               Had not I reason to be proud of my master, thus generously willing to
                  be outstripped in the race to which he had devoted the energies of a lifetime? For
                  though his words proved prophetic, and from that time my pictures did take a rank
                  in the artistic world to which his had never attained, this fact more than any
                  other seemed to afford him an intense gratification. His truly noble nature was
                  utterly incapable of a mean or petty impulse, and I verily believe he rejoiced in
                  my triumphs quite as sincerely as though they had been his own.
               Every fresh success only stimulated me to more earnest effort. Not only was I
                  impelled by a sincere and passionate love of art, but by a conscientious desire to
                  improve to their fullest extent the opportunities so generously afforded me, and
                  prove myself not unworthy of the interest of my benefactor. And so year by year I
                  worked and studied, and the eager enthusiasm of the boy deepened into the
                  steadfast purpose of the man, until at the expiration of our term of absence I was
                  enabled to return to the land I had left as a nameless adventurer, with a
                  transatlantic reputation, numbering among my friends many of the most
                  distinguished men of the age.
               It was a strange feeling to walk thus independently the streets of the city in
                  which I had wandered a vagrant; and yet the knowledge of what had been and what
                     was, awakened neither shame nor pride—only gratitude.
               
               It was even more difficult, perhaps, to realise the change in my worldly position
                  that those five years of absence had wrought. Whilst wandering in foreign
                  countries, with nothing to remind me of the dark pages in my life's history, I
                  never thought of questioning my right to the social privileges I enjoyed; but
                  finding myself again in the midst of familiar objects, I was oppressed with a
                  strange sense of unreality, and the impossibility of reconciling my past with my
                  present. Even my clearly-cut bearded face, upon whose earthiness of outline the
                  soul had so largely gained during those years of constant application, had a
                  strangely unnatural and unfamiliar look when viewed in the little mirror that had
                  so frequently sent back its reflection in times past. I believe I should really
                  have been more comfortable could I have taken up my life where I left it, and
                  returned as a matter of course to my old labors. Indeed, I said so to my friend,
                  Mr. G——, but he laughed and shook his head.
               "No, no, Philip," he said, "that would not do. The butterfly that has burst its
                  chrysalis never returns to it. I should be highly honored to be served by one of
                  the principal artists of the day. You must learn to realise the dignity of your
                  position, boy. Do you not know that you are the fashion just at
                  present; your name is upon every lip?"
               "My name?" I replied bitterly.
               "Yes," he answered gravely, "your name—the name that you have
                     earned."
               There was a rebuke in his tone, and I blushed in accepting it, as I realised my
                  thanklessness in thus even tacitly rebelling against the one inscrutable decree of
                  the Providence that had so wonderfully preserved and guarded me. How little I then
                  supposed that the time was not far distant when I would willingly have bartered
                  fame, genius, every earthly possession, for the knowledge that I did indeed
                  possess a name inherited, which I had a right to claim.
               Thus weakly are we constituted.
               The winter that succeeded our return was a very pleasant one. A niece of Mr. G——,
                  orphaned during his absence, whose isolated position, now that her school-days
                  were over, had more than anything else induced his return home, formed a very
                  agreeable addition to his household—throwing over it that undefinable home-like
                  feeling which a woman's presence always inspires, and which my kind friend for the
                  first time enjoyed since his mother's death long years before.
               I think, although he never expressed it in words, Mr. G—— had felt no little
                  anxiety in contemplating the revolution that the presence of a young girl must
                  necessarily work in the quiet old house, and that he shrank with all the nervous
                  dread of confirmed bachelorhood from the thought of the young
                     ladyisms to which he might be subjected; but his fears, if fears indeed
                  were entertained, were dispelled I think by the first sight of that frank, sweet
                  young face, in which he saw his own features reflected as though seen in a magic
                  mirror, softened and idealised. Indeed, the path to his heart was not a very
                  intricate one, and Sophie was not slow in finding it, and in less than a week had
                  established herself so firmly there, that I felt it was more than my place in his
                  regard was worth to even hint at the existence of the doubts that had so troubled
                  him a short time before.
               There was certainly no temptation for me to do so. Motherless, sisterless, cut off
                  as I had ever been from all female companionship, the friendship of this young
                  girl was a blessing earnestly coveted, and when won, sincerely appreciated. She
                  did not at all interfere, as I had secretly feared she might, with the familiar,
                  unrestrained intercourse of former days; indeed it really seemed as though she
                  were a link that bound my friend and myself even more closely together, her
                  delicate woman's tact drawing forth what was best in the nature of each, bringing
                  to light constantly new shades and phases of character, until we seemed to
                  appreciate and recognise ourselves and each other for the first time; and thus it
                  proved that although I judged it more fitting my present circumstances to
                  establish myself in bachelor lodgings at a few squares distance, that they were
                  lodgings only, and this as ever was home.
               
               Sometimes when after a pleasant evening spent in that social genial atmosphere, I would return to those lodgings
                  and find my fire out and my sketches scattered about in anything but picturesque
                  confusion, and everything with a chilly, dull, uncomfortable look, the sense of
                  contrast would strike me painfully, and thoughts that at other times I could
                  resolutely put from me, would clamorously demand admittance; and throwing myself
                  into my easy chair, I would give myself up to one of those aimless reveries that
                  sweep at times over every life, leaving them enervated and enfeebled. The disease
                  generally brought however its own cure, and I would spring from my seat at last
                  with a flush upon my cheek, and an inward consciousness that I had never yet been
                  conquered by circumstances however untoward they might seem.
               Strange to say, Sophie had no place in these dreamings. Certainly her pretty
                  little ways, half childish, half womanly, might have won her a foothold in any
                  heart, however impregnable a fortress it might seem; and her soft brown eyes,
                  sometimes deep and tender, sometimes brimming over with gleeful mithfulness, and
                  then again flashing with enthusiasm, were just the eyes to shine into one's
                  dreams, or to meet one unexpectedly gleaming from a blank sheet of canvas; yet our
                  intercourse was unaffectedly free from sentiment, entirely that of brother and
                  sister.
               Yet I knew enough of human nature to know it was surprising that this should be
                  so. No citadel so weakly guarded as a young man's unoccupied heart; and I could
                  not quite understand why she had not at once quietly taken possession; and then as
                  I would muse there would flash out from the dark past the vision of a
                  half-forgotten face, lighted by its gleaming golden hair, vaguely, mistily, just
                  as my angels gazed at me from the depths of my pictures, and with the same loving
                  tender expression; and I would wonder whether my heart was as unoccupied as it
                  seemed, whether there was not already written there the first chapter of a romance
                  that was to be finished. How? Oh, it was the wonderful finishing of the strange
                  story of my youth, that would send the hot blood flushing to my cheek, and myself
                  striding up and down my room in a state of fierce indignation, anathematising
                  thematising my folly and weak sentimentality in cherishing, even in secret,
                  thoughts that I would have cut off my right hand rather than allow any one to
                  suspect.
               Though I succeeded in shutting Sophie out of my dreams, she avenged the slight by
                  securing to herself a very large portion of my everyday life. Knowing nothing of
                  my previous history, to her I was only the rising young artist, her uncle's friend
                  and protege, in whose popularity she took a kind of sisterly pride; and she could
                  not understand the sensitiveness with which I shrank from the notice of her
                  fashionable friends, whose doors now stood open to me had my pride permitted me to
                  accept their hospitality, and laughingly characterised me as the most wonderful
                  phenomenon in nature, "a man who refused to be lionised." Conscious,
                  however, that I was regarded by her as a desirable escort, I could not always,
                  without a seeming churlishness, refuse to attend her; and the cup of pleasure thus
                  brought temptingly to my lips, only made the desire more intense to grasp it
                  firmly, and awakened the old rebellion in my heart against the power that had
                  neutralised all the wonderful gifts bestowed upon me by branding me as a social
                  outcast.
               I was, however, in the hands of a skilful little general who fully understood what
                  she was about. Since Sophie's lion would not exhibit himself to the public, it
                  became necessary for Sophie to become exhibitor and bring the public to see him.
                  "If you will not play guest," she would say saucily, "you shall at all events play
                  host. What is the use of my having a lion in leading strings if there is no one to
                  witness my triumph? Remember, you are not to fail me, we have a little supper
                  to-night." And thus it was: sometimes a supper, sometimes a dinner, sometimes an
                  evening party. Truly the revolution was effected. Merry laughter and the music of
                  glad young voices rang through the once silent, sober old house, and we who had so
                  dreaded change, now thoroughly enjoyed the reversal of all the fixed habits of our
                  lives—I with the enthusiasm of a youth defrauded of its legitimate sources of
                  enjoyment, and my friend with the loving satisfaction with which he entered into
                  everything that brought happiness and
                  brightness to the life of his darling, who had enthroned herself as idol in the
                  heart that had waited so long for her coming, an empty shrine.
               "Have you an engagement for Wednesday?" Sophie asked me one evening in mid-winter
                  as I rose to bid them good-night; "for if you have," she added with a determined
                  little shake of her head, "you must break it, as my very dearest friend has just
                  returned from Europe, and we are to have a dinner in her honor. Not a formal
                  affair remember, but a charming little reunion, to which I shall invite only
                  agreeable people, so come in your most amiable mood or you will forfeit your
                  seat."
               I laughed and carelessly promised obedience. Sophie I well knew had five hundred
                  dearest friends, and why should I suppose that the coming of this particular one
                  would be likely to affect me in any possible way? And so, unaware of what a
                  momentous day that Wednesday was to prove, I drifted on unconsciously to another
                  crisis in my life. Indeed, so completely did coming events fail to foreshadow
                  themselves, that I had very nearly forgotten the dinner altogether, and it was
                  only at the latest possible moment that I presented myself to my indignant little
                  hostess.
               There was time, however, only for a reproachful look and a sotto-voce threat of future vengeance, and then I was conducted
                  across the room and introduced to "the very dearest friend who had just returned
                  from Europe." There was no need for her to repeat that name. I had never forgotten
                  the face that looked up at me from beneath those waves of golden hair, with the
                  same childlike purity of expression that had first melted my heart into an
                  appreciation of the beautiful. Not that it was the same face that I remembered;
                  thought and feeling had wrought many changes there, and all the eager impetuosity
                  of childhood had faded out of it, leaving it calm and still—almost too still, one
                  would have said, who did not recognise in that calm, the restful peace of the soul
                  that had entered into possession.
               For a moment I utterly lost my self control, and it was well for me that Sophie's
                  careless words and the announcement of dinner covered the confusion that else I
                  must have found it impossible to conceal.
               Mechanically I offered my arm, but as she laid her white hand upon it, the light
                  touch thrilled through me, awakening my manhood, and the temporary weakness was
                  gone. Not only gone, but in its place a sense of power, of inward strength, such
                  as I had never known before.
               It seemed as though the sight of her brought with it, in the sudden realisation of
                  the almost miraculous change that had passed over my life since I last stood
                  beside her, a recognition of the wonderful capabilities with which it knew itself
                  endowed, and I felt that I could meet her look calmly, proudly, as one who had
                  fought not unworthily in the great battle, as one who with all the power of a
                  strong heart and an earnest will had striven single-handed with fortune and
                  conquered her.
               There was in this consciousness, after the first shock had passed, a strangely
                  exhilarating influence that bore down my ordinary reserve. Never had I felt more
                  coolly self-possessed, more quietly at ease. The remembrance of my past was lost
                  in the triumph of my present. For once Sophie's lion was fairly upon exhibition,
                  and I read delighted approval in her eyes. Her dinners were always charming, but
                  this one certainly surpassed all that had gone before. I talked, it is true, but
                  little to the companion so unexpectedly allotted to me, but I realised that it was
                  the inspiration of her presence that had lighted my life into this new brilliancy,
                  and knew full well that naturally as thought seemed to flow over my lips,
                  composedly as I now could meet her glance, that every nerve was strung to its
                  highest tension, and must quiver back into pain when the reaction should come that
                  would certainly follow.
               "I cannot understand it," she said, raising her clear eyes to mine with a
                  thoughtful penetrating look when we stood again in the drawing-room," your face
                  has no positive associations for me, and yet it is strangely familiar. It almost
                  seems as though I had known you in some previous state of existence. Have we ever
                  met before?"
               At another time I could not have parried so direct a question, but I did so then
                  with some quick jest about the transmigration of souls that carried our conversation into a new
                  channel. The recognition, I well knew, must come, but I did not wish it to be then
                  or there. "Let me meet her first on her own social level." I said to myself, "and
                  force her to measure my height with an unprejudiced eye, and then I will proudly,
                  willingly acknowledge the secret the revealing of which I now shrink from with
                  sensitive fear;" and at the time I believed myself sincere.
               Thus it caused me fresh uneasiness when a, few days afterwards, Sophie, who had
                  arranged a party in which her friend was included, to visit my picture that was
                  upon exhibition, suddenly exclaimed after gazing at it intently:
               "This is very strange! Why, Margy, how wonderfully you resemble this angel!"
               "Is that surprising?" I said, stepping forward quickly. But though
                  the words, and the tone in which they were uttered, brought a soft flush to her
                  cheek which it was no slight pleasure to see deepening there, I trembled inwardly
                  lest memory should take up the floating threads of recollection and weave them
                  into the terrible truths the shadow of which darkened all my sunshine.
               This anxiety wore off, however, as time passed on, for I realised it was only
                  whilst my face was unfamiliar that there was danger of its connecting itself with
                  the past. We seldom analyse the countenance of a friend; it means to us simply
                  such a person, just as the letters that unite to form a word convey to our minds
                  the sense of the word, not the names of the letters. Thus we lose
                  even the consciousness of deformity in one with whom we are constantly thrown, not
                  through affection, but familiarity.
               The countenance of a friend, I wrote—for as time passed on, it became my right to
                  claim that name from Margaret; for through Sophie's agency we were brought
                  frequently together, and the constant intercourse of those whose minds and tastes
                  are congenial, fence it around with what conventional titles you will, means
                  friendship.
               Whether she consulted her wishes or her instincts in thus throwing us into each
                  other's society, I cannot tell, but she certainly lost no opportunity of doing so;
                  and I did not fail to appreciate ciate the exquisite tact with which, when we were
                  together, she directed the conversation into the channels best calculated to
                  present our characters to each other in the most attractive light. At first I
                  shrank sensitively from these meetings; for though I was unwilling to acknowledge
                  the facts that I persuaded myself were of no moment to her though of such
                  importance to me, their suppression seemed to involve a species of imposition that
                  rendered me uncomfortable in her presence. Avoid her altogether I could not
                  without abandoning the only friends for whose society I really cared; for Margaret
                  I very soon found was not less dependent upon Sophie's affection than myself, and
                  sought even as I did, in her pleasant, cheerful home, refuge from a desolate
                  hearthstone,—her only companion since her father's death having been a lady who
                  was at that time her governess, and who now lived with her in the capacity of
                  friend and chaperone.
               It was not long, however, before the feelings with which I had first regarded her
                  were dispelled by the charm that she exercised over me; and I hailed with a
                  delight that I vainly strove to dissemble to myself, the necessity that thus drew
                  our lives together. Upon one point only I stood firm. Cross her threshold with my
                  secret unrevealed I felt that I could not, and many were the subterfuges to which
                  I was forced to resort to prevent her from supposing that any private reason
                  actuated my persistent refusals to accept her hospitality.
               Our intercourse, however, was sufficiently frank and cordial to disarm her
                  suspicions, and force her to attribute to accident the seeming inattention. To me,
                  however, the deprivation was a severe one, and induced me to grasp with even more
                  eagerness the opportunities of meeting her at the houses of mutual acquaintances.
                  Sophie had no longer reason to complain of me; I was her willing escort whenever
                  she chose to make demands upon my time. A restlessness for which I could not
                  account replaced the quiet content that had formerly overspread my life, and I
                  sought in the excitement of society the happiness that I had previously found in
                  repose.
               I would not acknowledge to myself what was the magnetic influence that drew me night after night into
                  crowded ball-rooms, and induced me to neglect even my art to linger by the side of
                  her whose "sweet fair face and gentle voice" had indeed rendered me "mad and
                  blind." There are unreasoning periods probably in all of our lives, and this was
                  mine. Had I once seriously investigated my own impulses and motives, I must have
                  recognised that I was treading upon dangerous ground; but I chose to enjoy my
                  present, and would not think, persuading myself that I stood in no
                  danger, because I rigidly excluded that living actual face from the reveries into
                  which in the past I had so frequently woven the ideal one. "We were friends,
                  simply friends, nothing more," I repeated to myself at least twenty times in each
                  day. "Surely there could be no harm in accepting the friendship she proffered me
                  so freely." I had not then recognised the fact that we are always in
                  the wrong when we are forced to defend ourselves to our own consciences.
               Thus, when the following summer a tour to Niagara and the Lakes was proposed by
                  Mr. G——, I readily yielded to Sophie's solicitations that I would accompany them.
                  Certainly it was my right to travel as I had ever done with my friend; he was fast
                  becoming an old man, and was dependent upon me for many services no other hand
                  could render. But the secret pleasure that the knowledge that Margaret was to be
                  of the party brought to my heart, ought to have warned me that a duty, stronger
                  even than that I owed him, should have withheld me from permitting myself two long
                  months of constant familiar intercourse with the woman whom every obligation of
                  honor forbade that I should love.
               But as is generally the case when we are weakest, I felt confident of my power to
                  resist the temptations that the future might bring, even whilst I knew myself too
                  weak to shrink from the one the present offered me; and thus I gave myself up
                  unresistingly to the enjoyment of that soft sweet summer that glided away only too
                  swiftly—mastering one by one the changing expressions of her face, exploring the
                  secret avenues of thought that led me into treasure-chambers undreamed of by the
                  world, at whose richness even I was forced at times to marvel; touching the
                  delicate chords of her womanly nature, and listening to the answering music, that
                  in its turn awakened echoes in my heart that I well knew might nevermore be
                  silenced.
               There is an old fanciful belief that souls are never created singly, but in pairs;
                  and that the incompleteness, the poverty of life arises from the fact that
                  untoward events separate these corresponding souls, preventing the union in which
                  alone there could be unalloyed happiness; but that in Paradise they shall not fail
                  to unite into one perfect being, complete in all its proportions, since each
                  supplies such qualities as the other has lacked. Had I been a convert to this
                  theory I should have felt that for me Paradise had commenced upon earth—that I had
                  found my corresponding soul.
               That springing into life as we had, one from a hovel, the other from a palace, in
                  meeting we dared not fail to recognise the fact that we already belonged to each
                  other. A comfortable doctrine this would prove for adventurers like myself who
                  have no other claim to advance; but unfortunately society fails to endorse these
                  spiritual mortgages, and he who holds no other title-deed to the heart of the one
                  he loves, has small cause to congratulate himself.
               With Margaret I never feared misapprehension of any kind. In her clear soul-lit
                  eyes I read her quick appreciation of each thought however imperfectly
                  expressed—nay, often realised that her womanly instinct pierced far more deeply
                  the motives of thought than I had power to do. In a word, I felt myself
                     comprehended. He who has realised what this means will understand
                  the new strength—life, I had almost called it—that sprang up within me from that
                  consciousness.
               Even had we been utterly indifferent to each other—the mere companions of an
                  hour—we could not have failed to recognise how entirely our natures harmonised. If
                  I had not loved her as a man, I must have studied her as an artist with exquisite
                  pleasure, and that study must of necessity have taught me reverence. As it was, I
                  loved and worshipped her both as man and artist. The fairest, purest ideal my
                  wildest dreams had ever conceived stood before me a living, breathing reality. And
                  yet I honestly declare the thought of
                  possession never entered my heart. This happy beautiful summer was a dream, like
                  many others that had brightened over my life, to fade as they had faded. It was as
                  I have said an unreasoning period—I recognised that the barrier between us was an
                  insurmountable one. I never forgot for a moment that it was
                  insurmountable, and yet I held down my conscience and chose for a brief period to
                  be happy whatever it might cost me, shrinking in a cowardly culpable way from all
                  self-examination.
               There are some who have stood blindly in a position such as mine; these are worthy
                  of pity. As for me, I was not blind; I wilfully closed my eyes and would not see.
                  I would not ask myself why it was that the life I had hitherto held so
                  indifferently had become all at once so priceless to me. When disquieting thoughts
                  arose I hushed them peremptorily. "I am not lost to all sense of honor," I would
                  argue with myself; "I understand my position; it is friendship that I feel, only
                  friendship, nothing more." Perhaps after all I was not far wrong. Friendship is
                  not love; but love in its highest, purest, most enduring sense is
                  friendship.
               Well, the dream was a very sweet one, but I was awakened from it abruptly,
                  harshly, as self-deceivers always are, and stood at last revealed to myself. This
                  is how it happened.
               As I was leaving Mr. G——'s room one night, he called me back. "Stay, Philip," he
                  said; "if you have the time to spare, I should like to have a few moments'
                  conversation with you. I have noticed for some time past," he added after I was
                  seated, "that your mind has not been at rest. You will think perhaps that I should
                  not ask your confidence until you offer it to me, but our long friendship, and the
                  deep interest I take in your welfare gives me the right, I think, to claim it. And
                  yet," he continued after a short silence that I strove in vain to break, "I should
                  hesitate to do so if I had not already divined the secret that you believe so
                  safe, and knowing your proud, sensitive nature, fully appreciate the struggle that
                  is going on in your breast. You are giving yourself much unnecessary pain, boy.
                  Remember that the woman you love, whatever may be her station, is honored by your
                  choice; and I thank God that I am able to place into hands so stainless, the
                  keeping of my child's happiness. The one cherished wish of my heart is gratified;
                  Sophie loves you, and you are worthy of her."
               I sat stunned, chilled to the heart; his words struck terror into me. I seemed to
                  have heard but that one last sentence, that having been once spoken could never be
                  recalled, that had burned itself in characters of fire upon my brain: "Sophie
                  loves you and you are worthy of her." I looked at him, that feeble old man whose
                  hair had bleached so rapidly in the past year, and I saw that his face, all aglow
                  with joy as it was, was quivering with an almost womanly tenderness, that his dark
                  eyes were filled with tears, as for the third time in his life he held out his
                  hand to me—that hand that had plucked me from infamy—in offering me what he
                  believed to be the final blessing with which he crowned all former benefits.
               This time I dared not grasp it. I had forfeited my right, I was no longer honest,
                  I was no longer true. With a low cry I bowed my face upon the table before me in
                  speechless agony. I cannot tell how long a time elapsed. I knew that he watched me
                  curiously; at last I felt his hand laid kindly upon my shoulder.
               I shrank instinctively from his touch; I dared not meet his eye; I rose hurriedly
                  to leave him. At the door I paused irresolutely, and then summoning all my
                  strength, grasped his arm firmly as I asked in a hoarse half-whisper, "Are you
                  assured of what you have said? How have you learned that Sophie loves me?"
               His brow that my strange conduct had clouded with a momentary anxiety, cleared at
                  my words. It was evident that he misinterpreted the cause of my emotion, and he
                  answered with a smile, "That is her secret; I have already said more
                  than she would ever forgive me for, so you must not betray me. Remember only
                  this," he added seriously, "I am not mistaken. You need have no fear."
               Hour after hour that night I walked my floor in a state of mind better imagined
                  than described, vainly striving to fly from the thought that clung to my memory
                  with pitiless tenacity, "Sophie loves you." The words rang in my ears like a
                     knell. Was it really so? I could not
                  doubt it. In the new light that had dawned upon my mind, a thousand little
                  corroborative circumstances, almost unnoted in the past, stood forth with
                  frightful distinctness. How far was I responsible for this I dared not ask myself.
                  For months, blind and deaf to all but my own selfish interest, I had devoted
                  myself exclusively to these two young girls; carefully guarding my manner towards
                  Margaret, lest she should suspect what I dared not confess to myself, but laying
                  no such restriction upon it with Sophie, cheating myself into the belief that my
                  more open attentions to her rendered those to her friend less culpable. It is true
                  I had never dreamed of danger to her; she had been to me so long friend and sister
                  that I could realise her in no other attitude; but the knowledge that I had not
                  meant to injure her could not free me from the deep sense of guilt and misery that
                  settled upon my heart. I loathed myself in feeling that I had placed her in a
                  position so degrading. It maddened me to realise how her sensitive womanly nature
                  would recoil from the thought so humbling to its pride, that her love had been
                  given unsought. I felt a bitter unreasoning resentment against myself, such as a
                  brother might feel towards one who had thus wronged a sister whom he idolised.
               And then, too, the face of my old friend Mr. G—— would arise before me, vividly
                  distinct with its look of kindly benevolence. Was it for this that he had for
                  years cherished me like a son, that I might cruelly wound the heart of her who, I
                  well knew, was dearer to him than his own life, and shamelessly destroy the
                  happiness of the household which had afforded me a refuge? I must have been a
                  better actor than I knew to thus set at fault his keen penetration. I could not
                  wonder that Sophie had deceived herself, since it seemed I had succeeded in
                  deceiving him. Perhaps in those first moments of despair I was harder upon myself
                  than I really deserved, since I had been free from all evil intention; and yet I
                  do not know. The selfish pursuit of our own aims and purposes, and utter disregard
                  of the interests and happiness of those around us, which is often cloaked under
                  the excuse of want of thought, is scarcely less worthy of blame, I sometimes
                  think, than actual criminality. My want of evil intention would not render
                  Sophie's suffering less acute when she realised that the love she had given me
                  frankly, honestly, was unreturned. No penitence of mine could now avert the stroke
                  that must fall upon the hearts of those who, next to Margaret, were the dearest
                  objects to me upon earth. Whichever way I looked I could not find one ray of light
                  to comfort me. When morning came I was still pacing my chamber, and as the dim
                  gray light touched my mirror I started at the reflection of my haggard, hopeless
                  face. The sight of it recalled me to myself, and to the consciousness that
                  self-accusations were useless, that all that remained to me now was to form some
                  definite course of action. Pressing my throbbing temples with my hands I threw
                  myself upon my bed and strove to think. Vain effort. But two thoughts presented
                  themselves. I must leave this fatal spot at once, and—Sophie must know the truth.
                  Some might have counselled me to act far differently, to accept the fate allotted
                  me; have urged that I was bound in honor to conceal from the woman I had deceived
                  all knowledge of that deception.
               Upon that point I felt no doubt; she must know the truth, whatever it might cost
                  us both. I could never meet her clear eyes with a lie in mine; I could never thus
                  secure her happiness.
               Mechanically I commenced my preparations for departure. As I approached my window
                  when they were at last completed, I saw that Sophie was already upon the portico.
                  The night had been sultry, and she had escaped, as was frequently her custom, at
                  the earliest possible moment into the fresh morning air. She looked very lovely as
                  she stood leaning against the balustrade with a thoughtful, pensive expression
                  upon her face that became it well.
               My heart gave a strange throb of pain as I gazed, and then seemed to stand quite
                  still. I turned from the window and went down to her.
               She uttered an exclamation of dismay as I approached. "What has happened?" she
                  questioned anxiously. "You are ill; I will call my uncle."
               
               "No," I answered, "nothing has happened; I am not ill. But as I am forced to
                  return home immediately, and shall start in the early train, I would like to say a
                  few words to you before I leave."
               She took my arm silently, and we walked down the broad steps of the portico, and
                  passed into a little shady walk that ran along the side of the hotel, where I knew
                  we would be safe from observation.
               There was not a sound in the woods but the faint rustling of the leaves and the
                  low chirp of the insects. The silence grew intolerable; and yet she would not, and
                  I could not, break it. What could I say that would not be an insult to her
                  womanliness? At last she spoke in her old impulsive way: "You are going home—what
                  has called you there—what does this mean?"
               "It means," I said bitterly, "that I have awakened at last to some slight sense of
                  honor. For months I have been acting weakly, wickedly. You look incredulous—listen
                  first to my confession, and then judge me as mercifully as you can. You have known
                  me only as the rising artist—your uncle's chosen friend; but there are dark pages
                  in my history that some other time I will unfold to you—a mystery that renders it
                  dishonorable—nay, impossible—for me to claim the hand of the woman that I love.
                  And yet throughout this whole summer I have yielded to the temptation of living in
                  her presence, recklessly disregarding the certain consequences of my rashness. Too
                  late for my own happiness, and possibly the happiness of others, I have realised
                  the pitiful unmanliness of my conduct, and now there is left to me only the
                  coward's refuge, flight."
               I had purposely refrained from looking at her whilst I spoke; now I turned and met
                  her eyes. They held a strange questioning look in them that pierced me to the
                  soul, and her face was white as marble.
               "Are you quite sure," she asked, "that this barrier of which you speak
                     is an insurmountable one?"
               "Quite sure," I answered.
               "If you believed," she asked again, this time with a slight tremor in her voice,
                  "that the love of which you spoke just now might possibly be, nay,
                     was returned, would that knowledge alter your determination to
                  resist it?"
               "It could not alter it," I said, for the second time echoing her words.
               "And yet knowing this to be so, you have wilfully sought to win a heart that you
                  never meant to claim!"
               I could not answer her; my eyes fell before her flashing, scornful glance.
               "I have indeed been deceived in you," she said; "you have acted basely,
                  shamelessly."
               She waited a moment as though expecting me to vindicate myself. Then, as I still
                  stood speechless, she turned abruptly. "We will go home," she said.
               Again that heavy, oppressive silence fell between us, broken only by the low
                  shivering of the leaves. As we neared the end of the avenue I suddenly caught her
                  hand in mine. "Sophie," I said desperately, "we have been friends so long, you
                     will forgive me, will you not?"
               She withdrew it quickly, almost contemptuously from my grasp. "No,"
                  she said in a cold hard tone, "I will never forgive you."
               She passed from my side as she spoke, and I made no further effort to detain her.
                  The stage stood before the hotel, just ready to start; I sprang into it, the door
                  was closed, and I sank back in my seat with a heavy consciousness that the bright
                  happy summer that had commenced so joyously was over—nay more, that for me the
                  summer of life had ended, that again I stood alone in the world, alone and
                  friendless.
               Some obstruction upon the road detained the train. It was nearing midnight as we
                  approached the city of Philadelphia. I was aroused from the
                  abstraction—insensibility, I had almost called it—into which I had fallen, by
                  hearing a child's voice just behind me exclaim, "One half-hour more and we will be
                  at home!"
               "Home!" That word struck upon my heart like a blow. I sprang from my
                  seat and rushed out upon the platform. The cool night-air and the consciousness of
                  swift rushing motion were very grateful
                  to me. It had seemed all day as though my journey was indeed a flight, a flight
                  from the heavy terrible trouble that was reaching forth a skeleton hand to grasp
                  me.
               Now, as I stood there alone, borne as it seemed upon the very wings of the wind,
                  gazing up into the deep unfathomable heaven brilliant with its myriad lights, a
                  sudden rest and stillness seemed to fall upon my soul. "Home!"—the word still rang
                  in my ear, but now with a strange pathetic meaning. How naturally, when we suffer,
                  does the heart seek to lose its own sense of inquietude in the calm of the
                  infinite! The very immensity of space, from which we shrink in happier hours,
                  fills us with no terrors. Our weary souls reach forward eagerly, yearningly. It is
                  no longer a void to us. "Underneath are the everlasting arms."
               Whilst I still gazed, there arose around me a wild, discordant cry—such a wail of
                  fierce, hopeless despair as perishing souls might utter on the last day of doom.
                  For an instant I felt a sharp, keen, sudden pain, then I knew no more.
               After that it seemed to me that for years and years I was shut up in a close
                  darkened room; that forms, some familiar and some unfamiliar, kept gliding around
                  me in a strange ghostly way; that I could hear the sound of low subdued voices,
                  and feel the pressure of gentle hands. Sometimes I would wonder vaguely what it
                  all meant, whether I was already dead and had entered another world, where all
                  impressions were dim and undefined. Then I would strive to make a powerful effort
                  to free myself from the stupor that was benumbing every faculty, and that effort
                  would cast me back into unconsciousness. Thus I hovered between life and death for
                  many weeks.
               At last I heard the physician's voice beside my bed say deliberately, "The crisis
                  has passed; I believe that he will recover; careful nursing is all that he
                  requires." Then there came the sound of low sobbing, and a fervent "Thank God!"
                  and I opened my eyes to find Sophie bending over me, with an eager look of joy
                  lighting her pale, careworn face.
               "Then you have forgiven me after all!" I said. She did not answer,
                  but I felt her hot tears fall upon my face as the physician commanded perfect
                  silence in the room, and I fell asleep again, with her hand clasped in mine, and
                  the peace of a forgiven child in my heart.
               From Mr. G——, as I grew stronger, I learned the little there was to be told. I had
                  been recognised by an acquaintance upon the train, and removed at once in an
                  insensible condition to Mr. G——'s house. They had first heard of the accident
                  through the papers, and finding my name among the fatally injured, they had
                  immediately started for home, and for the last month had watched beside me night
                  and day, with little hope of my recovery. Of Margaret he did not speak, nor did I
                  dare to ask; only their watchful care had saved me, my physician said. They had
                  fettered me with a fresh obligation. I owed to them my life.
               A worthless boon it seemed as I lay there hopelessly looking into the future. What
                  could it bring me? Sophie's face, worn with its sleepless vigils, was
                  a ceaseless reproach to me. During my slow convalescence no sister could have been
                  kinder, more tenderly devoted; and yet I felt growing up between us day by day a
                  barrier of restraint that neither had the power to break down. More than once as I
                  raised my eyes I found her steadily regarding me with a vague look of trouble in
                  hers that cut me to the heart.
               I felt like a traitor, lying there accepting her little thoughtful attentions—the
                  sacrifice of her time, her health, her pleasure; whilst day by day I knew that the
                  thought of Margaret was rooting itself more deeply within my soul, filling each
                  waking, and almost every sleeping, hour.
               One afternoon, when left for a few moments alone, I listlessly opened a book that
                  Sophie had been reading to me the day before. As I did so, a little "carte" of
                  Margaret, that she had used as a mark to keep her place, fell from it upon the
                  table.
               I seized it eagerly; I had been starving for a sight of her sweet face, and as I
                  gazed into the calm depths of her holy eyes, my whole frame trembled with
                  excitement. So absorbed was I that I did not know that Sophie had re-entered the
                  room until she stood beside me. As I looked up I found that she was reading my
                  face searchingly, and I thought a little sternly.
               
               "I should be glad to say a few words to you, if you think that you are strong
                  enough," she said—"words that have already been too long postponed."
               She turned from me abruptly as she spoke, and paced the floor for several minutes
                  with hasty irregular steps. When she paused again before me her face was very
                  white and her hands were locked tightly together.
               "When we last spoke upon this subject," she said, "you told me that the barrier
                  that divided you from the woman you loved was insurmountable."
               "Yes," I replied, "it was—it is—and must ever be."
               She paused a moment, and then a crimson glow crept up the pallor of her cheek.
                  "Philip," she said, "which of us do you love, Margaret or
                  myself?"
               "Sophie," I answered, "if you loved me you would never have asked
                  that question."
               "No," she replied, "and yet I do ask it."
               Then, as she caught the expression of my face, her own lighted intelligently.
                  "Ah," she added, "I see—I see—there has been some strange mistake. My poor uncle,
                  he little knows the mischief he has done."
               "No, no, dear Philip," she said, as she knelt beside me, whilst the rich crimson
                  glow mounted again over cheek and brow, "you are not so irresistible as you think;
                  for though I love you very dearly, you must, under all circumstances, have been
                  content with your place of brother, for"—she paused, and her eyes
                  rested meaningly upon the large brilliant that for the first time I observed
                  glowing upon her engagement finger—"This little ring has caused uncle much
                  trouble," she went on hurriedly. "He chose to fancy that you cared for me; and
                  although I could not be so blind as to believe that this was so, yet his anxieties
                  have strangely infected me, as I have striven to reconcile in your conduct some
                  things that seemed irreconcilable. I am glad—so glad—that at last I can speak
                  freely to you, and thus set right all that has been miserably wrong so long."
               For answer I could only press the little hand she extended to me to my lips and
                  bathe it with my tears. "Oh, Sophie!" I said at last, "you little know how
                  precious that brother's place has become to me—how valueless life seemed when I
                  thought you had withdrawn your confidence from me utterly! And now one proof of
                  your sisterly affection I must claim. I can bear this awful suspense no longer.
                  Tell me of Margaret. Oh, dear friend, help me if you can!" The last sentence was
                  almost a despairing cry, for as I uttered her friend's name, Sophie withdrew her
                  hand from mine, and the whole expression of her face altered and hardened.
               "Well," she answered coldly, "what of Margaret? And how can I help
                  you?"
               How, indeed? The question that stirred in my heart, "Does Margaret love me?" I
                  felt must not find utterance. Sophie, I knew well, would guard her friend's
                  dignity as though it were her own. Even could she answer it, how did
                  I wish it answered? Yes or No would bring equal misery. I bowed my face upon my
                  hands and groaned aloud.
               Sophie stood silently beside me, and I felt that she was stead-fastly regarding
                  me. When she spoke at last her voice had a softened tone. "It grieves me much,"
                  she said, "to see you thus unhappy, and gladly would I help you if I could; but I
                  think you cannot fail to realise how little it is in my power to aid you. Thus
                  much only I will say, Philip—that if a man loves a woman he should tell her so,
                  even though in telling her he must tell her at the same time he can never claim
                  her love this side of eternity. If she be a true woman she will not fear the
                  waiting; but let her have the strength of that knowledge to support her."
               She passed from my side as she spoke, and I sat long and seriously pondering her
                  last words. I dared not trust myself to think what they might imply. The very
                  sweetness of the hope they raised held a bitterness inexpressible.
               As soon as my health permitted I removed to my bachelor lodgings, and devoted
                  myself altogether to my art. Love of my profession had been with me always an
                  engrossing passion; I had worked for the work's sake, with little thought of the
                  fame that might be the result of that
                  labor. Now I strove to fill every hour with occupation, so that I might shut out
                  effectually the haunting image that gazed at me with its tender eyes from every
                  blank piece of canvas, that mingled itself with every dream, sleeping or waking,
                  that floated across my consciousness. I made a brave and honest fight with myself,
                  but the result was only humiliating defeat. I could not shut out the
                  thought of Margaret. Her likeness stole subtly into each creation of my fancy;
                  into each figure that I drew grew something of her willowy grace.
               I would thrill and tremble, and my heart would swell with a happy pain as I would
                  trace these chance resemblances, and would realise how her presence overshadowed
                  and pervaded my life. Nor, keenly as I suffered, would I have had it otherwise. If
                  by the speaking of a word I could have blotted out the past year, and thus
                  regained my old careless happy life that had been so sweet in the living, that
                  word would have been unspoken.
               Life was nobler, purer, better since her holy, gentle influence had stolen into
                  it; and though I said she must be to me hence-forward little more than a memory,
                  yet that memory, fraught to me with acute pain as it was, was the most precious
                  treasure that my heart contained. One thing I felt I was bound in honor to do: to
                  guard her life for the future, so far as lay in my power, from the misery that had
                  made mine a wreck. Truly, it was late in the day to think of this; but since the
                  past could not be recalled, I firmly resolved to take no more false steps. I would
                  make no voluntary effort to see Margaret. If she crossed my path I would
                  gratefully accept the moments of happiness thus afforded, but I would
                  conscientiously abstain from all intercourse with her that could be avoided; for I
                  knew—yes, knew with a certainty that made that knowledge an
                  intolerable torture, that if I willed it so I could make her love me.
                  For had not God made her mine, my very own? Did I not hold the key to
                  every secret avenue of her pure nature?
               Even now our separation would cause her regret and trouble; but her nature was too
                  noble to cherish an unworthy image, and when she realised me as the trifler who
                  had sought to unveil her heart's holiest mystery for the amusement of an idle
                  hour, she would dismiss me from her thoughts, not angrily, not scornfully even,
                  but of necessity.
               
               Thus I reasoned with a man's blindness, failing to realise that the only lasting,
                  cureless sorrow that can come to a woman who loves—a sorrow beside which
                  separation, death, estrangement even, sink into insignificance—is the knowledge of
                  the unworthiness of him whom she loves.
               My resolution was thoroughly tried. Weeks passed, and still I was wearily longing
                  for the sight of the sweet face that had once shed sunshine into my life.
               I had not known how much of the constant familiar intercourse I had enjoyed during
                  the previous year had been due to Sophie's kindly manœuvrings. Now I realised, not
                  only that she had ceased to afford me assistance, but that she willed to prevent
                  all communication between Margaret and myself until I chose to claim it.
               I knew there was kindness in her cruelty, a tender shielding of her friend from
                  possible harm, in which lingered perhaps a little just resentment at my seeming
                  insensibility to that friend's perfections; but my heart rebelled bitterly, and
                  little by little that wall of separation arose again between us, and it became
                  almost an unusual thing for me to do more than pay a ceremonious visit to the
                  house that had once been to me a second home.
               Human nature bows to the inevitable. There is a certain restfulness in the thought
                  that struggling and resistance are in vain, that the one course left open to us is
                  utter, absolute submission; but to feel that a blessing for which our heart is
                  crying is held out to us, and of our own free will to put it away,—thus indeed is
                  our strength of resolution tested.
               Business at length called me from the city. On the morning of my return, as I
                  passed Mr. G——'s, I remembered a message with which I had been entrusted for
                  Sophie, and using a pass-key, as had always been my habit in former times, I
                  entered, and guided my the sound of voices, passed directly to her little
                  "boudoir," into which only her most familiar friends had access.
               
               For a moment I paused on the threshold, powerless to enter, for through the
                  half-open door I perceived that Margaret was her companion. My approach had been
                  noiseless, as the sound of my footsteps was muffled by the thick carpet, and,
                  unobserved myself, I could note the changes that the past few months had
                  wrought.
               Pure, holy and tender it had always been, but there were farseeing depths in those
                  dreamy eyes, and a droop about the corners of that tremulous mouth, that lent a
                  new expression to the calm lily-white face that suffering had spiritualised into a
                  beauty almost divine.
               Suddenly, as though she felt the intensity of my gaze, she raised her eyes, and
                  met mine fixed upon her. It was but a moment, but in the glance that passed
                  between us, that rush of soul to soul, the secrets of two hearts were laid bare,
                  and I doubted no longer, but knew that Margaret loved me,—ay, and
                  knew that she knew I knew. It was but a single glance; instantly the white lids
                  drooped, and she turned with grave, kindly courtesy to welcome me. So perfect was
                  her self-control, so quiet her voice and manner, so free from embarrassment, yet
                  with a gentle dignity that told me more clearly than words could have done that
                  the old familiar intercourse of other days was over forever, that had it not been
                  for the vivid coloring that still dyed her cheek with its crimson flush, I should
                  have thought myself the dupe of an excited imagination.
               Had she been alone I could not have restrained myself from uttering the words that
                  I had vowed should never pass my lips. I felt that I would have given every
                  earthly possession for five moments' conversation with her. But though I knew that
                  Sophie read my wish, and rightly interpreted my imploring expression, she sat
                  there coolly indifferent, quietly knitting her little purse, and we talked of
                  things in which we took not the slightest interest, laughing and chatting merrily
                  as though we were the same light-hearted trio that had so often before assembled
                  in that little room, into whose lives no experience of pain had entered. Sophie
                  spoke of my growing fame, the brilliant future that was opening before me; and I
                  told her with a savage satisfaction, knowing that it would grieve her, of my
                  probable change of residence, of the necessity that might arise of returning again
                  to Europe.
               She looked at me searchingly as I spoke, with strangely troubled expression. But
                  there was no change in Margaret's face. Whatever I had read there, I realised I
                  was to learn nothing more, now that her womanly instinct of self-preservation was
                  aroused. But for that momentary revelation I should have left her thoroughly
                  convinced that my self-reproaches of the last few months had been an unnecessary
                  torture, that I possessed even less than a friend's place in her affections. As it
                  was, I could only wonder at the force of will with which she thus held down her
                  quivering heart.
               As I rose at last to leave them, Sophie said, with some little earnestness of
                  manner: "You will be with us at our usual New Year's Eve gathering, will you not,
                  Philip? Whatever the year may bring us of pain or joy or separation, let us begin
                  it once more together."
               Margaret did not second the invitation, as six months ago she would have done; but
                  her very silence and calm indifference spoke more powerfully than words, and
                  without hesitation I gave the required promise. With a light heart and a firm step
                  I passed from the house, and went directly to my studio. My resolution was fully
                  taken; I determined to stake my all upon one desperate venture.
               Drawing from my easel a half-finished picture, I laid upon it a new fresh roll of
                  canvas, and applied myself at once to my work. In the certain
                  knowledge of Margaret's love, life wore a new aspect. It was no longer a tangle I
                  vainly strove to unravel; I saw but one honorable path left open to me, and
                  however humiliating to my pride, I resolved to walk it unflinchingly.
               Day by day as I bent over my easel, Sophie's words rang in my ears: "If a man love
                  a woman he should tell her so—even though in telling her he must tell her at the
                  same time he can never claim her love this side of eternity; let her at least
                     have the strength of that knowledge to
                  support her." And I wondered at the selfish blindness to what was truly right that
                  had forced upon the sensitive heart of the woman I professed to love, the
                  bitterness of believing she had given her affection unsought.
               I labored upon my picture with feverish energy; the earliest dawn would brighten
                  upon me at my post. I was sustained by an inward excitement that seemed to almost
                  render food and sleep unnecessary; and it was not until the last day of the year,
                  as at twilight I stood before my finished work, that in the sudden weakness that
                  overcame me, in which it seemed for a time as though life itself must have passed,
                  I recognised the terrible strain to which I had subjected heart and brain.
               It seemed to me as I knelt there beside my picture with my face bowed in my hands,
                  that compliance with my promise to Sophie was simply an impossibility. As the hour
                  for assembling approached, however, I realised it equally impossible to deny
                  myself the happiness of meeting Margaret, once more at least, on the old friendly
                  footing. Sufficient to the day, I kept repeating to myself, sufficient to the day
                  is the evil: heart, drink one last draught of happiness—to-morrow
                  thou must die.
               
               So long had I been secluded from human companionship, that for the first few
                  moments I felt strangely dazed and bewildered in the brilliantly lighted rooms, in
                  the midst of the gay, cheerful assembly.
               Even Margaret's face had not upon me its usual tranquillising effect; indeed,
                  to-night it had lost its calm serenity. A crimson spot burned like a quivering
                  flame upon the cheek usually so lily-pale, and the thoughtful eyes were starry
                  with an almost unnatural brilliancy. Nor had her manner its usual gentle repose,
                  and her soft, silvery laugh rang out, from time to time, birdlike and clear.
               Her conduct towards me filled me with a strange dread. She neither sought nor
                  avoided my attentions, but met my eager glance with cool indifference. I held her
                  secret: she knew it. She was powerless to take from me the knowledge I had won in
                  the moment that her soul had revealed itself to mine. But I realised it was no
                  longer optional with me to accept or reject the love of this beautiful woman. Her
                  woman's pride had arisen in its might, and with a sudden sinking of heart I
                  comprehended that that momentary revealing might cost me cruelly.
               Never since the day of our first meeting had my nature been so thoroughly aroused.
                  Brilliant thoughts flowed from my lips without effort, and the little circle that
                  gathered around us applauded enthusiastically the quick flow of sparkling repartee
                  that, seemingly harmless as summer lightning, leapt scathingly from lip to lip,
                  leaving blackening traces sometimes, the very hurt of which only awakened my brain
                  to more vivid life.
               My snow-maiden was passion-warmed at last; and with a strangely thrilling sense of
                  delight I realised the power that, unconsciously to herself, I was exercising,
                  that could thus transform my pure pearl and force it to send forth such opal
                  rays.
               When the hour for separating arrived, I pleaded to be allowed to render her the
                  first service of the new year by escorting her home. Others also merrily urged
                  their claim to the honor. As she playfully hesitated before making her choice, she
                  caught the expression of earnest pleading in my eyes, and with a half scornful
                  smile placed her hand within my arm, and together we passed out under the silent
                  stars.
               It was one thing to talk with her in the midst of a hundred observant eyes, with
                  the brilliant light revealing every changing expression, and quite another to walk
                  thus alone with her through the deserted streets, with the hush of midnight all
                  around us, broken only by the clanging bells as they joyously rang in the new
                  year, and the heavy boom of the cannon that sounded like thunder in the
                  distance.
               Too well for my own peace had I interpreted the gesture with which she laid her
                  hand upon my arm,—that little hand that lay so near my heart that it could
                  scarcely fail to feel its throbbing. She had chosen I should fully realise that
                  she did not fear this private interview; in fact, that she accepted it willingly
                  with all its consequences. The silence of this past month, since I had read her
                  heart, had been too cruelly wounding to her woman's pride, and I knew that that pride would hold down
                  her love with an iron grasp; that my cause was hopeless.
               And so we walked on silently through the darkened streets, lighted from time to
                  time by the red glare of a rocket, while the bells rang out their hymns of praise
                  upon the frosty midnight air. What need was there of speech?—each knew the thought
                  of the other's heart. Spoken words upon any other subject would have been mockery.
                  Only at last, when I stood upon her doorstep—that doorstep under which I had
                  crouched like a wild animal a thousand years before, it seemed—my very desperation
                  gave me courage. With a sudden motion I grasped the little hand that lay upon my
                  arm, and held it in a firm clasp. "Margaret," I said. She gently
                  withdrew it, not quickly, but with a quiet decision that rendered resistance
                  impossible, and turned towards me her face silvered with the moonlight, with an
                  icy look of inquiry upon it.
               "May I ask you to break through your usual rule of receiving no visitors on New
                  Year's Day, and admit me for a half-hour tomorrow morning? I have a question that
                  I must submit to you."
               Her clear eyes met mine without faltering. "We have read each other's hearts too
                  long for me to fail to comprehend you," she said coldly. "Consider your question
                  answered here, and finally; and spare us both the pain of further words."
               "Forgive me," I said; "in this matter I have something more at stake than
                  happiness. My honor is involved, and for its sake I must beg that you will
                  reconsider your words, and allow me to have placed in your parlor a covered
                  picture that upon my coming I will unveil. You need not fear—our interview shall
                  be as brief as even you could wish, and when it is concluded I shall never again
                  make a demand upon your time."
               "As you will," she said, and turning from me she passed through the heavy portal,
                  and as she vanished from my sight the loud boom of a cannon rent the air like a
                  cry of mortal agony.
               And as I turned from that doorstep that had once afforded me such friendly
                  shelter, I remembered no longer with self pity, but with a keen envious pang, the
                  quiet satisfaction with which I had so often settled myself for a night of
                  untroubled sleep in the days of my wild Bohemian life. Then indeed I had suffered
                  physically cold and hunger, but what was that compared to the chill that had
                  settled down upon my soul; to the heart-hunger that was consuming me; to the
                  restless misery that sent me hurrying up and down the silent streets, where I
                  could keep in sight the lighted window of the room in which the cruel conflict
                  between a woman's pride and love was being waged, that would end, as I well knew,
                  in my eternal banishment from hope and happiness?
               The questioning glances of the pedestrians that began to throng the sidewalk sent
                  me in the early grey of morning back to my studio, to await the coming of the hour
                  when I might with propriety present myself before Margaret. When it at last
                  arrived I arose calm and collected. The past night's fever had burned itself out
                  and left me, at white heat it is true, but in my right mind.
               I sat for many moments alone in the luxuriously furnished parlor before she came
                  to me. Through the twilight of the darkened room the pictured faces of her
                  ancestors scowled down from their massive frames, as though they sought to
                  intimidate the base intruder, but among them all there was none more haughty, more
                  icily cold, than the living one, marble-like in its calm serenity, that met my
                  gaze when she at last stood before me.
               She tendered me no greeting, but seated herself in a low chair opposite, where the
                  light fell full upon her face that I might read its every expression. For a few
                  moments neither broke the silence that fell between us, and when at last I spoke,
                  my voice sounded strange and unnatural in its calmness.
               "Margaret," I said, "I fear I can scarcely tell you why I have sought this
                  interview without again stabbing your pride that I realise has been already
                  cruelly wounded; and yet in justice to myself, in justice to you, there is an
                  explanation that must be made, whatever it may cost me to offer, or you to receive
                  it."
               She bent her head forward in a listening attitude, whilst a faint half-mocking
                  smile passed over her face.
               "My conduct towards you during the past year," I continued, "has been unworthy and unmanly. Between your life
                  and mine there lies a barrier that cannot be overstepped. Realising its existence,
                  I should have avoided, rather that sought, your presence, should have crushed down
                  the first feeling of interest, and fled from the temptation. But human nature is
                  weak, and I grasped the happiness that the present offered me, feeling that rather
                  than cast it from me I would gladly bear whatever punishment of suffering the
                  future might hold for me; and when that time of retribution came I bore my pain as
                  bravely as I could. I should have 'died and made no sign,' had I not learned a
                  month ago that the consequences of my sin had fallen upon an innocent head, that I
                  was not the only sufferer."
               "Enough," she interrupted me, springing from her seat, whilst a crimson spot leapt
                  into her white cheek. "You manage your subject with great delicacy; I thank you
                  for this courteous handling of my heart. It is vain for me to deny that in an
                  unguarded moment you forced from my eyes a confession that I blush to make even to
                  my own consciousness; but know this, it shall avail you little. For this
                  humiliation I will never forgive you; from this hour we meet as strangers."
               "Yes," I answered quietly, "I came but to say farewell; and yet to claim at your
                  hands the forgiveness that I think you will scarcely fail to accord me, when the
                  unveiling of my picture explains why I dare ask from you nothing more."
               I arose as I spoke, and together we passed into the further room, in which the
                  light fell full upon my easel. With a firm hand I removed the covering from the
                  picture, and then stood silently beside it, reading her face.
               There it was, the whole scene as it had burned itself in characters of fire upon
                  my brain. The familiar doorstep, the indignant carpenter, the elderly gentleman
                  holding by the hand the angel child, from whose loving eyes shone a divine
                  compassion. And in their midst, grasping tightly his filthy blanket, the little
                  being, half animal, half human, with a look of terrified defiance upon his grimy
                  face.
               Margaret gazed upon the familiar scene, at first in speechless amazement. Then, as
                  its meaning dawned upon her, a faint soft color overspread her cheek, and she
                  glanced with a strangely troubled, bewildered look from the pictured face to the
                  one that stood still and stern beside it. "Phil?" she murmured.
               "Yes," I answered—"Phil—poor Phil—Phil the beggar—Phil the Arab—Phil
                  the thief—whatever you will—I have no other name to offer to my bride. Your
                  wounded pride perhaps will find sweet solace in the thought that the hand you have
                  denied me, the hand that in my wildest dreams I never dared to claim, was the
                  heaven-appointed instrument that plucked me from the pit of infamy, that set me as
                  a man among my fellowmen; that all that I have on earth, all that I hope for in
                  heaven, I owe to you. To me, bitter as the thought may be to you, the only comfort
                  that I find is in the knowledge that your life is interwoven so irrevocably with
                  mine that eternity even cannot disengage it."
               She sat with her face bowed upon her hands, and I saw that she was weeping. As I
                  paused, without raising her head she held out her right hand towards me. I
                  understood it as a gesture of dismissal, and passing to her side I clasped it
                  reverently.
               "And now," I said, "farewell. Forgive me for the wrong that I have offered you—the
                  pain that I have cost you. Judge me as mercifully as you can. If suffering could
                  atone for sin, my offence would have been long since expiated."
               As I turned to leave her she suddenly sprang to her feet, and raised her flushed,
                  tearful face to mine.
               "Philip," she cried, "I could find it in my heart to almost hate you! How dare you
                  speak such words to me? How would you have me answer you? What have I done to
                  deserve such treatment at your hands? My crime has been, it seems, my superiority
                  of social position. Prove if you can that a name inherited is more honorable than
                  a name earned. Prove that wealth is a more powerful agent in the world of men than
                  the genius that commands it. Prove if you dare that it is presumption for a man
                  whom God has made with every capability of good in him, to claim from a woman who
                  stands alone and desolate the right to
                  shield and cherish her. And when you fail, realise that within this hour you
                     have acted an unworthy part in forcing the woman whom you love to
                  shield your pride by the humiliation of her own."
               I stood before her, stunned and motionless, gazing down into the passionate face
                  upraised to mine, whilst a thousand conflicting thoughts surged through my brain.
                  She misinterpreted my silence, and when she spoke again, the icy chill had crept
                  once more into her voice.
               "Go," she said, "I have been mistaken in you. You are less noble than I thought.
                  You love yourself—not me. There is no room for pride in the heart that love has
                  filled. Go! Satisfy your heart-hunger, if you can, with your fame; and when you
                  find it cannot still its restless cravings, you will perhaps learn
                  the value of what to-day you cast from you."
               She would have withdrawn the hand that I still held, but as it struggled to be
                  free I clasped it a close prisoner, and gazing down upon her averted eyes,
                  compelled them to meet mine. What did I say? Ah, well, it matters not what I said.
                  When soul meets soul there is little need of spoken words. 
                     
                        "Love took up the harp of life and struck on all its chords with
                           might;
                        Struck the chord of self, that trembling passed in music out of
                           sight."
                     
                  
               
               
               Many years have passed since then, but I think my sweet wife Margaret has never
                  had reason to regret the choice she made that day. My picture hangs now in our
                  luxurious dining-saloon. I had it placed there that I might never forget, when I
                  sat down to my well-spread board, that the time had been that I was thankful for
                  the crumbs that fell from it. Our children know its history, and do not blush to
                  remember that their father was once the homeless beggar-boy. Their mother has
                  inculcated a nobler pride than that of birth—has taught them that God gives as He
                  wills position, wealth, beauty, talent, influence; that it is not
                     possession of His gifts, but the faithful use and improvement of
                  them that is worthy of honor.
               I think, too, the realisation of my wretched childhood has taught them to receive
                  with a more reverent faith the story of Him "who had not where to lay his head,"
                  and to comprehend the "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these, my
                  brethren, ye have done it unto me."
               My kind friend Mr. G—— still lives. He divides his time between Sophie's happy
                  household and mine. Old age is not to him dark and unlovely, but bright with every
                  happiness that affection can bestow, and the hope of heaven can promise.
               For his sake, even more than my own, I am thankful for the success that has
                  crowned my efforts, for the fame that has been the reward of my faithful labors.
                  Life has been so sweet, so satisfying, that I might have been tempted to rest
                  content with happiness, valuing as I did so lightly the applause of that world
                  that once would have crushed me pitilessly beneath its iron heel; but the
                  remembrance of the debt of gratitude I owe him has ever been the spur to incite me
                  to more determined effort, since his triumphant pride in me lends the chief joy
                  and interest to his failing years.
               It chanced that not long after my picture was placed there, that wishing to make
                  some alteration in the dining-room, I sent for old Mr. Brown the carpenter. I
                  shall never forget his look of utter amazement as, raising his eyes, he suddenly
                  recognised his own full-length likeness, and the scene in which he had played so
                  prominent a part.
               When, in a few quiet words, I explained to him why the picture hung there, the
                  look of surprise changed to one of ludicrous dismay, and he began to stammer out
                  apologies and explanations, in a way that would have been sufficiently amusing had
                  I not felt just then very gravely in earnest.
               "Nay, Mr. Brown," I said when he paused at length, quite out of breath, "I have no
                  quarrel with you. You were but one of the links in the chain of circumstance by
                  which God designed to bind me to Himself. But since you see there can be a better
                  use made of a boy than to hand him over to the police, perhaps it may be as well
                  for you to take this lesson to heart."
               
               And then I spoke seriously of the Fatherhood of God, of the loving
                  care He exercises over the human family, whom He has united together in the bond
                  of brotherhood; how contrary to His express command it is for one member to say
                  even to the most seemingly useless "there is no need of thee," since each soul
                  into which He has breathed the breath of immortality has a work, a design to carry
                  out, that can be accomplished by no other.
               There were tears in my own eyes as well as in those of the old man before I
                  concluded; and long after he left me I stood musing before the picture, preaching
                  to myself a little sermon of which it was the text. And as I realised, as I never
                  had before in its solemnity, how our hurrying, self-seeking feet tread into the
                  mire the crown-jewels of the Master that He has strewn along our path, designing
                  us to polish and lift into the sunlight of His love, becoming thus co workers with
                  Him—I made a solemn vow to subordinate every talent He had given me to the service
                  of my kind; to strive to stand on the battlefield of life not as the conquering
                  hero, but as he who carries the cup of cold water to the fallen and the faint,
                  heartening the hopeless with his words of cheer.
               I have honestly tried to keep that vow. And when I realise how God
                     has made me the bearer of His message to many a perishing soul,
                  how through my effort joy has brightened over lives that else would
                  have been dark and desolate, I can only wonder at the mercy of the great Master
                  workman, who has chosen to prepare and fit for His service an instrument so
                  humble—that brand plucked from the burning—POOR PHIL.
            
            
               MARION
               SHE looked like a queen as she sat there, with a rich crimson flush burning on
                  either cheek, and the rich crimson flowers drooping heavily on her white neck,
                  with that languid, half-weary, half-indifferent air which became her so well. I
                  sat at her feet, gazing up into her brilliant face with the almost reverential
                  admiration with which her marvellous beauty at times inspired me. Often before I
                  had felt its wonderful power, but never so deeply as now, when something new and
                  strange seemed mingled with what had hitherto been familiar to me in it. There was
                  a glow in the misty depths of her dark eyes, a restless inward excitement which
                  all her habitual repose of manner could not conceal. I dared not question her as
                  to its cause, for there were moments when I feared Marion almost more than I loved
                  her; so I waited in silence until the gloomy abstraction should pass away, and she
                  would turn to me again with the kindly interest she always manifested in what had
                  given me pleasure.
               It was late; the hands of the clock on the mantel pointed to the small hours. I
                  had paused in her chamber for a few moments before I sought my own, to review with
                  her the events of the evening, that had been to me one of perfect, absolute
                  enjoyment. I had been to my first ball, had entered for the first time that fairy
                  land so rich in its promises of happiness, into which I had gazed with such eager
                  longing throughout my quiet childhood.
               She had yielded at first a pleased attention to my enthusiastic, girlish
                  rhapsodies; yet whilst I spoke, the smile died from her lips and gloom crept
                  gradually over her face, and I felt she had forgotten even my presence in thoughts that brought a shadow with them.
               She started at last, and her brow slightly contracted, as recalled to herself by
                  my silence, she became conscious of my earnest gaze.
               "Well," she said, almost impatiently, as her steady eye threw off the look I had
                  fastened on her face, "why do you pause? Have you nothing more to say to me?"
               So different was she from other women, so carefully was every word and accent
                  usually guarded, that the slight irritation of her tone surprised me not a little.
                  I judged it best, however, to seem unconscious of her varying humor, and strove to
                  resume the gay careless strain that her reverie had interrupted. The effort was
                  useless—the thoughtful shadows had spread from her face over my heart, and a
                  second silence soon followed the first.
               "Go, little one—you are tired. It is selfish for me to keep you from your
                  rest—good-night." She bent over me and kissed my forehead as she spoke; her breath
                  came hot upon my cheek, and her burning lips sent a tingling glow through my frame
                  as they touched me.
               "Do not send me away yet," I pleaded, "unless I have wearied you with my
                  nonsense."
               "You weary me!" she said, "oh, no! I was weary indeed an hour ago in
                  the glare and bustle of the heated ball-room; but that cool, quiet face and voice
                  of yours have a wonderfully refreshing influence."
               "Marion," I said abruptly, after musing a few moments, "do you think Mr. Greyson
                  will call to see me? I should like to meet him again so very much."
               "Certainly, child. If it pleases you, you shall see him till you weary of him
                  whilst you are with me."
               "But I thought he did not visit here."
               Her face changed. "Did he tell you so?" she said, almost eagerly.
               "Oh no; but he asked where I was staying; and when I told him I was with you, I
                  thought from the expression of his face that——But it was only a fancy, I
                  suppose."
               "And a most absurd one," she said, with a careless smile. "Albert and I are quite
                  old friends, though I have seen but little of him lately, for there is no
                  congeniality in our temperaments, and we appreciate each other more when we are
                  apart."
               "Pardon me," I said, "but I should have thought"—I paused again; something in
                  Marion's eye deterred me from completing my half-formed sentence.
               "You would have thought," she concluded for me, "that a man of such evident
                  cultivation and refinement must be a welcome guest everywhere, and here
                  especially; but if I tell you that though he is noble, generous, sincere and
                  true-hearted, yet for this very array of virtues I hate him—what
                  would you think of me? Grace," she went on, with a vehemence that alarmed me,
                  without waiting for an answer, "there are those who in hating, compliment more
                  highly than in loving. This homage I pay to Albert Greyson. The elevation of his
                  life is a tacit reproach to the pettiness of mine. I measure myself by his
                  standard, and find myself dwarfed, and it maddens me. I must be first, supreme in
                  my world, else how can I rule? And when I cease to rule I must cease to live."
               "Marion, Marion," I cried, "why do you speak so bitterly?"
               She went on without heeding me. "Have not I the right to rule? Was I
                  not meant to bend all hearts before me? Wherefore else was granted me this
                  glorious, intoxicating beauty? You," she said, "with your sweet spiritual face and
                  your deep soul-lit eyes, will creep in time into the dreams of some pure,
                  single-hearted man; and content with your one conquest, content with the
                  consciousness that your presence creates for him a home, content to be simply
                  happy, you will be to him the crowning blessing of his life. But I—no single heart
                  could ever satisfy my craving. I must have change, change! You are a wildflower,
                  needing only the atmosphere of love that God has given to his world to strengthen
                  you into a perfect development—I an exotic, to whom that natural atmosphere is
                  death. I have breathed an artificial air till life itself is artificial with me,
                  till there is not one natural impulse, one womanly weakness in my heart. Would
                     I have the right, do you think, to
                  curse a true life with my love? If, then, I am deprived of all that other women
                  value, owning beauty in the place of happiness, have not I the right
                  to use it?—to use it as best pleases me? And yet," and she shuddered, "I hate it!
                  I hate it! for I am its slave."
               She had drawn me as she spoke in front of the long mirror that hung over her
                  dressing-table, and we stood there side by side; I in my simple white dress, with
                  delicate frail blossoms twined among my curls; she robed in black lace, relieved
                  only by the bright tropical flowers drooping from her hair. She gazed at the
                  brilliant image it sent back to her for a few moments in silence, with a darkening
                  brow. Those bright ornaments seemed just then a mockery to her mood, and with a
                  passionate impatience she strove to tear them from their place. The effort was
                  successful only in bringing around her white shoulders heavy masses of purplish
                  black hair, through whose waving tresses the rare exotics gleamed like precious
                  gems, heightening the beauty she sought to lessen. With a fierce exclamation she
                  struck her jewelled hand against the mirror, and its shattered fragments fell with
                  a sharp ring at her feet.
               She stood for a moment as though stupefied by what she had done, whilst with a cry
                  of terror I caught in mine the bleeding hand that had fallen listlessly to her
                  side.
               "Marion, Marion!" I cried, "you are mad!"
               "No, no!" she said, "not mad, only miserable." She drew from me, and throwing
                  herself into a chair, hid her face among its cushions, remaining for some moments
                  seemingly unconscious of my presence. Without turning towards me she motioned me
                  from her at last, with a gesture so imperative that I dared not disobey; and
                  wondering and terrified, I left her. Years have passed since then; but as clearly
                  as though it were still before me do I see that magnificent figure, bowing,
                  crushed by its own violence of passion, in that attitude of helpless, hopeless,
                  reckless despair; and as I recall the scene, the same sickening horror comes over
                  me as when I left her on that night, which, though I then little imagined it, was
                  to prove an era of such importance in the lives of both.
               I had met Marion Austen a few months previous to the opening of this little
                  narrative, at one of the principal summer watering-places. Utterly dissimilar in
                  tastes and character—she an accomplished woman of the world, my senior by many
                  years; I, a simple-hearted girl, brought up in the strict retirement of a village
                  home—there had sprung up between us one of those strange friendships that puzzle
                  the wisest heads, induced, it would seem, by a very opposition of qualities. It
                  has been said by an able writer, that "Girls often choose their first loves among
                  women." Marion was a passion with me. It was more as a lover than a friend that I
                  worshipped her. Her wonderful beauty was to me a source of never-failing delight.
                  All that was poetic and imaginative in my temperament seemed awakened by it into a
                  keener life. In her, more fully than in any woman I have ever known, did I realise
                  what was meant by "the poetry of motion." In her slightest movement there was
                  grace. There were moments when she passed me with that regal step and air of hers,
                  that the very touch of her dress sent a quivering thrill through all my frame, and
                  a caress or a smile at times brought the quick tears and sent the blood with a
                  stifling pressure to my heart. She could not be unconscious of the influence she
                  had acquired over me; but that consciousness seemed to cause her pain, rather than
                  pleasure. I can understand this now, how the craving of what was most womanly in
                  her was for love, not admiration; for appreciation, not homage. I felt that I
                  pleased her best when I talked to her in the girlish, natural way I used with
                  others; yet this was but rarely the case, for there was something in the very easy
                  familiarity of her manner towards me that more than anything else marked the
                  distance between us. The night to which I have just alluded I regard as the
                  commencement of my actual acquaintance with Marion. Before, I had idolised her as
                  I might some exquisite painting or work of art; from that time the reserve that
                  had shielded her real life from me melted away, and I learned to love her as a
                  woman. I know now how great a happiness it must have been to her to take another
                  life into her confidence, for she had few friends, poor Marion. She had truly said
                  she was made to command admiration, not
                  affection; to rule hearts, not to win them.
               I had been with her but a few days at the time of which I speak. Her urgent
                  solicitations and my earnest pleadings had wrung from my mother a reluctant
                  consent that I should pass the winter in her city home. It was with many
                  forebodings that she sent me from under her watchful care into the great world;
                  and had she realised the actual danger to which my unformed life was exposed by
                  its contact with one so cankered and embittered as my unhappy friend's, even
                     her arts of persuasion must have failed. She had blinded my
                  mother, however, as she could blind whomsoever it pleased her, until her truthful,
                  unsuspicious nature was even more under the influence of her fascinations than my
                  own; therefore it was that I had made my first entrance into society, on the
                  evening so often referred to, under auspices as favorable as any debutante could
                  possibly have desired, for Marion was one of the leaders of society, and I, as her
                  friend, came in for a reflected share of her popularity.
               Among those who had been introduced to me, the attention of the Mr. Greyson to
                  whom Marion had alluded with such passionate bitterness, had caused me the most
                  pleasure. I had all a young girl's faith in my own powers of discernment; nor for
                  once were they at fault when I recognised in him that superiority to those around
                  him that is most felt where least asserted. Truly, a taste more fastidious than
                  mine would have found little to cavil at in the grave, quiet, intelligent face,
                  and easy, gentlemanly bearing of my new acquaintance. His manner too, so free from
                  affectation or ostentation; his natural way of touching upon matters of grave
                  importance that another would scarcely have thought of drawing into a ball-room
                  conversation, yet with so little effort that he almost induced you to believe that
                  they were to you, as evidently to him, subjects of every-day consideration; or of
                  taking up in turn some trivial, threadbare fact, and elevating it into a new
                  importance by his manner of treating it—lent a charm to all he said that, coupled
                  with the rare power not only of holding the attention of his listener, but of so
                  developing his latent agreeability as to cause him to feel that he too was capable
                  of interesting, rendered Albert Greyson irresistible where he strove to please.
                  Yet this was rarely. Society presented few attractions to him; and a mere whim,
                  one of those chances that we learn later in life to term providences, had induced
                  him to leave his books for one night, and mingle with the brilliant throng
                  assembled in Mrs. Jay's drawing-room on the momentous evening that I made my first
                  appearance in the gay world. As a stranger I had attracted his attention, an
                  introduction had followed, and all through the evening he had paid me a marked
                  attention, that I had sufficient vanity to appreciate and sufficient humility to
                  wonder at.
               I had opened my full heart to Marion as I sat at her feet on our return home,
                  speaking freely and warmly in the flush of excitement and pleasure that sent the
                  blood dancing through my veins, as I never could have spoken with the sunlight on
                  my face in the calmer moments of ordinary life—questioning her eagerly of my new
                  friend, half reproaching her for her insensibility to his many perfections; and
                  she had answered me with the careless indifference that characterised her usual
                  manner, until stung into bitterness rather, it would seem, by some train of
                  associations awakened by my words, than the words themselves, she had broken into
                  the wild vehemence that had so shocked me.
               As I paced my chamber that night hour after hour—for to sleep was impossible
                  whilst the light still burned in the room of my wretched friend, haunted as I was
                  by the vague, nameless dread of some impending evil—I recalled word by word the
                  conversation that had passed between us. What had there been in my thoughtless
                  words to awaken that wild storm of passion? Vainly I puzzled myself with aimless
                  conjectures: I could find no clue to guide me through my difficulty.
               I had never thoroughly believed in the languid composure of Marion's manner, but I
                  had not suspected the intensity of the feelings she curbed and restrained into
                  that seeming calm; for fearful, I knew, must have been the inward conflict that
                  could have caused her—proud woman that she was—to throw off her haughty reserve of
                  manner, and thus unveil her suffering to me.
               
               I had watched her often wonderingly through the summer, as with calm indifference
                  she received the homage and adulation of those who thronged around her, yielding
                  her favor to them with the indolent grace of a queen, as though she conferred an
                  honor in permitting them to worship her. The quiet cadence of her voice seldom
                  swelled with passion or softened with pathos. The measureless depths of her great
                  eyes were cool and still, and the crimson flush on her clear olive cheek varied
                  little with her moods. She could talk, and talk well, but you felt that her words
                  were far from the index of her thoughts; they were simply words
                  falling from the surface of her life, and you knew that they interested her
                  little, and your answers less. It was as though in all the world there was no
                  incentive strong enough to arouse her from the apathy that had overspread her
                  life, no object worthy of her serious, earnest consideration.
               With me, as I said above, she was different; manifesting a kindly, womanly
                  interest in all that related to me; seeking to win me to her, seemingly well
                  pleased when she could lead me on to talk to her of myself, my own hopes, thoughts
                  and wishes. Yet even this interest, as I now pondered it, seemed strange and
                  unnatural. What was the tie that bound her to me? And as she rose before me, with
                  heaving breast and flashing eye and curving lip, as I had but just seen her, the
                  proud, passionless woman transformed in a moment into the beautiful fiend, I
                  shrank from the query with a vague shuddering terror.
               Again and again through the long night I crept to the door of Marion's room,
                  impelled by a fear that took no definite form, but urged me not to leave her there
                  alone in that wild, desperate mood. But though the lights still burned, all within
                  was silent; and not daring to break the stillness, I would hurry with swift,
                  noiseless steps to my own chamber, feeling a trembling sense of security when the
                  door was closed between us, only to be tortured anew by the nameless dread that
                  drew me again within hearing of her voice.
               The grey dawn shone at last through my windows, soothing and lulling my excited
                  nerves into a drowsy insensibility; my head sank on the table, and I slept the
                  heavy, unrefreshing sleep that follows a night of watching and anxiety. The sun
                  was shining brightly on my face when, awakened by the sound of the breakfast bell,
                  I started up in bewildered surprise from my unaccustomed resting place.
               With a sense of inexpressible relief I exchanged my gauzy evening dress for one
                  more suitable, and brushed the pale, wilted flowers from my hair, seeking to put
                  from me with them memories that still clung around me with a sickening horror.
                  That fierce, passionate face with its wild eyes met me at every turn, shaping
                  itself in the air around me, mirroring itself in the glass into which I looked,
                  lending its features to the pictures on the wall, gazing up at me from the flowers
                  on the carpet. I turned at last in very despair and fled from it as though it had
                  been a living thing, pausing only when I reached the dining-room. But there I
                  stood for a long, long time, fearing to enter, not daring to face her from whose
                  shadow I had fled. Summoning courage at last, I threw open the door. The room was
                  light and warm; in the centre was the bountifully spread table with its hissing
                  urn. Mrs. Austen stood by the large open fire-place, whilst Marion leant
                  carelessly back in a cushioned easy-chair, with the morning paper in her hand.
               She turned towards me with a bright smile as I entered. "Why, you lazy child," she
                  said, "we have been waiting for half an hour at least for you—and oh, what pallid
                  cheeks and heavy eyes! This will not do, little Grace. What will become of you
                  before the winter is over, if one night's dissipation makes such ravages?"
               She bent over me caressingly as she spoke, but I shrank from the touch of that
                  scarred hand, and glided to Mrs. Austen's side with some half-incoherent apology
                  for having detained breakfast.
               She smiled kindly. "It is we who are to blame, my dear, for not remembering that
                  you are unaccustomed to our late city hours. You should have kept the house quiet,
                  Marion, that this poor child might have slept; she looks really haggard and
                  worn."
               Marion answered playfully as she seated herself at the table. I had noticed a quivering play in the muscles
                  around her mouth as I turned from her, though it was but momentary; for her face
                  was now as impassive and beautiful as ever, and she talked and jested with an
                  animation that in her seemed almost unnatural.
               In the warm light and under the social influence of the morning meal, my
                  half-superstitious terrors faded away. Had it not been for the crimson marks on
                  that white hand, I should have thought the whole scene of the previous night some
                  fearful dream, or the creation of my heated fancy.
               Of Mrs. Austen I have not spoken before, for of her there was little to be said,
                  save that she was Marion's mother—one of those negative, ordinary women of whom
                  hundreds are to be found in every grade of society, who live their commonplace
                  lives, guiltless of definite aims and purposes. I could see that she stood in some
                  little awe of her brilliant and accomplished daughter, by whom her whole life and
                  current of thought were swayed, and to whom she was simply an appendage that lent
                  the protection of her presence as the nominal head of the house. Marion was not to
                  blame for this, for the trite, weak remarks and opinions hazarded from time to
                  time were received by her not only patiently, but almost deferentially, and the
                  marked respect of her manner never varied, whatever her mood might be. It seemed
                  to me that in this deference she sought to reflect dignity on what in itself was
                  wavering and uncertain.
               Her kindly words this morning aided not a little in restoring the usual elasticity
                  of my spirits and in dispelling the fears that haunted me. The phantom that had so
                  troubled me resolved itself into the serene, clearly-cut face opposite, and I
                  gazed into it with almost a remorseful tenderness that I should have wronged it
                  so.
               I had little time for thought after that early morning hour, for we spent the day
                  in a round of shopping, visiting and sightseeing; in the evening company came in,
                  and it was not until late bed-time that I found myself again alone with
                  Marion.
               As I would have parted with her at the door of her chamber, she laid her hand on
                  my arm half entreatingly. "Can you spare me a few moments?" she said; then seeing
                  that I hesitated, she added with so me effort, "You need fear no repetition of
                  last night's folly. I was crazed then by my own indecision of purpose, and had a
                  hard victory to win over my weaker self; I have come to a final determination now,
                  and the conflict is over, I hope, forever."
               As I followed her into the room my eyes turned instinctively towards the mirror,
                  and I started in some surprise as its clear, silvery, unbroken surface shone upon
                  me from its heavily carved frame.
               "It is replaced, you see," she said with a bitter smile. "It is my way to keep
                  near me no mementoes to awaken conscience. It paid the penalty that many a heart
                  has done for reflecting my image too glowingly. Ah well," she continued, half
                  musingly, throwing herself into her easy-chair, "mirror or heart, what does it
                  matter how often it is changed, if that which takes its place can offer an incense
                  as delicate, a flattery as pleasing to the vanity to which it ministers?"
               "Marion," I said with a sudden boldness, and with some severity in my tone, "why
                  will you speak in this reckless, heartless way? This affectation of a stoicism of
                  which I believe you utterly incapable, is unworthy of you. Pride takes no attitude
                  so degrading as that bitter self-mockery which glories in what should make its
                  shame."
               I had not thought how much my words held, until I saw that Marion's cheek blanched
                  and her eye quailed under my indignant glance; then I stood trembling at my own
                  temerity.
               "Sit down here, Grace," she said at last, pointing to my accustomed seat at her
                  feet, "and I will talk to you about myself. There are lives of which the only
                  seeming use is to serve as warnings to others; and though that generous, kindly
                  nature of yours has little need, I trust, of so dark a lesson as my experience
                  will teach it, yet it will be as well for you to learn in time the character of
                  the life with which yours is to be thrown into daily contact, lest with the
                  enthusiastic affection of youth you should learn to excuse, and thus endorse,
                  errors that have darkened my past, and
                  will cast their shadows over all my future. And yet," she added, whilst the bitter
                  smile again curled her lip, "I deserve little praise for the seeming humility of
                  my words; it is, perhaps, after all only a natural impulse that induces me to
                  break to you gently a fact of which the world will not permit you to remain long
                  in ignorance—that the friend to whom you have looked up with such loving idolatry,
                  is after all only a thoroughly heartless woman of the world; technically, flirt,
                  jilt, coquette, or whatever else implies one utterly unscrupulous as to the means
                  by which her own aims and purposes are forwarded."
               "I will not believe this!" I cried hotly. "My experience is limited, I grant, but
                  it is sufficiently large to teach me how cruelly unjust the world is to what it
                  cannot comprehend, how it treats with scorn and contempt all that it cannot drag
                  down to its own level."
               "For once," said Marion quietly, "the world is right: I am what I seem. It is for
                  this I have studied and worked through all my life. I have reached the summit to
                  which my ambition pointed me. I sought power, and I possess it. Those who
                  collectively condemn me, are individually tools in my hand. I can read not only
                  the thoughts, but the motives of thought in those around me. Like a skilful
                  surgeon who, mingling with the living, breathing crowd, can yet trace with his
                  mind's eye the formation of each skeleton, the bones, the nerves, the sinews, the
                  muscles that unite to form the perfect whole, I hold the clue to every petty
                  passion that goes to make up life. I have exchanged my faith in the true and
                  beautiful that is mercifully implanted in every human breast, for the more intense
                  but darker happiness of power. I have torn the false-face from
                  humanity, have forced its passions to unveil themselves, have stolen the cloak
                  from hypocrisy, and fought cunning with its own weapons. Men fear me and yet
                  worship me; they are but my dupes whom I lead blindly, holding their hearts in my
                  hand that I may feel their life. It is not the petty
                  promptings of a pampered vanity, as I have implied, that induces me to surround
                  myself with those to whom my will is law; but the thirst for power—that same
                  thirst that drove our mother Eve from Paradise, opening her eyes as it did to the
                  knowledge of evil."
               She paused suddenly, for I had dropped her hand and turned shudderingly from that
                  livid face and those glowing eyes.
               "Oh Grace!" she said, and that wild, despairing voice rings in my ear through all
                  these years as I write, "condemn me if you will, but pity me, for I am very
                  miserable. This talismanic power that unearths only what is evil, is a cruel gift.
                  I grasped it as the secret of happiness; it has yielded me only anguish. I would
                  give all that I possess of knowledge and influence for the unsuspicious confidence
                  of a heart that can trust even though it be deceived."
               "Those only know they are deceived who do not trust enough," I said. "It may be
                  only the semblance of truth that the faith of a pure heart creates around it, but
                  if that semblance is to it a reality, what does it matter?"
               "Truth is never unreal," she answered. "I have grappled with it too often not to
                  know its strength. It defies my talisman, and I am forced to realise that after
                  all I have missed the secret of power, to know that I govern only
                  through the pettiest and weakest impulses by which men are actuated. Time was,
                  that so I ruled, it mattered little how; now I feel that I degrade
                  not more those whom I rule, than myself in ruling. It is a bitter
                  thought to know that I owe whatever of love or admiration is granted me, to a
                  dissimulation and artifice that habit has softened into naturalness. What would
                  you say of one who could be content to pass her life in a room surrounded by
                  mirrors that reflected her own image in every possible attitude; or in a picture
                  gallery where only her own form and face were reproduced in an endless variety?
                  Thus it is that my moods and humors are reproduced in those lives with which mine
                  is thrown into contact. Each passion I awaken is an effect, not an impulse. I must
                  have forever the wearing knowledge of conquest—never the consciousness of
                  appreciation; for this power, once my slave, is now my master. I must exert it
                  whether I will or not, for it has so sapped the freshness from my life that its
                  very seeming naturalness is but the refinement of art. Could I believe, as I
                     once strove to persuade myself, that
                  the petty passions upon which I have the power to play are the
                  master-keys of the human heart, then remorse would harden into contempt. But it is
                     not so; there is something that I cannot grasp—something before
                  which I shrink, feeling that I am powerless. It flashed from your eyes just now as
                  you spoke, cowing me before you; it has gleamed upon me at times from the faces of
                  those whom I have most duped and led, and my hold on them has loosened from that
                  hour. It is truth, Grace—that truth of which I spoke, before which
                  falsehood must fly as darkness before light.
               "In those who crowd around me," she continued, "there are many false as
                  myself—some attracted by my beauty, some pleased by my appreciative enjoyment of
                  their talents, more drawn by my popularity, which sheds a reflected honor upon
                  those who court my favor; but there are others whose simple greatness of heart has
                  taught me to reverence as a fact that sincerity which for so long a time I
                  questioned, who worship in me those virtues that their own loving faith has
                  created, who refuse to pass the harsh verdict of falsity on my life. Can you not
                  understand how galling the thought must be to one so proud as I, that those who
                  are worthy of honor can only grant me their confidence so long as I succeed in
                  deceiving them; that could they know me as I really am, were my actual life
                  unveiled to them, they would shrink from me with the same shuddering horror with
                  which you turned from me just now?"
               "Forgive me," I said, with a sudden remorseful tenderness, as I cast my arms
                  around her, "forgive me, Marion! Guilty you may be; I dare not judge you. I only
                  know that I love you, and still trust you however you may doubt yourself. You have
                  resolutely for long years trampled down your better nature, mocking at its cry;
                  let it assert itself. You tremble in the darkness, and yet shrink from the light.
                  You are weary of ruling for your own pleasure; consent to rule for the good of
                  others. With your influence, your power of swaying hearts, your wonderful beauty,
                  the memory of which stamps your words indelibly upon the minds of those who listen
                  to you—what a career is open before you! Beauty, influence, and experience are
                  separately talents confided to you to be used for a purpose. A long life spreads
                  before you—will you not consent to redeem your past by your future?"
               She shook her head mournfully; then resting her forehead on her hand, sat for a
                  long time without speaking.
               "Grace," she said at last, and her voice was softened and subdued, "I have warned
                  you not to trust me—not to depend on my experience, or to rely with implicit
                  confidence on the views that I may from time to time advance. I have preferred
                  that you should learn to pity, perhaps despise me, rather than lean too trustingly
                  upon me; for I do not wish to harm you, child, and my theories of life, though I
                  believe them true, may be but mere perversions of truth, since better hearts read
                  a different meaning in its problems. I fear that I have done you a wrong in
                  exposing you to an influence so baleful as mine; and though I love you with an
                  intensity that your calmer nature can scarcely comprehend, no mere selfish craving
                  for your presence would have induced me to have brought your fresh young life into
                  the tainted and unhealthy atmosphere of this home. But," and her voice deepened,
                  "will it terrify you, after all that I have said, if I tell you that you are here
                  for a purpose—a purpose that I cannot now explain, as that explanation must defeat
                  my wishes?"
               My heart quivered a little as she spoke, but I looked up trustingly—saying
                  bravely, "No, Marion, for whatever you may be to others, I know that
                  you are true to me." A beautiful smile illumined her face, and her large eyes swam
                  in tears. "Thank you," she said, "you shall never repent this confidence."
               I rose to go, but with a sudden impulse bent over her, saying timidly but
                  earnestly, "Will you not let me help you? Will you not let me be your friend? You
                  have need to unlearn some of those hard lessons life has taught you; cannot I aid
                  you in forgetting them? May not my very inexperience be of use to you?"
               She trembled violently, and without speaking, drew towards her a table upon which
                  stood her writing-desk and a goblet half filled with water. She poured a few drops
                  of the pure fluid into an open inkstand, then held it towards me. "How much is
                     it changed?" she said. Then with an
                  unsteady hand she dropped a few dark globules from its curved mouth into the
                  remnant of the water; they writhed and curled for a moment through the clear
                  liquid; then it was clear no longer, but grey and turbid, as the foreign particles
                  diffused themselves, deadening its crystal sparkle.
               She turned to me with a quick meaning look, then averted her face. I left her
                  silently; my heart was very heavy.
               Marion had arranged a small, social company for the next evening. Scarcely more
                  than a dozen, she told me, were invited, but among the guests she named were some
                  whose fame had penetrated even into the seclusion of our village, whom I had
                  admired and reverenced from afar, never dreaming that my life could by any
                  possibility be brought into personal contact with theirs. Now I was to meet them
                  upon terms of equality—even more, as the guest and chosen friend of one to whom
                  they yielded both admiration and homage. I was musing over all these things, and
                  the strange chances of life that had brought me unexpectedly into a position so
                  novel, as we sat together, she and I, the next afternoon in the twilight over the
                  embers of the fire, before the lamps were lighted. So busy was I with my own
                  thoughts that I was unconscious that her eyes were fastened on my face, reading
                  its expressions curiously by the fitful gleams of firelight that started up
                  suddenly from time to time, only to fade again as suddenly into the monotonous
                  crimson glow, until raising mine, I caught and held them for a moment without
                  speaking.
               She smiled. "I plead guilty," she said; "I have been trying to steal your
                  thoughts, and have puzzled myself for the last half hour with the changing
                  expressions of your face."
               "Why take so much needless trouble to learn what a question would have purchased
                  for you?"
               The bitter look played around her lips. "It is my way," she said.
               I judged it best not to notice her last words, and frankly told her all that had
                  been passing in my mind. "Really, Marion," I concluded, "I am almost nervously
                  apprehensive of this evening. What will such an ignorant little nobody as I do
                  among all your distinguished friends? I shall disgrace both you and myself, I
                  fear; for though I believe I can be tolerably agreeable sometimes with ordinary
                  people, I have such a reverence for genius that when I am thrown in contact with
                  one to whom I have been accustomed to look up, it seems to extinguish me as
                  entirely as a little candle that burns quite brightly in a darkened room, but
                  which fades into a mere glimmer if you open the shutter and let in the
                  sunlight."
               "You underrate yourself," she replied; "though if we were to trace your
                  difficulties to their first cause we might find they arose rather from pride than
                  humility. However, I will not enter into the analysis this evening; only be
                  natural, and I have no fear for you. Your mind is a very good one; its
                  capabilities vastly superior to the most of those around you. You have had but few
                  means of enlarging and improving it; but you are very young, opportunity will come
                  with time. Among those you will meet to-night there will be some, I trust, capable
                  of understanding and appreciating this. You need not fear their judgment. It is in
                  the aristocracy of talent as in that of fashion, those who strive for a position
                  are ever ready to thrust down those who would follow in their footsteps, to break
                  the rounds of the ladder by which they have ascended; whilst those who hold that
                  position securely as their right, are on the contrary ever ready to lend a helping
                  hand, to acknowledge a fellow-laborer. The artist's eye sees 'the angel in the
                  marble,' and a truly great soul recognises elements of future greatness in minds
                  still uncultured and unformed. Beware of literary quacks and impostors, but never
                  fear the truly refined and intelligent; you will find them lenient even in their
                  justice.
               "Moreover," she continued, with a half smile, finding I did not break the pause
                  that followed her words, "you must remember these lionised people are not beings
                  of an entirely different species from yourself, but in a measure dependent upon
                  you. Some of them may have written books. If you are capable of appreciating and
                  enjoying them, those books were written for you, for the purpose of
                  winning your approval, and your verdict is a matter of some
                  importance to their authors. There may be some whose names stand foremost in the history of the
                  times: it is the approbation of such pure, single hearts as yours that they
                  consider it their highest privilege to gain. Some there may be who have had it in
                  their power to command your admiration by the nobility of their actions: if you
                  can understand the motives of those actions, you are nearly as great as they. If,
                  however," and again the dark look came, "you are unwilling to trust to your own
                  powers of attraction, I can readily give you the clue to each life, and teach you
                  how through its vanity, ambition, peculiar views or prejudices, you can win for
                  yourself its inalienable friendship. These seemingly invulnerable heroes have
                  generally an Achilles' heel, in which a well-directed shaft may rankle. What do
                  you say?"
               "No, no!" I cried, turning from the glowing light of the eyes that bent above me;
                  "friendship thus won must degrade, not elevate me in my own opinion. You must not
                  speak thus to me, Marion; and it would be well for you if you could realise as you
                  have just said, that those to whom we look up reverently are but mere
                  human beings after all, partaking only to a less extent in the foibles and
                  frailties that canker our lives. The thought should induce not bitterness, but
                  rather wonder at God's mercy in thus teaching us our idols are but clay, lest we
                  should lean upon them too trustingly or worship them too entirely."
               She rose. "Believe me," she said, "I was only testing you. No persuasion on your
                  part would have induced me to teach you what I would give half the years of my
                  life to forget. Do not let me harm you, Grace. Trust to your instincts, not to my
                  seeming knowledge; for even now you are far wiser than I."
               She passed from my side as she spoke, and I stood for a long time with my forehead
                  resting against the mantel, gazing musingly into the fire. The strange, dark,
                  impetuous nature of my friend was only dimly comprehended by me then; but through
                  its seeming falsity I recognised germs of truth, over which my heart yearned
                  pityingly. Had I been older—had I learned the lesson that time always teaches us,
                  of our own fallibility and weakness—I would not have dared to expose my life to an
                  influence so dangerous. But youth is confident and fearless. I felt only that I
                  might aid her, and thought not of myself. She was her own worst enemy, poor
                  Marion; and my tears fell silently as I thought how wretched must be a life
                  enveloped in such darkness as closed around hers, and how almost impossible to
                  relight the lamp of faith in a human heart when it has once been extinguished by
                  its evil passions.
               I observed Marion somewhat curiously that evening as she moved among her friends,
                  welcoming them with an easy courtesy in which there was neither warmth nor
                  formality. It half puzzled, half amused me to see how naturally and unsuspectingly
                  the company resolved itself into just such little groups and parties as her will
                  directed; and to note, despite that calm, negligent air of hers, how her keenly
                  observant eye took in every detail of the scene around her, watching the
                  expression of each face, knowing when to displace and how to rearrange her guests,
                  accomplishing the various moves and shiftings as readily as though they were so
                  many automatons in her hand. With such an ally I had little need to fear her
                  celebrities. It was her pleasure that I should please, and I felt that she watched
                  me with especial care. Had I been the idiot I had half jestingly declared myself,
                  I could scarcely have failed to be agreeable; I gave myself up for the time
                  entirely to her control. I use the word gave, but I scarcely know
                  whether this yielding up of my identity was voluntary or not, for her influence
                  seemed to pervade the room. She it was who directed the conversation and suggested
                  its subjects, yet no one seemed to be aware of this, nor of the mesmeric power by
                  which he was controlled.
               I had wished, yet had not dared, to ask Marion if Albert Greyson was included in
                  her invitation, and I was very well pleased when late in the evening he made his
                  appearance. Remembering the bitter tone she had adopted in speaking of him, I
                  watched his reception with some little interest. There was no change of color nor
                  difference of manner; she swept forward to receive him with her usual composure,
                  and they stood for a short time in conversation in the centre of the room; then,
                  evidently in answer to a question from him, she turned with a smile towards me. He bowed as he caught my eye, and his
                  face lighted. She led him towards me, and after a few moments left us alone
                  together, carrying captive with her the gentleman with whom I had been talking.
                  The hour I spent with him was perhaps the pleasantest of the evening. The perfect
                  freedom from restraint in his manner forbade it in mine; and I found myself
                  conversing with him as easily and naturally as though I had known him all my life,
                  pleasing the more perhaps that I made no effort to do so, forgetting myself
                  entirely. I was sorry when the thread of the animated discussion we were carrying
                  on was broken by Marion, who came towards us with a piece of music in her
                  hand.
               "Miss Austen," said Mr. Greyson, turning to her with a smile, "this little friend
                  of yours is very obstinate I have been arguing with her for the last half-hour,
                  and my logic has failed entirely to convince her; indeed I believe she even claims
                  the victory. Is it not so?" he added, appealing to me.
               "Yes," I replied laughingly, "the victory is certainly mine; but whether I have
                     won it is another question. You have been arguing, as you know
                  very well, against your own convictions and views. But even if that were not the
                  case, my side is the right side, because it is the just side; and
                  that I will maintain though you should tear to pieces every argument I have
                  used."
               "Oh Grace, Grace," said Marion, "this will not do; I shall never be able to make a
                  belle of you unless you learn to yield a point gracefully. I shall have to teach
                  you the lesson that experience soon taught me. I commenced as you have, but I
                  found that it would not answer. I could not understand at first why I had failed;
                  certainly I had acquitted myself entirely to my own satisfaction, displaying often
                  a surprising superiority of knowledge, and a readiness of repartee that
                  discomfited each adversary. I had yet to learn that it is not by superior
                  knowledge or ability that we win admiration or regard. Vanquish a man in an
                  argument, prove that his views are utterly baseless and unsound, and ten chances
                  to one you convert a friend into an enemy. And yet they would not have us
                  altogether ignorant—Oh no!—we must be sufficiently intelligent to appreciate the
                  force of the arguments guments they advance, sufficiently cultivated to make the
                  conquest over our opinions a matter of self-glorification; but woe to us if that
                  victory be not gained!—then we are stubborn and narrow-minded."
               She had commenced jestingly, but her voice grew deeper as she went on, and the
                  bitter smile played around her lips. Mr. Greyson folded his arms and leant back in
                  his chair; a shadow rested on his brow, and the face a few moments ago so pleasant
                  and kindly, was cold and stern. I glanced somewhat dubiously from one to
                  another.
               "Well," I said at last, a little defiantly I fear, "I do not care. A friend that
                  is lost so readily is not worth the trouble of keeping. My opinions shall never be
                  sacrificed to feed the vanity of such an one, I promise you; so I advise you to
                  seek a more docile pupil."
               Her eye softened as she met the half-indignant glance of mine. "I had almost
                  forgotten the purpose of my errand to your corner," she said. "I have promised
                  those gentlemen around the piano the pleasure of hearing you sing, and they are
                  looking quite impatiently towards us."
               "Please do not ask me—not to-night, dear Marion," I pleaded.
               She smiled wilfully. "Come," she said, and passing her arm through mine she led me
                  across the room.
               As I turned over the piles of unfamiliar music, my eye lighted on the quaint old
                  ballad of "Auld Robin Grey." Now I feel assured it was placed there purposely;
                  then I was almost as much surprised as pleased to find it in such company. I had a
                  sweet voice for ballad-singing, and this sad little song had always been a
                  favorite with me; just then its simple pathos touched me even more deeply than
                  usual. There were tears in my voice as well as in my eyes as I sang; nor was I the
                  only one thus moved, for as I paused a burning drop fell upon my hand. I looked up
                  wonderingly, for Marion stood beside me; her large eyes were fixed and dreamy, and
                  there was a mournful depth in their expression of which I had believed them
                  incapable. As she met my glance the look passed, and her face was as still and
                  impassive as ever.
               
               "We must thank you for a rare treat, my little Grace," she said, in that light,
                  mocking way of hers. "In this artificial world in which we live, where sentiment
                  is but another name for folly, we learn to disbelieve so entirely in the existence
                  of hearts, that we seek generally to please rather than to touch; indeed, any
                  effort to do so is generally frowned down as a species of social treason."
               Mr. Greyson had been standing on the other side of the instrument with his hand
                  half shading his eyes, which were bent upon me as I sang. There was a quick flash
                  in them now as he raised them to Marion's face.
               "We should scarcely," he said, "endorse such a statement as that by our silence.
                  Fortunately, however, the testimony of such an openly avowed sceptic in all
                  matters of the heart as Miss Austen must carry small weight with it in a matter of
                  mere feeling."
               His keen cutting tone, though quiet and gentlemanly, was even more severe than the
                  words themselves. I knew the hidden fire that leapt beneath the ice of Marion's
                  calm exterior and looked up at her imploringly. I need have had no fear; she
                  answered him only with that haughty, indolent smile of hers, then turned
                  negligently from him to reply to the trivial question of a guest at her side.
               Later in the evening, as I stood the centre of a little group of gentlemen who had
                  gathered around me, in one of the pauses of conversation Mr. Greyson's low, clear
                  voice fell on my ear.
               "Be that as it may," he said, "remember I warn you to beware how you graft her
                  fresh, unsuspicious life with the bitter fruit of yours."
               "I cannot harm her," was the reply; "goodness with Grace is an instinct."
               My cheek flushed, and I made a hurried excuse to leave a neighborhood in which I
                  was thus involuntarily playing the part of eavesdropper. As I turned, I saw that
                  Marion stood with him at a little distance from me.
               As was perhaps not quite right, yet very natural, my eyes wandered towards them
                  more than once during the half-hour they were together. The shadow still rested on
                  Mr. Greyson's brow, and his face was grave and stern; he seemed to be speaking
                  earnestly, at times even with feeling. She listened with quiet indifference,
                  playing carelessly with the tassel of the curtain near which they stood. At times
                  that smile, half mocking, half bitter, that I knew so well, passed over her face,
                  but I could read nothing in its expression.
               He turned from her at last with a gesture of impatience, then colored deeply as he
                  saw that I was observing him, and coming up to me, stood for a few moments in
                  conversation before he bade me good-night. Others soon followed him, for the hour
                  was late. When we were alone in the brilliant room, Marion came up to me, and
                  taking my face in her hands, turned it upward to her own.
               "Shall I tell you all the pretty things that have been said about you this
                  evening? What is your candid opinion after all of these terrible lions? Are you
                  satisfied with your success, you vain little girl?"
               I answered only her last query. "No, Marion," I said, "for it was you
                  who pleased through me. I was myself but the one hour I conversed with Mr.
                  Greyson; please do not let this be so again. Let me stand or fall by my own
                  merit."
               She looked at me thoughtfully. "You are right," she said; "I was not just to
                  you."
               She lighted my candle without speaking again, and we went silently upstairs
                  together. At the door of her chamber I paused, not knowing whether I would be
                  expected to enter or pass on.
               She readily interpreted my hesitation. "Not to-night, dear Grace," she said; "I am
                  weary—I want rest."
               I could see, despite her effort to conceal it, that she was struggling with some
                  strong excitement. Her breath, as she stooped to touch my brow with her lips, came
                  quick and hard, and the hand that held the candle trembled nervously. She smiled
                  brightly however as she met my earnest look, and bidding me good-night, passed
                  into her room.
               
               It is far from my intention to record the daily events of my visit to Marion. My
                  story is of her rather than myself, and I have entered into its minutiæ only
                  because I believed that I could thus most readily explain our relative positions,
                  and image forth through her own words the strange, passionate nature of my unhappy
                  friend, which I would scarcely have dared attempt in a mere cold analysis of her
                  character. My winter in the city was one of rare enjoyment. Marion's powers of
                  mind were of no mean calibre, and had won for her the position in the intellectual
                  world which her exquisite tact and surpassing beauty had gained in merely
                  fashionable circles. Her house was the daily resort of those whose society was as
                  instructive as it was delightful; and as her friend, opportunities were open to me
                  that few other homes could have afforded.
               The affection between us deepened into something more than mere ordinary
                  friendship. In Marion's intense nature there was no such thing as moderation, and
                  she lavished upon me an ardent love, which I returned by an almost equal devotion.
                  It was not only in words that this was manifested: a change seemed wrought in her
                  very life. The bitter smile curled her lip less frequently, and the scoffing jest
                  was seldom uttered; whilst the irony of her tone softened into a mournful pathos
                  at times, as she spoke of herself or others. She appeared to place a constant curb
                  upon her words, lest she should cause me pain or offend my sense of right. This
                  restraint originated, I believe, in the first instance, from the fear of injuring
                  me, in her dread lest, through her influence, my life should take the color of her
                  own; but gradually and involuntarily our positions towards each other changed. She
                  it was who leant upon me. The quiet assumption of superior knowledge and
                  experience passed away. My opinions and views were accepted by her as truth, and
                  her own theories discarded as false if they failed to coincide with mine. It was a
                  dangerous position for one so young as I, yet less dangerous perhaps than its
                  reverse might have been to me. I could not understand how the change had been
                  wrought, and day by day the study of that complex character became more
                  incomprehensible to me.
               Mr. Greyson was our constant, in fact I may write, our nightly visitor. In his
                  presence alone I had no power over Marion. The sight of him seemed to stir to the
                  surface all the fierce, passionate elements of her nature. The biting sarcasm, the
                  quick taunt, were ever upon her lip. His opinion had become to me a matter of more
                  than ordinary importance in those months of our acquaintance, and it pained me
                  much that she should thus constantly falsify herself to him, belieing so bitterly
                  her womanliness. It was not possible, as he had once said, for me to endorse the
                  sentiments she advanced by my silence, and again and again I was forced to oppose
                  her in his presence, arguing with all the strength of earnest conviction in
                  support of those truths which she so wantonly attacked. Sometimes when her
                  perverse misapprehensions awakened me into an unusual energy, that strange,
                  gleaming smile would flash suddenly across her face, lighting it with an
                  expression of almost triumphant exultation, and I would pause, bewildered, as I
                  strove to catch its hidden meaning. Once he saw that smile and his cheek
                  blanched—he answered her look with one almost of threatening; and when he turned
                  to me, there was in his eyes a solicitude that filled my heart with a vague
                  alarm.
               After he left us, one evening, when he had been our only visitor, and an argument
                  of unusual warmth had been carried on, I turned suddenly to Marion, who had lapsed
                  into the dreamy silence that, generally with her, succeeded a controversy of this
                  kind.
               "Do you really support the views you have advocated with such heat
                  this evening, Marion?" I asked.
               She raised her eyes to mine with a half-mournful smile. "No," she said, "you know
                  that I do not."
               I looked at her searchingly; again she smiled. "Do not puzzle that innocent little
                  brain of yours by attempting to comprehend my seeming inconsistencies; it is a
                  useless effort, I assure you."
               I was deeply moved. "God, in granting you the power to comprehend the truth, has
                  given you the command to support it," I said, very solemnly. "Our opinions are the
                  fruit of our experience, and that experience is, in other words, the testimony
                     given in by each life to strengthen
                  the right or swell the tide of evil. If it is a fearful crime to close our own
                  eyes to the light, what pardon is there for the recklessness that seeks to serve
                  its own purposes by darkening and misleading the minds of others?"
               She turned deadly pale and raised her hand appealingly; then she rose and paced
                  the floor with hurried steps for a long time. Pausing suddenly behind my chair,
                  she bent over me and pressed her hot lips to my brow. "Do not cast me utterly from
                  your love, Grace," she said; "the time may come when you will know me less guilty,
                  in this respect at least, than you believe me now." She passed through the open
                  door without waiting for my answer, but her head was bowed and her step unsteady.
                  It caused me bitter pain to have inflicted such suffering upon her, and yet
                  perhaps it was as well.
               As the time for my departure drew near she seemed to cling to me with a still more
                  earnest devotion. She had so few things to care for, poor Marion; and her heart
                  rebelled against the thought of yielding up the inestimable happiness, so lately
                  won, of rendering love for love.
               The separation was a hard one for me too, but it was not only the pain of parting
                  with her that saddened my brow and made my step so heavy. An affection deeper,
                  stronger, holier than that which takes the name of friendship, had been growing,
                  unsuspected and silently, in these months of constant intercourse with Albert
                  Greyson; and now that its links were to be broken I felt how tightly they had
                  bound me, and awakened at last to the knowledge that I had been living day by day
                  in the excitement of his presence, that every thought and word and action was
                  biased by an unconscious reference to his opinions; that life would be to me
                  henceforward a cold, dark journey if I must tread its paths alone. It was only the
                  present pang of parting, however, that I felt, for there was an inward happy
                  consciousness that my love had been yielded, not given; that it would
                  be claimed before long as a right. Yet, even had it been otherwise
                  there would have been no self-reproach to me in the thought that I had given my
                  heart unsought, for however unfortunately for ourselves our love may be bestowed,
                  there is no shame in loving, provided we love worthily one worthy of our
                  affection.
               It distressed me not a little that on the long-dreaded last evening of my visit,
                  Marion should have to suffer with one of her severe nervous headaches. I begged
                  her to let me sit with her, promising she should have perfect silence; but this
                  she peremptorily forbade; and when the servant brought up Mr. Greyson's name,
                  insisted so decidedly that I should leave her that I was forced to comply. I was
                  well pleased, though somewhat surprised, that he should be our only visitor; but
                  many things read clearly to me now that then I did not understand. Mrs. Austen
                  retired early, as was her custom, and for a long, long hour we were alone
                  together. Shall I tell how much of happiness that hour held for me? Ah no! Every
                  happy wife holds in her heart the sacred memory of such an hour—more precious to
                  her than all the years of love that have succeeded it.
               Marion's door stood half open, and the room within was brilliantly lighted as I
                  passed it on the way to my own. I strove to steal by quietly, for I longed to be
                  alone with my new joy, and felt that I could not meet her gaze with my happy
                  secret burning at my heart. Her quick ear caught my step, and she called
                  "Grace."
               I paused irresolutely. "Are you better? I cannot come—not to-night, Marion," I
                  faltered.
               "Grace."
               I dared not disobey that tone. She was seated in an easy-chair in the
                  centre of the room. Her face was colorless as the loose white morning-dress she
                  wore, and her strange, deep eyes gleamed from its pallor like lamps of living
                  flame. She raised them to my face with a look of eager penetration as I entered,
                  then opened her arms to me, and I threw myself upon her heart. She held me closely
                  there for many moments without speaking, and then with a gentle force turned my
                  flushed face upward to her own, and gazed long and earnestly into my eyes.
               "And so," she said at last, "he loves you! he loves you, little Grace! And
                  you?"—
               
               The tears that coursed lightly over my burning cheeks were her only answer.
               She bent and kissed my forehead. "May God bless you," she said. "From to-night I
                  shall learn to pray again, that I may pray for your happiness." And then she spoke
                  to me in gentle, womanly words, such words as I had never dreamed that I should
                  hear from Marion's lips; and as though I lay upon my mother's breast, I poured out
                  to her the fulness of my joy. Her face was calm and still as she listened, and in
                  her eyes there was a look almost holy in its tenderness.
               I rose at last to leave her; but as I closed the door, a low, moaning cry fell
                  upon my ear. I reopened it hastily. She still sat as I had left her, but her head
                  was bowed forward upon her hands, and her whole frame writhed in convulsive sobs.
                  Terrified and astonished I cast myself on my knees beside her, pressing her
                  quivering lips with mine, smoothing back the heavy masses of dishevelled hair that
                  fell around her brow, soothing and caressing her as I would a grieving child. The
                  paroxysm passed at last, and her tears fell less heavily. Then again she covered
                  her face with her hands and remained for a long time in perfect silence. When they
                  were withdrawn, there was little trace of the storm of passion that had swept over
                  it; an expression of actual humility seemed mingled with its tenderness.
               "I have done very wrong," she said gently, "to cast the shadow of my grief over
                  the first bright hour of your happiness; but your artless confidence has awakened
                  memories that it has been the effort of my life to deaden and destroy. You, Grace,
                  who know me now—the proud, cold, unloving woman that time has made of me—can
                  scarcely realise that once my heart was fresh and young as yours; that once it
                  beat proudly, as yours does to-night, in the happy consciousness that it was
                  claimed by a life stronger, better, nobler than its own; that once it held within
                  its depths that priceless treasure, the love of one who was pure and true. Ah,
                  well!" and her eye wandered restlessly from the fixed gaze of mine, "I was not
                  worthy; I would have despised him had he sought to retain that heart tainted and
                  poisoned by worldliness. He did well to cast it from him."
               There was a momentary struggle for composure, and then again Marion's quiet face
                  was turned to me. "Go now, child," she said in her old familiar way, "and forget
                  all that I have so selfishly said to you; and do not grieve for me. Remember, the
                  dream passed years ago, and I have learned to live without it."
               In the monotony of my quiet home the wonderful memories of my winter in the city
                  were a source of unfailing enjoyment, not only to myself, but to my young sisters,
                  who never wearied of listening to the reiterated accounts of the many sources of
                  pleasure that had been open to me. Letters, long and pleading, came from Marion
                  urging my return to her; but this my mother would by no means consent to, nor
                  could I myself be willing to break again the little home-circle that I so soon was
                  to leave forever; for the summer was passing swiftly away, and in the autumn
                  Albert Greyson had won permission to transplant me to his new home in the West,
                  where, as he said, he should begin life afresh.
               Marion had promised to be with me whilst I made my bridal preparations, and I was
                  much disappointed that the illness of her mother detained her from me until the
                  night before my wedding. In the joy of seeing her, however, I forgot my previous
                  annoyance, and the only trouble that clouded that time of perfect happiness was
                  the impossibility of crowding into the few hours that were left us, the many
                  things I had been accumulating during the past six months to say to her.
               All the coldness and reserve of her manner were laid aside. She entered with a
                  kindly interest, a genuine warmth, into the minutiæ of my various arrangements and
                  preparations. Her face was almost as radiant as my own as she listened to the
                  outpourings of my full heart; and though a shadow at times crossed its brightness,
                  I felt assured that a peace rested upon Marion's life that it had never known in
                  times past.
               Her arms were the first after my mother's to enfold me when the solemn vow had
                  been spoken that bound my life forever to him who stood beside me, her kiss the
                  next that was pressed upon my brow.
               Her eyes were full of light, and that strange, triumphant smile flashed over her
                  face as she laid her hand in Albert's.
               
               "You have chosen wisely," she said. "See that you prove yourself worthy of the
                  trust of this pure young heart."
               He looked at her steadfastly, but there was no drooping of the lids, no shrinking
                  from his gaze. Through the evening she quietly moved among my guests, relieving me
                  with kindly tact from my duties as hostess, pausing at times to speak some
                  endearing word, or to watch me with loving eyes.
               She had promised to remain for a few days with my mother, to break the first pain
                  of our separation; and as she held me in her arms the next morning in a last
                  embrace, she whispered softly in my ear:
               "You asked me once, dear Grace, if I would not let you help me. You have aided me
                  more than you know, in teaching me how pure a thing a human life can be."
               And so I parted from her, little thinking how many changes would be wrought in the
                  lives of both before we met again.
               Time flies swiftly when we are happy, and I had been many years a wife when one
                  day a letter reached me in that once familiar handwriting. Before I had parted
                  with her, on that beautiful autumn morning, I had sought to win a promise that she
                  would visit me in my new home before many months had passed. This promise she
                  refused to give, and moreover forbade that I should write to or attempt to hold
                  communication with her in any way, on pain of her severest displeasure. The
                  prohibition had caused me much distress and perplexity; and her assurances of
                  undiminished affection for me, and a knowledge of the eccentric wilfulness that
                  characterised her slightest actions, had been my only sources of comfort. From her
                  words, and in remembering many that had preceded them, I gathered that some
                  unforgiven offence, long ago committed by my husband, was the cause of this
                  strange conduct; but delicacy to her forbade me from demanding of him the
                  explanation which she had wished to withhold from me.
               In the years that had passed, however, I had chosen to disregard her command, and
                  had written to her repeatedly; but I found it, as of old, useless to oppose
                  Marion's will. My letters had been returned to me unanswered, and after the first,
                  unopened; so I was forced at last to submit, to wait her own time for breaking the
                  silence between us.
               Indirectly, information from time to time reached me concerning her. Soon after my
                  marriage, the death of her mother furnished her with the excuse she had long
                  desired for retiring from society, and since then her life had been passed in the
                  utmost seclusion, her entire time being devoted to deeds of charity and mercy. In
                  18—, when the pestilence raged in our crowded cities, and death, clothed in all
                  his horrors, visited every home-circle—again and again in the public journals was
                  mention made of the noble woman who dared every danger to supply the wants of the
                  sufferers, who walked fearless and unharmed in the midst of disease as though she
                  bore a charmed life, who by her single efforts wrested many victims from the grasp
                  of the destroyer, and ministered with self-sacrificing devotion to the comfort of
                  those upon whom his cold hand was laid too heavily for rescue.
               My heart swelled with a proud joy as from time to time these testimonials met my
                  eye, for I felt that Marion was achieving now that conquest before which all her
                  other triumphs paled into insignificance, the conquest over self; that the germs
                  of good within her were striking their roots slowly but surely into the very
                  depths of her nature, and that they would blossom forth at last into an abundant
                  harvest. The letter I had welcomed so joyfully brought in its perusal more pain
                  than pleasure. It held but a few lines; they ran thus:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "May I come to you, dear Grace, and share for a short time the
                              happiness of your home? I have but a few months left me now on earth,
                              and before I start on my long journey I would wish to look once more
                              into the sweet face of the one friend whose gentle influence has done
                              so much to rob it of its terrors. Experience may have taught you to
                              regard me with less leniency than of old; but, unless you have ceased
                              to love me, do not refuse this, my last request.
                           
                              MARION."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Blinding tears filled my eyes as I read. When I had finished the little note I passed it in silence to Albert,
                  who sat beside me. His face grew very grave and stern as he perused it.
               "I shall not oppose what I know must be your wish," he said, as he handed it back
                  to me. "In fact, it would be impossible for you to refuse a request thus
                  worded."
               "Refuse!" I cried, looking at him in indignant astonishment.
               "Yes," he replied quietly; "under other circumstances I must have desired—nay
                  more, have insisted, that you should do so. That friend of yours is false to the
                  core, Grace. Of her it may be indeed said, 'the truth is not in her.' Even now I
                  can scarcely consent for her to bring that passionate, turbulent life of hers into
                  our peaceful home."
               I turned from him almost angrily. I was too deeply wounded even to attempt her
                  defence; perhaps it was as well that I left it for Marion to vindicate herself. In
                  less than a week she was with us. My anxiety for her was at first much relieved:
                  there were no signs of emaciation in her exquisitely proportioned figure, no
                  evidence of debility in her firm step and erect carriage. Only in the deadly
                  pallor of her cheek, that the glow of pleasure or the flush of excitement had no
                  longer power to tinge, was read the secret of the fearful malady that was sapping
                  her life. Changed she was, but scarcely less beautiful than when I used to feast
                  my eyes upon her loveliness with such fervid admiration. The white face that
                  contrasted so strangely with the mourning dress, which she had never laid aside,
                  wore a look of tender humility which it had not known in those old days; and
                  though the fire of her eye was quenched, in its marvellous depths dwelt an
                  expression of peaceful serenity that had taken the place of its half-defiant
                  flash. Her lip, too, had lost its scornful curve, and the sweet womanly smile that
                  once had been a rare visitant there, played often around her mouth. The change in
                  herself was scarcely less marked. There was a repose of manner very different from
                  her former half-haughty indifference, whilst the impetuosity that at times had
                  characterised her was subdued into an earnestness that had its source in her depth
                  of feeling.
               She readily endeared herself to the various members of the household. My little
                  girls hung around her with a loving fondness, entirely free from the reverential
                  awe with which I had once regarded her, and my baby would at any time leave even
                  my arms for hers; whilst the courteous politeness of my husband's manner softened
                  day by day into a more kindly interest. Whatever the sins of the brilliant belle
                  might have been, he seemed to recognise the injustice of visiting them upon the
                  pale invalid, who bore her sufferings with such uncomplaining fortitude. To me her
                  presence was a source of exquisite delight. If I had loved her in the past, even
                  whilst I bitterly condemned her, when conscience was constantly raising its
                  warning voice to construe that love into a temptation to my soul: now that she
                  came to me sanctified by suffering, purified by faith, no longer the proud, cold
                  sceptic, but the humble, loving woman, was it strange that my heart welcomed her
                  again to her place there with eager joy?
               She had been with me for about a month, when one evening as I came into the parlor
                  after tea, I found her seated at the piano, whilst my little girls stood beside
                  her, petitioning "Aunt Marion" for a song. I joined my entreaties with theirs; for
                  though her voice was one of rare power, never more than once or twice in my life
                  had I heard her sing. Her hands played idly over the keys for a few moments, and
                  then in a voice that had lost none of its former rich fulness she sang the first
                  and last stanzas of Moore's exquisite little melody "Farewell—but whenever you
                  welcome the hour." She faltered more than once on the last verse, however, and I
                  noticed a quivering play in the muscles around her mouth; and also that when
                  Albert, who had entered unobserved, added his thanks to ours, as she turned from
                  him her large eyes swam with tears.
               She was quiet and abstracted through the evening, speaking little; though from
                  time to time I saw that her eyes rested in turn upon my husband's face and mine
                  with a look of mournful meaning. When our usual time for retiring came, she rose
                  and held out her hand to Albert. "Good-night," she said.
               It was the first time this familiarity had been exchanged between tween them; and, though I read a look of slight
                  surprise upon his face, he clasped it gently for a moment in his own as he
                  detained her to make some kind inquiries about her health. As she turned away, I
                  saw that she was deeply agitated, and that she trembled violently. I sprang to her
                  side.
               "You are ill, Marion," I said.
               "No, no," she replied, "only a little faint." But her steps were irregular and
                  slow, and she leant heavily upon my shoulder. "Come to my room with me," she
                  whispered, "I have much to say to you to-night."
               As I entered her chamber I found, to my astonishment, that it was dismantled and
                  bare, and that her trunk no longer stood in its accustomed place.
               "Ah yes," she said, in answer to my look of bewilderment, "they were sent for this
                  morning—all my things—whilst we were driving. I must leave you by daybreak
                  to-morrow, that I may start in the early train. Do not look so grieved, darling;
                  it must be so. You will understand how impossible it is for me to remain longer
                  with you when I have opened to you, as I purpose doing, all the secret history of
                  my life."
               She seated herself as she spoke, and motioned me to take my place beside her. I
                  threw myself, as in my girlish days, in the old familiar attitude at her feet, and
                  waited without speaking for her to break the silence that followed her last
                  words.
               "Grace," she said at last, with sad earnestness, "the revelations that I must make
                  to you to-night may teach you to despise me; but remember, with even more horror
                  than you possibly can feel, do I look back to that time of darkness and despair in
                  which I erred so blindly. I seek to offer no extenuation for its sins, but only to
                  detail to you the events of my life as they really did occur; you can draw your
                  own moral. Portions of that life-history I have been wrong perhaps in withholding
                  from you so long.
               "I told you once that I had loved in early youth," she added. "Have no suspicions
                  ever crossed your mind, have you never guessed to whom my life yielded up its
                  first devotion?"
               The blood surged suddenly to my heart as a terrible fear flashed upon my mind. I
                  read its confirmation in her eyes, and my head sank into my hands.
               "Oh Marion, my poor Marion!" I cried, "how fearfully I have wronged you!"
               "No," she replied, "you have been my good angel; only through you has the sting of
                  remorse been plucked from my heart. Listen now and you shall learn how much you
                  have done for me.
               "Albert Greyson and I grew up as children together. Our families were intimate,
                  and his sister Annie was my favorite friend. I cannot remember the time when I did
                  not know and love him. He was my senior by several years, and, as was but natural,
                  I early learned to look up to him and regulate my life by his wishes and opinions,
                  as though he had been to me, as well as to Annie, an elder brother. I was scarcely
                  more than sixteen when it was thought advisable by his friends that he should go
                  for a few years to Europe, that the finishing touches might be given to his
                  education by foreign advantages and travel.
               "The prospect of parting was a heavy trial to us both. Then for the first time we
                  learned that we were no longer children, that a tie stronger than that of blood
                  bound us to each other.
               "I was very happy in the knowledge of his love. Even the thought of our separation
                  could scarcely cloud my first joy. He was scrupulously honorable then as now, and
                  would bind me by no promise.
               "'No, Marion,' he said, 'you are young and beautiful; I have no right to shackle
                  your life thus early with a vow. This may be with you a mere fleeting fancy; it
                  may have grown the habit of your life to love me. Our lives must be severed
                  utterly; I must not even hear from you, unless you are ill or in trouble. If you
                  love me truly as you have said, absence and silence will not weaken that love; but
                  if it cannot stand the test—ah, Marion, I would not wish to hold you only by your
                  word!'
               "I was wounded and grieved by his doubt, but when he said, 'Marion, you
                     will not change, you will not break my heart,' and gazing into his
                  face I saw the suffering painted there, and realised that this harsh sentence
                  pressed not more heavily upon my heart
                  than on his, with a sudden impulse I raised my hand and cried: 'You will not
                  accept my vow, but heaven shall receive it! Neither time, absence, nor death even,
                  shall have power to break the tie by which our souls are bound together. From this
                  moment I dedicate my life to you. Yours I am for time and for eternity.'
               "He would have checked me, but I pointed upward with a triumphant smile. 'You
                  cannot cancel my words,' I said; 'they are recorded there.'
               "But"—and she paused—"I am paining you. I grow strangely inconsiderate lately; yet
                  you cannot know how sweet it is for me to linger with these old memories.
               "We confided our secret to no one, not even to Annie. I did not grieve so openly
                  for him as I might otherwise have done, but I can scarcely express to you the
                  loneliness and desolation of my life in those first months of separation. I
                  secluded myself from all society, pleading as an excuse my youth and my studies. I
                  applied myself to the latter with renewed diligence. I seemed to be animated by
                  the one object of rendering myself worthy of the love that I had won, determining
                  that on his return he should find no want in me. Albert had been gone rather more
                  than a year when a distant cousin of his came to stay for some time at Mr.
                  Greyson's. He was a hot-headed impetuous young fellow just from college, and
                  readily rendered himself a favorite not only in Mr. Greyson's home, but ours,
                  where he soon learned to spend more than half of his time.
               "That Clarence Weir, at his impressible age, should fall desperately in love with
                  a beautiful girl with whom he was thrown daily on terms of familiarity, was only
                  the natural consequence of our intimacy. He was a singular being, ardent and
                  impetuous, yet gifted with exquisite sensibilities and rare depth of feeling.
                  There was more of the woman than the man in him. A beautiful thought or a tale of
                  grief would bring the quick flush to his delicately veined cheek and a dimness to
                  his large dark eyes; and yet, though his highly-strung nature possessed slight
                  powers of endurance, beneath it flashed an indomitable energy. He was, in fact,
                  that rare compound of genius and passion that in the delicately organised nervous
                  temperaments of our most ill-fated poets we have learned to mourn. His frequent
                  visits broke agreeably the monotony of my quiet life, and I soon began to look
                  forward to his coming with a pleasure that nothing had afforded me since Albert's
                  departure. He was somewhat older than I, yet I felt to be many years his senior,
                  and often assumed with him that careless air of half superiority which the
                  consciousness of a wider experience and more mature judgment teaches us at times
                  to use. Compared to the image hidden in my heart, to which my thoughts ever turned
                  with a tender reverence, he was but a boy; and as such, his passionate devotion at
                  first rather amused than pleased me. As time wore on, however, and I learned to
                  know how entirely his life was under my control, there was a singular fascination
                  for me in testing, from time to time, that influence over him—a strange delight in
                  feeling that every power and capability of his nature was subservient to my will.
                  It was a new sensation. It had been Albert's place to guide—mine to follow; his to
                  will, mine to perform. My life had taken its color from his. I had been loved as a
                  woman; now I was worshipped as an idol. My slightest word became a law, my most
                  carelessly expressed opinion from that time a recognised truth. His very thoughts
                  were under my control; I could lead them as I pleased; my power was absolute. In a
                  moment I could darken his brow or kindle his eye with the flash of joy.
               "I grew tyrannical at times, and experimented cruelly with the various shades of
                  feeling I chose to call into play; but no tyranny could weaken his allegiance. I
                  did not fairly recognise the danger of our relative positions; but when conscience
                  raised its voice loudly at times I turned impatiently from its reproaches; I would
                  not readily cast from me the newly-found happiness of ruling. Annie Greyson too,
                  who more than suspected her brother's interest in me, although she believed it
                  still unacknowledged, sought more than once to warn me as to the certain
                  consequences of my present course; but I turned aside her words with jesting, and
                  day by day wove the network of my fascinations more closely around my victim.
               
               "This state of things could not exist always. The time came when, unable to bear
                  longer the suspense with which he was tortured, Clarence claimed from me a
                  definite answer. I was not then totally hardened. The frank, manly avowal of his
                  love touched me more deeply than I would have been willing for him to know. In
                  that moment the veil that had blinded me so long fell from my eyes, and I
                  recognised all the baseness and perfidy of my conduct; recognised too how Albert's
                  love had been wronged, his confidence outraged. Had I given vent to the bitter
                  shame, the fierce remorse that tore my heart as I saw my sin at last in its true
                  light, it might have saved us both. But my proud spirit was unwilling to submit to
                  this humiliation; and the anger that should have burned against myself, wreaked
                  itself upon the innocent head of my lover. I adopted a haughty tone, wondered at
                  the presumption that dared aspire so high, answering his entreaties with mocking,
                  his reproaches with taunts, until he quitted my presence at last, fairly maddened
                  by my scorn.
               "Annie had been his confidante—to her he carried his outraged, wounded feelings,
                  poured out the first bitterness of his anguish. She came to me almost incredulous
                  of the possibility of such perfidy. Hot words passed between us, and we parted,
                  never again to meet as friends. In the first flush of her indignation she wrote to
                  her brother an account of all that had occurred; she warned me she would do so.
                  'He loves you,' she said; 'this will be a fearful trial for him, but he must learn
                  to cast from his friendship one who has proven herself so utterly unworthy of
                  it.'
               "I knew the delicacy of Albert's perceptions of right, his stern sense of justice,
                  and felt that my conduct would in his eyes be intolerable. I would have written to
                  him, but what had I to urge in my own defence? I dared not think—solitude became
                  of all things the most to be dreaded by me, remorse embittered every thought of
                  the past, fear of the anguish to come clouded every hope of the future. As the
                  winter came on I gladly yielded to my mother's urgent wish that I should go into
                  society, and we took for the season a furnished house in the city.
               "My début there was a triumph; I was surrounded
                  at once by a throng of admirers. The delicate incense of their flatteries
                  intoxicated me; I had tasted once the happiness of power, and craved again to
                  rule. No word had come to me from Albert, so I steeled my heart bitterly against
                  him, and contented myself with enacting queen to the obedient subjects who bowed
                  before me.
               "Annie too had come to the city, but we seldom met, and when we did she was
                  reserved and cold. Clarence I never saw, never but once—" She paused, and her
                  features worked convulsively. "I ruined him," she said; "he had not the moral
                  strength to bear up against his disappointment, and sought in dissipation
                  forgetfulness of it. His downward course was rapid. The very elements that would
                  have lent the brightest lustre to his life, became the most powerful engines for
                  its destruction.
               "I said I met him once. The beauty of the night had tempted me to walk instead of
                  riding as usual to the opera, and I recognised him standing in a half-intoxicated
                  state, with bloodshot eyes and haggard face, among a noisy group of young men
                  clustered around the door of a gaming-house. The light flashed suddenly upon me as
                  I passed, and he started back with a cry almost of fear, cursing me for a
                  beautiful fiend.
               "His story is a brief one; he sank lower and lower, until, hoping thus to break
                  the evil associations that surrounded him, willing too, perhaps, to free
                  themselves from the disgrace of his presence, his family urged that he should go
                  to Europe. It was in vain; he could not escape from the torturing memories that
                  ever goaded him on to fresh excesses. In a small town in Germany he at last
                  attempted to put an end to the existence which was now to him only a misery, The
                  wound, self-inflicted, was mortal, though not immediate in its consequences.
                  Albert, as an American, was summoned to the beside of a dying countryman. What was
                  his horror and anguish to recognise in the writhing sufferer the friend of his
                  boyhood, his light-hearted young cousin! From his lips he heard Annie's story of
                  my guilt corroborated, heard many things besides which the tenderness of her
                  woman's heart had induced her to withhold. He died at last in wild delirium,
                     Grace, calling down vengeance on my
                  head, cursing me as his destroyer—the destroyer of both his body and his
                  soul."
               She paused again, shuddering, and bowed her head upon her hands. "Oh those curses,
                  those curses! they hang on me so heavily! I do not dare to die when I remember I
                  must meet him face to face before God's throne. Only that thought in my dark days
                  had power to restrain my hand from seeking my own life. Only that thought teaches
                  me now to shrink from the eternity to which I am hastening so fast. And yet God is
                  merciful; He has promised pardon to the penitent; and there are times of peace
                  when those blessed words seem spoken to my heart, 'Thy sins are forgiven
                  thee.'
               "Shortly afterwards I received a foreign paper directed to me in Albert's
                  handwriting, in which there was a marked paragraph mentioning the suicide of a
                  young American, Clarence Weir, with some shrewd surmises as to its probable
                  causes. There was no word or line of explanation, only accompanying it a small
                  package, from which as I opened it fell the miniature that Albert had worn next
                  his heart, and the long curl that I had severed from my forehead on the morning of
                  his departure. Had the knowledge of Clarence's death reached me in any other way,
                  the fearful lesson might not have been lost upon me; but the consciousness that my
                  lover had cast me off forever, hardened me into stone. The miserable end of the
                  unhappy boy, who had dared aspire to Albert's place within my heart, seemed to my
                  disordered mind but a light punishment for his presumption. I hated him scarcely
                  less than Annie, with a fierce, bitter hatred, for having divided from me a love
                  that I valued more than life; and when I heard that Annie too was dead—that
                  declining for many months, the frail thread of her life had been severed by the
                  awful intelligence that reached her, and learned as a fact, what I had long
                  suspected, that she had clung with more than cousinly interest to the misguided
                  one whose happiness I had blasted—there was more of triumph than pity in the
                  thought that she had suffered not less than I.
               "That next season I went to the White Sulphur Springs. Old habitués of the place
                  still remember the beautiful woman with whom none dared dispute the pre-eminence,
                  before whose claims all others were forgotten, who exacted homage as her right,
                  ruling as an empress the little world which hitherto had been a republic, divided
                  among a multitude of belles. I verily believe a demon possessed me that summer. I
                  was so utterly wretched I did not choose that any should be happy. I will teach
                  them to suffer, I cried fiercely to myself, to suffer as I am suffering. And so I
                  played with hearts, casting them from me carelessly when I wearied of them, or
                  they had lost their power to please. I needed no incentive, but one was given me
                  that rendered me utterly reckless. Among the guests was one whom I never saw in
                  the daylight, but who, wrapped in a heavy cloak with his hat drawn over his eyes,
                  stood every night in a position that commanded the ballroom, who lingered near me
                  that he might catch my words, who watched me with cautious eagerness. Time had
                  wrought many changes, but no disguise could long conceal Albert Greyson from me. I
                  knew why he had come, how with a lingering hope that he had judged me too harshly,
                  he sought to read some traces of womanliness still left in me. I had never blamed
                  him for casting my love from him. I would have scorned him had he been willing to
                  hold me to his heart, polluted as I was; but there arose a wild desire to show him
                  what estimate others placed on what he held so valueless—a desire too to teach him
                  he possessed no longer power over me, to force him to believe that I accepted not
                  less willingly than himself the release from my past vow. I said to myself I must
                  support my woman's pride: I did not think how low pride must first sink when it
                  can sustain itself only by duplicity.
               "I learned at last that the mysterious stranger, upon whom the gentlemen of my
                  party passed many jesting comments, was about to leave us, to leave without one
                  word to me. I determined this should not be, and on the last evening of his stay,
                  passed to his side as he stood after tea in a retired part of the portico, resting
                  his head upon his hand. 'You leave us in the morning, I believe, Mr. Greyson,' I
                  said, in a courteous, unfaltering tone; 'may I trouble you to carry a small package to the city
                  for me? Its safe delivery is a matter of some importance. I trust,' I added, 'that
                  though you seem entirely to have ignored our former friendly relations, a
                  remembrance of them will induce you to pardon the liberty I have taken in thus
                  accosting you.'
               "He was much agitated as he raised his white face to mine. 'Marion!'
                  he said. Then, as he met my eye with its cold, steely expression, he cried
                  bitterly: 'Ah, no! this is not Marion. Great heavens! how
                     fearfully that face has changed!'
               "My heart rebelled fiercely against his half-unconscious emphasis. 'You left me a
                  child,' I said; 'you return to find me a woman. Am I to blame for this? Everything
                  has changed; why should I be the same?'
               "I turned from him indifferently, as though I would have left him; but he detained
                  me.
               "'Stay,' he said, 'I have a message for you—a message from one who is now in
                  eternity. I had intended to send it to you by letter, but it may be as well for me
                  to deliver it here.' And then he told me, Grace, all that you have already learned
                  of the last moments of Clarence Weir—with much beside which I will not pain your
                  gentle heart by repeating. His voice trembled with feeling as he spoke—breaking
                  down utterly at times; whilst I listened with a proud, unmoved, resolute
                  composure, as though my heart had been in truth a stone. The sudden crash of the
                  music broke in upon his narrative, announcing the commencement of the usual
                  evening ball, and I saw that Albert shuddered as the lively measure, so out of
                  unison with his sad history, fell upon his ear.
               "One of my latest conquests, who had been lingering near for some time with
                  evident impatience, now eagerly grasped this excuse for coming up to us, to claim
                  the first dance of the evening that I had promised him.
               "'Really,' I replied in the light, mocking tone that had become habitual with me,
                  'Mr. Greyson has been telling me a tale so pathetic that I fear he will believe me
                  devoid of all feeling if I enter so immediately into the follies of life.'
               "The young fellow laughed, and protested he would not give up the privilege he had
                  had such difficulty in obtaining.
               "'You see he will not release me, Mr. Greyson,' I said in the same tone; 'he has
                  not sufficient magnanimity to save my character with you, so I suppose I shall
                  have to imagine the rest of your story.'
               "I placed my hand upon the offered arm and glided from his side; then, as with a
                  sudden thought, paused and returned.
               "'I shall not see you again probably, as you leave early in the morning, so I must
                  bid you good-bye now.' I held out my hand as I spoke, but he folded his arms
                  across his breast and looked sternly into my eyes. I bore even that
                  look unflinchingly; and as we passed up the long portico, a quick sarcasm to my
                  attendant sent his gay laugh ringing back upon Albert's ear.
               "That night the disguise was thrown aside, and Mr. Greyson stood just within the
                  threshold of the ball-room, his white face turned ever towards me, drinking in, so
                  to speak, every gay word, every light laugh of mine, as though each fresh evidence
                  of my heartlessness and unworthiness would be of use to him in aiding him to crush
                  from his heart any lingering tenderness that might link itself with memories of
                  me.
               "It is scarcely necessary for me to enter into a detailed account of the next few
                  years. Dark and miserable ones they were to me, although the world laid its most
                  precious gifts at my feet. It had become the fashion to admire me; men ran wild
                  after my beauty, and my own sex yielded almost as readily to its fascinating
                  power. My home was one of the gayest in the city, and as only those were admitted
                  who possessed some claim to intelligence or agreeability, my acquaintance became
                  an honor eagerly sought for, as its possession implied acknowledged merit. Those
                  years brought me many lessons. My first bitter hatred against those around me
                  paled into contempt. We find very much what we seek for in this life: I sought,
                  and therefore found, only base, petty motives in those that surrounded me. I
                  despised them even more perhaps that they looked up to me—to me who
                  knew myself so utterly unworthy. In my many suitors I saw only my dupes, or those who had dishonored themselves by
                  a willingness to bind to their own, a life so contaminated by worldliness as mine.
                  Gradually however a change was wrought in me. The testimony of lives whose
                  unswerving truthfulness taught me reverence, opened my eyes to my error. I saw
                  that it was the falsity of my own heart that had clothed all other hearts with
                  falsehood. The credulity of those whom I had led, assumed another attitude when it
                  took the name of faith. They had loved in me what they had
                     imagined in me. They were the more worthy of honor that they had
                  been incapable of comprehending the duplicity that had misled them. It is hard to
                  recognise the truth when the intellect instead of the heart is first convinced of
                  it. In my case the contest was a long one. You were with me, Grace, whilst I was
                  struggling against conviction; your unconscious influence did more than all else
                  beside to render me powerless in that struggle. Faith came at last, and with faith
                  peace.
               "For many months after the interview I have mentioned, Albert Greyson avoided me
                  with scrupulous care; but the time came when he no longer shrank from my presence,
                  but mingled nightly in the assemblies where he knew I would be found, greeting me
                  when we were thrown together neither with restraint nor reserve, but with the
                  careless indifference of an ordinary acquaintance. Then I knew in very truth that
                  all was over, that I was no more to him than any other heartless woman whose
                  course he disapproved, that I had lost all power to pain him. And yet I knew,
                  though the dream had faded utterly, it had left his heart barren and dark; that as
                  a single man he could never be a happy one; that his life, with its capabilities
                  for loving thrown back constantly upon itself, must at last become embittered and
                  faithless. And as I watched him year by year, and saw that he grew colder and
                  sterner, that his judgment of those around him was less lenient, and his sarcasm
                  more ready, with the remorse for my past sin was mingled the fearful thought that
                  through it, he too, as well as my first unhappy victim, might lose not only this
                  life, but life eternal.
               "Had Albert willed it now I would not have been his wife, for I recognised too
                  well that my love could bring him only misery; but when during my summer sojourn
                  at —— I met with one as pure and true as he had once believed me, I conceived a
                  plan by which I thought at last I might secure the happiness of the heart that I
                  had wronged so terribly. You tremble, darling. Do you understand now, little
                  Grace, how you have aided me? how you have plucked the sharpest sorrow from my
                  life, by giving it the blessed assurance that light shone again upon the soul that
                  the shadow of my sin had darkened?
               "I watched you carefully, studied you thoroughly; examined your tastes, your
                  capabilities: the result was what I had hoped. In knowing you he could not fail to
                  love you. Your destinies were divided; you might never meet unless I willed it so.
                  There was a happiness you can scarcely estimate, to me in that thought. I brought
                  you to the city, for I felt that your gentle, loving life cast on the background
                  of one so false and dark as mine, could not fail to move him. My experiment was a
                  success from the first. His eager look of interest as his eye first rested on your
                  modest, downcast face, assured me I need have no fear. And yet, Grace, I was only
                  human, and at times I had to struggle fiercely with myself. Though his love was
                  mine no longer, it was a bitter trial to know that it was transferred to another;
                  that the place that I once had filled would soon be filled again, and he would
                  feel no want. Had I loved you less, darling—had I not realised before many weeks
                  had passed that your happiness too was at stake—strength might have failed me—I do
                  not know. As it was, loving you as I did, only less than him, warring with that
                  first feeling, an awful fear took possession of me lest I had sacrificed your
                  fresh young life to no purpose. Was the old love dead in very truth
                  within his heart? Were there no clinging memories that might have power to bind
                  him to the past? no regret still lingering for what might have been? Had I not
                  after all only wronged you, and brought an additional misery upon his life and my
                  own?
               "You remember, Grace, your loving avowal of faith in me and my affection for you,
                  on that night, soon after your arrival in the city, when I warned you not to trust me. The
                  generous confidence of your innocent young heart touched me deeply, and that
                  moment I formed inly the determination that actuated my whole course of conduct
                  through the winter. I would uproot any remnant of interest that might still
                  linger; I would teach him to despise me even more thoroughly than I deserved; he
                  should learn no longer to regret the past, but to thank God for having delivered
                  him from the temptation of my love. I know now that I might have spared myself
                  this suffering, that my influence over him perished long before in the first
                  realisation of my unworthiness; but then, as I courted his contempt—advancing as
                  my own, sentiments that even in my darkest hours I would scarcely have cared to
                  endorse, and saw his look of scorn, turning from me, lighten into one of loving
                  tenderness as it lingered on your sweet face, as with earnest warmth you sought to
                  controvert my sophistical theories—mingling with my pain there was a triumphant
                  exultation in knowing that again I held his happiness in my hand; that whilst he
                  despised me I was serving him; that the joy that sent a new life through his heart
                  was a gift to him from me.
               
               "You can understand now, dear friend, many things that may have puzzled you in the
                  past—the long silence I imposed upon you, my unwillingness to answer your many
                  letters. I sought to starve my love out by refusing it all food. But it would not
                  die; it will not die, Grace. Fervid and strong as in the hour I vowed
                  that vow of constancy to heaven, it still rules my life. I had thought that the
                  cold hand laid upon my heart had deadened its fires, that at last I might come to
                  you in safety. But earth is becoming far too sweet to me; I must leave you and at
                  once. You will not seek to change my determination when you remember that thus I
                  will be spared the pain of a second parting—a renewal of the anguish I passed
                  through an hour ago in gazing into his face for the last time.
               "Do not weep, darling," she continued, for I was sobbing violently. "And, oh
                  Grace,"—and her voice broke down utterly—"will you not promise me that when I have
                  passed away from earth, you will tell him all that I have said to you to-night?
                  Tell him that the vow I vowed in the first hour of our early love was unbroken to
                  the last; that my life, false to the world, false to myself, false to heaven, was
                  ever true to him. Will you not bid him think when he is most happy, that from me
                  after all has flowed the happiness of his life? That I have been instrumental in
                  procuring him the blessing with which my love could never have crowned it—seeking
                  thus not to expiate, but in some measure to atone for my crime? Will you not teach
                  him to think somewhat more leniently of her who, though she has sinned deeply, has
                  suffered scarcely less severely? Am I asking too much, little wife? Surely you to
                  whom the whole of that great love is granted, will spare me the small portion of
                  it comprised in the one word—pardon."
               I was deeply moved, and my tears fell silently, as laying my hand in hers I gave
                  solemnly the required pledge. Then that eager, restless look within her eyes faded
                  into one of peace, and rising, she passed with me into the nursery where my
                  children slept.
               "Grace," she said, as she gazed with loving tenderness upon the placid faces of
                  the innocent sleepers, "your little girls will not forget the strange, pale lady
                  who made for a time one in their home. In days to come, when you may find it
                  needful to repeat to them the sad history of my life, that memory may aid you in
                  impressing the moral you would draw from it. Guard them carefully from the shoals
                  on which my life has wrecked itself. Teach them that loss of faith in man is soon
                  followed by loss of faith God: 
                     
                        'That worldly wise
                        Is but half-witted at its highest praise.'
                     
                   That life is a very simple thing, and love a very pure one; and that the
                  woman who learns to dissimulate, to control her impulses, to subdue the
                  naturalness of her life, will find that she has much to unlearn before she can
                  live or love truly."
               She stood for a long time silently by the side of the little beds, lingering
                  longest beside that which held my baby, my boy, who had his father's brow and
                  eyes. As her tears fell upon his face, the white lids unclosed and the tiny hand
                  sought to raise itself caressingly to
                  her face, but the slumber was but half broken and the round arm fell again
                  powerless to his side. She looked at me wistfully, and understanding the mute
                  appeal, I raised his light weight in my arms, and carrying him to her chamber,
                  laid him upon her bed. She smiled gratefully, then clasped me in a long, silent
                  embrace to her heart. After I had left the room, as I turned for one last look I
                  saw that she had cast herself upon her knees beside the bed on which my baby
                  slept.
               It was summer-time when Marion left us. In the early autumn, as I sat one evening
                  alone in the twilight, a package was brought to me. I tore it open with a feeling
                  of vague terror. It contained only a miniature and a long dark tress of hair, but
                  there was no need for me to break the black seal of the accompanying letter,
                  directed to me in an unfamiliar hand, to assure me that my fears were too well
                  founded.
               With a trembling step I passed into the library, where I knew I would find my
                  husband. The lights were already lighted there, and with his head resting upon his
                  hand he bent over a book, in the study of which he was absorbed. So absorbed was
                  he that he did not hear my step, and laying one hand lightly on his shoulder to
                  call his attention, with the other I placed on the table before him the long raven
                  curl and the exquisite image of that beautiful face. He started and his cheek
                  paled as he gazed into the eyes that smiled up at him with the same look of
                  innocent, trusting love that they had hidden in their depths long years before,
                  then he raised his own with a look of grave, surprised inquiry to my tearful
                  face.
               "She is dead, Albert," I said, "Marion is dead."
               His face grew still more grave, and he folded his hands solemnly. "May God be
                  merciful then," he said, "to that poor, sinning soul."
               "He will," I answered; "long before this she has claimed His blessed
                  promise of 'pardon to the penitent.'" And then, with my head resting on my
                  husband's breast, I told him all that I have written here—not in these cold,
                  lifeless words, but in those that rose at the moment to my lip, to which depth of
                  feeling lent its own pathos. His tears mingled with mine before the close of my
                  sad narrative, and when at last I paused, he raised the little miniature from the
                  table and pressed it reverently to his lips with a murmured prayer for
                  forgiveness.
               And so Marion sleeps, and still the great world rolls on with little thought of
                  her who was once one of its brightest ornaments. Her resting-place, as was her
                  wish, is unmarked by stone or tablet; but in the far West there is a home, the
                  happiness of which is to her memory an everlasting monument. She, too, I trust,
                  has found a home, in which the wild, passionate longings of her soul are hushed
                  into an eternal rest. Poor Marion! she was in very truth her own worst enemy. Even
                  I, who love her so, dare not pass judgment on that life, with its misused powers,
                  its wasted energies; but God is more merciful than man. May its sad history raise
                  a warning voice to all who seek to war against Him with the talents He has granted
                  them to carve His name upon the world's sceptical heart; and may they learn from
                  it the lesson that experience else must teach them, that— 
                     
                        "We thwart the Deity; and 'tis decreed,
                        Who thwarts His will, shall contradict their own."
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
               C. G.; OR, THE TALE OF A TRUNK.
               THERE it stood, open at last—displaying to the light of day delicate laces, softly
                  tinted ribbons, little slippers, gauzy undersleeves—in short, all the thousand and
                  one essentials of a young lady's toilet. And there, before it, with a scowl of
                  unmistakable displeasure on his handsome face, stood Frank Hamilton, gazing in a
                  kind of maze at the unexpected metamorphosis of his sober colored cravats and
                  spotless linens. Taking into consideration that our hero had returned from a long
                  journey only a few hours before, and that one of these had been spent in hammering
                  at the patent lock "that had somehow gotten out of order on the way," and that he
                  was a very human man indeed—the vigorous kick which sent the
                  ponderous lid crushing down on all the loves of things for which some charming
                  little beauty was doubtless crying her eyes out, with the accompanying "confound
                  the trumpery!" was just what might have been expected from him.
               How could the mistake have been made? That mattered very little, as made it was.
                  How was it to be rectified? Ah! there was the question. At what possible stage of
                  his journey could the exchange have taken place, that put the proprietress of all
                  those ribbons and laces in possession of the more dignified habiliments, which,
                  without doubt, would be quite as unsatisfying to her womanly mind as her pretty
                  little arrangements were to his stronger one.
               All these questions he slowly debated as, after his first wrath had cooled, he
                  meditatively walked around the obnoxious trunk—arriving at last at the conclusion
                  that people always do when they have not the shred of a fact to start from,
                  namely, that he knew nothing at all about it.
               After all, the mistake was a very natural one; it was just the height, the breath,
                  the color of the trunk that he had lost, and with the exception that C. G. in
                  small white letters on the side had taken the place of F. H., it was the very
                  duplicate of his own. As the similarity was not kept up in the interior
                  arrangements, however, and our friend had no idea of arraying himself in the
                  rainbow hues that his eye had taken in in its indignant sweep over the vanities of
                  life, and as there is little pleasure in being unamiable when there is nobody near
                  to feel its effects—without trusting himself with another look at the offending
                  article, he caught up his hat from the floor, where he had thrown it when he
                  commenced his attack on the obstinate lock, and with a grim thanksgiving that the
                  young lady had left him that at least, he started off to mend matters
                  as well as he could by a visit to his tailor.
               Several days passed, and as the visit proved efficacious in relieving the first
                  pressure of annoyance, it never occurred to him that perhaps the loss of the other
                  sufferer was less easily remedied. It was not until one rainy night about a week
                  afterwards, when having no engagement on hand, he concluded to spend a quiet
                  evening at home, he remembered that, though he had telegraphed to the different
                  stations for the recovery of his own missing property, as yet he had taken no
                  measures to restore the possessions of his comrade in distress to their proper
                  owner.
               Perhaps there was a little vindictive pleasure in the thought that the annoyance
                  had been mutual, and yet the carelessness had possibly, nay most probably, been
                  his own. Perhaps the thought of the indignant amazement of the young girl as the
                  raised lid of his trunk had displayed its treasures to her bewildered eyes, struck
                  him ludicrously, for he laughed a little low laugh under his breath as he arranged
                  the shade so that it should cast the light upon his work.
               
               As he stands there, with one hand resting on the lid, the other fitting the key
                  into the lock, it may be as well to take a closer view of the young gentleman whom
                  we have so unceremoniously, and perhaps unfairly, introduced to you in a
                  passion.
               Deprived of his parents before he knew that he possessed them, Frank Hamilton had
                  grown up as other wealthy and handsome boys grow up in large cities, petted by
                  ladies older than himself, flattered and worshipped by those of his own age,
                  spoiled by his teachers and schoolmates, with whom the manly, generous boy was a
                  universal favorite, until there seemed every prospect of his deteriorating into
                  one of those humored darlings of society so insufferably disagreeable to all
                  sensible people. Indeed, at eighteen the boy could manage a flirtation, smoke as
                  many cigars, drink as many glasses of wine, and had quite as high an opinion of
                  himself as any one of his associates, which is saying not a little.
               As he grew older, however, his really kind heart and strong head taught him that
                  he was throwing away a life the which, if he could not render useful, he could at
                  least preserve from being injurious to himself and others; taught him, too, that
                  in the world of men a good address and handsome face, unless supported by more
                  solid qualities, would advance him but very little. It took some time to unlearn
                  the lessons of a lifetime, but Frank Hamilton at thirty was a much humbler, and
                  doubtless a much better man, than the self-conceited little coxcomb of eighteen.
                  In mingling with the world he had felt his own deficiencies, and determined to
                  overcome them. Surfeited with his first draught of the cup of pleasure, he had
                  withdrawn himself from society, and resolved to enjoy himself in his own way. Not
                  that he was either a misanthrope or a cynic, for a pleasanter companion to pass a
                  leisure hour with could scarcely have been found, and few faces were more
                  cordially welcomed either in the club-room or the private parlors of his large
                  circle of friends; but he had the good taste to not unfrequently prefer a quiet
                  evening's reading in his own luxurious bachelor apartments, to the temptations of
                  a fashionable ball-room, where he would be called upon to whisper vapid nothings
                  to vapid nonentities in illusions and tarletons; or even to the more alluring
                  oyster-suppers, with their attendant headaches and blues the next day; from which
                  singularity arose the verdict of "a fine fellow, but a very odd one," which you
                  often heard coupled with his name.
               Of women he knew but little, and as that little was drawn from watering-place and
                  ball-room experiences, and strengthened by the life-like portrayal of an
                  occasional popular novel, it was not greatly to their advantage. Not but what in
                  the abstract he had a most profound respect for the sex, and no gentleman could be
                  more scrupulously punctilious in the most trivial observances of polite life; but
                  I am afraid that, gazing from the height of his bachelor superiority, he
                  considered them a very inferior portion of the creation, a kind of necessary evil,
                  or, at best, useful only so far as they served occasionally to dissipate gloomy
                  thoughts or while away an idle hour—in fact, his ideas on the subject were just
                  about as crude and unformed as those of most young men who have grown up without
                  sisters or a home.
               Having outlived the period when all women were angels, he revenged the wrongs
                  inflicted by faithless Julias and Adelaides during his chrysalis period, by
                  treating their successors in the field of bellehood with that indulgent courtesy
                  that men of mind are so apt to affect towards the young girls with whom they are
                  thrown, forcing them to swallow, ay, and gratify their appetite for conversation
                  with, that whipped cream that passes current in society, and with which, to be
                  sure, no fault can be found, except that it is very unsatisfying.
               And yet, perhaps, I do him injustice; he erred ignorantly rather than wilfully.
                  Packed away somewhere in his composition, so carefully that its possessor was
                  entirely unconscious of it, was no small amount of sentiment, that waited only for
                  the little golden key of affection to open its prison-house to flood his whole
                  life with beauty. Many an evening, as he sat alone in his silent room reading late
                  into the night, he would lay down his book with a sigh, and gazing wistfully at
                  the vacant chair opposite, wish that the room could be less silent,
                  dreaming, in vague bachelor fashion, of
                  the time that was to come when his life should have another aim than just the care
                  of self.
               But the trunk is open. And, now, if I have a lady reader, she will please to
                  shudder as she sees those great man's hands going through the delicate little
                  fineries in a way that would have given the owner decided palpitations, even had
                  she been too strong-minded for hysterics. With a contemptuous smile he travelled
                  all over the broad tray, with an occasional "pish!" or "pshaw!" as he shook out
                  some new evidence of womanly vanity, and the smile changed into a short derisive
                  laugh as his hand encountered a loose pile of papers labelled "My Journal." He
                  raised it to the light, examining it curiously, as though it had been some rare
                  literary curiosity. Nothing was discoverable but a clear, flowing, girlish
                  handwriting. He paused doubtfully. As yet he had obtained no clue by which he
                  might discover the rightful possessor of the trunk: would it not be well to glance
                  over the pages of this diary in order to gain a fuller address than the
                  unsatisfactory C. G. that ornamented the centre of the embroidered handkerchiefs?
                  I shall not offer any excuse for Frank Hamilton's conduct—of course it was
                  inexcusable—but as I am telling the facts as they did occur, not as
                  they ought to have occurred, I am not to be held accountable for this
                  or any other enormity he may commit before this narrative is ended; but I will say
                  for him, that I do believe when he threw himself into his easy-chair with that
                  young girl's journal in his hand, he had no intention of doing more than to glance
                  rapidly from leaf to leaf for any proper name that might occur, and that he had
                  fully persuaded himself, as we sometimes find it very easy to persuade ourselves
                  to do what we want to, that it was his duty to do this.
               He turned over the first pages carelessly, but a few lines attracting his
                  attention, he drew his breath a little hard, and bent his handsome brows more
                  attentively over the manuscript; nor did he change his attitude until his eye
                  having travelled slowly down line after line, the turning of the last page awoke
                  him from his temporary forgetfulness.
               There was a strange look in Frank Hamilton's eyes as he shaded them with his hand
                  for a few moments after that long, earnest perusal—a deep, misty light, that gave
                  a new expression to his face. He sat for a long time silent, his hand nervously
                  grasping those loose white papers. "It is so, then," he said at last, "that women
                  think when they are alone."
               Possibly the train of thoughts that followed was less pleasing, for his lip curled
                  again a little scornfully. "Yes," he said, "I have been a fool, a conceited fool!"
                  Then as he relapsed into silence the softened look came back again. "If my mother
                  had lived," he said at last softly, "ah, if she had lived I would have been a very
                  different man!" He rose and paced the floor, but in a few moments he stopped, and
                  the blood rushed hotly to his face. What had he done? He had taken advantage of an
                  accident to peer into the very depths of a young girl's heart; unconsciously to
                  her, he held in his hand the very motive-power of her life. Certainly there was no
                  reason why she should blush at that revealing. But should she ever learn the
                  truth?—"She would forgive me," he said humbly, and that misty light came again
                  into his eyes,—"she would forgive me, for she has done me good." Yes, you have
                  found me out, reader. You see by this time as plainly as I do, that the case was
                  pretty well over with our bachelor friend. And why, in this age of romance, when
                  heroes are constantly falling in love at first sight with beautiful faces, without
                  pausing to inquire whether their owners are not as soulless as Undine, may not my
                  hero, if only for novelty's sake, fall in love with the beautiful soul that has
                  never a face to show itself through, to which this night has introduced him?
               After all there was nothing very extraordinary in that journal. It is true it was
                  not the enumeration of flirtations, beaux and conquests that he had expected, but
                  a very simple, girlish little record of thoughts and feelings, just such a one as
                  your sister or your cousin—or you yourself, reader, for aught I know—may keep; but
                  Frank Hamilton, as I said above, knew but little of women, and he felt that this
                  night had opened to him a new and very beautiful study. Those few words: "It is
                  so, then, that women think when they are alone," were the virtual recantation of
                  the creed of a lifetime.
               
               Many faults he had certainly, but that of obstinacy was not included among them;
                  and once convinced that he had erred in judgment, he had sufficient generosity not
                  only to acknowledge the error, but warmly to espouse the cause that he had wronged
                  by doubt. Thus having stepped behind the conventional veil of ordinary life, that
                  binds in so narrowly a young girl's thoughts and feelings—having gazed into the
                  unsullied depths of a pure, untainted soul—he was willing to accept it, not as the
                  exception to, but as the type of that womanhood at which he had so ignorantly and
                  arrogantly scoffed.
               He found in those white pages no marks of decided genius, but the outpourings of a
                  frank, fresh, true young life, that, secure of the silence of its confidant, gave
                  uncontrolled vent to its natural vivacity. Of her outer life he could judge but
                  little, as there were few incidents recorded, and those only such as bore upon
                  some inward train of thought. There was now a glowing, heart-felt description of
                  the beautiful scenery through which she had passed in her late journey to Niagara,
                  then some extracts from conversations that had interested her, or some pithy
                  little sentence, pervaded by a quiet sense of humor that was irresistible, or a
                  comical portrayal of character that only the sketcher's native kindness of heart
                  preserved from being satirical. Indeed there was a shrewd appreciation of human
                  nature somewhat surprising in a young girl, and yet the foibles were unveiled
                  neither bitterly nor angrily, but with a pitying tenderness, that would seem to
                  make of those foibles only the background upon which the nobler traits of
                  character might be thrown. There were joyous, careless entries when the writer
                  would seem to write for the very pleasure of saying pleasant things, and graver
                  pages when the whole woman's soul would outpour itself in passionate longings and
                  aspirations; and now and then some incidental train of reasoning that evinced no
                  little strength of thought, united with an appreciative love of the true and
                  beautiful that indicated a sensitive and refined nature.
               There breathed in every line a firm, unwavering faith in the preponderance of good
                  over evil in the world; nor did that faith seem to spring from the credulous
                  trustfulness of a young heart that had never been deceived, but from the deep
                  convictions of the woman, who, feeling her own truth and sincerity, dared not deny
                  to others that which she herself possessed; and over all was thrown the mantle of
                  another faith—a faith so humble, yet so perfect, holy and childlike, that it was
                  little wonder Frank Hamilton's eyes were dim, and that from the silent grave of
                  the past came gliding the thought of the young mother he had never known.
                  Thoughtfully he laid down the diary, and again approached the trunk. Before, he
                  had examined it because he ought to know; now, because he
                     must know who its possessor was. It was amusing to note the change
                  that had come over him; very reverently did he handle those articles that
                     her hand had been the last to touch. It was astonishing too to see
                  how acute his perceptions had grown; he saw a thousand little corroborative
                  evidences of refinement and taste in the arrangement and disposal of each article.
                  A tiny pair of black satin slippers first engrossed his attention. Such slippers,
                  he confidently averred to himself, had never been seen before; and let me tell
                  you, reader, our hero was an authority on that subject, for he had made them an
                  especial branch of study during that earlier period of which we have before
                  spoken.
               Then a half-worn glove met his eye—he raised it to his lips and breathed softly
                  into it, and there it lay like a snowflake on his broad palm, a perfect model of
                  the prettiest little hand in the world. He sighed unconsciously as it shrivelled
                  into a mere glove again beneath his touch. I wonder what he did with it—can you
                  guess? It certainly did not go back into the trunk. Then he raised a small
                  hand-glass from amidst its bed of ribands. Why could not the faithless mirror have
                  retained the impress of the sweet face that had last looked into it?—for sweet he
                  felt that face must be, whatever its form or feature; and with that thought he
                  vowed internally that were she ugly as she ought to be beautiful—ay, were she even
                  red-haired and cross-eyed—still would he seek her out, giving her honor always as
                  the noblest, truest heart that the world had ever known. And here it may be as
                  well to remark that I very much doubt
                  whether he would have done any such thing; such unexampled self-devotion is too
                  much to expect from any hero. Whilst separated by distance and circumstances, it
                  was all very well to swear fealty to his unknown goddess; but doubtless, however
                  he might theorise, Frank Hamilton would have found it quite as difficult as many a
                  wiser brother has, to see heaven in the eyes of an ugly woman.
               A small pearl-handled brush next drew his attention. As he examined the pretty
                  plaything he caught sight of a long, waving thread of golden hair glistening in
                  the gaslight. Very tenderly he unwound it. No, she was not red-haired; it was the
                  very exquisite pale golden hue that he had always given to his dreamwife, that
                  most impossible of creations, who floats vaguely through a bachelor's
                  imagination—that being who is beautiful as an houri, yet unconscious as an angel;
                  who is as spirited as Xanthippe, and yet as amiable as Griselda; who, in fact, is
                  perfection, and yet is to look up with the most reverent humility to his own very
                  imperfect and unworthy self, in days that are to come.
               With the utmost care he wound the fine glistening thread on the tip of his
                  forefinger, until it formed a soft little golden circlet. This he deposited very
                  carefully in the case of his watch, and returned again to his work.
               There was little more to be found—a small Testament, a few odd volumes of
                  poetry—Tennyson, Longfellow, Mrs. Browning—a book of extracts. Here he paused. It
                  told the same tale as the diary. Wherever he had seen that book of extracts he
                  thought he would have known it for hers who had written the journal; from it
                  breathed the same spirit of purity and refinement. The search was almost ended,
                  for, however unwillingly, our hero was forced to acknowledge that the laces and
                  gauzes and collars and ribands looked very much like those worn by his ordinary
                  lady acquaintances. No, there was another book that had escaped his notice—a
                  little novelette, such as young girls are very apt to pass away the hours of a
                  warm day with in travelling. Ah! there was a name at last—not written once, but
                  half a dozen times over the cover, as though an idle hand had held the pen. The
                  initials were the same, but the handwriting was a different one. Was it her name?
                  Well, and if it were, how much wiser was he? Clara Gray would be scarcely more
                  easily found in actual life than C. G.
               There was nothing further to aid him in the discovery of the owner of his heart
                  and wardrobe, save in a rosewood box of trinkets an exquisite ring, curiously set
                  with sapphires and diamonds, bearing the initials C. F., which after all was
                  nothing, as it was of antique workmanship and evidently a family piece. The
                  examination of the tray ended, he lifted it from the trunk (which was one of those
                  commodious travelling arrangements for the transportation of flounced dresses and
                  the lighter toilet essentials), and with unskilful hand, to which however
                  reverence taught care, raised without unfolding dress after dress. Even here,
                  gazing with newly enlightened eyes, in the selection of those cool-looking
                  dresses, softly tinted and delicately edged, he found traces of the same refined
                  taste. One of a subdued pearl color, of a soft home-like material, pleased him the
                  most. He drew it from among the others and held it up before him. No, she was not
                  so small, although the glove and slipper would have seemed to say so: had she
                  filled that dress her head might have rested on his shoulder. Did Frank Hamilton
                  think of that?
               Clumsily he locked the buttons into their respective buttonholes, and the little
                  taper waist looked quite natural. He placed it in that vacant chair at which he
                  had often gazed so wistfully, and when the footstool was brought and the slippers
                  placed upon it, and the folds nicely arranged, it seemed really life-like. This
                  accomplished, he threw himself again into his easy-chair and looked at it
                  musingly.
               What had he gained by his evening's work? He had learned that there was existing
                  somewhere a woman, golden-haired and pure-thoughted, who was to be to him
                  henceforward the ideal of all that is true and holy in life. He had learned, too,
                  a lesson of faith in the existence of truth in the world, at which he had
                  previously scoffed, accepting unhesitatingly as he did the testimony of that frank
                  young heart that had become unconsciously his teacher. If one heart beats thus
                  truly, other true hearts must be found,
                  he argued. Many thoughts were in his mind as he gazed meditatively at the
                  home-like figure opposite, picturing to himself the soft swell of the white
                  throat, the delicate tracery of the golden hair over the smooth brow, and the
                  deep, loving eyes that ought to have been there too.
               If other people had known what I have chanced to find out—how often during the
                  long winter evenings that followed, after the doors were carefully locked, that
                  same grey dress was drawn from its hiding-place and its folds arranged upon the
                  little chair, whilst Frank Hamilton sat opposite with his book or the
                     diary—I am afraid that young gentleman would at present have occupied a
                  cell in some lunatic asylum, instead of the pleasant dwelling where I spent so
                  delightful an evening with him last week. "I was so lonely," said the poor fellow
                  deprecatingly, when he told me the story; "and the dress looked so natural, that I
                  could almost imagine that she was there."
               One night, as he was amusing himself with another inspection of the trunk, he made
                  a most alarming discovery. Hidden under a little pile of collars he found a blue
                  velvet case, that, as he raised it, fell open in his hand, displaying the
                  miniature of a very handsome bearded face exquisitely painted.
               Had a thunderbolt fallen in the room, our hero's consternation could scarcely have
                  been greater. By what right came that miniature in the trunk of his
                  purposed bride? And in his first indignation he felt that he had been cruelly
                  wronged by the fair-haired lady of his dreams.
               How unreasonable he was! What claim had he upon this woman, whose identity had
                  been so strangely woven in with the thread of his own—this woman who before now
                  might be wedded to another? The thought was very bitter; but even in that moment
                  of desolation Frank Hamilton thanked God for the pure and holy influence that for
                  a time had overshadowed his life, awakening there thoughts that else had slept
                  forever.
               Perhaps, after all, the case might not be as bad as his fears foreboded. Certainly
                  he had noticed nothing in the little journal that betrayed that the heart which
                  spoke there was trammeled with an earthly love; yet this thought did not comfort
                  him much, for he felt assured that a nature like hers would keep that holy secret
                  hidden in her breast, as something too sacred to be breathed even when alone.
               There were, however, as he conned it jealously line by line, expressions that he
                  had before passed unregarded, which he now viewed suspiciously—various incidental
                  allusions to some "Fred" that now struck him very unpleasantly, such as "Poor
                  Fred," "My dear Fred," "My handsome Fred," and several accounts of rides and walks
                  of which he had been the companion.
               What did it all mean? Frank did not know. Oh, if he only had a woman's wit to help
                  him—women have such a knack of understanding such things! Handsome Fred indeed! He
                  glanced furiously at the innocent likeness that lay open before him on the table
                  where he had thrown it. There was certainly something familiar in that face. He
                  grasped it eagerly. "Fred!"—oh, yes, in spite of the alterations of a full beard
                  and some halfdozen years of life, it was unmistakably his old college chum, Fred
                  Grafton. Anywhere else in the world that frank, honest face would have afforded
                  him no little satisfaction; as it was, he looked at it very moodily. Well, if she
                  loved Fred Grafton—and who could help loving him that ever knew him?—all indeed
                  was over. Not that even Fred was worthy of her—what man that lived was
                     worthy of such a woman?
               "Anguish worketh inspiration," says a poet. It sent a happy thought this moment to
                  Frank Hamilton's brain. Paper and pens were soon forthcoming, and in a short time
                  a letter was indited to his long-lost friend, recalling college days, and
                  cordially inviting him to —— to renew old associations. Thus, at least, he said to
                  himself, I will learn who she is, and something of her.
               The result of the letter was, about six weeks afterwards, a knock at the door of
                  his room, as he sat one evening with the often-studied diary in his hand, striving
                  to extract some drops of comfort from its tantalising pages. Hastily thrusting his
                  treasure behind the cushion of his chair, he arose to receive the intruder; and so
                  was his mind occupied by the one thought, that it was scarcely a surprise to him to recognise in the
                  honest, cheery face the original of the miniature that had acted as a sedative to
                  all his sentimental dreams.
               Whatever were the contending feelings warring in Hamilton's breast, there was no
                  withstanding that hearty grasp and the sincere "Glad to see you! glad to see you,
                  old fellow!" and though his hand was at first extended rather coldly, there was
                  something in the familiar clasp that brought back thronging memories of the olden
                  times, and made the greeting as cordial as the one which met it.
               There is something in the tie of college fellowship that neither time nor all the
                  crowding events of after-life can do away with. However cold or hardened or
                  sceptical the heart may have grown, however the scorching breath of the world may
                  have seared its early freshness, the sight of a face, changed though it may be,
                  that we have known when life was pure and fresh and true to us, brings back
                  memories that shed the light of our early youth over the dark, cold pathway we may
                  be treading.
               It was surprising how soon the ice melted from around Frank Hamilton's heart in
                  that genial, friendly atmosphere, how the formality of manner and the little touch
                  of stiffness in his tone, that for the first few moments sat rather illy upon him,
                  wore away as he looked into the familiar, sunny face opposite.
               Reviving trains of thought, the awakening of memories that had slept for years,
                  sent the blood circulating more quickly through his veins, and gazing into his
                  handsome, animated face, you would have seen little trace of bitterness or anger
                  there.
               Indeed, to a close observer, the other occupant of the room, after the first
                  excitement of the meeting was over, seemed the most restless and preoccupied of
                  the two. Some secret, of no unpleasant nature, however, seemed to be resting on a
                  mind that, unaccustomed to secrecy of any kind, was chafing under a silence on
                  that one absorbing topic, a silence that it knew not how to break. His friend at
                  length, observing his abstraction, rallied him upon it, and then, with much
                  stammering and confusion, the important announcement was made. He was to be
                  married in a month to the very sweetest girl in the world, and his visit to the
                  city was no ordinary business trip, but to prepare for the great event. The ice
                  gathered again around Hamilton's heart. It was as though an iron hand had been
                  laid upon it, suddenly crushing out its life. "And her name?" he said, a little
                  hoarsely.
               "Clara Grey."
               The iron hand pressed very heavily; there was a suffocating feeling in his throat
                  and a sudden chilliness in his veins, as though the blood was stagnating there;
                  but fortunately, his friend was too busy with his own happiness to notice the
                  strange pallor and rigidity of his face. The way once opened, he needed but little
                  encouragement to pour out his whole heart to his confidant, just as he had been
                  accustomed to do in those old days when they were boys together. Unconscious of
                  the pain he was inflicting, delighted to find so patient and apparently interested
                  a listener, he dilated unwearyingly on the perfections of this woman, who of all
                  women was the most perfect, the most altogether lovely. He had met her, he said,
                  last summer at Niagara, whither he had accompanied his sister and aunt. Their
                  parties had joined and travelled together afterwards, and since then—ah! since
                  then much had happened!
               With a strange fascination Frank Hamilton listened to his friend's eloquent
                  eulogiums. 
                     "There is a pleasure that is born of pain."
                   He spoke of her; and even though each word widened the distance
                  between them, there was a happiness in hearing her praises sounded that even that
                  torture could not overbalance. And yet, how guilty he felt as he sat listening to
                  the frank, unreserved confidences of his friend! The diary behind the cushion of
                  his chair seemed to writhe in a most uncomfortable way from time to time. By what
                  right had he possessed himself of the contents of the heart that his unsuspicious
                  friend believed all his own? How would Grafton regard him should the truth be made
                  known? Poor Frank! there was a hard conflict in his heart that night.
               
               "Is she then very beautiful?" he asked at last, when Fred paused, having actually
                  talked himself out of breath.
               "Beautiful as an angel! with her golden curls, large blue eyes, dimpled mouth and
                  softly tinted cheeks; and if you could but hear her laugh!—she is always either
                  laughing or singing, and on my word I don't know which is sweetest. Ah, if you
                  could but see her for one moment!—and you shall," he said in a magnanimous tone,
                  suddenly thrusting his hand into his breast and drawing forth a miniature—"I would
                  show it to no one else, but she would not mind you."
               Poor Frank! again there came that sudden stopping of the blood, that suffocating
                  weight around the heart.
               "No, no," he said, pushing it from him—"I have wronged you enough already." Then
                  recalled to himself by the blank amazement depicted on Fred's face, with a forced
                  laugh he added somewhat incoherently, "No, no, old fellow, it won't do! it won't
                  do! Have you forgotten what a susceptible heart I used to have? Suppose I should
                  fall in love with your goddess: that would be a bad state of affairs, would it
                  not? I will come to your wedding, my boy, and see her first as she stands by your
                  side at the altar; then all will be safe, you know."
               Fortunately Fred's nature was anything but a suspicious one; he laughed
                  good-humoredly. "You are right," he said; "I did not think of that. No, you shall
                  not have a glimpse of her till she belongs to me, for ten chances to one you might
                  cut me out after all; you know you are so much cleverer than I."
               A few more careless words and the young men parted—the one to light slumbers and
                  pleasant dreams of a happy future, the other to wrestle with the weight of sorrow
                  which that night had fallen upon him; for now that all was over, Frank Hamilton
                  found that upon the frail foundation of a dream he had raised a solid fabric of
                  happiness—found how firmly rooted had been the faith, almost unconsciously
                  indulged, that in days that were to come he should not only find, but woo and win
                  the woman whose pure thoughts, since they had mingled with the current of his own,
                  had ennobled and spiritualised his life—found how each word, thought and action
                  had for the last six months been carried to the touchstone of that pure young
                  conscience, that spoke so forcibly and unwaveringly for the right. Had there been
                  no clue by which to discover her, he would have loved an ideal all his life, and
                  been a better man too for that love; but to see the shadowy outlines of his dream
                  shape themselves into a reality, and then resign that reality to another, was a
                  test almost too hard for just a human heart.
               And yet when the door closed on his friend there was no feeling of hardness or
                  bitterness in the young fellow's breast. With all his faults, our hero possessed
                  some noble traits of character, that in a time of trial stood forth prominently,
                  over-shadowing the less worthy attributes of his nature. In his grief there was no
                  mingling of anger or jealousy. The thought that his own cause was hopeless was, if
                  anything, softened to him by the knowledge that his successful rival was the
                  worthiest man he had ever known.
               With a hand that was a little unsteady he drew forth the journal from its
                  hiding-place. "Once more," he whispered to himself, "and then never again." As he
                  slowly perused those now familiar pages a change came over his face. Words and
                  sentences before disregarded spoke to him with a new meaning. The shadow deepened
                  as he read, until at last, when his study ended, all thought of self was merged in
                  the greater trouble that had come upon him.
               No, she did not, and never would love Fred Grafton as his wife ought to love him!
                  There were not many allusions to him, to be sure, in that little diary; but those
                  few sentences spoke volumes to perceptions sharpened by their own suffering.
               The indulgent tenderness of their tone was such as might become a sister or a
                  friend, who, recognising the foibles mingled with the sterling good qualities of a
                  sturdy, sincere nature, loved him in spite of, perhaps even for the
                  weaknesses she blamed, but never the young bride who was about to resign her
                  destiny to his guidance. She who spoke was the stronger of the two, and must feel
                  that superior strength. In the time that was to come, he who should be the supporter must lean upon her for
                  support; she it was who must guide, he who must follow. As Hamilton recalled the
                  image of his friend as he had stood before him a few moments since, saying with
                  tears in his honest eyes as he wrung his hand at parting, "I know I am not worthy
                  of her, Frank; but I love her—indeed I do!"—there was a feeling of
                  momentary anger against her who, receiving all the overflowing affection of that
                  kindly heart, could give so little in return. And yet was not she the most to be
                  pitied? As he placed side by side the ideal woman he had created and Fred Grafton
                  as he knew him, contrasting that deep, thoughtful nature, as yet unconscious of
                  its own capabilities, with the light, matter-of-fact, unsentimental character of
                  the other, he felt in truth that she was to be the sufferer.
               It had been said at college "that trouble would not stick to Fred Grafton." His
                  trusting, unsuspicious nature made him somewhat obtuse where his affections were
                  concerned. If his wife wore a smile he would see nothing amiss; and a smile she
                  would wear—that Frank knew her well enough to know, though her heart
                  were breaking under it. There was no blame to be attached to her. If she deceived
                  him in telling him she loved him, she deceived herself still more. Her fate was
                  that of many a young girl who has lived before, and will live after her—she had
                  mistaken this, the first interest that had brightened over her life, for the
                  dawning of that perfect day of love that comes in time to such hearts as hers,
                  arousing every capability of happiness, calling into being every beauty and charm
                  of which existence is capable. After a while she would awaken to the knowledge
                  that she did not love as she might have loved; to the knowledge too that this
                  sisterly regard, this friendly affection could never ripen into anything deeper or
                  stronger; that it was a feeling complete and perfect in itself; not the love that,
                  sown as a seed in the heart, each year strikes its roots more firmly around the
                  very centre of its life, until at last it cannot be torn away without destroying
                  that very life itself.
               Then would come bitter self-reproaches for failures in duty, self-hatred for
                  hypocrisy and ingratitude; and mingling with all, that sense of loneliness and
                  desolation felt only by those who live unknown and misunderstood by the friends
                  who love them most; and though Fred's simple goodness must not only call forth the
                  tenderness, but command the reverence of her true woman's heart; still his blunt
                  downrightness must jar constantly upon her finer and more delicate perceptions;
                  and the more hopeless was it that he would wound, and never know that he had
                  wounded; or if he saw that he had pained, would grieve sincerely for having done
                  so, but be utterly incapable of comprehending how the pain had been
                  inflicted. There was just the trouble after all; his practical nature could not
                  even understand the superiority of the one which had linked itself to his; and
                  though she would experience no lack of kindness or of love, she would find neither
                  companion nor friend in him whom she had vowed to "obey" and "serve."
               In all the concerns of daily life they would walk hand in hand together; but in
                  the higher happinesses of her nature, in the great joys of her life, he could have
                  no part. He would never feel his loss; but she—would not her soul
                  chafe constantly against the barrier that separated them?
               The future looked very dark to Frank Hamilton as he laid down the diary. Was he to
                  see this sacrifice consummated, and raise no warning voice? And yet what was to be
                  done? He might as well talk Hebrew to Fred as attempt to make him understand the
                  thoughts working in his mind; and all he could do would be to render him unhappy.
                  On the other hand, by what right should he say to the young girl who was in a
                  month to be a wife: "You do not love this man as you are capable of loving one
                  whose nature assimilates more nearly to the heights of your own"? And even were
                  there the possibility of opening her eyes to the danger that threatened her peace,
                  not even to save her could Frank bend himself to a deed so disloyal
                  to his friend. He felt that he was powerless to act, though three lives might be
                  sacrificed by that inaction.
               His determination once taken, he acted on it unflinchingly. All trace of the dream
                  that had altered every aim and purpose of his life must be removed. The journal was consigned finally to the trunk, each
                  delicate little article smoothed into its place, and then the key turned in the
                  lock with a sharp, sudden click, and its contents were to him as a sealed book
                  forever. The next day it was on its way to its proper owner, her direction having
                  on some careless pretext been extracted from her "fiancée." During the time that
                  his friend remained in the city, Hamilton was with him constantly, aiding him with
                  his advice, completing every possible arrangement for him, and, as though he would
                  cauterise the wound that would not heal, encouraging him constantly to converse on
                  that one topic which, as it was naturally the uppermost one with him, the young
                  fellow was only too glad to do, delighted to find an auditor always interested,
                  and indulgent to his wildest extravagances; and finally put the finishing touch to
                  his self-devotion by promising to be with him on that most important of all days,
                  and serve as his groomsman.
               Of the month that followed I shall not speak, of the constant conflicts, of the
                  vain effort to familiarise the thought that would not be familiarised. More than
                  once pen was taken in hand to retract his promise; but the knowledge that nothing
                  save the sight of her living and breathing the wife of another would eradicate the
                  dream from his breast, stayed his hand, and the appointed day saw him on his way,
                  with the aspect more of a mourner going to a funeral than a guest expected at a
                  merry-making.
               At the latest possible moment he drove to the handsome mansion of the bride's
                  father, from which they were to start for the church. Fred met him at the door
                  with a hilarious welcome, and a sharp rebuke for his tardiness, and led the way
                  into the brilliantly lighted room, where all save the bride were in waiting.
               "Here is the truant at last!" he cried; "I was afraid he was going to give us the
                  slip, and then poor Carrie must have worn the willow to-night. By the way, you do
                  not know each other, do you? Carrie—where are you, sister Carrie?—this is Frank
                  Hamilton of whom you have so often heard me speak."
               Frank bowed to a tall, pale girl with large grave eyes, who stood a little apart
                  from the company. There was no time for words on either side, for just then there
                  was a rustle on the stair, and in the doorway, with the long white veil floating
                  around her like a mist, he saw the lady of his dreams, the living Clara Grey.
                  Truly Fred was not far wrong when he had said she was beautiful as an angel. Who,
                  looking into that faultless face, with its perfect features, its gentle,
                  childlike, winning expression, and its roguish dimples that even the "awfulness"
                  of the occasion could not wholly eradicate, would not have pronounced it
                  perfection? And yet as Hamilton gazed, there came over him a vague feeling of
                  disappointment. It was not the face he had given to his ideal. Of
                     that type he had seen hundreds. There was the sweetness,
                  gentleness and loveliness; but the calm serenity, the quiet power that should have
                  been there, were wanting. This was a child: he had loved a woman.
               But the little procession was forming, and mechanically offering his arm to the
                  young girl who stood beside him, he led her to the carriage.
               The drive was a silent one; each occupied in thought, was perhaps unconscious of
                  the abstraction of the other. As they paused at the church door, and the full
                  light fell upon the face of his companion, Frank was startled from his reflections
                  by her extreme pallor; and as they waited in the vestibule for the forming of the
                  bridal train, she trembled so violently that the arm upon which she leant was a
                  needful support.
               "Do you fear the crowd?" he asked.
               "The crowd? Ah, no! I had not thought of that," she answered.
               A few moments more, and they stood before the altar—the soft, full swell of music
                  was hushed, and the solemn words rang through the church that were to bind two
                  lives together until eternity.
               Strange and inconsistent as it may seem, Hamilton's thoughts just then were
                  occupied, not with the rosy, frightened little bride, but with the pale, agitated
                  face by his side. He saw that agitation gradually subside as the service
                  proceeded, and a deep, earnest, holy look come into the large grey eyes that, when
                  the closing prayer was ended, and they
                  turned to leave the church, seemed to light the still, white face with a divine
                  radiance.
               The ride home was also a silent one; from no want of interest on Frank's part
                  certainly, but from a natural delicacy that forbade him from obtruding his
                  presence upon the young girl, to whom solitude just then, he felt, must be most
                  grateful. His thoughtfulness was not unappreciated. As he handed her from the
                  carriage, she said, in a voice that was still a little tremulous: "You have been
                  very kind to me, Mr. Hamilton; I thank you. It was hard to bear. Fred is all I
                  have in the world, you know."
               Somehow that evening our hero was not so intensely miserable as by right he should
                  have been. Much to his own astonishment, he found himself making some very
                  commonplace remarks to the bride without feeling the least embarrassment, and
                  congratulating Fred with a heartiness that ought to have been
                  genuine, if it was not. I am inclined to think that, secretly, he took some credit
                  to himself for his magnanimity; and yet I doubt after all if he deserved much
                  praise.
               Nor did he find his duties as groomsman—those distasteful duties—that he had
                  looked forward to with such dissatisfaction, nearly so onerous as he had
                  anticipated; indeed, if he had a complaint to make, it was that too many, among
                  the large company which now filled the room, seemed to find the lady who was that
                  night his peculiar charge, as attractive as he himself did; for, however it might
                  have seemed an hour before, Hamilton discovered that the young girl was neither
                  deaf nor dumb, in fact that she possessed conversational powers of no ordinary
                  nature. A little more serious than was her wont she may have been; but the
                  influences of the time and hour could not fail to awaken, in some measure, her
                  native sprightliness. He was charmed with the freshness and naïveté of her
                  remarks, so different from the usual stereotyped ballroom conversation; and with
                  the easy grace with which she moved among her brother's guests, fulfilling so
                  quietly, and yet effectually, her duties as hostess. In fact, although men are
                  proverbially fickle, I feel almost ashamed to tell how utterly Clara Grey, the
                  little journal, and his sufferings of the past few months, were forgotten by our
                  hero.
               Late in the evening he succeeded in disengaging Miss Grafton from her numerous
                  admirers, and bearing her off from the noise and confusion into the quiet of the
                  refreshment-room. As he returned to his companion with an ice, his attention was
                  attracted by the glove she had drawn from her hand, which hung carelessly from her
                  finger by its silken thread. There was something familiar in the little white
                  mould that sent a thrill through his frame, and when his eye travelled upward to
                  the hand from which it was suspended, and saw glowing there a ring curiously set
                  with diamonds and sapphires, the very duplicate of a ring he had once examined so
                  fruitlessly, he could scarcely form the words that at last came somewhat
                  incoherently.
               "Will you let me see that ring, Miss Grafton? There is something familiar, that is
                  to say I have associations—at least I have a reason for making so strange a
                  request."
               Poor Frank broke down completely under the look of quiet amazement fastened upon
                  his face.
               "It requires no apology," she said, readily extending her hand; "the setting is a
                  peculiar one. It was my mother's engagement-ring, and I have worn it ever since
                  her death. You should examine it more closely," she added with a smile, "but I
                  have made a little vow to myself that it shall never leave my hand again, as I
                  mislaid, or, I should say, lost it a short time ago, and it was only by the
                  strangest chance in the world that it was restored to me."
               Hamilton's eager, inquiring look spoke so pleadingly what his lips refused to
                  utter in words, that amused with the interest he manifested, she continued:
               "I see you are a marvel lover, Mr. Hamilton, and determined to attach some mystery
                  to this harmless ornament. The simple facts of the case are these: Returning last
                  summer from Niagara, we travelled, you must know, in company with my bright little
                  sister-in-law; and Fred, not being at that time in a very responsible state of
                  mind, was so obliging as to exchange my trunk for that of a gentleman, who,
                  doubtless, was not more pleased with his bargain that I was. A short time
                  afterwards I missed my ring, which I
                  suppose in packing must have fallen from my finger; for on examining my trunk,
                  which was most unexpectedly set down at Clara's door about a month ago, I found it
                  lying loosely in the tray. Are you satisfied now?" she added, looking up archly
                  into his face.
               "Ah—yes—no—excuse me—I am really ill—very ill—I must have air," and abruptly
                  leaving the half-frightened girl, he darted through the open door of the
                  conservatory out into the night. It seemed to him, as he said afterwards, that he
                  must have died had he stayed there, with those soft, innocent eyes reading his
                  thoughts.
               When alone, the chill night-air soon cooled his excitement, and his ideas became
                  somewhat more collected.
               Yes, he had been a blind fool; he saw it all now. Did not C. G. stand as well for
                  Carrie Grafton as for Clara Grey? And why should not his sister be at liberty to
                  carry a miniature of Fred in her trunk; and why should it be impossible that one
                  of Clara's little novelettes should find its way there also? And then the
                  journal?—the fond, sisterly mention of the supposed lover was now readily
                  accounted for. Why had he forgotten that Fred had a sister? He remembered that at
                  college he had often heard him speak of her; and also the crude attempts at
                  slippers and smoking-caps that used to find their way in mysterious-looking
                  parcels to Fred's room, and which he would persist in wearing, despite the
                  laughter of his companions, in order that he might please the loving little heart
                  that sent them by writing how useful they were. Oh yes!—of course he could now
                  think of fifty things that would have saved him any amount of trouble had he only
                  remembered them a month or so before.
               And now that the mystery was solved, how much better off was he? Human nature is a
                  strange thing, after all. For six months he had been striving to find the
                  possessor of that journal, and the first thing he had done upon finding her had
                  been to run away. He would have travelled miles for one glimpse of that face; yet
                  now, when not twenty yards lay between them, he stood hesitating and irresolute.
                  He felt keenly the ludicrous position in which he had placed himself. What would
                  she—what could she think of him? She must believe that he was either crazed or
                  intoxicated; no other construction could be put upon his unaccountable behavior.
                  The hot blood danced in his temples at the thought. What should he do?
               As he stood there, chafing with inward indignation, he thought he heard a laugh he
                  recognised. The magnetism was too powerful; love for once was stronger than
                  self-love. He must see her again at any sacrifice of his pride. He approached the
                  door.
               She was sitting in the alcove of a window, as he first caught sight of her, and
                  its heavy curtains formed a framework to the most beautiful picture, Frank
                  Hamilton thought, that he had ever gazed upon. She was engaged in animated
                  conversation, and a sweet smile played around her lips and lighted those deep,
                  wonderful eyes. Excitement had lent a rich glow to her cheek; and her face, in
                  which even a less refined taste could have noted few faults, was to him brilliant
                  in its speaking loveliness. Why had he waited for her explanation to recognise in
                  her his ideal woman?
               Just as he had dreamed her to be, did she now appear to him,—from the fair hair,
                  banded smoothly back, with the delicate white flowers drooping from it to the
                  curving neck, to the tiny satin slipper just discoverable beneath the folds of her
                  rich dress.
               She smiled a little mischievously as he approached her, with a very deprecatory
                  and ill-at-case expression upon his handsome face.
               "Are you better?" she asked.
               "Ah, yes," he answered; "it was a vertigo, I think—a slight vertigo. I—I—am
                  subject to them."
               And then, as his glance caught the dancing sparkle in her eye, his ludicrous
                  position struck him too forcibly to be withstood, and his embarrassment
                  disappeared in a hearty laugh, in which she joined with much zest. Sentimentalise
                  as you will, nothing unites hearts more readily than a good laugh. From that
                  moment they were friends.
               And now, reader, I have almost finished. Of course, you say, the lady was wooed
                  and won? Why, of course she was. Things happen in real life very much as they do
                  in novels, you know; and what author is
                  there with the least generosity in his composition that does not close with a
                  wedding? How she was wooed and won is another question.
                     That I cannot answer, as I have never been able to find out myself
                  how exactly the thing is done, else I should have written myself "Benedict"
                  instead of "Bachelor" long ago. All that I know is that, in one of the earliest of
                  the spring months, the two trunks that had exercised so important an influence
                  over their owners' destinies travelled very amicably, side by side, on a second
                  journey to Niagara, without the least disagreeable interference with each
                  other.
               
               "Carrie," said Frank Hamilton to his young wife, one night, as they sat alone in
                  the prettily furnished parlor that had taken the place of his bachelor lodgings.
                  It was a wild, tempestuous night without,—just such a night as that which, many
                  months before, he had devoted to the examination of the unwelcome trunk,—but
                  within it was very bright and comfortable. He had been looking at her for some
                  time, as she bent, quietly busy, over her fancy work. She was seated in the very
                  little chair at which he had often gazed so wistfully. The light from the shaded
                  lamp trembled over the soft golden hair and lit the delicately tinted cheek, then,
                  sinking further downward, buried itself in the graceful folds of the same grey
                  dress that had played the part of companion to Frank's solitary evenings, a year
                  ago. It was the very realisation of his dream. "Carrie, do you know I have a
                  secret that weighs very heavily upon my conscience? And I am half inclined to make
                  you my confessor,—that is to say, if you will promise to absolve me."
               With much solemnity the thimble was drawn from the busy little finger and placed
                  upon the table, the white hands folded gravely, and the pretty head inclined
                  towards him, with a look of mock seriousness that was very fascinating.
               "Ah, you think that I am jesting; but I am not. Frankly, then, I have never told
                  you of it, but I was very much in love about six months before I met you."
               The large eyes raised themselves with a bright, trustful smile to his face.
               "It is the truth, however sceptical you may look; and with that very dress you
                  have on. I vow by this token it is so," and he drew forth a crushed white glove
                  and threw it on the table.
               "Why, Frank, what are you doing with that old glove of mine?"
               "I have worn it for a year, Mrs. Hamilton."
               "Frank!"
               And then with that sweet face resting on his breast, he told her the tale that I
                  have told you, reader,—told how to his cold, selfish life her gentle words had
                  come like the breath of the early spring, calling into being thoughts and
                  aspirations that had lain seemingly chilled and lifeless in the winter of his
                  heart—told her of the good that she had done him, how she herself had rendered
                  that heart worthy to receive the priceless jewel of love that it now held,—told
                  her of his bitter struggle when the hopes that he had dared to cherish were all
                  suddenly swept away,—told her many more things than I shall tell you, for,
                  familiar as you may think yourself with him, there are depths in Frank Hamilton's
                  heart into which I would never dare drop the plummet-line of description.
               "And now, Carrie," he said in conclusion, "you forgive me, do you not, for the
                  unwarrantable liberty I took with your little diary? It was very wrong certainly,
                  but I cannot say I am sorry for it."
               The flushed, tearful face of the young wife raised itself from its hiding-place,
                  and a sweet, wistful smile parted her lips.
               "As it was you, Frank, it was all right; but I would never, never,
                     never have forgiven anybody else."
               Thus, reader, ends the Tale of the Trunk. I have guided my hero through the
                  dangerous sea of single life, into the peaceful haven of a happy home; there I
                  leave him to the care of the little pilot he has taken upon board, who, if her
                  future redeem the promise of her girlhood, will not fail to guide him safely
                  through the shoals and quicksands, to be found sometimes even in the most
                  seemingly placid of domestic waters, to the end of life's perilous journey.
            
            
               
               COMPENSATION.
               I WAS the last of my line. For generations the name of Alexander Clinton had held
                  an honored place in the history of the world. No stain had ever humbled its pride,
                  no life had ever shamed the memory of its noble founder. Prosperity had been so
                  long the portion of our house, that it had learned to claim as its right those
                  blessings that to many come so scantily. Was it strange then, that when a
                  helpless, sickly cripple was laid into the arms of my proud, stern father as the
                  heir to the name and fame that he had ever guarded with such scrupulous care—he
                  should cast it from him with a cry of anguish, cursing the hour of its birth?
               Every ambitious dream, every fondly cherished hope, perished suddenly as he gazed
                  upon his deformed, misshapen child; and with them perished as suddenly the love
                  that had been growing silently in his heart, and in its place arose an angry
                  bitterness against the innocent cause of his fierce, unavailing mortification and
                  regret. I dare not judge him too severely. Through life, effort had been with him
                  another name for success; obstacles had arisen in his path only to be conquered;
                  to will had been to do. Unaccustomed to be thwarted in
                  his slightest wish, this total overthrow of all that had made his future precious
                  to him, was more than he had strength to bear. An habitual melancholy took the
                  place of his former cheerful courtesy, and from the hour of my birth he was never
                  known to smile.
               In my early childhood I looked up to him with that awe with which a cold, grave,
                  unloving face inspires a sensitive nature. In my boyhood I defied him with a
                  rebellious sense of his injustice; and now that his proud heart has ceased to
                  beat, and he is laid among the lowliest of earth to rest, I can pity the poor
                  broken life from which the shadow of my misfortune excluded all light forever. I
                  had no unkindness to complain of; but the very scrupulous care with which every
                  personal comfort and advantage was attended to, became galling as I grew old
                  enough to comprehend that it was thus he sought to alone to me for the loss of the
                  love of which I was orphaned. I felt that the sacred tie of father and son united
                  us but in name, and only the entreaties of my mother induced me to submit to a
                  dependence that became year by year more bitter. My claim, unhallowed by
                  affection, ceased to be binding, I thought, when it was acknowledged only as a
                  right.
               To that mother, the pitying angel of my childhood, the loving companion of my
                  youth, memory turns in reverent adoration. I may use the word now, since her grave
                  has become to me the altar where I may worship her as saint as well as woman. She
                  was my other self. Every motherly instinct seemed intensified by the misfortune
                  that had robbed me of a claim to all hearts save hers. The trial that had blasted
                  my father's life only purified and strengthened her nobler nature, stamping her
                  serene brow with a holy tenderness, and lending to her manner a quiet dignity and
                  repose. Love, not compassion, prompted her self-sacrificing devotion, her
                  unceasing care Even my sensitive pride could take no offence, for I knew that she
                  mourned my misfortune, not her own.
               I was nearly six years old, I think, before the full knowledge of what that
                  misfortune was, burst upon me. I had suffered great bodily pain, it is true, but
                  to that I had become so accustomed that I never thought of questioning its cause.
                  I had learned too, babe as I was, that my presence was distasteful to my
                  father,—watching for his step only that I might avoid him, shrinking instinctively
                  from the cold, clear voice that seemed ever colder and clearer when he addressed
                  himself to me; but my childish mind failed to connect the two facts of my
                  suffering and his want of love, until his own hand fitted the missing link.
               
               I well remember the evening when this new truth dawned upon me. I had been playing
                  unnoticed about the room for a long time, as my mother sat by my father's side,
                  her hand in his, conversing with him in a low, earnest voice; while he gazed, with
                  a look almost of tenderness in his eyes, into the face so beautiful, and yet so
                  sad, that was raised to his own.
               Suddenly, impelled by some childish impulse, and emboldened by her presence, I
                  sprang upon his chair, casting my little arms around his neck, in the first and
                  only caress that ever passed between us. She turned to me with a glad, bright
                  smile; but at the touch of that withered arm he shivered violently, and with a
                  darkening brow thrust me from him with a bitter word—a word that burned itself in
                  torturing, fiery lines upon my heart, in characters that only the hand of death
                  will have power to erase. My mother's quiet nature was stirred to its very depths;
                  a bright crimson spot burned on her thin cheek, as catching me quickly to her
                  heart, she spoke wild, impassioned words in my behalf—fronting almost defiantly
                  the cold, stern man who stood before her calm and impassive. What the answer was
                  that came at last my baby-mind had not the power to comprehend; but the color
                  faded suddenly from her cheek, and a deathly whiteness overspread her face, as
                  with a low, heart-broken cry she bowed her head until it rested upon my curls, as
                  she bore me from the room.
               That night I was awakened by the sound of suppressed sobbing; and as I sat up in
                  my little bed, I saw that she knelt beside it. I gazed at her in wondering
                  surprise, trying vainly to comprehend the meaning of her fervent, agonised
                  prayer.
               "Let him die, O God!" she murmured; "let him die. Take him to Thyself, I pray
                  Thee, before he learns to realise the full extent of his misery." A feeling of
                  distress, not unmixed with fear, came over me as I listened to her earnest words,
                  chorused ever by that wild appeal, "Let him die, O Father! in mercy, let him die!"
                  and, creeping to her side, I twined my arms around her neck.
               "Why must I die, mother?" I said. "What have I done? Don't you love
                  Alec, either?"
               She started, and clasping me in her arms, pressed me convulsively to her heart.
                  "Do I love you? O my son! my son!" she cried, "you will learn in time, perhaps, to
                  comprehend how great must be the love that is willing even to resign you to secure
                  your happiness."
               Weeping, she held me closely to her breast, striving with soothing words and
                  tender epithets to efface any painful impression that might be left upon my mind.
                  But the distress had been too great to be readily forgotten; and often, through
                  the next day, I would stop my play to wonder how it was that she who loved me so
                  could wish that I should die, and why she supposed I must be always miserable.
               In the afternoon I wandered into the parlor, seeking for some new means to amuse
                  myself, and as I passed a large mirror reaching to the floor, I suddenly caught
                  sight of my own reflection.
               A hundred times before I had gazed upon it carelessly; now, as I looked, a new
                  thought came into my mind, and something that was not curiosity drew me to inspect
                  it more closely. As distinctly as at that moment I saw it, can I now recall that
                  diminutive figure, with its thin, white face and great sad eyes that grew larger
                  and sadder as the mystery that had heretofore enclosed my life faded into a
                  terrible certainty. When I turned away at last, it was to go to the window, and
                  there, until the evening closed in, I sat with my small face pressed closely to
                  the glass, watching the groups of gay, happy-looking children passing so
                  constantly with the firm, elastic tread of perfect health. A hand was laid upon my
                  shoulder at last, and my mother's sweet voice broke the long silence.
               "What is Alec thinking of? Is he watching God's beautiful stars?"
               "No," I replied; "I don't love God."
               The words came with a sob. She felt that the consciousness of my misfortune had
                  been realised, and, taking me in her arms, she pillowed my head upon her heart.
                  When she spoke, her voice was very grave.
               "How is this, my son?" she said. "How is it that you do not love the good God who
                  has been so kind to you?"
               
               "He is not good," I said; "he is cruel. Why did he not make me like other
                  children? Why did he make me so that my father could not love me?"
               A tear fell on my cheek, and she trembled violently.
               "Listen to me, my boy," she said, "and try to remember what I say to you. I cannot
                  tell you why it is that God has chosen to give you a life of suffering; but I know
                  that he is very merciful, and would not have afflicted you unless he knew that it
                  was for your good. Will you not try to believe that this is so? The other day you
                  asked me why it was that my handsome diamonds were set in that ugly black enamel,
                  and I told you that it was to make them shine more brightly and to bring out all
                  their beauties. Souls are God's jewels, and he sets them as he pleases; sometimes
                  he knows that they will glow more purely in the midst of sorrow and suffering—that
                  the very darkness of the life around them will enable them to reflect more
                  brilliantly the holy light of the love he sheds upon them. And so, darling, we who
                  know so little what is best for us, have only to submit patiently and
                  unmurmuringly to his will, not doubting that merciful love."
               I shall never forget the reverent tenderness of her tone as she spoke, or the holy
                  look that brightened her pure face as she bent over me. The angry, rebellious
                  feeling with which I had been battling, faded away under the magic of her soft,
                  earnest voice. She possibly did not realise the importance of that hour, as she
                  answered my childish questionings; but I know, now, that she fulfilled to me the
                  part of one of God's angels, in bearing away the tiny seed of scepticism before it
                  gathered strength to root itself, that else might now have overgrown my life,
                  excluding the light of His love forever.
               Year by year, as I grew older, the burden of my misfortune became more
                  intolerable. I shrank sensitively from the companionship of other children. The
                  scoffing looks of some, the compassionate pity of others, were equally painful to
                  me. The companion and friend whose words alone had not the power to wound, was my
                  nearest and best—the one that Heaven had granted me—my mother. To her I clung with
                  a strength of affection that had in it something of idolatry. She was in truth, as
                  I have said, my other self; her nature the mould upon which mine was formed.
               Every advantage of education that the wealth and influence of my father could
                  afford me, had been placed at my disposal; and though, as time went on, the
                  distortion of my figure seemed to increase rather than diminish, my intellect,
                  grasping and clear, strengthened and enlarged itself as though in mockery of its
                  setting. My constant daily intercourse with a refined and cultivated woman,
                  imparted to my perceptions a delicacy that must else have been wanting—her
                  watchfulness excluding from my studies all save what was elevating and refining to
                  my taste; the purity and beauty of her daily life lending its coloring to my whole
                  tone of thought; her exquisite fancy casting a charm around what was most actual
                  and commonplace; her quiet influence softening and toning down the harsh lines of
                  my sterner nature. It might have been better for me, possibly, had a less tender
                  care guarded my life, as the morbid sensitiveness nourished by her very love
                  rendered me utterly incapable of battling with the world, when the time came for
                  me to take my stand alone.
               I had attained the years, if not the stature of a man, when the stroke fell. It
                  did not come suddenly. For months I had noted the fading of the beautiful life
                  that had grown too pure for earth; had watched that loved face as it became more
                  and more spiritual, as the touch of suffering chiseled the exquisite features to a
                  still greater delicacy, and felt that the holy calm of its expression was light
                  from the other world reflected there. We knew that we must part, but that
                  consciousness seemed only to strengthen the links that bound us to each other; and
                  even the hope of heaven could scarcely reconcile her to the thought of leaving me
                  still to suffer.
               For days after they carried her to rest, I lingered near the grave. With that vain
                  human clinging to the body so natural in the first moments of desolation, I only
                  felt that where she was, was home to me. Never shall I forget those calm, starry
                  nights of September that I spent alone in the "city of the dead." Misery had
                  almost maddened me, and all remembrances connected with that time are vague and indistinct; but a strange
                  impression, that had been a childish superstition with me years before, that the
                  beautiful stars were the souls of the lost and mourned gazing down upon us in
                  pitying love, again took possession of my mind, inducing, even to this hour, a
                  reverent tenderness for these, the only companions of my lonely night-watches in
                  that time of darkness and despair. This state of things could not continue long;
                  body and mind gave way at last under the pressure of agony, and I was borne from
                  her grave raving in delirium. A long and violent brain fever was the result of my
                  exposure and distress, and for days it was believed I would be reunited to her
                  whom I mourned so bitterly. But it was not to be so; my unripe life was not yet
                  ready to be garnered, and in mercy it was left until the influence of sun and
                  storm had done their work upon its stubborn fibre.
               As soon as strength returned to me, I sought an interview with my father. A
                  determination that had its root deep down in my very childhood, to remain no
                  longer than was possible dependent on his bounty, I could now carry into effect,
                  since my mother's small property, that reverted by right to me, would supply at
                  least the necessities of life, even should I be unable to support myself. Only her
                  entreaties, and the dread of a separation from her, had caused me to submit so
                  long to what I felt to be a degradation; now there was but little pain in leaving
                  the desolate walls that, unlighted by her presence, were no longer home to me.
               My father listened to the few concise sentences in which I communicated my
                  resolution, in grave, unmoved silence. When I concluded, he turned to me with a
                  cold, hard look. "You will scarcely," he said, "expect me to view this proposition
                  of yours very seriously. I shall not oppose it, since I regard it as a mere boyish
                  freak, for which a short experience of the real difficulties of life will be the
                  most effectual cure. We have," he continued, his face again resuming its usual
                  marble rigidity, "as you say, added but little to the happiness of each other. It
                  is perhaps the misfortune, rather than the fault, of each that this has been so.
                  Our temperaments are uncongenial; it is as well that we should be apart. But
                  laying all considerations of feeling aside, my honor will not allow me to consent
                  to a separation on the terms that you propose. Whether you choose to avail
                  yourself of it or not, I shall deposit a certain yearly allowance, payable only to
                  your order, until the time of my death, when of course such property as I hold
                  will revert to you as my natural heir."
               Quietly and respectfully, but in a tone as resolute as his own, I assured him that
                  my determination to receive nothing from his hand was unalterable. "I shall prove
                  myself unworthy of the liberal education for which I have to thank you, sir," I
                  said, "if I am not able, with the aid of such property as I may receive from my
                  mother's estate, to support myself comfortably. As for the fortune, to which I
                  know by law I am entitled, dispose of it as you will; I have sworn upon my knees
                  that I will never use one penny of the inheritance to which my claim is merely a
                  legal right. I accept from you, sir, only my name, which I shall continue to hold,
                  since of that you have not the power to deprive me so long as I preserve it
                  untarnished."
               His white face grew a shade whiter as our eyes met in a long, steady gaze as I
                  concluded; into it passed momentarily an expression of remorse, almost of regret,
                  as he recognised his own haughty spirit in my words. There was an inward struggle,
                  the short upper lip quivered convulsively; but his evil demon, pride, had held too
                  long undisputed sway over his life to allow a better feeling to assert itself. It
                  was soon over, and he answered me again in a hard, dry tone:
               "I am well aware that you are perfectly sincere in what you have said, but allow
                  me to believe that for the present I am the most competent judge of what is for
                  your best interest. A little worldly experience will show you the folly of the
                  course you are pursuing, and teach you to view the matter in a very different
                  light. Pardon me then if I attach but little weight to what has just passed
                  between us, and remember that I am ready to forget your words whenever you are
                  willing to recall them."
               My spirit chafed angrily at his slighting, half-contemptuous tone; but restraining
                  myself, I replied to him very formally. "It is useless, sir, to argue this matter further.
                  Judge my honor by your own, then ask yourself what my course must be. My decision
                  is irrevocable. I have only therefore to bid you farewell, assuring you at the
                  same time that this separation is a final one. We part, I trust, without
                  bitterness."
               I stepped to his side as I spoke, holding out my hand; he grasped it firmly,
                  without speaking, turning away his head. There was no excuse for lingering; and so
                  I passed from the home of my childhood, without one word of kindness, without one
                  voice to cry "God speed you!" out into the bleak, bitter world, feeling that life
                  held nothing for me, that all that was left me in the future was comprised in the
                  word, endurance.
               
               I will not speak of those first few struggling years, with their times of darkness
                  and despair, when all, even hope, seemed lost. I worked not for a mere support,
                  but for fame—not for my own sake, but for his who through life had so cruelly
                  undervalued me. I worked that he might feel at last that the despised cripple,
                  whom he had virtually discarded, had not humbled, but added fresh lustre to the
                  family name that he guarded so proudly.
               Without friends or influence, the struggle was an unequal one; but I brought to
                  the contest a brave, resolute spirit, and so conquered fortune. I became well
                  known among the literary circles of the day as an able essayist and reviewer,
                  while my position as editor of one of the largest commercial journals of the time,
                  afforded me a more solid means of subsistence. Yet, when the end for which I
                  worked was gained, and the approval of the world had taught the cold, unloving
                  man, in whose heart I had no place, that he was not dishonored in his son, I found
                  myself no nearer happiness than before. I stood alone—not as another man may speak
                  that word, alone, but separated from the great living world by the impassable
                  barrier of my deformity—powerless to win to myself any portion of the wealth of
                  love with which God has flooded his universe.
               I realised in bitterness of spirit that my life might never more be bound by those
                  sweet domestic ties of human affection, the strength of which even death has not
                  the power to break, changing ing them only into links by which earth and heaven
                  are more closely united; that I must gaze ever, as now, with sad, hopeless eyes
                  upon happiness in which I could have no share; craving, yet shrinking with
                  sensitive pride from any expression of kindness, lest pity, not interest, should
                  prove its root.
               I had outlived the first early dreams that come to all young hearts, and my
                  somewhat imaginative temperament had been well schooled by hard work and study;
                  yet there were times when that sense of loneliness was strangely oppressive. I had
                  no name for the want that seemed to spring from sweet memories of the tenderness
                  that had blessed my youth, and little thought that in mourning the loss of my past
                  happiness I mourned the loss of all that makes life most precious.
               Impelled by my disinclination for the society of strangers, I had, in the first
                  days of my voluntary exile, taken bachelor lodgings; but finding their solitude
                  insupportable, I obtained rooms in a boarding-house, where the small social circle
                  created for me the semblance, at least, of a home. There, for many years, occupied
                  with my books and papers, life flowed quietly away—quietly, and I might write
                  happily, had it not been for the one craving want that I knew by the name of
                  grief.
               Now and then a familiar face would drop from the little family, or a vacant chair
                  would be filled by a new-comer; but living in, and perhaps too much
                     for myself, I troubled myself little with what passed around
                  me.
               An habitual reserve, growing from the keen consciousness of my misfortune in
                  childhood, proved a shield that few had either the inclination or courage to
                  penetrate, and through which I myself had not the power to break; and thus it was,
                  that whilst my name was upon many lips, I lived unnoticed and unknown, numbering
                  my friends among those whose thoughts I had gained, not through their spoken, but
                  their written words. It is never well for a life when this is so; a species of
                  morbid egotism, over-growing our natural healthy sympathies with those around us,
                  is too often the result of such seclusion.
               "The proper study of mankind is man;" and this study, only to be carried on amid the cheerful relations of
                  everyday life, can never be mastered by him who stands apart, drawing his
                  inferences from such mummied thoughts as he may find preserved in books.
               One evening in autumn I returned home, more than usually wearied by my day's work.
                  As I passed the parlor, the door of which stood open, my step was arrested by the
                  sound of a strange, old melody, half hymn, half ballad, that had been familiar to
                  me in my boyhood as a favorite of my mother's. Years had passed since I had heard
                  the strain, and the sweet, low voice of the singer sounded so like that which had
                  long been silent, that I stood for a few moments trembling and awed, grasping the
                  doorway for support, feeling almost as though her grave had opened at my feet.
               The musician was hidden from me by the dimness of the room, lighted only by the
                  faint moonlight which stole down through the hazy, rifting clouds that obscured
                  the sky; and entering unobserved by her, I seated myself in an easy-chair by the
                  window, and gave myself up to the full enjoyment of the music. Under any
                  circumstances it must have been a rare treat to one so passionately devoted to it
                  as I; but there are moments, and we all have lived them, when the hidden feelings
                  of the heart seem lifted to its surface, when the very nerves of our lives are
                  bared to the influences around them. Thus, utterly unmanned, I sat listening, with
                  the tears coursing down my cheeks, to that exquisite voice as it quivered through
                  one plaintive melody after another; thrilling with suppressed feeling as its
                  familiar cadence recalled the memory of her who, I knew full well, was that night
                  singing in heaven.
               I had little thought then of the change that hour's experience was to work in me;
                  that the hand passing over those keys was to sweep the chords of my heart as well;
                  that the silver thread of harmony was sent to recall me into the circle of human
                  life and sympathy, from which I had been so long an outcast.
               I did not have much difficulty in linking that soft voice with a sweet young face,
                  that for the last week had brightened our gloomy old boarding-house like a gleam
                  of sunlight, and upon which I had gazed, with admiration it is true, yet with that
                  indifference with which we learn to regard those blessings or happinesses which we
                  know are designed for the lives of others, and in which we feel that our own can
                  have no possible share.
               As the musician, leaving her instrument, came forward with a slow, uncertain step
                  into the moonlight, I saw that my surmise had been a correct one, and gazed with a
                  new interest into the beautiful face, upon which the soft, cool light fell,
                  rendering it still more delicate and spiritual. She stood almost beside me, yet to
                  my surprise I saw that she still seemed to be unaware of my presence. Had I seen
                  her thus for the first time, I might have been tempted to believe her, not a mere
                  woman, but an ethereal being, born from the beauty of the hour, part of the light
                  in which she was enclosed, so holy and innocent was the perfect repose of the pure
                  face, so calm and peaceful the large blue eyes that met mine with a look of such
                  dreamy unconsciousness.
               Thus for many moments she stood beside me, until some slight movement betraying my
                  proximity, she turned towards me with a smile:
               "Ah, is it you, Aunt Ellen?" she said. "I thought I was alone."
               She laid her white hand on my shoulder as she spoke, then withdrew it quickly,
                  with a startled look, whilst a crimson flush mounted to her cheek.
               "Pardon me," she said. "I am blind."
               Sadder words never fell from human lips; yet she did not speak them sadly, but
                  with a quiet dignity that held in it something almost more touching than
                  complaint.
               I know not what answer I made her; I only know that my heart was stirred to its
                  very depths, and that I spoke its language, not my own.
               When she left me, for a long time I paced the darkened room with quick, irregular
                  steps. My soul was deeply moved. The feeling of compassion, of heartfelt pity, was
                  strangely new to me; suffering had taught me selfishness, I fear. It had been
                     my habit to measure other men's
                  griefs by my own, and see them dwarfed by the comparison; but this beautiful,
                  broken life, how could I comprehend its loss? this sensitive woman's
                  life imprisoned forever in darkness. Here was a fate even more pitiful than
                  mine.
               The light touch of that white hand, too, had stirred my blood into a strange
                  fever. The soft, firm pressure, unfamiliar now for many years, awakened a host of
                  memories that shaped themselves in my disturbed slumbers that night into dreams,
                  in which I was a child again, resting my head upon my mother's heart, whilst I
                  poured out my griefs into her ready ear; but the face that bent above me, with its
                  look of tender sympathy and love, was not hers whom I had reverenced in years gone
                  by, but the one that had gleamed upon me, spirit-like and still, through its veil
                  of silver moonlight.
               I know not what happy chance it was that sent Maud Anstead and her aunt to form
                  part of our little family circle. Chance, did I say?—how dare I call it so? It was
                  God that sent her, with her message of hope and comfort to the poor life that he
                  had rendered so desolate. Her coming was indeed an era in its history. From that
                  time I began to live; I had but dreamed before.
               However I might have known her, the unconscious magnetism she exercised on all
                  around her must have drawn me to her; but as it was, our common misfortune
                  rendered the tie of friendship a still more strong and binding one.
               I had mingled little, since my mother's death, in the society of women. Realising
                  how impossible it must ever be for me to take my proper position among them, I
                  could not bear their tender compassion unconsciously betraying itself in softened
                  voice and manner when I was near. Even the delicate tact that so studiously
                  avoided every subject that could cause me pain, annoyed and irritated me. I was
                  too proud to accept the pity which I felt was all that could ever be granted to
                  one so unfortunate as I.
               With Maud alone I felt myself to be indeed a man. Her misfortune rendered her
                  incapable of comprehending mine. With no idea of form save that which reached her
                  through the sense of touch, no explanation or description could convey to her any
                  idea of the nature of the affliction that separated me from my fellow-men. Knowing
                  this, I could open my heart to her as I never had before to any human being,
                  speaking unreservedly of the misery that had blighted every hope and ambition of
                  my life. It was sympathy, not pity, she accorded me; and how sweet that sympathy
                  was to one so long isolated from all human affection, only those circumstanced as
                  I was at that time can realise.
               God, as though in compensation for what he has deprived them of, has granted to
                  the blind a finer instinct—another sense, if we may call it so—by which to shield
                  their lives from harm. They seldom err in their judgment of character; the
                  intonations of voice, the very step and manner of those around them, bear to their
                  delicate perceptions a meaning which we must ever be incapable of understanding;
                  and they judge us not by what we seem to be, but by what we are.
               For the first time in my life I was upon an equal footing with another. We stood,
                  she and I, not face to face, but soul to soul. By my own merit I knew I must stand
                  or fall: that word and thought, and motive of thought, weighed nicely in the
                  balance of that pure young conscience, were carving the lines by which my image
                  must be recognised by her, and I gained in self-respect when the unreserved
                  friendship and confidence of that true heart were granted me; feeling that my
                  life, thus endorsed, must be indeed a worthy one.
               Maud had been blind from early childhood. Some faint, clinging memories of green
                  fields and sunny skies still remained to her, but vague and dream-like in their
                  indistinctness, so that they lent no additional sadness, but rather beauty to her
                  life. She had no knowledge of the parents of whom death had deprived her in
                  infancy; and the tender care of the aunt, who had taken the desolate orphan to her
                  heart, had so shielded her from suffering that she had never known the loss that
                  on some lives falls so heavily. With Mrs. Anstead the one thought and object of
                  life seemed to be to render bright and sunny the lot that might else have been so cheerless. From her very
                  cradle Maud had been guarded, so far as was possible, by her thoughtful care, from
                  all knowledge of the painful truths with which we grow so soon familiar. Tales of
                  suffering and distress had been carefully excluded from both reading and
                  conversation, and only the beautiful presented to the mind that had but itself to
                  feed upon. Only in understanding this could the childlike simplicity and purity of
                  her life be comprehended—that life which had known only love.
               She was a strange study, this young girl; living in a world of sin and sorrow, so
                  unconscious of the evil that surrounded her. And a strange study, too, was the
                  nature that an education of affection had developed: not fervid, not passionate,
                  but hiding under its seeming serenity and repose, a depth of feeling, a strength
                  of affection, of which passion is incapable—a nature that, had she lived in those
                  old days when men were martyred for their love to God, might have borne her to the
                  stake, and strengthened her to meet unflinchingly the tortures by which her pure
                  soul was freed.
               Untouched by grief, her life held no shadows. Unconscious of its own powers, the
                  deeper woman's nature as yet slept unawakened, overlaid by an artless, girlish
                  gaiety that had in it at times a gleeful mirthfulness seldom found save in the joy
                  of childhood; and it was sad, in looking at her, to know how that beautiful,
                  flowery life must in time be swept away by the upheaving of the greater life that
                  lay beneath.
               With an eager thirst for knowledge, a clear, ready mind, and an appreciative love
                  of the beautiful, her aunt had found in educating her an easy and delightful task.
                  Cut off though she had been from so many sources of knowledge, there were few
                  subjects that arose in our many discussions that she could not touch with a grace
                  and ease that might have put to shame those whose opportunities had been far more
                  extensive. There was a peculiar force, and yet delicacy, in her manner of treating
                  any knotty, controverted point that seldom failed to carry conviction. Could my
                  meaning be understood, I would say that her views of life, though sometimes false
                  to fact from the very necessities of the case, were always true to principle; or
                  to express the thought more clearly in her own simple and pithy language, "If they
                  were not right, they ought to have been."
               It was rather hard at first for her aunt, who had acted as eyes for her darling so
                  long, to resign the privilege to me; but it became at last quite customary during
                  those long winter evenings for Maud and myself to withdraw to a little table,
                  somewhat removed from the rest of the company, where the sound of our voices would
                  not interrupt any conversation that might be carried on, in order that I might
                  read to her while she busied herself with the bright, delicate worsteds that she
                  wrought into so many tasteful and beautiful forms.
               She had never learned that control of feature which renders the human countenance
                  a mask, not an index, and every thought and emotion of her heart stamped itself
                  upon her face. As I would read to her some exquisite poem, or morsel of
                  word-painting upon which the artist-soul of the author had expended its whole
                  wealth of beauty, I would pause sometimes, forgetful of his meaning, to watch the
                  lighting of that speaking face, with its deep, holy eyes and sensitive mouth
                  trembling with earnestness and feeling. She would look troubled and wondering,
                  when on questioning the cause of my silence I would tell her "I had been thinking
                  of something else," and chide me gently for my coldness and want of
                  appreciation.
               It was sweet to know her utterly unconscious of my earnest gaze, to know that I
                  might feast unchecked upon her beauty, to know that the flush on the soft cheek
                  would not deepen, or the white lids droop over the blue eyes to shield them from
                  my scrutiny. What power the human eye has upon those around it we cannot
                  understand, but certain it is, that with the blind, where its influence is unfelt,
                  there is a freedom from embarrassment, a frankness of expression, seldom met with
                  in others. Words with Maud were spoken thoughts. Always sincere, always natural,
                  unconsciously to herself, she would at times withdraw the veil that shielded that
                  inner nature, and show me truths written there as yet to herself unknown.
               
               In her conversation there was a charm I have never felt in that of another; her
                  language concise and well chosen, combining richness and beauty of imagery with an
                  originality, a naïveté of thought that rendered it irresistible. As our friendship
                  established itself upon a still, firmer basis, I found in her a valuable assistant
                  and fellow-laborer. Few manuscripts passed from my desk to the office that had not
                  the sanction of her approval, that had not been weeded by her hand. If my style
                  lost something of its force, in the absence of the caustic satire that heretofore
                  had marked it, it gained not less, I think, in elevation and purity of expression.
                  I could not bear with bitter words, however well turned they might be, to bring
                  that grieved, troubled look into the sweet face that bent towards me with such
                  eager interest. Thus it was at first to save her pain that I guarded my words with
                  more scrupulous care; but as time went on, her conscience taught mine to compute
                  the influence of those thoughts that I once had sent forth, careless of their
                  consequence, and I trembled as I recognised the power I had wielded so
                  recklessly.
               The love of flowers with Maud was almost a passion, and the little vase that stood
                  beside her on the table seldom failed to receive its nightly supply of fragrant
                  blossoms. I would amuse myself sometimes by trying to explain to her the meaning
                  of form and color, and winning from her in return her crude, unformed ideas. It
                  would occasion me pleasure that I scarcely cared to analyse, to see her cast a
                  beautiful camellia or rare tropical flower carelessly aside, choosing in its stead
                  some simple, perfumed bud. She would shake her head with a smile when I would
                  remonstrate. "They may, as you say, be exquisite," she would answer, "but they
                  have no power to speak to me in a language I comprehend. I do not love them: they
                  have no soul."
               How swiftly that winter glided away! Neither the young girl who sat beside me
                  night after night, lending such earnest, pleased attention to my words, nor I,
                  secure in the knowledge of my misfortune, nor the guardian who watched us both
                  with tender compassion, happy in the happiness of her loved charge, ever dreamed
                  how closely those hours were weaving the threads of our lives together. For me the
                  priceless possession of the present was sufficient joy. I knew no future in my
                  thoughts, but lived on and on in a dream of happiness, never questioning what the
                  end must be.
               But there came a time at last when the calm that had over-spread my life was
                  broken. In the public journals we read constantly of the almost miraculous cures
                  effected among the blind by an eminent London physician. Letters corroborating the
                  accounts we saw there, came to Mrs. Anstead with every steamer from Europe,
                  earnestly urging her to bring Maud to England, in order to place her under his
                  care. Patients, they wrote, were crowding to London from every part of the world,
                  and the most seemingly hopeless cases would not unfrequently yield to his skilful
                  treatment.
               Maud listened to these accounts, at first in silence, with a flushing cheek; but
                  as time passed on, and her aunt began to add her solicitations to those of their
                  friends across the water, she would turn from the subject as though it caused her
                  pain, and any allusion to it would bring a shadow over her face. She had been so
                  happy in her captivity, that now that the prison-door seemed to be opened, she
                  stood upon its threshold like a little bird to whom freedom has been
                  offered—panting for liberty, yet still withheld from claiming it by affection for
                  those who have tended it so lovingly.
               Mrs. Anstead could not comprehend what she called "Maud's inconsistency," but I,
                  more deeply read in the secrets of that true young heart, knew, from the struggle
                  in my own breast, what she was passing through, and realised with bitter
                  self-reproach that every happy hour we had passed together had fashioned itself
                  into a link in the chain by which she was bound.
               It is strange how sometimes a feeling that has become the very motive-power of our
                  lives, influencing their every word and thought, may sleep unknown and unsuspected
                  in our hearts. The knowledge of my love for Maud did not break upon me suddenly.
                  At first I could not understand why it was I shrank so sensitively from the
                  thought of her release from her misfortune, why it should cause me pain instead of
                  pleasure. Fiercely indignant with
                  myself for a selfishness that would willingly fetter her life to contribute to the
                  happiness of mine, I questioned my own heart carefully for its cause.
               Then it was that I saw the gulf opening at my feet,—learned how deeply rooted was
                  the love that had been growing silently and unsuspected during those months of
                  constant intercourse,—realising with bitter shame that more than all else upon
                  earth, I feared the restoration of her sight. One moment of vision, I well knew,
                  must destroy for her every illusion; and with this thought there came another,
                  crushing me to the very earth—that if this were so, I had acted a base, unmanly
                  part in thus taking advantage of her misfortune, to win for myself a place within
                  her heart that I would never have the right to claim. Even should her blindness
                  prove incurable, I saw but the one course open to me: I must break all connection
                  between us, and forever; even though she, incapable of comprehending the wall of
                  separation that was raised between us, should oppose me and seek to change my
                  purpose.
               How fearfully I suffered during those weeks of indecision, few can comprehend. It
                  was not with me, as with her, the prospect of a few months of separation that
                  appalled: I knew that in parting with her it must be forever. All
                  that was human in me rebelled against this decision; but honor, dearer to me even
                  than love, demanded that it must be made. In the midst of the thick despair that
                  enclosed my life, one present duty presented itself. I must urge her to a
                  compliance with her aunt's wishes, must no longer avoid the subject so painful to
                  us both, but use the influence I possessed to induce her to consent to place
                  herself under the care of this physician of whose skill all spoke so
                  confidently.
               It was a severe test of my strength of purpose, and as such I dared not shrink
                  from it. She listened to me wonderingly at first, as I urged upon her the
                  necessity of yielding her own wishes on this point. But as I continued earnestly,
                  almost sternly, to remind her of those duties for which her blindness
                  incapacitated her, and which she had not the right to ignore; of the shadow that
                  her misfortune cast upon the hearts of those that loved her—I was forced to shade
                  my eyes with my hand, that I might not see the quivering play of her features and
                  the beseeching expression of that upturned face. She answered me not a word; but
                  when I paused at last, burst into tears, and turning from me, passed with a quick
                  step from the room.
               It was not long before I learned from Mrs. Anstead that Maud had at last consented
                  to the voyage. I had known that it must be so; yet it seemed to me that I should
                  die in the first moment that the thought presented itself to my mind as a fact. So
                  weak is human nature, that had she stood beside me then, I believe I should have
                  knelt at her feet, praying her not to leave me.
               The weeks of preparation passed swiftly away. At first I sought to absent myself
                  from her, thinking thus to break the pain of parting; but when I found my seeming
                  coldness and change of manner grieved and troubled her, I judged it best, to spare
                  her all unnecessary suffering, that our lives should flow on in their accustomed
                  channel, trusting that the months of separation would better prepare her for the
                  shock of knowing, as she must in time, that our parting had been a final one.
               The last night came. We spent the evening as usual, at our little table. She was
                  pale and still, speaking little. What I suffered in those last hours cannot be
                  expressed, for I knew that her very soul was wrung with anguish, yet was forced to
                  guard all tenderness from my tone and manner, and speak with seeming indifference
                  of what was rending my heart. Little wonder that I so overacted my part, that more
                  than once I brought that childlike, grieved look into her face, and the tears to
                  her blue eyes.
               One by one the boarders dropped away, until she and I sat there alone. It grew
                  very late. The chiming of a clock in the neighborhood broke in upon the silence,
                  for words at last had failed us. Each stroke fell like a knell upon my heart. With
                  the last she rose.
               "I must bid you farewell now," she said, "we leave so early in the morning." She
                  paused, then added, with some little effort, whilst a slight flush rose to her cheek: "We have
                  been friends so long, I would wish to see you once before I go."
               I understood what she meant, and without speaking, inclined my head towards her,
                  that she might pass her hand lightly over my face to fix its features in her
                  memory. The soft velvet touch of that delicate hand, as tremulous and quivering it
                  passed over my hot brow and throbbing temples, stirred my heart to its very
                  depths. I had no longer power to restrain myself, and grasping it in mine, I held
                  it firmly, whilst I gazed into the sweet, flushed face that bent before me as
                  though it felt my look.
               "Oh, Maud," I said, "my beautiful one, how can I live without
                  you!"
               She did not withdraw the hand I held, she did not shrink from me, but with
                  drooping lids and bowed head waited for the words that every obligation of honor
                  forbade that I should speak.
               Oh, that moment! how it burns upon my memory—as I stood clinging to, rather than
                  holding, that white hand, watching the crimson deepen on her cheek, a torrent of
                  passionate, loving words held back by one simple act of will. Whether
                  strength would have been given me to stand firm in that instant of fierce
                  temptation, or whether longer gazing into that pure face, with its look of tender
                  humility, would have deprived me altogether of reason, I cannot know; but as I
                  raised my eyes they rested momentarily on the long mirror that hung opposite.
               With fearful fidelity it sent back the reflection of two figures: the one lithe,
                  light, graceful—the other——
               With a low cry of anguish I loosed her hand.
               "God did well," I said, "When he failed to make me a man. This night I have proven
                  myself unworthy the name. Should sight ever come to those darkened eyes of yours,
                  my poor Maud, you will learn how deeply I have sinned against you—will learn how
                  fearful has been the struggle in my heart, how terrible my anguish. Pray for me,
                  then. Pray for me now, that He will strengthen me to bear the misery of this
                  hour."
               I dared not turn for a last look at her face; I dared not listen to the words that
                  trembled on her lips; but hurrying from the room, sought in the silence and
                  darkness of my own, to still the wild excitement with which each nerve was
                  quivering. The long night passed at last, and with the first grey streak of dawn I
                  stole down stairs before any one was astir in the house. I knew that she must not
                  know that I was near, that I must not speak to her; but I felt that I must see her
                  once again before she passed away forever.
               It was not long before I heard that sweet, low voice bidding its farewells, and
                  leaving messages of love and kindness for those who were not there to claim them.
                  Then, shawled and bonneted, she came into the room, dim with the early morning
                  twilight, in the far corner of which I sat waiting her coming, and passed with a
                  slow step to the little table where we had spent so many happy hours. Resting her
                  arms upon it, she bowed her head upon them, and her frail, slight figure was
                  convulsed with the emotion to which, believing herself alone, she gave
                  uncontrolled vent.
               It was no human strength that withheld me, whilst those low sobs, mingled with
                  murmured words of tenderness, fell upon my ear; and when at last, hearing the
                  voices calling from the hall below, she rose, passing so near me as I stood in the
                  doorway that her dress swept against me, it was no human power that restrained me
                  from clasping her for a moment to my heart and pressing my lips to her pure
                  brow.
               Again I stood alone in the world; again the priceless blessing of woman's love and
                  tenderness had been granted me for a short space, only by its withdrawal to render
                  my lot doubly dreary and desolate; again what had made the happiness of life was
                  taken from me, and its stern, hard duties substituted. She had lent it a purpose
                  apart from herself, in teaching it the value of its influence; and so I worked
                  earnestly and uncomplainingly, seeking to comfort and aid those hearts still more
                  wretched than my own, realising, through our common brotherhood of misery, that
                  they needed help and pity, not taunts and reproaches.
               Fame, that whilst I sought it had at first seemed to elude my grasp,—now that I
                  sought it not, and worked only that God's world might be better that even so helpless a life as mine had lived in it, now
                  crowned my efforts as their natural consequence, and I found it hard to shield my
                  life from the curious observation of the public to which I spoke. Notoriety was to
                  me a source of pain, rather than pleasure. The sunlight of approval, shining at
                  last upon me, had no power to warm from my nature the chill reserve that years of
                  loneliness had fostered there. As, far below earth's surface, in its silence and
                  its darkness, are formed those precious gems that men most highly prize, so in the
                  silence and darkness of my heart had grown those thoughts to which others now
                  attached a value of which I had never dreamed.
               To me, the experiences from which they were hewn had been cold and hard, and
                  lustreless enough; but if they flashed into beauty in the happy light falling from
                  the lives of other men—why, then, what right had I to withhold what was to them a
                  source of pleasure? Each man's mind is a strange mosaic, formed of the thoughts
                  and feelings of others; and it strengthened me sometimes when I wearied of my
                  labor, to know that I, obscure and powerless as I seemed, held the privilege of
                  fitting into the lives of those around me good, true impulses, and pure and holy
                  thoughts.
               Letters came from time to time across the water, speaking first hopefully, then
                  certainly, of Maud's recovery. She, by whom those letters were penned, would have
                  marvelled had she known with what bitterness of spirit her joyful tidings were
                  received; and even more perhaps, had she seen the little messages enclosed from
                  Maud, torn from the sheet unread and given to the flames. I dared not feed my
                  heart with the thought of her; even the books that we had read together were put
                  away—every trace of her removed. I said, "The past is a dream; I must forget it."
                  Alas! who ever ceased to remember what he willed to forget?
               Month after month, as it rolled away, only stamped her image more indelibly upon
                  my heart. Sleeping or waking, the one thought I sought to exclude seemed ever
                  present with me; I had no power to stifle memory. As light came to her life,
                  darkness settled still more densely upon mine; and with all the strength of
                  principle I possessed, I sought to nerve myself for the time of trial that I felt
                  was awaiting me. Now that the great heart of the ocean beat between us, my
                  temptation was, comparatively speaking, an easy one. But I knew that the time
                  would come when my poor weak will might be the only barrier that separated us.
                  Would I have strength to resist her pleadings, and those of my own heart, and
                  avoid the meeting which she was already anticipating so joyfully; or would I yield
                  weakly, forgetting all manliness and honor, in claiming from the compassionate
                  tenderness of her nature a continuance of her love?
               When the letter came at last announcing their speedy return, the struggle was at
                  an end. The restless tumult of hopes and fears was stilled, and from its death
                  arose a firm, unwavering purpose. I knew that we must not meet, and
                  so at once commenced my preparations to place the ocean again between us. Even
                  though my own resolution might not fail, accident, or even her will, might force
                  upon me an interview for the consequences of which I trembled. I understood so
                  well the unselfishness of her nature, that I knew, though every delusion should be
                  broken,—pity, in such hearts as hers scarcely less strong than love, might still
                  induce her to seek to atone to me for my misfortune by devoting her life to mine.
                  I knew that she must not make, nor I accept this sacrifice; that thus happiness
                  could never be secured to either.
               I would have left the country before their return to it, but for another thought
                  which, when it first presented itself, caused me bitter anguish, but which as time
                  wore on, shaped itself into a duty which, though I turned from it with natural
                  shrinking, was not to be ignored. Maud loved me. Whether it was my sin or her
                  misfortune that this was so, it was still a fact; she loved me, and must suffer
                  not less than I in this separation. I had aided her in weaving the dream; now I
                  must break it for her. She must know what it was she had loved. The exquisite
                  creation of her fancy to which she had given my name, must fade into the terrible
                  reality. She must remember me when I had passed forever from her presence, not as
                  the mysterious being upon whom some
                  fearful affliction rested, which her love alone had the power to alleviate, but as
                  the poor, wretched cripple, who had perhaps acted even a dishonorable part, in
                  winning through her misfortune, a place in her regard which might otherwise have
                  been denied. Though it were but for one moment, she must see me, to
                  enable her more readily to disengage the clinging memories that else would cast a
                  shadow over her whole life. Perhaps of my sufferings, the bitterest of all was the
                  recognition of this duty; but once recognised, I dared not turn from it.
               It was not until the day before the vessel in which I had engaged passage was to
                  sail, that I returned to the city, which I had left under the plea of urgent
                  business shortly before their arrival. I had learned that Maud was to visit a very
                  fine private collection of paintings and statuary, and had judged it best that our
                  meeting should be where the presence of others would act as a restraint upon our
                  words. Few can imagine the acute mental agony inflicted by the thought of my
                  self-imposed task. Now that the moment for action had arrived, it seemed to me
                  that I could more readily have laid down my life. Only the knowledge that my
                  suffering was to spare her grief, gave me strength to carry my resolution into
                  effect.
               The gallery was somewhat crowded, but I had little difficulty in singling out the
                  two figures that alone held any interest for me. Mrs. Anstead was busily engaged
                  in conversation with a friend, but Maud stood with that intent, absorbed
                  expression which I so well remembered, on her soul-lit face, gazing at an
                  exquisite statue, the dream-like loveliness of which, although fresh from a
                  master-hand, had already given it a world-wide reputation.
               Fearing that the expression of my face might reveal too much, I placed myself
                  before a large mirror, in which I could watch every change of hers unobserved. I
                  knew that her look at last must rest upon me, and awaited, with what inward
                  excitement may be imagined, the crisis of my fate.
               I did not realise how, since the recovery of her sight, all that was unpleasing or
                  repulsive had been guarded from it. I did not realise how painfully the vision of
                  my uncouth figure must break the dream of beauty in which she had been rapt; I did
                  not realise the impossibility of her connecting the strange apparition before her
                  with her friend of other days; and when into her eyes, as they at last rested upon
                  me, there passed a look of shuddering terror, and I saw that she grasped the arm
                  of her aunt as though for support, a burning, bitter sense of wrong sent flashing
                  back a glance in which there was so much of anguish, indignation and reproach,
                  that the look changed to one of eager questioning, and she started forward with a
                  low, stifled cry.
               I waited for no further explanation, but passing through the crowd, hurried with
                  swift steps from my place of martyrdom. Life at that moment held for me but the
                  one purpose of hiding forever from her sight my poor, distorted frame. I wrote to
                  her that night. What mad, wild words I penned I cannot now recall; I only know
                  that my heart was breaking, and but for that relief I must have lost my
                  reason.
               Perhaps at this time nothing could have been worse for me than the long,
                  monotonous sea-voyage; for, cut off from its ordinary sources of occupation, my
                  mind had only its own unhealthy thoughts to dwell upon. The past held for me but
                  the one bitter memory of that look of shuddering terror in the eyes in which I had
                  read heretofore only love and tenderness. I was very miserable, the more so
                  perhaps that I knew in the whole wide world there was not one to care for my
                  happiness or misery. It seemed to me at times as though my faith would fail me in
                  the justice of that God who had portioned out for my life only bitterness. He knew
                  my need was very great, and so was very merciful; and though I could not pray "Thy
                  will be done," he listened to my cry, "Lord, help me to endure," and strengthened
                  me in time to arouse myself from the lethargy of despair that had paralysed my
                  faculties, teaching me that if we have not the right to selfishly enjoy, neither
                  have we the right to selfishly suffer, in this world of universal suffering.
               My life for the next three years was one of constant change. I had no home-ties to
                  bind me to any single spot, and so I wandered at will over the old world, seeking
                  in variety, oblivion of the past. He
                  who wrestles manfully with suffering must come off victor in the end. The
                  experiences of those years were to me of inestimable value. If they could not give
                  me happiness. I gained through them at least the power of rendering the lives of
                  others happier, and that consciousness brought a peace to my life that it had not
                  known even in brighter days. Human nature is everywhere the same, and one has
                  never to look very far from where he stands for abuses and misery. I found work
                  enough to do wherever I might go.
               The press is not so free in the old world as in ours, and I jeoparded my liberty
                  more than once in the fearlessness with which I vindicated the right. It
                  strengthened me sometimes, when I shrank from losing this, the last gift that
                  could be taken from me, to think that perhaps my life had been stripped of its
                  blessings, had been rendered comparatively valueless to me, only that I might
                  stand forth boldly as the champion of the helpless and the wronged; as one who had
                  more to lose, who was richer in happiness, might not have dared to do.
               How much or how little I accomplished, matters not. I felt that my business was to
                  plant, not to gather the increase; and even when I seemed to have utterly failed
                  in what I sought to accomplish, the words of one whom I had heard in my youth
                  recurred to me, saving me from discouragement: "We think we have done nothing if
                  we do not see the fruit of our efforts, not remembering that those
                     efforts are in themselves the fruit of our
                  lives."
               I had lingered one year in Rome rather later in the season than is the custom of
                  strangers; the much-dreaded malaria rendering it almost uninhabitable during the
                  summer months to those not inured to the climate. The enervating, poisoned air had
                  already begun to exercise its influence over me, and I delayed my preparations for
                  leaving the city day after day, simply from want of energy to complete them. The
                  grounds of the Villa Borghese, which during the rest of the year are thronged by
                  equestrian and foot passengers, were now shunned and deserted, even by the
                  inhabitants themselves. The scorching heat of the days rendered its cool, shady
                  walks peculiarly inviting, and though I knew well the danger of too constant
                  visits, I yielded not unfrequently to the temptation, which in my weakened state I
                  had scarcely strength of will to resist.
               Oppressed by a nervous restlessness that had rendered me incapable of any settled
                  employment through the day, I sought one afternoon, as usual, my favorite walk,
                  hoping that the quiet and repose of all around me might soothe my mind into its
                  ordinary calm. The fever was already burning in my veins, although I knew it not.
                  Wild, fantastic visions floated before my eyes. Old thoughts and memories pressed
                  upon me with a power I had not strength to resist: The golden air around me seemed
                  filled with myriads of faces, some dreamily thoughtful, some timidly beseeching,
                  some glad and bright, some mournful and weary, all bearing a strange likeness to a
                  face I once had known. I do not know even now if it were altogether a dream—that
                  old Italian air is filled with angel forms, and has thus resolved itself not
                  unfrequently to the artist's eye.
               As I stood leaning against a marble fountain, gazing down into its clear depths,
                  from which, as though an Undine was imprisoned there, gazed back upon me a sweet
                  young face in the first flush of girlish loveliness, I was startled by an eager
                  exclamation, and turning, I saw before me—no dream, no fancy now—a face not unlike
                  those mocking images with which the wood seemed haunted, but holier than them all;
                  a face calm and still, but into which there flashed a vivid coloring as its eyes
                  met mine. Incapable of moving a muscle or thinking a thought I stood, stunned and
                  bewildered, gazing wildly, incredulously at the slight, frail form that with
                  white, outstretched hands bent towards me. Then I grew dizzy and faint, and
                  darkness swept in between us. I was conscious only of a heavy fall, of a wild,
                  terrified cry, then all was blank.
               Many days had passed when consciousness again returned to me; days marked only by
                  terrible fever dreams that I cannot even now recall without a shuddering sense of
                  horror; yet so strong had been the impression of that last moment of life
                     before the delirium seized me, that
                  it was scarcely with surprise that I found that calm, white face still bending
                  above me, paler and thinner than when I last had seen it, but the same. It was sad
                  and anxious when my eyes first rested on it; but as she met my look of wistful
                  inquiry, it lighted with an expression of joy, whilst a murmured thanksgiving fell
                  from her lips.
               "Maud," I said, "am I dreaming still?"
               She smiled, but tears came with the smile. "Hush," she whispered, "do not speak;
                  do not think, even. You have been very ill, but all will be well now; God has been
                  very merciful."
               And so, obedient to her warning, I lay quiet and motionless, in one of those
                  dreamy lethargies that so frequently follow the breaking of a fever, calmly
                  content to know that she was watching by me, earing for me, that those soft eyes
                  that never left my face, still held in them all the tenderness of bygone years.
                  Thus for hours, days, it may be even weeks, for I took no note of time, she
                  watched beside me. All was not well as she had prophesied. The delirium having
                  passed, had left me in a low typhoid state, from which my already exhausted system
                  seemed not to have the power to rally. Daily, hourly, I felt my strength gradually
                  ebbing away. Sleepless and untiring, night and day, Maud was ever near me,
                  soothing and supporting me with gentle, cheering words, moving through the room
                  noiselessly as a spirit, supplying each unspoken want, and by her quiet influence
                  calming each troubled thought into peace. Mrs. Anstead's kind, motherly face too,
                  not unfrequently bent above me, and I felt that these loved friends had been sent
                  in mercy, that death might not find me alone and deserted. For death I knew was
                  very near to me, chilling the blood in my veins, laying his cold hand on my heart
                  until its pulsations were almost stifled.
               I did not fear to die; from early childhood it had been the earnest wish of my
                  life. But one link bound me now to earth; and perhaps were that link severed, it
                  would be as well for her whom I so loved.
               Looking into the eyes of my physician one night, I saw that all was over. "How
                  many hours have I left?" I questioned. He did not answer me, but the pity in his
                  face spoke more powerfully than words.
               "I do not wish for life," I said. "Do not deceive me; can I live until
                  morning?"
               He shook his head mournfully.
               "It is well," I said; "send Maud to me; I have much to say to her. She has a brave
                  heart, and will not fear, I think, to watch with me to the last."
               I had not known that she was near me, but at my words she came forward and took
                  her usual place beside me. There was no moan, no cry of pain, but her face was
                  white and rigid as marble, and held in its expression an anguish terrible to see.
                  When she spoke her very voice seemed altered, so cold and clear was it, as though
                  its sweetness too had died in that hour of fearful suffering.
               "You do not care to live," she said. "You do not care to live."
               "No, Maud," I said, "for life must bring misery to us both. Death alone can unite
                  us." And then I spoke as I only could have spoken with the knowledge of an
                  inevitable doom hanging over me—opening to her my whole heart and life, with all
                  its struggles, its sufferings and its love.
               She listened with one hand clasped in mine as if to hold me still to earth, the
                  other pressed tightly against her heart as though to hush its wild throbbing.
               Never was there a wooing more solemn, with death and love standing on each side
                  the bed struggling for the mastery. Hour after hour passed away, and my waning
                  strength and failing voice, and the speechless agony of the white face that bent
                  above me, told me too surely that the end was very near. Then, as my last act on
                  earth, I drew from my finger a little ring set with a single diamond which I had
                  worn since my mother's death, as her parting gift, and with a trembling, unsteady
                  touch, placed it upon the hand of her whom this night's words had bound to me
                  forever.
               "It is for eternity, Maud," I whispered; and her white lips murmured after mine,
                  "For eternity."
               It was a fearful betrothal, this linking of life with death, with the solemn hush of midnight all around us, and
                  our only witnesses, such unseen visitants from the other world as might be waiting
                  to bear me away forever.
               The effort so exhausted me that I lay for many moments motionless and still. My
                  thoughts became vague, confused and uncertain; earth seemed indeed to be passing
                  away.
               "Maud," I gasped, "it is almost over—I cannot hear the words that you are
                  speaking—sing to me."
               There was a pause, and then upon the stillness broke the soft, low notes of her
                  sweet voice as it rose in the familiar melody of that old hymn that had stolen
                  into my heart like a dream of the past on the evening that we first had met. It
                  grew fainter and fainter as I listened, and a pleasing languor stole over all my
                  senses, that I had neither the wish nor power to break. My eyes closed
                  irresistibly, and for hours I knew nothing.
               When I awoke from the healthy, life-giving sleep that had come to me in the place
                  of death, it was to find her still watching beside me, and my physician standing
                  with his hand upon my wrist.
               "Is it life?" I asked, looking up into his face.
               "It is a miracle," he answered.
               Again there followed nights and days of weary watching, in which I lay almost
                  without power of thought or motion, helpless as a babe; but the crisis had passed,
                  and weakness now was the only difficulty to be overcome; and I read my improvement
                  day by day in the increasing serenity of Maud's sweet face, and the happy light
                  that glowed in her soft eyes. So near had I stood to the boundary of the
                  spirit-world, that for a time its peace seemed to rest upon my life, shutting out
                  the cares and anxieties that I knew must come with returning strength, yet
                  sometimes its calm was broken by a strange pang, as I would see, through the
                  dimness of the darkened room, my ring flashing upon her white hand, and with a
                  moan of agony I would bury my face in the pillows, and pray fervently that death
                  would save me from the misery that restored health must bring to me. For I knew
                  that I had no right to hold her by the vow wrung from her in that hour of anguish
                  and despair; yet how could I part with her now, when my life had become so
                  accustomed to her presence, so dependent upon her for its smallest comforts? I
                  dared not think of it, or of the solitary existence, shorn of all happiness, that
                  must be my portion in the time that was to come. Those days of convalescence might
                  have been very pleasant ones, had it not been for the conflict in my breast that
                  deprived me of all power of enjoyment, and it was with impatience that I heard
                  them day by day speak of my rapid improvement. I did not wish to be better. I
                  would have been willing to lie there weak and suffering forever, with Maud to care
                  for and watch by me; content with the consciousness that I was the one thought and
                  object of her life; content to know that she was sitting beside me with her books
                  or work, pleased and happy when she could win me from the depression that with
                  returning strength seemed to paralyse all my faculties.
               I had thought that I loved her in those early days, that I had suffered in our
                  first separation; yet that love and that suffering seemed as nothing in comparison
                  with the pain I had now to conquer, and which I now must bear.
               Again and again I nerved myself for the trial. Resolutions that the struggle of
                  hours had formed, in the darkness of night, were dissipated in a moment as I
                  looked into her sweet face, and day by day I postponed my self-imposed duty, my
                  weak heart pleading eagerly for a still longer respite from suffering.
               One mild, beautiful afternoon in autumn, my chair had been drawn, as usual, near
                  the open window, that I might better receive the cool breeze that seemed to bring
                  health and life with it. Maud had been reading to me, but my mind was so absorbed
                  with its own sad thoughts, that her words had fallen upon my ear only as
                  meaningless sound; nor was her own attention very firmly riveted, for it was not
                  long before the book dropped listlessly from her hand, and she sank into one of
                  her long, silent reveries, her eyes resting dreamily upon her ring, which flashed
                  and sparkled brilliantly in the sunlight. With eager interest I watched the
                  changes of her face, striving to learn what were the thoughts that lent it its serious sweetness. She
                  looked up at last, and meeting my earnest gaze, a bright flush mounted to her
                  cheek, and her eyes again drooped hastily.
               "I must reclaim that pledge," I said, and even to myself my voice sounded cold and
                  unnatural. "It was given, not for time, but for eternity."
               She started, and the color fading from her cheek and temples, left them as white
                  as marble; then rose, and coming slowly to my side, laid the hand upon which our
                  betrothal ring glowed within mine.
               "Only thus can I return it to you," she said. "I will never leave you
                  again."
               The words were uttered with a quiet emphasis that gave them the solemnity of a
                  vow; and looking into her pale face, I read in its holy light a strength of
                  purpose with which I felt it useless to contend. Turning my head away, I pressed
                  my hand to my eyes to shut her from my sight.
               "I am very weak," I pleaded; "do not tempt me, Maud. I have no right to bind your
                  fresh, young life to one so unfortunate as mine. Even your love must be changed to
                  contempt could I thus sacrifice my honor."
               She did not speak, but I felt the soft, warm clasp of her hand tighten upon
                  mine.
               "God demands no sacrifice of His creatures for which He does not furnish them
                  strength," I added, after a pause; "He will help us. It is His hand that has
                  placed the barrier between us, and our weak wills have not the power to destroy
                  it; and so, Maud, you must forget the wild words I spoke to you when I believed my
                  soul divorced forever from its clay."
               "I will not forget," she answered. "I have the right to choose my
                  fate, and I have chosen. Your life was yielded to my prayers; it has need of mine,
                  and so I claim it. Do not turn from me, else you will tempt me to plead not for
                  your happiness, but my own; will tempt me to forget I am a woman."
               The crimson glowed again over her cheek and brow with the last word, and I felt
                  her tears falling slowly on my hands. She had spoken truly—she had
                  the right to choose—and she had chosen neither blindly nor ignorantly. To my life,
                  alienated so long from human sympathy, had come at last the priceless gift of
                  love. Should I cast it from me recklessly? There was a pause, in which I looked
                  deep down into her eyes, reading her very soul. Then I drew her to my heart.
               "God forgive me if I do you wrong, my beautiful Maud," I said, "but I
                     cannot live without you."
               
               We have made our home in Florence—fairest city of the earth. It is not such a home
                  as I might have offered my wife had my hereditary estates come to me unmortgaged
                  by my vow. Yet when my father's will, naming me as his sole heir, was placed
                  within my hand, it cost me not one single pang to sign away the vast possessions
                  which, thus inherited, must have clung around me as a curse, but which now will
                  bring light and joy to many a poor heart that else had perished in darkness and
                  despair. I scarcely dare to think what in life he would have felt, had he known
                  the uses to which the wealth that he guarded so carefully, would be bestowed; but
                  if souls that have passed from earth have still the power of watching such events
                  as may transpire here, I feel assured that he will not blame me that I have
                  invested it in his name for God.
               Maud and I have little need of wealth. My slender income affords us all the
                  comforts, if not the luxuries, of life. For me, I have not one wish that is left
                  ungratified, having long since ceased to mourn my misfortune, as it has taught me
                  how truly noble is the heart I hold, how pure and perfect its love. I have read
                  somewhere of an artist who, in order to drive away gloomy thoughts, painted upon a
                  panel of his favorite sitting-room the face of an angel, with an expression so
                  joyous, bright and beautiful, that even grief had no power to resist its happy
                  influence. My home owns such an angel; but she whose presence sheds a quiet joy
                  and peace on all who may approach her, is no mere creation of the fancy, for I
                  know her by the holier name of wife. Upon her hand still glows our betrothal
                  ring—the pledge that was given for
                  eternity. Mine she is, not only for a few brief years, but forever.
                  Our marriage was of heart to heart, soul to soul. Death has no power to read us a
                  divorce; for death, which is the tyrant of life, is the slave of love, granting to
                  it an immortality in which only it can attain its highest perfection.
            
            
               ROGER ASCOTT'S STORY.
               I DO not think I remember the time when I was not fond of little Lottie Lewis. I
                  can see her now as she used to stand at her garden gate, in her check calico dress
                  and white sun-bonnet, with her spelling-book in her hand, waiting for me to call
                  for her on my way to school. For we both went to Dame Hobson's school in those
                  days; and as our house was only a little way further up the road, and Lottie was
                  somewhat timid of cows and dogs, of which dangers I of course had all a boy's
                  contempt, I generally acted as her protector; making such ferocious attacks upon
                  the inoffensive cattle, and the small terriers of the neighborhood, that I came in
                  time to be regarded by them as a very dangerous enemy that it was not at all safe
                  to tamper with; and by Lottie as a hero, ranking only next in her esteem to the
                  greatest hero of all, George Washington, about whom we had read in our first book
                  of history.
               Those long walks to the school, through the pleasant summer woods, used to be very
                  delightful. There was a little stream on the way which it was a daily temptation
                  for us to linger and play beside; the water always sang so merrily over the cool,
                  green, slippery stones. Sometimes in the spring, when swollen by heavy rains, it
                  was quite a little river, I was forced to ford it, carrying Lottie in my arms; and
                  then what a great, strong boy I felt myself to be; and when I stopped midway and
                  pretended I was going to drop her in, what a pleasure it was to feel her throw her
                  arms around my neck, and hide her face upon my shoulder, as she would cry out
                  beseechingly, "Oh, no, Roger! Good, dear, kind Roger, please don't!"—though she knew very well all
                  the time that there was no danger, and that I would have waded in up to my neck
                  rather than let her wet one of her little shoes.
               We always found plenty to talk about. Lottie could tell the most beautiful fairy
                  tales that ever were listened to, and she always did so in such a grave, truthful
                  kind of way, that I became at last almost afraid to throw a stone at a squirrel,
                  or even kill a wasp, lest I should inflict a terrible wrong upon some handsome
                  prince or beautiful princess in disguise.
               Then, when she was tired, I had generally some horrible ghost story, equally
                  fascinating, to tell her in return; and to produce a greater effect, I would
                  always choose the darkest and most lonesome part of the woods for its delivery,
                  watching the growing look of terror in her eyes, and her whitening cheek, with
                  self-complacent delight, until at last, unable to bear it longer, she would creep
                  up to my side, whispering tremblingly: "Oh, Roger, Roger, I am so afraid! Please
                  take hold of my hand;" and I would grasp her little soft hand right manfully, and
                  tell her she "Needn't be frightened whilst I was with her, for she
                  knew very well I wouldn't let anything hurt her;" and then as her
                  blue eyes would look trustfully up into my face, I would feel myself to be six
                  feet tall and twenty years old at least.
               All the boys—and the girls too, for the matter of that—at Dame Hobson's school,
                  learned to know that whoever harmed Lottie Lewis had to fight me afterwards, so
                  that even those whom her gentleness failed to win, were careful how they
                  trespassed upon her rights, as most of them stood in some awe of the strong arm
                  that was always used to purpose in her defence. She repaid my devotion to her
                  cause by acting as mediator in the many difficulties in which I involved myself,
                  and her soft, persuasive manner of stating things, and her eloquent pleading in my
                  behalf, had power not unfrequently to soften the heart even of the Dame herself,
                  for whom the long wielding of ferule and birch had gained the reputation of being
                  utterly pitiless, who was heard sometimes dolefully to complain "That it was a
                  very hard case that she could not punish her worst pupil, without inflicting twice
                  as much suffering on her best one, who never gave any one any trouble."
               In our school games, if there was any "choosing" to be done, it grew to be a
                  recognised fact that I would always choose Lottie, and that she would always
                  choose me. No one ever attempted to interfere with my right of pressing her little
                  red lips with mine, for it was well understood that Lottie did not care to be
                  kissed by any one but Roger.
               This was only when we were little children, however, for I shall never forget what
                  disgrace I got myself into the last time we played that game together. It was
                  after I had been away to Uncle Joe's for eighteen months or so, and had come back
                  a great, bashful lad, to find that Lottie had grown into a tall, slight girl, whom
                  I could scarcely recognise as my chubby little playmate. We were spending the
                  evening out together at neighbor Brown's, and towards the latter part of it, some
                  one proposed we should finish off with a play. Of course, when I was put into the
                  ring I chose Lottie. She came into the circle looking very shy and rosy, and they
                  all sang and danced around us until the time for me to kiss her came. Then she did
                  not run and shriek as some of the other girls had done, but stood up straight and
                  looked me steadily in the eyes. "You know you are not to do that, Roger Ascott,"
                  she said. I drew back a little, but the other boys laughed, and cried "Go on,
                  Roger—now's your time!" and before I knew what I was about, I had thrown my arm
                  around her and kissed her soft, crimson cheek. I stood quite frightened and still
                  the next moment, for without saying a single word she broke through the ring and
                  ran out into the porch, and there I heard her sobbing as if her heart would break.
                  I don't think I ever felt so distressed in my life as when I heard those sobs. I
                  could have gone down on my knees, if it would have done any good, and begged
                  forgiveness. But all I could say to her was of no use. She would not answer me a
                  single word, or even look at me; and when the time came for the party to break up,
                  and I inquired humbly "if I might not take her home?" she replied quite
                  distantly," No, I thank you, Mr. Ascott; I prefer to walk with Jenny Smith and her brother," I do not think that
                  the whole world held a more miserable being than myself.
               The girls in the village talked a great deal about our little quarrel, and all
                  united in saying that Lottie had behaved very foolishly, and was "just trying to
                  take airs on herself." But I found that almost all the boys thought the more of
                  her for being a little over-particular; and as for me, after that night there
                  seemed to be quite a change in the way I felt towards her. Not but what, after she
                  had forgiven me, we were just as friendly as we had always been; but I could not
                  talk as freely to her as I once had done, and learned a trick of stammering and
                  losing my self-possession when we were together, which was very disagreeable to
                  myself and wholly incomprehensible to her. Shortly after this she went to boarding
                  school, for her father, who was a well-to-do farmer, said, and rightly too, "that
                  his Lottie had the look of a lady, and ought to have the advantages of one."
               It used to make me feel a little badly sometimes when letters would come from her,
                  and I would hear that she was studying French and music, and I don't know what all
                  besides—it seemed to make such a distance between us; and if she had not always
                  ended with "give my love to Roger," or "tell Roger not to forget me," I hardly
                  think I could have borne it. As it was, I determined I would try to keep up with
                  her as well as I could. So I purchased a share in the village library, and
                  consulted the new schoolmaster, who, after Dame Hobson's death, had taken the
                  school, as to what books it would be most profitable for me to read; and used to
                  sit up late at night, and get up long before work hours in the morning, so as to
                  gain as much time as possible for study. My own family considered me quite a
                  prodigy of learning, and even the people in the village began to look up to me
                  almost as reverentially as they did to the schoolmaster himself. But the very
                  first evening that I spent with Lottie Lewis on her return home after a two years'
                  absence, taught me that if I had been working all this time to raise myself to a
                  level with her, I might as well have spared my pains. "Ah," I said, bitterly, to
                  myself on my way home, "it is of no use after all. It is only a fine material that
                  admits of a fine polish; clay is clay, and marble is marble; and Lottie Lewis is a
                  lady, and Roger Ascott is only—like the rest of those around him."
               This feeling wore away a little, however, as we were more thrown together; Lottie
                  was always so kind, pleasant and good-natured, and so shy too about bringing
                  forward her accomplishments, lest the other girls should say she had grown proud
                  and affected. I found, besides, that my reading, which I had at first so
                  undervalued, was not so useless as it had seemed; for that, although she knew so
                  much more than I did on some subjects, there were a great many things that I could
                  tell her that she did not know. It was very consolatory to my
                  self-love when I found that this was so; nor did Lottie seem to be at all piqued
                  to find that in spite of all her advantages, on some points I had gotten ahead of
                  her.
               She did not allow me, however, to have the monopoly either of her confidence or of
                  the country walks, as I once had. Nor did the young men who had been boys at Dame
                  Hobson's school yield the first place to me as unselfishly as they had in those
                  days. Lottie had her full share of the coquetry, of which few girls of her age are
                  deficient, and appreciated the value of the little privileges she accorded to the
                  throng of admirers around her, balancing them so nicely, however, that no one had
                  the right to be aggrieved, unless perhaps it was myself, who felt as though I was
                  defrauded when any favor was bestowed upon another.
               I had not the face, however, to collar Bob Jones when Lottie presented him with
                  the choicest flower in the little bouquet which I had just given her, or to knock
                  down Jem Smith when she allowed him, instead of me, to help her over the
                  stepping-stones of the little brook I had so often forded with her in my arms,
                  though I must confess I could have done so with a very keen relish. It seemed
                  almost profanation that those rough, coarse men should dare to think of loving
                  Lottie; and that Lottie should encourage them, and even seem to take pleasure in
                  their admiration, rendered me at times fiercely indignant with her; although, of
                  course, I had the sense to keep all such feelings to myself. 'Tis true the distance that separated her from me was
                  scarcely less great, but the difference was that I never sought to push my claims
                  upon her as they did, and never forgot that distance; feeling, that
                  even if in time to come she should be willing to believe that an honest heart and
                  an earnest love could securely bridge the chasm between us, I, even though I might
                  call her wife, would never forget that the nature I had linked to mine was a
                  higher and a purer one.
               Even when we were little children at Dame Hobson's school I used to realise, in a
                  dim, vague kind of a way, the difference between my pet companion, with her soft
                  blue eyes and peach-blossom face, and the rough, rude Jennys and Mollys and Sarah
                  Anns who blundered and cried over their dog-eared spelling books; but now that
                  they were grown, the contrast was still more striking.
               I used to watch my little sister sometimes as she would throw crumbs to her white
                  doves that flew down from their perch into the barnyard, and as I would see them
                  pure and spotless, walking about with such an easy, unconscious grace among the
                  heavy, clumsy fowls that pushed and crowded and fought for the food, I would feel
                  that just so Lottie Lewis walked among the inhabitants of Hiltonville, and ask
                  myself how was it possible that one of those white doves could ever mate itself
                  with a clumsy duck—however good a duck he might be for household purposes—and live
                  down in the barnyard?
               I scarcely know how it was that I first told Lottie that I loved her; I certainly
                  had no thought of doing so that bright summer afternoon that I asked her to walk
                  down to the old schoolhouse which, by the way, had become quite a favorite stroll
                  with the young people since it had fallen into ruin, though the children, who were
                  being educated in the new brick building in the village, which its handsome,
                  gold-lettered sign announced to be the "Institute for Young Ladies and Gentlemen,"
                  regarded it quite contemptuously.
               Lottie and I both concluded, however, as we sat in the little porch overgrown with
                  woodbine and clematis, that the associations tions of our childhood would not have
                  been half so sweet and pleasant if it had not been for this same little country
                  school-house; and we talked in a half-regretful way of the past, as though we were
                  very old indeed, and Lottie recalled many little incidents that I had quite
                  forgotten. The very air of the place seemed to lead our thoughts to the old times,
                  and to bring back the confiding tenderness of tone and manner which had been the
                  habit of those days; and so, when raising her blue eyes to mine, she said simply,
                  "How very kind you always used to be to me, Roger!" I blundered out something in
                  an awkward way that brought a warm flush to her face; and then, finding I had
                  committed myself too far to draw back, I rushed on blindly, scarcely conscious of
                  what I was saying, but only feeling I was giving vent to all those pent-up
                  thoughts and hopes that I had been cherishing for so many years.
               She listened to me without speaking, with her head turned away from me and bent
                  forward a little, nervously twisting and untwisting the strings of the hat that
                  hung from her hand. When I ceased, she still sat in the same position, as though
                  she had not heard what I had been saying, or had quite forgotten that I was there.
                  I stood leaning against a pillar of the little porch, looking down at her, waiting
                  for her to break the long silence, feeling more and more troubled as moment after
                  moment passed and she still sat motionless.
               "Well, Lottie," I said at last, "have you not one word to say to me?"
               "What must I say?" she answered, in a low voice.
               "Say that you love me."
               She raised her hot face suddenly, and threw back the soft curls that clustered
                  around it. "Well, then, Roger, I do love you, with all my heart."
               "Oh, Lottie," I said in a grieved voice, "don't say it in that way, I
                  beg of you!"
               "Well, then, I don't love you—if you like that any better," she answered, a saucy,
                  mischievous smile breaking over her face. "The fact is, Roger," she added, more
                  earnestly, seeing the pain she was
                  giving me, "I don't know whether I do or not, and I don't want to. I like you
                  better than anybody else, as you know very well; but I am too young to think of—of
                  anything of that kind seriously. I mean for the present just to enjoy myself; and
                  as for the future, it must take care of itself." She put her finger playfully to
                  her lips as I would have spoken, and sprang up, declaring it was quite time we had
                  started for home. "It is all nicely settled and fixed," she added, "so don't say
                  another word about it, please, that is a good, kind Roger—I am very sure you do
                  not want to tease me."
               And that was all the satisfaction I could get; and though I went home with a
                  pretty bad heartache, it was some little comfort to feel that Lottie had learned
                  my secret at last; for I knew that though she had forbidden me to speak, the
                  knowledge of my earnest, fervent love would unconsciously to herself, plead my
                  cause more powerfully perhaps than I might ever have been able to have done.
                  Certainly her manner was never quite the same to me after that evening. She laid
                  aside all her coquettish little ways when I was near, and did not seem to care
                  about teasing and provoking me half so much as she once had. With the other young
                  fellows she was just as mischievous and full of fun as ever. But there was a
                  little shy reserve in her way of treating me, which, coupled with a certain
                  hesitancy in her speech at times, and a habit that her eyes had of seeking the
                  ground if she found mine reading her face too earnestly, assured me she had not
                  discarded as valueless the revealings of that afternoon spent at the old
                  schoolhouse. And so the autumn and the winter passed away.
               At Easter, Squire Hilton's son, Charles, came home. His return made quite a
                  commotion in Hiltonville; for although the Squire's family held themselves
                  somewhat aloof from the villagers, still the advent of a handsome young man who
                  had received a college education and spent two years in Europe, was an event of
                  sufficient importance to awaken the keenest interest in the minds of the feminine
                  portion of the community, at least. Foreign travel seemed to have rendered him
                  rather more democratic in his views than formerly, for though as a boy he had
                  treated the villagers with the utmost superciliousness, his object seemed now to
                  be to conciliate and make friends of them; and he was soon on free and easy terms
                  at most of our principal houses, and an honored guest at all our little feasts and
                  merry-makings. I must own that, in spite of the general feeling in his favor, I
                  was inclined to view these advances somewhat suspiciously, even before those
                  suspicions pointed in any definite direction; but when I found that it was always
                  Lottie whom he singled out to honor with his marked attentions—that however polite
                  he might be to the rest of the girls, it was she alone whom he ever invited to
                  share his evening walks—and when I learned finally that he had brought down his
                  guitar to Mr. Lewis's, in order to teach her to accompany herself upon it, I had
                  no difficulty in comprehending what it was that had wrought the change in him.
               It was a very easy thing for me to style him "an insufferable young coxcomb," and
                  to turn into ridicule the fine speeches he made to our rustic belles, whenever I
                  had the opportunity to do so; but there was a stinging consciousness for all, that
                  he was a remarkably handsome and well-educated young fellow, and as far my
                  superior in cultivation and manner as Lottie herself was; and a consciousness,
                  too, that if I felt this, she also must realise it, and make, however unwillingly,
                  to herself, comparison between him and those around her.
               I remember the first time we were thrown in actual contact was at a quilting party
                  at Mr. Wiseman's, soon after his return. I had watched his attentions to Lottie
                  throughout the evening, with a jealous rage that rendered me almost beside myself.
                  Not that there was anything particularly demonstrative in them; but the very quiet
                  self-possession with which he talked to her, and the easy gaiety with which she
                  answered him, so free from the constraint and awkwardness or the ill-concealed
                  delight with which the other girls met his advances, filled me with a vague
                  uneasiness. I realised that she was, and felt herself to be, his equal; and that,
                  gazing down into her pure, refined face, he realised it too, and unconsciously
                  guarded his manner from the easy familiarity liarity that he adopted without scruple towards the
                  rest of the guests.
               As he left her for a few moments, I crossed over to where she was sitting. She
                  received me with a smile and a kind word, to which, however, I replied somewhat
                  discourteously. She looked surprised; and then, as her glance followed mine, which
                  was resting moodily on the young stranger, as he paused to say a few words to
                  Jenny Smith, who was simpering and blushing behind her fan, she asked somewhat
                  mischievously, "What I thought of our new acquisition?" "I think he is a——" I
                  paused just in time, and continued more quietly, "I dare not give a verdict in
                  opposition to all Hiltonville. Of course he is a very fine gentleman, and quite
                  unlike the imperious, dictatorial boy who used to set his dog on any of the
                  villagers whom he found on his father's place. He threatened to set it upon us
                  once, I think, when we crept into his meadow to pluck those pretty blue flowers
                  that grew nowhere else. Do you remember?" She did remember, as I saw by the half
                  resentful look she gave me; but at that moment he came up to her again, and with a
                  smile she turned to him, saying with half-malicious playfulness:
               "Mr. Ascott has just reminded me of a cause of quarrel with you, which I had quite
                  forgotten. He says you threatened to set your dog upon me when I was a little
                  girl."
               "Probably it may have slipped your memory, sir, "I answered to his incredulous
                  look. "It was but a slight affair, after all; but I can very well recall the
                  morning when you ordered us off your grounds, calling us a couple of little ragged
                  beggars, and threatening to set your dog on us if ever you found us there
                  again."
               He looked at me for a moment haughtily, evidently resenting the tone of my words
                  even more than the words themselves. "Really, sir," he answered, coolly, "you have
                  a most excellent memory for offences;" and then, turning from me, he bent over
                  Lottie, who was perfectly white with anger and astonishment, with a whispered
                  sentence that sent a crimson glow flushing all over her face.
               I turned away, feeling sick at heart; bitterly angry with him, and still more
                  angry with myself; for I felt that I had measured strength with him in Lottie's
                  presence, and had been worsted.
               I had engaged to walk home with her that evening, and it was some satisfaction to
                  me to see his disappointed look as I drew her little hand within my arm. My
                  triumph did not last very long, however, for she replied so briefly and concisely
                  to the remarks that I made, that I felt she was very seriously offended with
                  me.
               "I trust, Roger," she said, as we neared the close of our walk, "that you will
                  guard yourself in future—in my presence, at least—from any such displays of temper
                  as I have been witness to to-night. I consider that you have insulted Mr. Hilton
                  very grossly."
               "If it is an insult to recall a fact exactly as it occurred, perhaps I did," I
                  answered. "At all events, I do not regret it."
               "The fact was one that it was utterly unnecessary to recall; therefore it was
                  uncourteous to recall it. Though, after all, it was nothing in itself; it was the
                  offensive manner in which it was repeated to which I principally object."
               "You can scarcely expect the same polish of manner from Dame Hobson's graduate
                  that you find in the young collegian," I answered, bitterly.
               "Perhaps not," she replied, coolly; "but I expect from Roger Ascott that genuine
                  courtesy that, springing from the heart, avoids all topics that can cause
                  embarrassment or painful feeling to those around him."
               Her words stung me, and I retorted by such an angry invective against the
                  purse-proud young aristocrat that Lottie was fairly aroused.
               "He is always gentlemanly, at all events," she said, hotly, "which certainly,
                  to-night, you are not, Roger Ascott." She passed through the gate, which I held
                  open for her, as she spoke, and on into the house. The sound of the closing door
                  awakened me from my temporary fury. What had I done? In the first place quarrelled
                  with Lottie, and in the second given her the right to draw the unfavorable
                  comparison between her new admirer and myself which I had so much dreaded. "He is
                  gentlemanly, and you are
                     not, Roger Ascott." The words seemed to ring in my ear as I turned
                  away from the little gate, which I had never left before without a pressure of her
                  warm, soft little hand and her cheerful good-night; and they haunted my disturbed
                  slumbers with a dreary significance.
               My nature is a very obstinate one, and even though I had suffered so much, I had
                  not the slightest idea of withdrawing from the position I had taken, even to
                  regain Lottie's favor; but when, as I came down the road next morning, I saw her
                  standing just as she used to stand when waiting for me to call for her on the way
                  to school, and I felt that her being there was a token that her tender little
                  heart had forgiven me without waiting for me to confess myself in the wrong, I was
                  deeply touched, and at once eagerly anxious to make the concession which a few
                  moments before had seemed so hard. She pretended not to see me as I came up, and
                  to be very busily looking for something in the grass; but her start of affected
                  surprise, and her "Ah, is it you, Roger?" when I called her, did not deceive
                  me.
               "Lottie," I said, bluntly, "I don't know what induced me to behave as I did last
                  night, and I want to tell you I am sorry for it."
               She gave me a bright glance. "I knew that you would be when you came to think over
                  it," she said; "for it was not like you, Roger."
               "And now you will bid me good-night and good-morning both in one, will you not?" I
                  asked.
               She laughed, and held out her hand, and I grasped it firmly in mine, looking down
                  at her slight, graceful figure, in its neat white morning dress, and her sweet
                  morning face, with a strange choking in my throat.
               "Oh, Lottie!" I said.
               She felt what was in my tone, and stopped me by raising her finger warningly.
                  "Hush, Roger," she said; "you must not—indeed, you must not."
               I turned away with a sigh, but I saw that the eyes that followed me were full of
                  tears.
               And so our first difficulty was amicably settled. But I soon found that my
                  troubles had only just begun; for the Squire's young son had no idea of yielding
                  the field to so unworthy a competitor as myself, and became in a little while so
                  open and demonstrative in his attentions to Lottie, that the whole population of
                  the village found little else to gossip about. It became almost disagreeable for
                  me to visit at Mr. Lewis's, for I always found him there; and as there was little
                  love between us, he repaid my openly expressed dislike with a haughty courtesy
                  that I felt to be far more insulting than absolute rudeness. In the many slight
                  collisions that took place between us, I always found myself worsted; my hot,
                  impetuous temper was no match for his perfect self-restraint and cool, cutting
                  irony; and I could always feel that though Lottie seldom took part in these
                  quarrels, even if it did not shape itself in words, the thought was in her heart,
                  "He is gentlemanly, and you are not, Roger Ascott;" so, as it was
                  painful in the extreme for me to appear to a disadvantage before her, my visits
                  became less and less frequent, until at last they were almost entirely
                  discontinued. Lottie did not ask me, as she once would have done, why this was so.
                  Indeed, she was far less cordial to me than she had been—evidently shrinking from
                  meeting me save in the presence of others, and then replying to my questions with
                  a stiff ceremoniousness entirely unlike her usual frank, cheerful manner. I asked
                  her at last "if I had offended her in any way." She looked much embarrassed, but
                  answered "No." And then I felt more heart-sick than ever, for I had been secretly
                  cherishing the hope that it was some fault of mine which might in
                  time be atoned for, that had produced the estrangement between us.
               Ah, well, I would say bitterly to myself, I must wait, I suppose. The fancies of
                  these fine young gentlemen are proverbially fickle; his will burn itself out
                  before long, and then, perhaps, Lottie Lewis will not be unwilling to receive the
                  old friend who has always been true to her. And hot, indignant tears would fill my
                  eyes, less at the thought of my own wrongs, than in feeling he might have the
                  power of cruelly wounding the innocent heart that relied on him so unsuspiciously.
                  It may have been that, unconsciously
                  sciously to myself, there was a selfish comfort in this thought, painful as it
                  was; but if so, I was punished for it, for shortly after, Hiltonville was
                  electrified by the sight of Squire Hilton's handsome barouche drawing up at Mr.
                  Lewis's gate, and the information spread from mouth to mouth, "that Squire
                  Hilton's lady and daughters were calling upon Lottie." When I found that this was
                  so, my heart sank hopelessly. His attentions then had meant more than I had been
                  willing to suppose, and my fate was indeed sealed; for I knew that the Squire
                  idolised his son, and that the young man's will was the law of the household.
               Other visits followed the first one, and in a short time we learned that Lottie
                  was to go up to the Hall to spend a week with the Squire's young daughters. This
                  last piece of intelligence almost set the Hiltonville people beside themselves.
                  That such distinction should have visited one of their number seemed to reflect
                  honor upon the whole village, and those who had been on free and easy terms with
                  her began to treat her quite deferentially.
               In justice to Lottie, I must say she bore her honors very meekly. Even after her
                  engagement with young Hilton was generally believed, she made not the slightest
                  change in her manner towards any of her former friends, unless it was myself. A
                  little innocent gratification she could not but be expected to feel in her
                  unlooked-for popularity, and elevation of position in the eyes of her humble
                  friends. Nor could the womanly vanity, of which she possessed a full share, fail
                  to be gratified by the knowledge that she engrossed all the thoughts of the
                  elegant young fellow, whose most commonplace remarks were retailed as valuable
                  among the simple villagers, and from whom the most ordinary act of courtesy was
                  received with ill-concealed delight by any one of the other Hiltonville girls.
                  Lottie was too entirely a lady, and respected herself too much, to allow her young
                  lover to suppose, from any change in her manner, that she felt at all elevated by
                  his preference. In fact, she was even more careful than ever before of giving
                  offence to those around her; and the only difference that could be noticed was,
                  that she was not quite so gay as formerly, and save where she felt her refusal to
                  accept invitations might be resented, went as little as possible into society; but
                  her companions, who were inclined to look upon her actions with a lenient eye,
                  said "That engaged people were apt to behave so, and it was very natural that they
                  should."
               Sometimes I would meet them in their evening walks as I would be coming home from
                  work. On these occasions he would always honor me with a very stately bow, which I
                  would respond to by a malignant scowl at him, and a scarcely perceptible
                  inclination to Lottie. It irritated me especially to meet them thus in my dusty
                  coat, offering such a contrast as I did to him. And yet as I would look after
                  them, I could not but feel they were a very handsome couple, and that it was much
                  more fitting as it was, than if it had been as I had once so fondly hoped it might
                  be. How could I blame Lottie that this young stranger had aroused the interest in
                  her heart that my whole life of devotion had failed to awaken? He was to her a
                  being of a higher order from the humdrum, everyday people by whom she had been
                  always surrounded. How different his deferential attentions were from the rude,
                  awkward efforts to please her, to which she had been accustomed. His perfect
                  self-possession too, and mastery of his subject in conversation, combined with
                  that entire ease and grace of manner, to be acquired only by mingling with the
                  world, had to her the charm of novelty, and the appreciation, moreover, of her own
                  exquisite taste. Then, besides, he had the power of opening to her a new world,
                  his continental travels having made him an eye-witness of those miracles of art of
                  whose beauty she had heretofore only read and dreamed: thus his memory was a
                  treasure-house, the wealth of which seemed inexhaustible. He had seen, as Lottie
                  said, everything, and known everybody, in the whole wide world who was worth
                  seeing and knowing. No, I could not blame her. Her higher nature had sought, as
                  was its right, a higher atmosphere; and who was Roger Ascott, that he should
                  condemn her because she would not come down to his level, and live in the
                  barnyard?
               I knew that Lottie's engagement was generally believed in the village, but I felt
                  that the terrible suspense which was wearing out my life could not be quieted into certainty until I
                  had received a confirmation of the report from her own lips. So, when I found that
                  whilst Mr. Hilton was absent from home a few days, a walking party was being
                  formed which she had consented to join, I so arranged it that I was, as though by
                  accident, her escort. I saw, without seeming to observe it, that she was both
                  discomforted and annoyed that this was so, and I talked to her quite collectedly
                  on indifferent subjects, carefully choosing those that I knew were farthest both
                  from her thoughts and mine. When we reached the brook she complained of being so
                  very much fatigued, that I proposed we should rest for a little while. The others
                  followed our example at first, but gradually one couple after another strolled
                  away until we were left there alone. It was a new thing for Lottie to complain of
                  weariness, and as I looked at her after she had removed her hat, I saw that she
                  seemed to be very far from well. There was a restless look in her large eyes, that
                  seemed larger and brighter than ever, and the color in her cheek was not the
                  steady bloom it once had been, but came and went with every passing thought,
                  whilst the whole face had a fragile delicacy of beauty that caused me a vague
                  uneasiness. She seemed to have lost the restraint that had so oppressed her in the
                  early part of our walk. The familiar spot brought back the old cordial
                  friendliness, and she talked to me as though she had quite forgotten that for the
                  past six months we had been comparatively strangers. Some chance mention of Mr.
                  Hilton's name all at once brought back the old chill, and making a motion as
                  though to rise, she murmured something about being quite able to go on now, and
                  that it was time we were at home. "Stay," I said, "it is not late yet, Lottie, and
                  I want to talk with you a little while," and then, as is generally my custom, I
                  went directly to the point.
               "I have been waiting for a long time for this opportunity. I wish to hear from
                  your own lips whether or not you are engaged to Squire Hilton's young son."
               The color flushed all over her face, whether with embarrassment or anger I could
                  not tell. "And suppose I should be, Roger Ascott," she said, half resentfully,
                  "what right would you have to oppose it?"
               "None," I replied. "I only wish to know the truth, whether it be so
                  or not."
               I stood looking down at her, as she slowly plucked the little blue flowers that
                  grew beside her and threw them one by one into the stream.
               "And if it should be so," she said, "I don't see why I am to be
                  blamed so bitterly; I am sure he is in every way worthy of far more than I can
                  ever bring to him. Any woman, however high her station, might be proud to be
                  singled out by him."
               "Perhaps so," I replied; "nor have I spoken, as you imply, one single word of
                  blame. I had once hoped, as you know very well, that it might be different; but
                  perhaps it is best and right that it should be as it is. He can offer you much of
                  which you must have been deprived with me; and since he loves you, and you, I
                  suppose, love him—"
               "Suppose!" she interrupted me almost fiercely; "what right have you, Roger Ascott,
                  to question my love for him? But you steeled your heart against him from the very
                  first, and would hear nothing in his favor, and now you are willing to misjudge me
                  only because you think he cares for me. It is cruel and hardhearted in you to
                  tease and torment me so," and she burst into a gusty little fit of weeping.
               "Lottie," I said mournfully, "you are causing both yourself and me a great deal of
                  unnecessary pain. I will have suffering enough to bear in my life, and I should
                  not think you would wish to increase it. Answer me this one question without
                  equivocation, and then we will go home. Are you, or are you not, engaged to
                  Charles Hilton?"
               Something in my manner seemed to impress her, for she ceased sobbing, and looked
                  up at me with a face perfectly colorless.
               "Yes, Roger," she said, "we are to be married on the first day of October." And
                  then she rose, and I drew her hand through my arm, and we walked home silently
                  through the forest.
               But after she had passed in through the little gate, and I was turning away, she
                  came out again, and laid her hand upon my arm. "Roger," she said, "you will
                  forgive me, I am very sure, for the
                  hasty words I spoke to you this afternoon. And—and—Roger, after I am—after it is
                  all over, you will still be my friend, will you not? You have been so good and
                  patient with me always, and have cared for me so long, that I cannot bear to feel
                  that I must lose you altogether."
               "Lottie," I said, "you don't know what you ask. I have never been
                  your friend—I have loved you ever since I was no higher
                  than this gate-post. After the first day of October I must go away and never see
                  you again. I should be acting wickedly towards you, and falsely to myself, if I
                  did not. Only believe this," I added, with a sudden, almost convulsive sob, "that
                  I have no hard feelings against you, and that I shall pray for your happiness
                  wherever I may go."
               And so I left her and went on to my own home, and by the time I reached there I
                  felt dizzy and sick, and my mother said, "Roger, you are not well; you have quite
                  a high fever, and must go to bed." So I obeyed her, caring little what became of
                  me, and out of that bed I did not rise again for many a long week.
               I was not dangerously ill; it was a low, nervous fever, the doctor said. He did
                  not suspect what was the matter, but I think my mother did; she was so tender and
                  gentle with me, keeping the sharp tones out of her voice that a life of care had
                  tangled in with its natural sweetness; and I felt very grateful to her for her
                  sympathy, and still more grateful that she sympathised in silence, for I felt that
                  I could not bear even her hand to touch the wound that was causing me such
                  agony.
               Lottie used to send down every day to know how I was. Sometimes she would come
                  herself, and I would hear her low, earnest voice as she talked outside my door
                  with my mother. She would often, too, bring me rare, luscious fruits that she
                  thought could scarcely fail to tempt my appetite; but as I knew she could only
                  have procured them from the Squire's hot-house, I felt that every drop of their
                  cool juice would search my tongue as though it had been hot lead. Of course, I
                  knew that in time I must learn to realise her in her new position, but I was not
                  prepared just then for her to begin to play Lady Bountiful to me.
               I got about again at last, however, and then I felt that I ought to be very
                  grateful to the fever, for people attributed my bad looks and low spirits to my
                  long illness, and I was spared from becoming the object of the pitying curiosity
                  that else might have sought to drag my hidden troubles to the light. I heard that
                  Lottie's wedding preparations were quietly going on, although it seemed she was
                  far less communicative about her plans than suited the wishes of her neighbors. I
                  shrank sensitively from every allusion to her; and my mother, who watched each
                  expression of my face with anxious care, skilfully warded off the conversation
                  from what she felt intuitively to be a painful subject, whenever any of our
                  acquaintances dropped in.
               My chief, in fact my only pleasure, was to wander off alone into the forest; for
                  there everything spoke to me of her, and the associations with her as child, girl,
                  and maiden, were so tender and so pure, and the woods were so still and holy, that
                  they hushed my restless thoughts into a passive quietness that might almost have
                  been called happiness, since it was the lulling of misery.
               One afternoon in autumn, I wandered down as usual to the brook. Everything in
                  nature was beginning to look sad and dreary, and it was with a morbid pleasure
                  that I watched the dry crisp leaves, that once had been so green and beautiful, as
                  the wind seized them and bore them in eddying circles to the ground. The very sky
                  above me was no longer blue and brilliant, but lowering and overcast; and it
                  seemed to me that even the little stream that in the summer time had made such
                  merry music, now sent forth a sound like the sighing of one in pain. As I
                  approached the brook, I started back with a low cry of surprise, for, if my eyes
                  were not playing me false, it was Lottie who sat upon the bank, gazing down with a
                  sad, troubled look into its rippling waters. She arose when she saw me, and gave
                  me her hand, and I noticed that her face was very white, and had a quiet, grave
                  look upon it that I had never seen there before. Finding that I was trembling too
                  much to stand, she drew me down to a seat beside her, and then she talked to me
                  about my illness in a kind, friendly way; and I tried to answer her cheerfully,
                  for I felt that she had probably bably
                  grieved over the hasty words she had spoken to me the last time we talked
                  together, and desired before her marriage parted us forever, to assure herself
                  that there was peace between us; and I wished her to feel that I understood her
                  motive, and appreciated the effort it must have cost her to seek this
                  interview.
               "Roger," she said at last, and as she spoke, a bright glow sprang into her cheek,
                  "do you know that Charles Hilton has gone away?"
               I thought it was cruel in her to mention his name just then, but I replied very
                  quietly, "No, that I had not heard it, and that I troubled myself
                  very little about the gossip in which so many of my neighbors took so keen an
                  interest."
               "Well," she said slowly, "he has gone away, and—he is not coming back again—at
                  least not for a long, long time."
               I understood her white face then, and my whole nature was aroused into
                  indignation. "It is as I feared it would be then," I cried, "my poor little
                  Lottie! That false, selfish heart has robbed yours of its happiness only to
                  gratify its miserable vanity. May——"
               "Hush!" she cried, raising her hand appealingly, "not one word against him; don't
                  harm him by a single doubt. I have wronged him enough already; I—I sent him away,
                  Roger!"
               "You?" I looked at her incredulously.
               "Yes," she said, sobbing, "I have sent him away; I have told him I could never be
                  his wife, because—because I loved some one else better than I did him."
               "What does this mean?" I said, confusedly; "my mind is not so strong as it was
                  before my illness, I cannot comprehend it. You have sent him away—you love—who is
                  it that you love?"
               The ghost of a mischievous smile lighted Lottie's tearful face for a moment; the
                  next, she had hidden it on my shoulder.
               "Oh, Roger! foolish, foolish Roger!" she said, "is it because you
                     really don't know, or because you don't care to know?"
               Then the truth flashed on me, and my heart gave a great leap of joy. "Mine!—all
                  mine!—mine at last!" Oh, what a moment that was!
               But when the first delirium of joy had passed, another thought came like a cold
                  grey cloud over my perfect happiness.
               "Lottie," I said, "how has this happened?"
               "Don't ask me," she said, "I have been so weak—so wicked. When you know all, it
                  may be you will feel that I am not worthy to be your wife; and I am not, Roger,
                  nor the wife of any other true man. I don't know how I was led on to act as I have
                  done; I did not mean to do wrong at first. You know he was so different from any
                  one I had ever known before, it was only natural that I should be pleased and
                  flattered by his attentions. And then you remember how every one around me talked
                  about him, and as I listened to their praises of him, foolish dreams and notions
                  began to creep into my head, and I thought what a fine thing it would be to be a
                  lady and ride in my own coach, though that was only in a general way at first; and
                  I often lay awake at night, and thought if I were rich how much good I would do
                  with my money, and how every one should learn to bless the good lady at the Hall.
                  And so gradually my mind became familiarised with the thought. It was about that
                  time I began to change towards you, Roger; for though I did not know how much I
                  cared for you, I knew that I was wronging you, and felt uncomfortable and
                  self-condemned whenever we met. And then I went to the Hall to stay, and
                  everything was so elegant there, and so different from what I had been accustomed
                  to, that I seemed to be living in an enchanted world; and when Charles Hilton
                  addressed me soon afterwards, and I found how entirely and devotedly he loved me,
                  I told him that I would be his wife. But, oh, how miserable that first night was
                  after I gave him my promise, and how many times I determined I would recall it the
                  next morning! Yet when the next morning came, and my busy, daily duties commenced,
                  things looked differently to me, and I said to myself, 'It is too late to draw
                  back; what is done is done, and I have no right to undo it.' And I liked and
                  respected him so much that I thought, 'I cannot help learning to love him after a
                  while—many a happy marriage has commenced without love.' And so I stifled my
                  conscience, and tried to be gay and cheerful as I had always been, but every little kindness and
                  manifestation of affection on his part made me feel myself a hypocrite; for though
                  I liked to have him with me, and if he had been only a friend there were few whose
                  society I should have enjoyed more, still I felt that I did not care for him as he
                  thought that I did, and that, however I might try to palliate it to myself, I was
                  cruelly deceiving him. And when I would meet you as we were walking together, I
                  would not dare to ask myself what the sudden, quick throbbing of my heart meant,
                  and sometimes I would quite forget to answer what he was saying for thinking how I
                  would have felt if it had been upon your arm I had been leaning as your promised
                  wife. Oh, those were dark times, Roger—dark, wicked times! And when he asked me to
                  fix the day for our wedding, I was glad to do so; for I thought, 'When I am really
                  married, the struggle will be over, and I will not be so wretched. And he shall
                  never know that I do not care for him as much perhaps as I ought, for I will do my
                  duty by him faithfully;' for I did not realise then that the highest duty of a
                  wife is to love, and that if she fails in that, she has failed in
                  all. But after that last afternoon that we spent here in the woods, you and I, it
                  all became quite clear to me. I knew then, not only that I did not
                  love him, but that I did love you, Roger, and that love could only be
                  rooted out of my heart with its life itself. You cannot imagine how utterly
                  wretched I was during those long, long weeks that you were ill. I had been doing
                  wrong so long that it seemed to me my conscience was not capable of telling me
                  what was right. I felt that I ought not to go on with it; but now
                  that my engagement had progressed so far, it seemed such a terrible sin to break
                  it that I scarcely dared to do so. Then I knew, too, what you thought about such
                  things, and the tempter said to me, 'Lottie Lewis, Roger Ascott is an honorable
                  man; and when he learns how you have been behaving, he will despise you as
                  thoroughly as you despise yourself, and you will lose even his
                     friendship, when he finds you no longer worthy his confidence. You
                  had better let things continue as they are, and then you can at least make one
                  happy, whilst otherwise you must make three miserable.' And so I listened to him,
                  and waited and waited, and had not strength to do what I knew I ought. And when
                  you got about again, every time I met you, the sight of your white face went to my
                  heart like the stab of a knife; and every morning when I rose, I would tremble to
                  feel that I was one day nearer the time that I had learned to look forward to
                  almost with terror.
               "A few nights ago, I wakened from a deep sleep, with my mind perfectly clear, and
                  all its faculties alive, and I could not turn the subject from me, as I had so
                  long been in the habit of doing; and then all at once I realised the precipice
                  upon which I stood, and felt that, if I broke my engagement, the sin would be, not
                  in breaking it, but in ever having formed it, and that to go on with it, would
                  only be involving myself still further in wrong. Then again the tempter whispered,
                  'Do you owe nothing to the lover whom you have so cruelly deceived? You have
                  wronged him enough already by unfaithfulness. Only the devotion of a lifetime can
                  atone for that wrong.' But I answered firmly, 'Yes, I owe to his sincere affection
                  that he should know the truth. If it is sin now, that he does not hold the first
                  place in my heart, when I am pledged to him by my word only—when I am his wife, it
                  would be crime.' And then it seemed to me that, for the first time, I
                  realised how utterly I had deceived myself, when I had fancied it could be a duty
                  to go on for years living the lie that I had been acting for months. And I felt
                  that it would be like chaining the living to the dead, to bind his warm, loving
                  heart to one so cold as mine, and shuddered as I thought how he must have felt
                  towards me when he found out, as he would after a while, how I had misled him.
                  True, he would suffer now, but it would not be that suffering, for
                  now we could part. And then I threw myself beside my bed, and prayed that I might
                  have strength to make my confession to him before another day should pass; and
                  when I arose from my knees, I sat down by the window and waited for the day to
                  break, for I dared not sleep again until this duty was performed—realising, as I
                  did, that if resolution failed me now, I was lost. In the first early
                  grey of dawn I wrote my little note, begging him to come to me at once. When it
                  was actually sealed and directed I felt
                  a great weight taken off my heart, and sat there watching the sun rise, holding it
                  in my hand until it grew late enough to send it, with a feeling of peace and quiet
                  I had not known for many months. It was not very long before he came. Something
                  either in the incoherence of its sentences, or the tremulousness of the
                  handwriting, led him to suppose that some trouble awaited him, and I saw that he
                  looked pale and anxious. I could not speak one word to him, but passively allowed
                  him to lead me into the little sitting room; but when the door was closed, and he
                  drew me towards him, and brushing my curls back from my forehead, said: 'And now,
                  what is it, darling?'—Oh! Roger, Roger, you must not ask me what passed in that
                  interview. God in his mercy may grant perhaps, that in time I may forget it; but
                  the knowledge of his misery must be to me a lifelong punishment, almost greater
                  than I have strength to bear. He forgave me before he went away, but I shall never
                  forgive myself—never! never!"
               She had spoken heretofore in a low, strained voice, which suppressed excitement
                  had rendered unnatural and almost harsh; now it failed her suddenly, and bowing
                  her head upon her hands, wept silently those bitter, bitter tears of repentance
                  that a true woman should never have cause to shed. My head too was bowed under a
                  keen, terrible sense of suffering, such as I had never known before. Sweet and
                  precious as was the consciousness of Lottie's love for me, I would have foregone
                  it—yes, in that first hour of anguish I felt I would rather have followed her to
                  her grave upon that autumn afternoon, than to have listened to this confession of
                  unworthiness from her lips. She had been my ideal woman, stainless and pure; and
                  through life I had yielded her the love, not unmixed with reverence, which a man
                  should feel for her whom he has chosen for his wife. Nay, I had gone still
                  further, an accusing conscience whispered, for I felt that I had given her the
                     first place in my heart; that in deciding any debated point I had
                  asked myself, not "Is it right?" but "What will Lottie think?" Was this my
                  punishment that she stood before me now, convicted of a heartlessness, a perfidy,
                  from the consciousness of which the rudest of her village companions might have
                  shrunk with shame? Bitter as the thought was, I could not turn it from me, nor
                  question the justice of the stroke, for I knew that God is at war with idols, and
                  that though He has granted us the right to love, He has forbidden us to
                  worship.
               Lottie's voice, now soft and tremulous in its tone, aroused me at last with a keen
                  spasm of pain. "I have told you all this," she said, "because I wished that you
                  should learn the facts as they really were, from my own lips, and because, since I
                  know that you have cared for me in the past, and that I have caused you very great
                  suffering, I thought it right that you should also know that I have—that I do love
                  you; and that if I have still the power to make you happy, I am willing to be your
                  wife; but if, as I suppose, I have forfeited your esteem forever, and you choose
                  to cast me from you as unworthy respect and affection, I shall feel that it is
                  only what I deserve."
               They were brave words for a woman to speak, and I understood and respected the
                  spirit that prompted my timid, sensitive Lottie to thus seemingly forget her
                  womanliness. But many and contending feelings were at war in my breast, and I
                  dared not raise my bowed head, or speak the thoughts that were rising in my
                  heart.
               She misinterpreted my silence. "I thought it would be so," she said; "I knew it
                  must be so. I do not blame you, Roger."
               She rose to leave me as she spoke, and then I looked up at her. Her cheek was very
                  pale, and her soft blue eyes held an expression of woe in them that pierced me to
                  the soul, whilst her lips quivered convulsively like those of a grieved child.
               It was but a momentary glimpse I caught of her face, for from a sudden impulse I
                  drew her to my side and hid it on my breast. "No, Lottie," I said, "I cannot lose
                  you now. Surely we poor, frail human beings, to whom God forgives so much, should
                  be willing to forgive one another."
               And as she lay with her bright head pillowed on my heart, sobbing wearily, I
                  realised, with a deep, earnest sense of thankfulness, that if I had lost the ideal
                  before which I had bowed so long in
                  tender reverence, I had gained the right to guide and guard the life that had
                  given itself into my keeping. I had no fear for her future. I felt that she had
                  come out purified from the baptism of suffering through which she had passed; that
                  to the penitent, God sometimes so overrules a step downward that it becomes a step
                  heavenward, and that a lesson had been learned well worthy the pain it had cost
                  her.
               Our walk home was almost a silent one, yet how unlike that last silent walk
                  through the green summer woods, when the gulf of an eternal separation seemed to
                  lie between our hearts! Now in the soul of each was a deep, quiet joy that needed
                  no expression in words, yet a joy saddened and solemnised to both by the knowledge
                  of another's wrong and suffering.
               Great was the indignation of Hiltonville when it learned that Lottie Lewis was to
                  marry Roger Ascott instead of the young Squire, as he was generally called; but
                  feeling ran highest in the little circle of intimates by whom she was surrounded,
                  who had fully expected, through their friendship with its future mistress, to gain
                  a foothold as visiting acquaintances at the Hall, and whose disappointment and
                  chagrin at the loss of this much coveted privilege, could with difficulty be
                  concealed. It seemed indeed that they could scarcely forgive Lottie for the sudden
                  overthrow of their ambitious hopes, and punished her, as is the fashion in larger
                  and more influential places than Hiltonville, by the infliction of those cruel,
                  stinging little wounds that friendly hands know how to send home to the tenderest
                  and most vulnerable points of the pride or self-love of the victim, whose weakness
                  or misfortune has exposed her to the lash.
               "Everybody had known all along, of course, that it would never come to anything;
                  that the young Squire was only amusing himself, and that she was a silly little
                  simpleton to have allowed herself, to be taken in by his professions. To be sure,
                  she was not to be blamed, poor girl; though, as she had always been somewhat
                  uppish in her notions, probably it would prove a good lesson for her."
               No one would admit for a moment the possibility of Lottie's having voluntarily
                  resigned her claim to her wealthy lover. Indeed, her very efforts at first to
                  exculpate him, implying thereby that she herself had been in fault, aroused such a
                  storm of indignation around her, that she concluded her wisest course lay in
                  perfect silence. "It was all very well for her to talk in that way," the
                  Hiltonville ladies remarked confidentially to each other, "but everybody knew how
                  much of such nonsense to believe. It was very likely, was it not?—she would throw
                  away a chance of that kind; though of course she must make the best story for
                  herself that she could." And then those who were marriageable would sigh audibly
                  and murmur, "They were so sorry for poor Lottie's disappointment,"
                  and their mothers would roll up their eyes and "Thank their stars" that
                     their girls had a little common-sense, and too much self-respect
                  to be trying to reach after things that were above them." In fact, our little
                  village was very much like the rest of the world; and though every one chose to
                  believe the young Squire to be the offender, no one seemed inclined to be at all
                  harsh in their judgment of him; and though every one professed to believe Lottie
                  entirely innocent, they pitied her in a severe way that implied she had been very
                  much to blame.
               The sweetness and humility with which she bore her loss of popularity, and the
                  simple dignity, unmixed with anger, with which she repelled the intrusive
                  curiosity and hypocritical sympathy of her many friends, and the patience with
                  which she submitted to the ceaseless reproaches of Mr. Lewis, who had prided
                  himself not a little on his position as prospective father-in-law to the future
                  Squire, assured me more than anything else of the genuineness of her repentance.
                  She seemed in fact to accept whatever was unpleasant in her present situation as a
                  portion of the punishment that she had richly merited, and it pleased me to see
                  how entirely all thought of self seemed to be merged in the desire to save him
                  whom she had wronged, from reproach. "Oh, Roger," she would say tearfully, "if it
                  only had been as they believe! If he only had trifled with me, and I had been free
                  from blame, how painless to me their pity must have been! But now, I feel that each word of sympathy I listen to is a
                  stab at his honor. Yet I have no power to shield him, and the wrong that I have
                  done him seems to grow in stature day by day."
               I made no attempt to extenuate her fault to her, or to lessen her self-reproaches;
                  but the consciousness of her suffering seemed to awaken in my heart a tenderness
                  of affection that she had never before called forth. The very bitterness and
                  unkindness of those around us, from which she sought refuge in my love, seemed to
                  give it a right of protection which grew more and more precious. It is true, I had
                  ceased to thrill and tremble in her presence, and the knowledge of her failure in
                  duty had swept away many delusions which time must at all events have destroyed;
                  and I was glad that it was so, for I question if any man's love is worthy the
                  name, until he has met and faced the thought that she whom he has worshipped as
                  uniting in one person all the impossible virtues, is a poor, frail human being
                  like himself, subject to all the trials and temptations with which the evil one
                  assails his peace of mind, and often with far less strength to meet
                  them. If there is any genuineness in that love, his idol must become to him a
                  woman before she is worthy to take the place in his heart which should be sacred
                  only to his wife.
               And why, after all, should he claim from her what he has not in his power to give?
                  If she has faults, he doubtless has plenty to counterbalance them. If he has to
                  forgive some things, she has to forgive more. Few of us, I think, can look back to
                  our early dreams without a feeling of thankfulness that the moulding of our
                  fortunes has not been given into our own hands. So far as my individual experience
                  is concerned, I freely acknowledge that had my little Lottie been the exquisite
                  ideal that my boyish fancy pictured her, I must have gone through life with the
                  depressing consciousness that I, Roger Ascott, was a very unfit companion for her.
                  As it is, in the long journey we have travelled together, we have found, I
                  believe, little to complain of in each other. My wife is far more precious to me,
                  and quite as lovely in my eyes, as the young bride who, so many years ago, I
                  brought, on that bright New Year's morning, to our pleasant little home. Her cheek
                  is not quite so round, nor her step so elastic as in the old days; but the same
                  soft, loving light lives in her eyes; and though her face has lost its former glad
                  brightness, the chastened, holy tenderness of its expression is far more beautiful
                  to me, for I know it is the shadow of the great sorrow that fell upon us in the
                  first years of our married life, when the angel of death bore our little Roger
                  from us. It seemed hard then that our home should be childless, yet the knowledge
                  that we had only each other to depend upon may have made the bond between us a
                  still nearer and tenderer one; and when late in life our little Lottie came, I at
                  first almost felt to grudge her her portion of the love of which I had had so long
                  the monopoly. Yet this child of our old age has always seemed to both of us a
                  special gift of mercy, sent like a sunbeam to brighten our last days; and so
                  precious has she grown, that it is with almost painful significance that each
                  night and morning we in earnest humility breathe forth the petition, "Lord, keep
                  us from idols."
               Our bright, merry darling, she grows day by day more like what her mother was at
                  her age; and it seems to me that of late years a tenderer feeling has grown into
                  my love for her than even in her baby days, for in some strange way she seems to
                  bring back the past and link it with the present. I think my dear wife comprehends
                  this feeling, for it was but the other day when I had been sitting for a long time
                  gazing musingly at our daughter, who was bending over some pretty work, with her
                  soft curls shading her peach-blossom face, that she laid her hand gently on my
                  shoulder:
               "Ah, Roger," she said, half jestingly, "you are thinking of other times, I know.
                  Take care, else I shall be jealous of my old self."
               I looked thoughtfully from one to the other for a moment without replying, then I
                  drew her head down to my breast. "There is no need, Charlotte," I said; "you are
                  just as I would have you. The shadowed face is dearer to me than the sunlit one
                  and I love these wrinkles far better than dimples."
               Others beside myself have learned to follow the light, graceful figure of my little girl with glances of
                  admiration; and it is with some natural pride, not unmixed with amusement, that I
                  see the young fellows pushing and crowding each other after service on the
                  Sabbath, in order to get a word or a smile from her as she passes by. She seems to
                  be entirely unconscious, the innocent darling, of the commotion her presence
                  always excites among the rustic beaux, and is only happy in the consciousness that
                  everybody loves and is kind to her. But I, who have learned to read the signs of
                  the times better, forebode trouble ahead. I know, of all worldly possessions, a
                  young daughter of eighteen is the most precarious, and I foresee that before long
                  some of these presumptuous young rascals will be asking me for my Lottie in the
                  most matter-of-course manner imaginable; and then if I demur, or show the least
                  reluctance to part with the child who has been all mine so long, whom I have
                  watched over in sickness and cared for in health, and who has made herself a
                  necessary part of my very daily life, I will be a cruel, hard-hearted parent, and
                  all Hiltonville will be talking of my persecution of the young lovers.
               For Hiltonville talks still. And it has a bit of gossip on hand now that may
                  perhaps have the credit of provoking the last few sentences. I am trying very hard
                  to make up my mind that it is not true, but I seem to read a confirmation of it
                  sometimes in Lottie's eyes, and in the deeper glow that mounts to her dimpled
                  cheek as a certain name is mentioned in her presence. Well, well, I might have
                  known how it would be when I allowed that handsome boy to hang about the house as
                  he has been doing lately. Not that there is a cleverer young fellow in the whole
                  county, or for the matter of that in the country itself, than Arthur Hilton; but I
                  cannot bear the thought of losing my Lottie—not yet, or for a long, long time at
                  least.
               And that reminds me that I should have told how, when his father died five years
                  after our marriage, Charles Hilton came home to take his place, bringing with him
                  a young Spanish bride who could speak but few words of English, but whose sweet,
                  childish face, and gentle, courteous manners won golden opinions from those
                  competent critics whose right it was to pronounce judgment in Hiltonville; and
                  how, as the new Squire expressed a wish that Lottie and she should be friends, my
                  wife took the shy, sensitive stranger at once to her womanly heart, and they
                  became firm allies. She it was who watched night and day for weeks by her bedside
                  during her last long illness, and took the little infant Arthur from her dying
                  arms, promising that he should never lack a mother's care and counsel whilst she
                  was upon the earth. And thus it has happened that almost as much of the boy's life
                  has been spent at the cottage as at the Hall. It is only natural, of course, that
                  thrown together as they have been from babyhood, the children should be fond of
                  each other, and right and proper enough in its way; and I might have laughed at
                  Hiltonville talk, and let things take their course without thinking of
                  consequences, had it not been for something that occurred last Sabbath. We were
                  walking home from church, my wife and I, and Lottie and Arthur were, as usual, a
                  little ahead of us, and I had just remarked "that I did not believe there was a
                  finer looking couple than they in the whole of England," when the Squire joined
                  us. He too watched the young people for a while in silence, then he turned to me
                  with a laugh.
               "We shall have a little Lottie as mistress of the Hall yet, if I am not mistaken,
                  in spite of you, Roger Ascott." And then as the color flushed up into my wife's
                  soft cheek, he added in a grave, serious way, bending one of those looks on her I
                  so well remembered: "You will trust him with your treasure, will you not? He is a
                  good lad, and worthy, I believe, of a true woman's love."
               And she, looking up with full eyes and trembling lips, answered in a low voice:
                  "It is a justice that I cannot question, that will rob our home of its darling to
                  add brightness and beauty to yours. I am glad that it must be so. It seems, in
                  some sort, an atonement for the past."
               It was the first allusion in all the years that had gone by to the wrong she had
                  done his love, and it touched him, for as he turned hastily away, I saw that his
                  eyes too were full of tears, and that his lips trembled scarcely less than
                  hers.
               We walked home in silence after that. The thought suggested by this little episode, however familiar it might
                  be to my wife, was a decidedly new and unpalatable one to me; and as I parted with
                  the young fellow at the gate, I fear that my manner was far less cordial to him
                  than usual. Indeed, I was aware of a half-formed impulse to order him off the
                  premises altogether; which I knew, however, must not be carried into effect. I
                  wandered about restlessly enough through the afternoon, but finding myself unable
                  to solve my own doubts, and concluding a straightforward course was best, I walked
                  right up to where Lottie was standing, and taking her chin in my hand, raised her
                  face so that I could read its expression.
               "Daughter," I said, "are you really fond of Arthur Hilton?"
               She looked up at me, her eyes full of innocent surprise. "Fond of Arthur?—what a
                  question, father! Why, of course I am!" Then all at once a crimson glow flushed to
                  her very temples, and breaking from me suddenly, she ran out of the room. When she
                  came down to tea, there were traces of tears on her cheeks, and her eyes drooped
                  consciously as they met mine; so I fear I did mischief after all by putting a
                  thought into her head that I verily believe had never entered it before.
               Why is it that these Hiltons cannot be satisfied without just the very thing upon
                  which I have most set my heart? Why is it that my treasures are the only ones that
                  seem to have the least value in their eyes? Wasn't it enough that this young
                  fellow's father nearly turned my hair grey with distress thirty years ago, that
                  now his son must follow in his footsteps, and bring a new trouble upon me in my
                  old age? What a bitter old cynic any one might suppose me to be, that heard me
                  grumbling in this way! Ought I not rather rejoice if my Lottie should find a
                  stout, strong arm to guard and guide her when mine is dust? Should I not thank God
                  that he, to whom I must in time confide her, is earnest and true, and well worthy,
                  as his father says, of the best blessing that can come to a man's life, a pure and
                  true wife? Yes, I know that well enough, and I shall reconcile it after a while, I
                  suppose, but not just yet.
               All the while that I have been writing this afternoon, the two have been sitting
                  out together in the vine-covered porch, talking very earnestly. I wonder how they
                  find so much to say! However, thoughts run lightly over young lips. Lottie is
                  silent just now, and her head is turned away from me and drooping forward a
                  little. How like the child is to her mother! her very attitude is a familiar one.
                  How the boy's face flushes as he talks! What a picture the open doorway frames to
                  me—it is a study for an artist. They are coming in now. Ah! he has taken her
                  hand—what does it mean? I see, I see; it has come, I suppose, and I must submit.
                  It is the same story that I learned thirty years ago; old as the world, yet new to
                  each young heart. Can I question my child's right to her romance? Would I wish her
                  life to grow grey without having known that exquisite rosy glow that can come to
                  it only in its spring-time. No, no; Lottie is dear to me, but her happiness is
                  dearer. I must speak no word that will cast a chill upon her joy. This day must be
                  to her sacred only to happy memories.
               
               It has been three months since I laid down my pen. I knew then, as I saw the deep,
                  soft light in my Lottie's eyes and the crimson blush that mounted to her very
                  brow, what that long afternoon's talk had been about; and so, without a word, I
                  took my little daughter to my heart, and when she trembled into tears, I brushed
                  back the soft hair and kissed her wet cheek. "There, my darling, my birdie," I
                  whispered, "go to your mother and I will talk with Arthur." Yet when she was gone,
                  and he and I stood alone together, and I felt his eager, anxious eyes reading my
                  face, I found I had nothing to say after all. But when alarmed at my silence he
                  came to my side, saying in an earnest voice, "You will give her to
                  me, Mr. Ascott?—it is a great gift that I ask, I know; but I appreciate its value
                  and your sacrifice," what could I do but grasp his outstretched hand and answer in
                  a low, troubled way, "Yes, yes, it must be so, I suppose; young hearts must be
                  happy though old ones break. Take her, and be worthy of her if you can."
               And so, having once resigned her, I tried to accustom myself to the thought, and to take an interest in the busy
                  preparations going on around me; but when this morning's sun aroused me to the
                  consciousness that Lottie's wedding-day had dawned at last, I arose with a weary
                  sense of pain around my heart I had not felt before for many years.
               How fair and sweet our darling looked in her pure white bridal dress as she stood
                  before the little altar, where thirty years ago her mother gave her life into my
                  keeping! There seemed to me an unreality in all that was passing around me—that
                  strange confusing of the past with the present, with which I am troubled
                  sometimes; the faint perfume of orange blossoms, the purple and crimson light that
                  floated in through the small stained windows, the low, solemn tone of the minister
                  as he pronounced the irrevocable words that, without severing our claim, gave to
                  another a higher right than we had ever possessed, produced a dream-like
                  indistinctness of thought from which I was only aroused when at last all was over,
                  and we stood once more outside the little church. Then, when I had kissed and
                  blessed my child for the last time before giving her into her young husband's
                  keeping, I turned to my silent wife, whose sufferings I had forgotten in my own
                  selfish grief, with a pang of keen self-reproach as I looked into her dim eyes,
                  and saw how pale her thin cheek had grown.
               She smiled as she met my anxious gaze, and laid her hand lightly on my arm, and,
                  as with one impulse, our feet turned into the path that led to the graveyard. The
                  sunlight still lingered on the little mound beside which we paused at last, and
                  Lottie knelt down beside it, twining her arm lovingly around the small white stone
                  that told how five-and-twenty years ago our first-born had passed from earth to
                  heaven. The moon had risen, flooding everything around us with its soft, cool
                  light. When she turned her quiet face again to mine, it was calm and shadowless in
                  its perfect peace.
               "Roger," she said, "the bereavement of to-day has taught me to comprehend God's
                  mercy in bereaving us years ago. The child who has just passed from our home is
                  lost to us; her life, rounded in its perfect happiness, will feel less and less
                  the need of ours; and even though her love should prove unchanging, the new cares
                  and joys that will sweep in between us must in a measure divide us. But this babe
                  is ours still—ours always—ours and God's."
               There were to be gay doings at the Hall, and as we passed homeward silently
                  through the streets, we found them already astir with villagers in their holiday
                  dresses, all moving in one direction. We answered cordially to the many cheery
                  salutations that greeted us; but our hearts, softened and solemnised by the trial
                  that bound them still more closely together, had little interest in the general
                  gaiety, and we were glad when we stood once more in our quiet little cottage. Then
                  I raised my wife's drooping head and pressed her soft lips with mine.
               "Darling," I said, "thirty years ago, when I brought you to this home, we were
                  sufficient for each other. Can it not be so again?"
               Her grave eyes met mine with a look of loving reproach, holy in its tenderness.
                  "Need you ask that question, Roger?" she whispered. "Then we stood together at the
                  threshold of life; happy, it is true, in the consciousness of each other's love,
                  but with a long, untried future before us, in which, for what we knew, many a
                  sharp pang might be hidden. Now we stand at almost its last stopping-place, with a
                  whole lifetime of mutual joys, cares and sorrows shared between us, with memories
                  instead of hopes, to bind us together. Should we not be dearer to each other now
                  than then?"
               My sweet wife! As I drew her to my heart, I felt that it was even so. Youth has
                  its present, but age has its past and its future; and its past is shadowless, and
                  its future is limitless
            
            
               
               THE STORY OF A DREAM.
               
                  
                     
                        "Only waiting till the angels
                        Open wide the mystic gate,
                        At whose feet I long have lingered,
                        Weary, poor, and desolate,
                        Even now I hear the footsteps,
                        And their voices far away;
                        If they call me, I am waiting,
                        Only waiting to obey."
                     
                  
               
               I AM growing old. My mirror year by year shows me a face more and more seamed by
                  the lines of toil and care, with sunken eyes that have lost the fire and lustre of
                  youth, a figure bent and stooping. Soon all will be over, and the name to which I
                  have answered for so many weary years, carved into the marble of a headstone, will
                  be the only memorial left of one whose existence has been a long struggle with
                  life for its necessities. Yet the thought of death has no terrors for me, for I
                  have an humble hope that it will give to me at last, what that life has withheld
                  so long—happiness. I do not complain. My lot has been only that of thousands, who
                  daily coin their youth and health and strength into the paltry pittance that keeps
                  body and soul together; whose earnings at the close of each year barely suffice to
                  cover its expenses, content if they are able to preserve an honorable independence
                  that enables them to look into the faces of their fellowmen with, sad it may be,
                  yet honest eyes.
               There are few lives however cold and dark and cheerless they may seem, to which
                  the time does not come when a little sun-ray, falling across them, calls into
                  existence from their very earthiness some tiny flower of love or joy, that sheds a
                  divine fragrance upon all around it. What though it wither before its buds gather
                  strength to open to the light, and hope dies forever with its fading petals?—its
                  brief life has given them memory, as a sacred talisman, to preserve their future
                  from relapsing into the dull gloom of the past.
               Over the chill monotony of my life fell that sun-ray. In my heart
                  blossomed that flower; and though even the flower with me was but a dream, my
                  heart still holds the fragrance it shed there.
               The dream was, in truth, sent in mercy, arousing me from the heavy lethargy that
                  was enclosing all my energies, calling into being faculties that else had died and
                  made no sign, infusing a soul into what was fast becoming a mere machine,
                  performing mechanically each day its apportioned labor.
               Few in God's world were more desolate than I. To most are granted some sweet,
                  faint, clinging memories of a childhood of love and tenderness: to me, childhood
                  is a blank, or worse. And yet it is as well, perhaps, that the young mother,
                  widowed before I saw the light, who left me so early to the cold charity of
                  strangers, bequeathed no definite recollections by which to shape her image. Had I
                  known her as only an earthly woman, perhaps even coarse and uncultured as those by
                  whom my youth was surrounded, that certain knowledge must have taken from me the
                  ideal of tender grace and loveliness to which I have given her name, and into
                  which all the dim, vague impressions of truth, purity and beauty that have reached
                  me through my cold, practical outer life combined themselves, and which reverent
                  love has made to me a reality.
               It is with a sickening horror that I recur, even momentarily, to the scenes of my
                  early boyhood; with shame that I remember my blood flows through the veins of
                  those who made me feel so bitterly my dependence, whose mean, grovelling lives,
                  with their petty aims and purposes, strove to crush from mine every generous
                  impulse or gleam of intelligence, enforcing their lessons with a brutal tyranny
                  that awoke in me, at last, a resistance that sent me, scarcely more than a babe in
                  years, into the world to carve my own fortune from its granite heart.
               I obtained the situation of boy-of-all-work in one of those large, dingy warehouses where the accumulation of wealth
                  is the one fixed purpose of life, in comparison with which all other
                  considerations sink into insignificance—our labor commencing with the dawn, and
                  stealing often hours from the night. Our employers were scarcely less slaves than
                  we poor boys, whom they looked upon simply as so much muscle and sinew, useful in
                  the accomplishment of their purposes, laboring with us, and casting under the
                  wheels of their Juggernaut, Mammon, all that was really valuable in existence.
                  Then I looked up to them with the wondering admiration commanded by their
                  superiority of position and dignity; now, my riper experience teaches me how
                  utterly pitiful and pitiable were those lives. They had homes supplied with every
                  elegance and luxury, but no time to enjoy even their simplest comforts; libraries
                  stored with the richest treasures of literature, with no inclination to penetrate
                  into their mysteries; walls lined with the most exquisite gems of art, with no
                  taste to appreciate their beauty; beds of down, upon which they sank in the
                  profound, dreamless slumber of exhaustion, or tossed restlessly, goaded still by
                  the torturing anxieties of business: children whom they knew only by feature;
                  wives, loving and lovely, to whom they returned worn out and irritable, to pass
                  perhaps an hour snatched grudgingly from their life of toil before seeking their
                  rest. Nor is this the story of a month or year, but of a lifetime—a lifetime
                  ending at last either in a premature grave or an old age of wretched imbecility,
                  from which even those who once cherished that life must shrink, feeling that it is
                  "dark and unlovely."
               This is no sketch of an embittered fancy; I speak only of the plain facts with
                  which life has familiarised me. Many a wife who sits alone in her splendid home,
                  would gladly part with all save its barest necessities, could she thus repurchase
                  the thoughtful attentions and pleasant intercourse of earlier years; gazing with a
                  longing regret into the face of him to whom she has given her life, who furnishes
                  her in return simply with a home; noting with dread how, day by day, his face
                  grows colder and sterner as the man is metamorphosed into the automaton. Many
                  children, orphaned phaned in all save name, have reason to curse the gold coined
                  from a father's life-blood, and with it that father, who, forgetting the sacred
                  responsibilities of his office, has delegated to other hands the training of the
                  youth of those whose mismanaged childhood has ripened into a manhood of reckless
                  dissipation and ruinous extravagance.
               I am wandering far from my subject, and the poor boy in whom I would seek to
                  interest you; but sometimes I puzzle myself with wondering how man, whom God has
                  created to live eternally, dare permit such a waste of intellect, energy,
                  happiness, hope, faith, honor, health—all, in fact, that makes life worthy of
                  possession. But I cannot solve the mystery, for I am not very wise; and moreover,
                  why should I cavil that others barter for gold and position, those gifts with too
                  many of which I have parted, only for bread and meat?
               My destiny, however, was moulded, not by choice, but necessity. No position could
                  be more intolerable than that from which I had escaped; and schooled to obedience,
                  and inured to hardships as I had been all through my life, it was less difficult
                  for me to reconcile myself to the prospect of ceaseless labor.
               There was little variety in my days. I rose early, to have the store swept and
                  fires made before my employers came down; and at night crept, tired and
                  dispirited, to my garret, too jaded and weary to covet any higher pleasure than
                  rest. A strict discipline was preserved in our firm; little conversation was held
                  with the hands, save that necessarily involved in the explanation of orders.
                  Habit, not sullenness, therefore, accounted for a taciturnity that too often, I
                  fear, passed for moroseness. It was my business to work, not to talk; and though
                  there were several boys of my own age in the store, we had little save youth in
                  common; for they were mean-spirited and tricky, and I soon learned to despise the
                  low cunning upon which they prided themselves in excelling each other. Moreover,
                  their talk was generally of things of which I knew nothing, consequently
                  interesting me little; so I contented myself with my own thoughts and the
                  discharge of my duties, looking forward to nothing better or higher; living in the
                  circle custom had prescribed scribed
                  for me, without a thought of cavilling at its monotony. And thus boyhood passed
                  into manhood.
               I wonder now, as I look back to that time, to think how uncomplainingly, almost
                  unconsciously, I gave up those pleasures of youth which, usually, it claims as its
                  right; but the fact was, my rights had been so entirely disregarded by others,
                  that I myself had almost forgotten their existence. Why should I not work? Was I
                  not paid for working? What right had I to waste my time when I had sold it to
                  others? How could I expect holidays, when my services, I knew, were needed in the
                  store? Thus I reasoned in my own mind—if that vague habit of arriving at
                  conclusions could be called reasoning—and everything seemed right, and as it
                  should be. It never occurred to me to compare my lot with that of those more
                  favored by fortune, and murmur that I was debarred from the privileges they
                  enjoyed. Those merry, happy boys who lived in the palaces up town, of which I got
                  an occasional glimpse as I passed on some swift business errand, who seemed to
                  have nothing to do but amuse and enjoy themselves, were beings of quite another
                  species. It was their business to be happy, mine to do my duty; so I
                  contented myself with an occasional long look into some brilliant toyshop, and
                  accepted such excitements as came to me in the shape of a hand-organ, a fire, or a
                  parade of soldiers, and was satisfied.
               I generally slept on Sundays, for I was tired out with my week's work; and
                  besides, I had nothing else to do, for I did not like to go to church much, it was
                  so hard to find a seat among the grand people, and then I was very apt to go to
                  sleep whilst the minister was preaching, and the sexton would shake me awake so
                  roughly after service, and "wonder what such little scamps came to church for,
                  only to give trouble to their betters." Christmas was a very stupid day to me too,
                  for then we had holiday, and I had nothing to do but wander about all day, and the
                  shops were closed, and there was scarcely anybody on the street. To be sure it was
                  pleasant in the morning, for then I would follow the boys that I saw with packages
                  of shooting crackers, that I might enjoy the explosion with them; and in the
                  evening, when everybody was going home with bundles under their arms, and I had a
                  chance of seeing the beautiful things that peeped out through their coverings; but
                  on the whole I was glad when it was over and I could go to work again.
               I am growing tiresome, I fear; but I have entered thus into the minutiæ of my
                  life, to show how utterly barren it was of all excitements and enjoyments at the
                  time it was visited by the dream that changed forever its current. Only one
                  comprehending the former barrenness can understand how that dream should become
                  the reality, and life the dream; how imagination, that had been growing silently
                  through all those years of facts, should spring "full statured into being,"
                  claiming its right to rule; how readily the life, cramped and narrowed into
                  unnatural boundaries, should yield itself to its sway.
               I was no longer a boy, but a man, when it came to me—such a man as such a boy must
                  have made, honest, practical, reserved, taciturn. Circumstances had also altered
                  slightly with me. My faithful discharge of duty had been noticed and approved. I
                  could serve them better in a higher capacity, consequently I was elevated to a
                  clerkship. The position I still hold.
               I can smile now as I remember how I saw her first; though tears are
                  falling as I reopen the cabinet of memory and draw forth its pictures one by one,
                  lifelike in the vivid coloring that time has not power to fade or change.
               As I was on my way to our place of business one morning, at a somewhat later hour
                  than when I had its more menial offices to perform, my attention was drawn to a
                  little figure, closely enveloped in its velvets and furs, on the sidewalk before
                  me. The rain of the night before, freezing as it fell, had rendered the pavements
                  smooth and slippery as sheets of glass; and I, in common with most of the other
                  pedestrians abroad, had chosen the only possible way of preserving my equilibrium
                  by taking possession of the middle of the street. The little lady in front of me,
                  however, seemed determined not to yield to the necessities of the case, but
                  courageously pursued her way, as though it was the very easiest thing in the world
                  for her to do what no one else would dare attempt. I had watched for some time, with growing interest, the tiny feet that
                  so deftly and lightly skimmed over the most difficult places, coming at length to
                  the conclusion that they were certainly protected by a charm, when suddenly my
                  mental predictions of the last half-hour were verified, and she lay prostrate on
                  the sidewalk.
               I sprang forward to offer my assistance, and had succeeded in raising her, when
                  the treacherous ice, that had just played her so false, was not more merciful to
                  me, and I measured in turn my length on the ground. Her clear, merry laugh rang
                  out upon the frosty air, but when she turned her crimson face to mine, and noted
                  the embarrassment and mortification painted there, a sudden gravity replaced her
                  merriment, and looking up at me with an expression in her great blue eyes that
                  said more plainly than words could have done, "Do not let this little accident
                  annoy you, I know that it was your intention to assist me"—she withdrew the hand
                  that, in my confusion, I still held tightly in my own, and with an emphatic "Thank
                  you—you are very kind," the intonation of which for some reason was inexpressibly
                  soothing to my self-love, turned from me, and passing quickly around a corner, was
                  lost to my view.
               I stood for a few moment gazing, bewildered, at the spot where she had been, and
                  when at last I recovered my self-possession sufficiently to walk on, I noticed a
                  small silver portemonnaie, exquisitely wrought, lying at my feet. I caught it up
                  quickly, not doubting who was its possessor, and hurried forward that I might
                  restore it, and thus win another grateful glance from those blue eyes; but much to
                  my disappointment she was already out of sight, and there was nothing left for me
                  but to hurry on to the store, where I found Mr. Brown wondering at my unusual
                  tardiness.
               That sweet face, warmed by its crimson flush, haunted me strangely through the
                  day, and more than once I paused dizzily, as a pair of large blue eyes gazed up
                  into mine from the yellowed pages of the ledger, and at last, determined to
                  re-collect my scattered senses by exercise, I started out for a brisk walk in the
                  open air. Doubtless it was only the desire to restore the property that I had come
                  so innocently into possession of, that induced me to scan so closely every lady
                  that passed me by, that occasioned the eager start and quickened step as I caught
                  sight of a figure now and then that resembled hers. I thought so then, at all
                  events; and as night closed in, leaving me still in possession of the pretty
                  trinket, I believed the chagrin I experienced the very natural result of my
                  ineffectual efforts to restore it.
               I seized the paper eagerly next morning, and glanced hastily over the
                  advertisements. There was, as I expected, a full description of the missing
                  article, and directions where its finder might leave it and receive a reward for
                  his trouble. I knew the house well; it was one of those marble-fronted palaces
                  upon which I had often gazed with wondering, speculative eyes, as I sauntered
                  lazily through the more fashionable portions of the city on Sunday evenings.
               It had seemed a very simple thing to call, ask for her, and place in her own hands
                  her missing property, as I read the directions for so doing in the paper; but as I
                  neared her place of residence, the quickened pulsations of my heart, and a certain
                  feeling of tightness across my chest, combined with an indescribable and unusual
                  timidity, gave to the whole affair a very different aspect, and I finally
                  determined, not without a choking feeling of disappointment however, for which I
                  could not at all account, that I would omit the most important item in my
                  programme, and simply leave the portemonnaie with the servant who came to the
                  door; and gathering strength with this resolution, I mounted the steps and rang
                  the bell.
               She was standing in the hall probably, and from some whim, best known to herself,
                  determined to answer in person the timid summons, for the door opened instantly
                  and she stood before me. A gush of music from a feathered songstress, imprisoned
                  in the conservatory at the end of the hall, floated out to me on the soft, warm
                  air, and the music and the warmth seemed but the natural result of her appearing,
                  as though the sunny brightness of her sweet face created around it by right an
                  eternal summer-time.
               The suddenness of the apparition scattered to the winds my little stock of self-possession, and after a
                  stammered explanation, that it did not add to my self-command to know was utterly
                  unintelligible, I drew forth the portemonnaie and held it out to her, that the
                  sight of it might explain my errand. A quick flush mounted to her brow, and her
                  dimples deepened, as she recognised in me her luckless cavalier of the day before;
                  but any tendency towards mirthfulness was checked by the painful incoherence of my
                  words, and she answered with her former grave, reassuring kindness:
               "You have conferred a greater favor than you know in restoring this little
                  keepsake, as I value it less for its intrinsic worth than as a gift. I have been
                  really quite miserable about it."
               She held out her hand with a bright, grateful smile as she spoke, and for a moment
                  I touched the little, white, soft thing with mine, as I gave the bauble into her
                  keeping.
               My errand was accomplished, and yet I lingered, willing to feast my eyes a little
                  longer, before I turned again into the weary darkness of my daily life; regardless
                  that the biting blast that swept down the street was mercilessly chilling the
                  frail summer flower that stood unprotected from its fury. A sudden thought—terror,
                  I may almost call it—lest she should offer me the promised reward, recalled me to
                  myself, and turning from her thanks with a brief "Good morning," I hurried from
                  her presence.
               I need have had no fear, she was too truly generous to have subjected me to this
                  degradation; but to my blunted perceptions, accustomed to the daily exchange of
                  services for money, it seemed only too natural, and I shrank from the thought with
                  a pain springing from the birth of a feeling to which my life had hitherto been a
                  stranger.
               That slight figure clad in its neat morning dress, with the tiny linen collar
                  meeting around the pure white throat, touched me strangely. I had seen those who
                  as a boy I called "ladies," as reverently as though I had said "angels,"
                  frequently, of course, in their out-door wrappings, and sometimes even in the
                  splendors of a full toilet as they whirled swiftly past in their carriages on
                  their way to some "matinee" or dinner party; but never before had I stood face to
                  face with a young girl in her simple home attire; and it was this very simplicity,
                  I think, that touched me so, and awakened such strange longings in my heart to
                  which I could give no name.
               It was a week or more before I saw her again—a week so different in its feverish
                  excitement and weary expectations from the many that had rolled coldly over my
                  life, that unable to account for the restless irritability that forbade one moment
                  of quiet or repose, I began to fear that I was about to be visited by a severe
                  illness, and had some vague thoughts of consulting a physician. At last one
                  afternoon my efforts to again encounter her were crowned with success. An
                  exquisite engraving of Faith, with eyes upraised in reverent love to the cross
                  shadowed forth above it, had caught her attention in the window of a picture
                  depot, and she stood in a careless, absorbed attitude, utterly lost in the
                  contemplation of its beauty to all thought of time or place.
               I passed, unseen by her, into the store, and as fortunately the attention of the
                  salesman was taken up by other customers, I had full leisure to study closely the
                  face that twice before had flashed upon me like a gleam of sunlight, leaving only
                  a dazzling impression of loveliness.
               It was very quiet now and still, though enthusiasm had lighted it with an
                  expression so holy, pure and spiritual, that it glowed with almost a divine
                  beauty. No painter ever imaged forth a face more saintly. The large blue eyes were
                  dilated, and moist with tears, whilst the tiny mouth trembled with the repressed
                  feeling that dyed the cheek with its burning flush.
               I was far from understanding what power there was in the picture to so move her,
                  but even then I loved less her perfect beauty than the soul that spoke through
                  it—that something unknown to my life, and even yet but dimly
                  comprehended because so long unknown.
               The engraving hangs, as it has hung ever since the evening of that day, on the
                  wall of my chamber, where it may be the last thing at night, the first in the
                  morning to meet my eyes; and as I raise them to it now, and see that look of
                  reverent love unchanged through all these years, still beaming from its upturned
                  face, it is less to me a picture than a
                  sermon; teaching how love, shining soul-like through the divine lineaments of
                  faith, must be of necessity unchangeable, unalienable, eternal. It is the more
                  precious to me, possibly, since I have learned to trace a likeness in its chaste,
                  pure outlines to the other face that gazed on it so lovingly—not as I saw it then,
                  flushed and beautiful, in the glow of the crimson twilight, but as it last met my
                  eyes, with the fair hair banded from the marble brow—as I love to think of it,
                  glorified and crowned in the light of the everlasting city that "has no need of
                  the sun by day or the moon by night."
               I scarcely know how, but it became the habit of my life to note her movements, and
                  so direct my own that I might win from time to time the happiness of gazing for a
                  moment into her sweet, unconscious face, or breathing for a little space the air
                  purified by her presence. With scrupulous care I strove to shield myself from her
                  observation, for I had no intention of rendering my love ridiculous in her eyes.
                  Love!—I did not know it by that name; I only knew those days were very dark
                  uncheered by her presence, that even a glimpse of her slight figure in the
                  distance had power to send the blood more buoyantly through my veins and render me
                  happier for hours.
               My life, manacled by custom and stern necessity, turned as eagerly towards hers,
                  as the prisoner to the gleam of sunlight that falls across the darkness of his
                  dungeon—watching, as he might the tendrils of a vine that had twined itself into
                  the gratings of his window, the fresh, beautiful life, living in a light to him
                  unknown, unhoped for. As I had worked, so I loved, unquestioningly, looking
                  forward to no future, asking nothing save the happiness of loving.
               Each Saturday evening was set aside for the practising of the church-choir of
                  which she was a member. Learning this, I made a request, or I might rather say
                  demand, of my employer, that this one evening of the week might be my own. He
                  demurred, and yielded at last ungraciously, his quick eye reading in the
                  determination of my manner the danger of denial, for my faithful services had
                  become really valuable to the firm, and were not to be lightly dispensed with.
               "I hope, young man," he said, eyeing me severely, "you have no such folly as love
                  or marriage in your head; such an idea would be the very height of absurdity in
                  one circumstanced as you are. It was the mistake of my life, sir—the grand
                  mistake. Had I continued single, I would, at the very least calculation, have been
                  worth a hundred thousand more than I am at this present moment. A young man who
                  has his way to make in the world, has no right to burden himself with a wife and
                  family—no right, sir."
               I assured him very truthfully that I had no such intention, but his words started
                  a new train of thought in my mind, and as I wended my way homeward through the
                  darkness, again and again the image of that fair young girl in her neatly fitting
                  morning dress, with her soft hair brushed simply from her pure white brow, as I
                  had seen her on that first morning, stole into my reverie. I loved to think of her
                  thus; somehow she seemed nearer to me, and the line that separated us to be less
                  severely drawn.
               As I passed through a by-street, a window in one of the small houses that fronted
                  on it stood open, and such a flood of cheery light flashed out upon the night,
                  that involuntarily I paused. The table was spread for tea, and before the fire
                  that danced on the hearth, sat a young mother, tossing merrily a springing,
                  crowing baby, who strove to bury his little fat hands in the heavy masses of dark
                  hair she had pushed back from her brow. So absorbed was she that she did not hear
                  the stealthy opening of the door, or the cautious steps of a fine young fellow, of
                  about my age apparently, who, with a mischievous gleam in his black eyes, suddenly
                  enclosed mother and babe with his strong arms. She turned her smiling, startled
                  face to his to receive his caress, then with a woman's quick delicacy glanced
                  towards the open window, pointing to it warningly, while a bright blush mounted to
                  her cheek. He laughed and held her closer; but disengaging herself from his
                  embrace, she crossed the room quickly and drew the blind, leaving me again in
                  darkness. "It must be a pleasant thing," I said half aloud, "yes, a very pleasant
                  thing to have a home."
               I started guiltily at the sound of my own voice, and walked on swiftly, resolutely crushing thought. I passed
                     her dwelling-place, as was my custom. The carriage stood at the
                  door, waiting to bear her to some concert probably, as the hour was so early, and
                  I lingered near it. It was but a few moments before she ran lightly down the
                  steps, chatting gaily the while with the favored suitor who had to-night the honor
                  of attending her. He handed her into the carriage; a laugh floated for a moment on
                  the air as he sprang in after her and closed the door, then they were whirled
                  swiftly away, and I was left again alone in the silence and the darkness.
               My heart was very heavy; bitter, rebellious thoughts sent scalding tears to my
                  eyes, and fierce, passionate words to my lips. I questioned why the cold,
                  impassive calm of my life had been broken only to teach it its misery; I
                  questioned God's mercy in granting to hearts the capacity of loving, to which the
                  fulfillment of that love must ever be denied. I had yet to learn that God permits
                  no idol to stand before His cross. My life was poor and barren, and its idol was
                  this dream. He broke its beauty, that He might render me worthy of receiving it,
                  not as a dream, but a reality.
               Few hours of my life have afforded me more unalloyed delight than those spent in
                  the darkened church on the Saturday evening practisings. She was seldom absent,
                  for this preparation for the sacred services of the Sabbath was with her a duty
                  with which pleasure was never permitted to interfere. Week by week I grasped
                  eagerly the dangerous happiness of gazing unrebuked into the gentle face, that had
                  become to me the type of all that was holy, pure and womanly, separated from it
                  only by the swell of the music, that raised itself like a veil of sound between
                  us. There were many voices in the choir, but on the surface of them all, hers
                  floated clear and birdlike, as though it were their office to bear it upward,
                  rising ever as it did on the waves of melody the nearest to heaven.
               In my moments of darkness and doubt there are times when those strains sweep again
                  over my heart, touching and softening it with their old power; and the words I
                  learned to treasure then, because memory wedded them with the music of her voice,
                  now, like precious seed, send their roots deep down into my heart, blossoming
                  forth with a beauty then undreamed of.
               Earthly thoughts never broke the calm enjoyment of those moments. At these times,
                  more than any other, she was to me a sacred thing, to be gazed upon with upraised,
                  reverent eyes; and it was not until I came forth from the desolate, dark church
                  into the outer world that I felt again that dull, heavy pain around my heart to
                  which I gave no name.
               Once she caused me bitter suffering; I can almost wonder now as I think how bitter
                  it was. They had been practising a new and difficult piece of music, and in the
                  pause that followed I heard her propose that they should try it over again, whilst
                  she went below into the church that she might judge better of its execution.
               "I have often been tempted to desert you before," she said, "the music sounds so
                  grandly, swelling through the unfilled church; to-night the desire is irresistible
                  and I am determined to gratify it, as you scarcely need my voice at all in
                  this."
               More than one of the singers started to their feet to accompany her, but she waved
                  them back. "No, no," she said, "if you all come, how can I judge of the music? I
                  will go alone."
               For a moment she disappeared, and then I saw her coming slowly down the darkened
                  aisle, with that floating, noiseless step of hers, her golden curls gleaming like
                  a halo around her white brow as the light fell on them from above. Nearer and
                  nearer she came, and I pressed my hand hard against my heart to still its violent
                  throbbing, as unconscious of my presence she seated herself at last almost beside
                  me. I leant back further into the shadow of the pillar that shielded me from her
                  sight, and drew my hat far over my eyes, for a recognition then and there would
                  have maddened me, I think, in its tacit betrayal of my wild, hopeless love.
               Her face wore that look of peaceful serenity that was to me its most beautiful
                  expression, and the upraised eyes were soft and dreamy, as the low, plaintive
                  notes trembled, wailing through the
                  church. Exquisite happiness and misery are alike in their effects; I know not
                  whether I most suffered or enjoyed those few brief moments.
               Suddenly she turned, and her eyes fell on the dark figure crouching almost at her
                  side. A sharp cry of terror rang from her lips, and springing to her feet, she
                  fled swiftly from me—from me, who would have laid down my life to
                  have saved hers from a grief! There was a confusion of voices in the gallery above
                  and a sudden trampling of feet, and with my hand still pressing tightly against my
                  throbbing heart, I rushed out into the night. Yes, it was hard, very hard to bear.
                  It seems but a little thing as I record it now; then it caused me weeks of
                  anguish—miserable weeks they were, in which I dared not seek to gaze upon her
                  face.
               Spring softened into summer, and the long nights following days of weary labor,
                  sent many a gleam of happiness over my life. I had no liberty, it is true, to make
                  one of the number who nightly sought her presence; but I had the right, if it so
                  pleased me, to linger near the open window, listening for the sound of her voice.
                  And whether it reached me in merriment, in earnest converse, or in song, its soft
                  music had always power to chase the demon of unrest from my heart, and still its
                  rebellious passions into peace. Sometimes, too, I would catch sight of a graceful
                  outline standing out clear and distinct against the dim inner light, and sometimes
                  could watch unseen the changes of her sweet face, silvered by the moonlight.
                  Once—and my breath comes quickly even now as I recall that moment of intense
                  delight—she wore upon her breast the flowers I had sent; and though I knew she
                  knew not whence they came—wearing them possibly as the gift of another—it was a
                  joy such as I have seldom experienced since, to see them resting there, mingling
                  their pure breath with hers.
               I am growing garrulous, I fear. It is the fault of old age; and I so love to
                  linger on that time. Nothing is trivial to me that is linked with a memory of
                  her.
               One day my employer asked me to attend to some business with a gentleman up town
                  for him, and my feelings may be better imagined than described, when I found he
                  was sending me into the presence of her father, directing me to her home. How I
                  ever managed to ask for him at his door in that clear business voice, to walk with
                  so firm a step up those broad stairs over which her feet had so often passed, I
                  know not, for the interview was scarcely less a dream to me then than now; but I
                  found myself at last, standing face to face with the tall, stern man upon whose
                  arm I had often seen her leaning so fondly. The cold courtesy of his manner
                  restored my self-possession, and I briefly stated the business that had brought me
                  there. He requested me to be seated, and drawing towards him pens and paper,
                  applied himself to his work.
               I had full leisure to gaze around the luxuriously furnished library, in which I
                  found more than one trace of her presence. The exquisite selection of engravings
                  that hung around the walls attested the purity of her taste, and among them I
                  recognised, with a thrill of delight, the duplicate to the one that cheered the
                  darkness of my home. Some delicately tinted fancy-work lay upon the table, half
                  hidden under the scattered business papers, and on a chair near by me was a
                  half-open volume of poems, with a fresh rosebud thrown carelessly between the
                  leaves, to keep the place possibly, until the unwelcome visitor's departure should
                  permit her return to her pleasant occupation.
               My eyes having completed their survey of the apartment, rested at last again on
                  the face of its owner. I did not question myself why the examination of that face,
                  so haughty and severe even in repose, with its broad, high forehead, clearly cut
                  outlines, and short, curved upper lip, was a matter of such painful interest to
                  me, until my vague, half-formed thoughts were scattered by his voice.
               His eyes were fastened on me in their turn with a keen, scrutinising gaze. "Young
                  man, you have something to say to me." Mine must have held more than I knew in
                  their expression, for it was an assertion rather than a question.
               I hastily answered him in the negative, but his cold eye held mine steadily for a moment, before he resumed his
                  pen. And that scathing glance shrivelled the illusion of the past six months, as
                  instantaneously as the lightning's flash strips beauty and verdure together from
                  the doomed tree upon which it darts, leaving it bare and lifeless.
               I leant back in my chair, blind and dizzy. I could deceive myself no longer. I
                  knew then that I loved her, wildly, idolatrously; that I had hoped against hope;
                  had fed my imagination with dreams until I was ready to claim them as a reality.
                  My blood leapt madly through my veins. "This is your moment," a mocking voice
                  whispered in my ear; "tell him you love her; ask this proud man to
                  give you his daughter. Faint heart never won fair lady—courage, courage! Tell him
                  of the noble home you have to take her to; of the refined circle of relatives into
                  which you will introduce her; of your uncle the blacksmith, and those gentle,
                  loving cousins who were the companions of your boyhood. Tell him how for months
                  you have worshipped the ground she trod upon; how, sleeping and waking, she has
                  been your one thought. He will grant you a courteous hearing, doubtless; will
                  recognise probably that death and love level all distinctions. Oh, fool! fool!
                  fool!"
               It was well that his voice broke my reverie, well that his eye was abstracted and
                  thoughtful, seeking not again to question mine—well too, perhaps, that as I passed
                  mechanically down the broad stairs again, I caught one glimpse of her to still the
                  fever in my veins. The door of the conservatory was open, and I saw her standing
                  among the flowers in her pure white morning dress, and her voice reached me soft
                  and musical, as with head thrown back a little, she spoke in caressing accents to
                  the tiny bird that, fluttering and drooping its wings in answer to her words, had
                  perched itself fearlessly on her raised hand. It was a pretty picture, but I
                  turned from it resolutely, walking with a firm step to the door, through which I
                  passed, an humbler, perhaps a wiser man than I had entered it an hour before.
               My lesson had been a severe one, but after all it profited me
                     little, for I could not, or perhaps I should more truthfully
                  write I would not, disengage my life from the dream that had lent it so much
                  beauty. I knew my danger now, but I dared it fearlessly, losing no opportunity
                  that would give her to my sight, living only in memory and hope; and so summer
                  passed into autumn, and autumn into winter. I did not seek to excuse myself for
                  grasping so eagerly the intoxicating happiness of her presence, for I knew that
                  the time was coming when I must look no longer on her face, when I must banish the
                  thought of her as a crime. For among her suitors there was one who now was ever at
                  her side, at sight of whom the quick blood dyed her check, whose privilege it was
                  to win her earnest attention to his words, whose claim all recognised and
                  smilingly assented to. What right had I to dispute it, penniless beggar that I
                  was? What had I to urge against that claim? True, I loved her—he loved her too,
                  doubtless. His love was authorised by the approval of parent and friends—mine an
                  impertinence, liable to be resented as such by those whose right it was to protect
                  her. He was a young lawyer, rising rapidly in his profession; I a poor clerk in a
                  store, the principal of which could scarcely have obtained an entrance on terms of
                  equality into the circle in which she moved. His name for generations had been one
                  of the proudest of which the country boasted; of my antecedents the less said the
                  better. He was intelligent, cultivated and refined; I only partially educated, my
                  mind dwarfed and narrowed, its natural abilities cramped and paralyzed. He could
                  be to her companion and friend; I, however circumstances had favored my suit,
                  never more than her slave, the dependant on her kindness.
               I may have been weaker than I think, but I believe that even whilst suffering thus
                  keenly, if by a word I had possessed the power to win her love, that word would
                  have been unspoken, for her happiness was dearer to me than my own, and thus I
                  well knew I could never have secured it, even though I had been enabled to
                  surround her with every luxury to which her life was accustomed. I might have
                  worshipped her; but a true heart asks not adoration, but appreciation, and my less
                  delicate perceptions would have brushed the down from the butterfly life that I sought to grasp lovingly. Our natures
                  had been trained in schools too different ever to assimilate. I never could have
                  transplanted that frail exotic to an ungenial soil and atmosphere, only to watch
                  its perishing.
               He to whom she had given her heart was worthy of its keeping, if a mere human man
                     could be worthy a treasure so priceless. Even I could find no
                  charge against him. As man and gentleman, there was no spot or stain upon him. It
                  would be one of those rare unions where congeniality of taste and feeling are the
                  basis of love. They would be happy together, doubtless—very happy.
               With cruel satisfaction I rehearsed again and again in my own mind our relative
                  positions towards her, in bitter mockery of my own presumptuous love, and chafed
                  wildly as the days passed on, and the hour drew nigh, that was to banish me into
                  the darkness forever.
               It was the eve of the new year. Accident which may have been more than chance,
                  drew me into the neighborhood of the church in which for so many months I had
                  worshipped, not God so much, I fear, as her. My heart gave a wild leap of terror
                  as I saw that it was brilliantly illumined, and that early as was the hour, crowds
                  were already thronging through its doors. There was an inward cry for strength,
                  for I knew that my time of trial had come. I clung, sick and faint, for a moment
                  to the iron rails until my trembling limbs gained strength to carry me forward,
                  and then I passed in with the rest.
               How brilliant the church was, with its myriad lights, and its Christmas robe of
                  green! How many beautiful faces bent forward eagerly at each stir in the
                  congregation, robbed of their usual decorous gravity by the excitement of the
                  occasion! How dense and heavy the atmosphere was with the perfumes wafted from
                  their sandal-wood fans and delicate cambric! How strange and unnatural the half
                  suppressed buzz of voices! My perceptions, sharpened into acuteness, took in the
                  minutest details of the scene around me, whilst I stood paralysed into
                  passiveness, waiting for the moment that was to seal my doom.
               There was a movement in the crowd, whisperings from one to another. White-robed
                  figures passed me by, and I turned with strained, eager eyes to gaze for the last
                  time into her face. Saintlike and holy, it was the face of one who felt that she
                  stood in the presence of her God, to vow a vow for time and for eternity. Shielded
                  by the depth of her own feeling from all knowledge of the throng that pressed upon
                  her, of the thousand eyes that feasted on her beauty, she stood calm and still
                  before the altar. Each word from her lips reached me, low and tremulous, but clear
                  and distinct. Then a hush fell on the assembled multitude, and heads were bowed
                  whilst the voice of prayer breathed through the church—a hush broken by the wild,
                  joyous peal of the organ as it swelled forth its anthem of praise. Then once more
                  there was a hurrying stir, and again she passed me, brushing me with her bridal
                  robes, the white face bowed like a broken lily, clinging closely to the arm that
                  was henceforward to be her support—the strength all gone, now there was no longer
                  necessity for its exertion. And with her glided the dream that had made life
                  beautiful to me since I had learned to live.
               How that night passed I cannot tell; its memory is to me like one of those
                  horrible nightmare dreams that haunt our slumbers when a fearful danger seems to
                  overhang us, and we madly strain each nerve and muscle to escape, yet find
                  ourselves powerless and benumbed. I have some dim recollection of bending eagerly
                  over the brink of the rapidly rushing river, upon the banks of which at last I
                  found myself; of a longing desire to be at rest under its cool, moon-lighted
                  waters; then of darting wildly from the spot as the moonbeams fashioned themselves
                  into the image of her face, with its sweet, grave look of solemn warning. I was
                  crazed for the time, I think, for when the morning broke at last, dim and gray and
                  chill, recalling my scattered faculties with its real light, I gazed around
                  wonderingly, to find that I was wandering recklessly over country roads far beyond
                  the limits of the city.
               Habit, which in truth with me had become second nature, guided me at the
                  accustomed hour to my accustomed duties. They were all that life had left me now,
                  and I grasped them eagerly. Work, work,
                  was the inward cry; let there be no moment unfilled, no idle hour for memory to
                  assert itself.
               Fortunately, about this time the firm needed the services of a trusty agent in a
                  distant city; the position was offered to me, and gladly accepted.
               I was happier, or I should rather write less miserable, when miles of distance lay
                  between us. It was something at least to escape the torturing terror that ever
                  haunted me, of meeting her whom I had vowed never willingly to see again, and
                  perhaps in my madness speaking wild words to her that it would have killed me to
                  remember. It was hard to feel that it was a sin for me to love her, that what had
                  been the purest blessing of my life had now become its chiefest temptation. But I
                  fought the tempter manfully. That name was never breathed save in my prayers, and
                  if I prayed more frequently for the joy of naming her, God will forgive me: I was
                  very wretched.
               Month after month glided away. The trust that had been imposed upon me was
                  discharged, and I had no longer an excuse for lingering. Letters came too,
                  imperatively demanding my return. I was glad that it was not optional with me
                  whether I should go or remain; that necessity, not inclination, compelled that
                  return to the scenes of my past happiness and misery, the very thought of which
                  filled me with a wild joy that swept away the calm stupor of despair that had
                  enclosed my life. Each moment seemed an hour, each day a year, that separated me
                  from the old, familiar associations of my past. As eagerly as a few months
                  previously I had sought to fly from it, did I now long to return to the city,
                  hallowed to me by the one thought and memory.
               But when I trod its streets again, taking up, not my imaginary, but my real life,
                  where I had left it half a year before; when the illusion that distance had thrown
                  around it faded into the hard, actual present of every day, then I felt my
                  loneliness and desolation as I had never known it in that distant city, scarcely
                  even in the first bitter hours of bereavement when the excitement of passion had
                  sustained me.
               If I wronged her in my heart by wanting strength to tear away at once the love
                  that had rooted itself so deeply there my actions at least were true to her.
                  Carefully I avoided every possibility of meeting, and too well had I studied her
                  every movement in my happier hours, not to be able to do so effectually. I had
                  more than one hard battle to fight to enable me to stand firmly by this
                  determination. There were times when I would have bartered all of life that was
                  left me, to look once more upon her face. Then conscience would rise grim and
                  stern with its unfailing answer, "Never! Never again!"
               Duty to her, if no higher law, compelled obedience; so I gave myself up
                  remorselessly to a life of constant and unceasing labor, accepting many duties
                  that did not of necessity devolve upon me, content if in return I could win for
                  myself the dreamless slumber of exhaustion that had blessed my boyhood.
               More than a year passed thus, and again the early spring-time budded into flowers.
                  Its soft, enervating influence penetrated even into our dingy, cobwebbed office,
                  and tempted me one mild, beautiful afternoon in May to leave the store at an early
                  hour, that I might extend my walk beyond its usual limits. I sauntered idly along,
                  with my eyes cast upon the ground as was my custom, wrapped in one of those
                  dreamless reveries that at times paralyzed my faculties into repose—noting, caring
                  little in fact, how my steps directed themselves. I was aroused from my
                  abstraction by some one rudely jostling me in passing, and gazed around, terrified
                  to find that the force of old habit had led my feet into forbidden, and now
                  unfamiliar precincts, that I stood almost opposite her home. I would have turned
                  and fled, but for a sight that chilled the fever in my veins, that hushed all
                  feeling into a calm too terrible for thought. A funeral train extended its dark
                  length far as the eye could reach, whilst long, heavy folds of crape floated on
                  the soft breeze across the spot where I had seen her stand in her fresh, youthful
                  beauty.
               There was no one to forbid my entrance, and an irresistible impulse led me up the
                  steps, through the crowded hall to the threshold of the room, where weeping
                  mourners bowed around the dead. The house was dark and chill; no voice of song
                     greeted me now—music and light had
                  fled forever. On my ear fell only the low, solemn chant: "I am the resurrection
                  and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet
                  shall he live; and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die." I stood
                  motionless and still till the voice was hushed, and the silence broken only by the
                  sound of low, suppressed sobbing; then with an unfaltering step I passed to the
                  side of the coffin, placed so that the dim light from the chandelier above might
                  fall upon the face of the dead.
               That face I had seen in its first flush of girlish loveliness; had watched
                  softened and spiritualised by the influence of an earthly love—how shall I speak
                  of it as I saw it for the last time with the light of immortality upon it? Calm
                  and pale and still, holy and pure as the lilies and the snowdrops laid upon her
                  breast.
               It was as though the soul in its flight had lent a ray of its celestial joy to the
                  clay from which it parted, or rather perhaps the realisation of its eternal bliss
                  had reached it ere the flight was made. "Death is swallowed up in victory" were
                  the last words her lips had spoken, and the divine radiance of her face still
                  breathed the last word "victory." As I gazed, my heart was moved to its very
                  depths with a strange, new emotion. Hard, impenitent, sceptical as it had been, it
                  had no power to resist the message of eternal love written on that brow. Its
                  inward cry of faith went up: "My Lord and my God!" and through the thick darkness
                  of that hour broke the dawn of the new day in the ful light of which she stood for
                  all eternity.
               I had no tears to weep for her. It was not death on which I gazed, but "the sleep
                  He giveth His beloved;" and as I touched her brow reverently with my lips before I
                  turned away, it was as one of God's saints, not the woman I had loved.
               Many years have passed since then—many years, with little change in them for me.
                  Our firm is in other hands. The little boy who used to come occasionally with a
                  message for his father, or for the purpose of walking home with him, is now its
                  head, and his youthful features are already hardening into a cold, practical
                  business look, from the responsibilities of his position. I am still the clerk;
                  and to him, as much a piece of the office furniture as the stools and desks that
                  have grown old with me. Time has ploughed deep furrows in my brow, and my step has
                  become a little unsteady, yet he is older than I, this clever young business man.
                  He would laugh in very scorn could he know how week by week, each Sabbath day
                  leads the old man who has worn out his life in the service of his house, to the
                  side of a grave forgotten by all save him, where sleeps one whom they laid to rest
                  there more than a quarter of a century ago.
               Many would join in the laugh, for the age is cold and sceptical, and when the dew
                  of faith is shaken from fresh young lives, they are apt to wither in the scorching
                  sunlight of prosperity. I do not envy them their wider experience, but thank God
                  for the dream that has kept my life pure and young through all these years.
               Her grave is to me no place of mourning, but merely a spot sacred to her memory.
                  It has become a precious privilege to escape for a few hours each week from the
                  bustling turmoil of the noisy city, to the holy stillness of this city of the
                  dead. She is not there—that I know full well. The seed planted so many years ago
                  has blossomed into an eternal beauty in the light of heaven; yet I feel nearer to
                  her in this quiet, beautiful spot, where the presence of the Lord seems ever to
                  rest, and my thoughts turn more naturally to the home to which she has been
                  gathered, and to which I am fast hastening. Thus it is that each Sabbath after
                  service my steps turn to the place where reposes the dust that the immortal spirit
                  I so loved cast from it in its upward flight, nor is the time I pass with my old
                  memories the least profitable portion of the day to me.
               Once I was not the only watcher. The grief-stricken father, the young
                  lover-husband, in their first desolation, often mingled their tears above her
                  resting-place. The proud old man sleeps now beside his child. He to whom she gave
                  her life loved but the clay: he has accepted the divorce that death has granted
                  him. A sweet face that is unlike hers is ever by his side, golden-haired haired children whom she never knew
                  call him father. He is a happy man. The world has heaped its honors on his head,
                  fortune has emptied her horn at his feet, love has lightened his life of its
                  cares, his home is glad with the gay voices of his children, and so the grave is
                  left to me. Only the grave? Ah no! inestimably precious is the thought of the hour
                  in which my long, patient waiting shall meet with its reward. Love that has
                  conquered time cannot perish in eternity. God is just. To him who has parted so
                  readily with her memory he has given honor, wealth, happiness; to me he has
                  granted only hope. Shall I doubt of its fulfillment?
               Thus as once I used to wait in the cold, darkened church, gazing up into the light
                  for a sight of her sweet face, so I still wait, gazing upward from the chill
                  darkness of my daily life into the light that has received her. Hand in hand with
                  the young mother who gave me being, she stands amid the seraphic host that sing
                  their hallelujahs around the throne of the Lamb. Hand in hand they bend above me
                  in my dreams, radiant with celestial loveliness. Those dreams become more vivid as
                  I weaken year by year: when will they brighten into reality? When shall I join
                  them in their shout of "victory" as I throw off this earthly garment and spring
                  into the light?
               Yet in my joy at parting with my life, let me not seem to despise it. I am
                  thankful for its very harshness and monotony that has left me nothing to cling to
                  in it. If I had had more I should now have less. Life is God's gift, and doubt it
                  as we will, that gift is ever the one that suits us best. I marvel as I think how
                  often we dare to cast it back upon Him, questioning His mercy. This sin has been
                  mine in times past; therefore it is, perhaps, that whilst the young and loved fall
                  around me day by day, I am still ungathered. Well, I will seek to wait patiently,
                  for the end must soon come now—that end which is the beginning of life and joy
                  eternal.
