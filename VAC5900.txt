               CHAPTER I.
               THE STORM—LONDON, 1703.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           'I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds
                           Have riv'd the knotty oaks; and I have seen
                           The ambitious ocean swell, and rage, and foam,
                           To be exalted with the threatening clouds:
                           But never till to-night, never till now,
                           Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.
                           Either there is a civil strife in Heaven;
                           Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
                           Incenses them to send destruction."
                        
                     
                     JULIUS CÆSAR, I. III.
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "So when an angel, by Divine command,
                           With rising tempests shakes a guilty land
                           (Such as of late o'er pale Britannia passed)."
                        
                     
                     THE CAMPAIGN.
                  
               
               A DEEP silence reigns over London, and although it wants but an hour of midnight,
                  the quietness feels too intense even for so late an hour. The moon hangs in the
                  centre of the ragged clouds, lurid and red, totally unlike its usual radiant light
                  and mellow color; thin leaden clouds scud swiftly before it, and, for a time, dim
                  its glow, making it dull and copperish until they pass. The heavens in every part
                  present an unusual appearance; an opaque, light-colored mist floats between the
                  sky and the earth, and dims the brilliancy of the few stars that cluster around
                  the sun of night. It is, however, beginning to break; wide crevices already
                  yawning and cracks opening, the huge clouds show their threatening ranks, piled
                  mountain high, and filled with the
                  thunderbolts of Jove's great armorer, Vulcan. People afterwards said that this
                  mist formed itself into the semblance of an immense angel, whose wings covered the
                  half of the city, and whose face was lowering and angry. Be that as it may, they
                  had scant time to notice it before the lightning began; its quick, sharp, blinding
                  flashes push out in bold relief the torn clouds and vaporous banks whence it
                  comes; the low rumbling thunder moans its solemn accompaniment, and the air grows
                  more stifling, sticking in the throat, as do the sulphurous blasts from the depths
                  of Ætna, or the mouth of Apollyon. At the corners of the streets, on the old-time
                  roomy porches, and on the sheltered stoops of the coffee-houses and taverns, stand
                  or sit groups of anxious people conversing in subdued, awe-stricken tones on the
                  unusual signs in the firmament; they look constrained and uneasy, as though they
                  feel the awful shadow of this coming event.
               Now, there being a momentary cessation of both thunder and lightning, they breathe
                  more freely and begin to hope that after all the storm may blow over; scarcely,
                  however, have they time to exchange their whispered thoughts ere a quicker, but
                  more sustained, more blinding flash deprives them almost of sight, making them see
                  things "as through a glass darkly," and the thunder meanwhile crashing out a
                  sublimely grand symphony. Globes of pink fire coruscate simultaneously in all
                  parts of the heavens, whirling around for a few seconds with inconceivable
                  velocity, bursting with a sharp report, and filling the air with millions of fiery
                  fragments which saturate the atmosphere with an unnatural, suffocating smell.
                  Meteoric flashes scintillate around, mother Nature appearing to be working herself
                  up to an angry, revengeful mood.
               Great, heavy drops patter sullenly on the dry pavement ment, and leave clots of
                  mud where they fall in slow succession. Again for a few minutes there is a
                  cessation.
               Once more they hope that the storm will blow over and break elsewhere; but, with a
                  wilder, heavier crash than its predecessors, the thunder roars aloud and the
                  tempest begins in real earnest. The Storm-God shrieks with fierce, savage joy as
                  he bursts in all his might upon the devoted city—palace and cottage, church and
                  gaming hell alike he shatters in his mad career.
               Bolts upon bolts leap from cloud to cloud, and hiss in very terror at their own
                  appalling deadliness, as they rive and rend in their swift passage to the
                  earth.
               The Thames, now a seething mass of muddy billows, rushes and boils over its banks
                  with strange violence, dashes its waves even into Westminster Hall, and floods the
                  city with its cold, slimy torrent; London Bridge meanwhile threatening momentarily
                  to fall asunder, and precipitate itself from its piers into the angry flood which
                  swirls and eddies beneath it like an immense maelström.
               In Saint James' Park whole avenues of noble elms are uprooted, and lie prostrate
                  far away from their former positions, a part of the palace has been struck by
                  lightning, and hurled to the ground with an all-destroying force and impetuosity,
                  while the same power has killed its human victims by the score—a happier fate, to
                  be sure, than that of those who were maimed and wounded by flying signs, falling
                  walls, and the large hailstones which now begin to add their terrors to the
                  dreadful scene; down they come! rattling on the many roofs like volleys of
                  musketry; the wind whirls them in all directions; glass is flying about, and
                  hundreds of persons are knocked senseless by these frozen bullets hurled from on
                  high.
               The leaden coverings of the church and houseroofs are rolled up like ribbons and as quickly unrolled by
                  the howling wind, as it shifts and careens to all quarters in the same
                  instant.
               The terror-stricken people close their eyes in fear and trembling, and cover their
                  pale faces with shaking hands to screen the dread sights from their view. They
                  cower in groups, scarcely knowing which to fear the most, the enormous hailstones,
                  the forked lightning ricochetting and hurtling about their ears, or the
                  thunder-claps which set their heads whirling and their ears humming.
               The tumult is beyond all conception; it is as though all hell had again rebelled
                  against the Divinity, and were trying to scale the summit of the heaven which they
                  had forever lost.
               Houses and churches are falling in all directions, adding to the din and confusion
                  and sending up clouds of dust, and in many cases myriads of sparks, which the
                  pouring rain soon quenches.
               Amidst this mad struggle of the elements can be seen a group of terrified men,
                  crying babes, and sobbing women, who cling together in the middle of the street
                  waiting in terror for the storm to cease, so that they can return in safety to
                  homes which they have forsaken for fear of the lightning which strikes and levels
                  so many of the taller houses; the while a courtly gallant surveying the huddling
                  crowd with a look of supercilious pity and proud disdain. He is dressed in a cloak
                  and doublet of gray velvet, lined with pale blue, the outside is covered with deep
                  bars of black lace, silken hose cover his well-shaped legs, and his shoes are made
                  in the latest mode and fastened with small diamond buckles. His body is erect and
                  soldierly, and his haughty bearing betrays his patrician origin. His hat, very
                  wide in the brim, is looped up on one side with an aigrette of brilliants, the
                  other drooping over the right cheek and leaving it in deep shadow; it is rakishly
                  cocked and hides half of a handsome, wicked face, adorned with the peaked beard in
                  the style of Vandyck. He looks, as a girl close by him says, "Every inch of a
                  rakehelly ruffler."
               Hearing the remark, he turns to her with a smile, and says, reprovingly, "How now,
                  Mistress Impertinence! art frightened at old Tom Wharton? S'bodkins! Once was a
                  time when a pretty girl would have given him a better reception than cold words
                  and sour looks!" And he extends his hand in order to raise her face to the light
                  and scan her features more plainly.
               Thomas Wharton was born in the times of the Covenanters, his father being a sour,
                  rigid old Calvinist, and a firm believer in Cromwell and his Ironsides. His
                  boyhood was passed amid a dismal set of sombre, psalmsinging roundheads, half
                  preachers, half soldiers, firm believers in the church-militant and the sanctity
                  of their own persons.
               Growing older and gradually breaking loose from such associations, of course a
                  decided reaction took place, and in the London of the Restoration he became such a
                  libertine, scapegrace, and blasphemous wit that he shocked even the wildest of
                  such a dissolute crew of Cavaliers as never England boasted before, nor wishes to
                  boast again. Ribald and profanely witty in his conversation, impious and insolent,
                  he fought so often, coming unscathed out of so many duels that he attained the
                  reputation of bearing a charmed life. Utterly shameless, the barbed arrows of his
                  assailants' tongues he shot back, with a jeer at their impotence. Being a Whig of
                  the most virulent type, he is as true as steel to the party he supports with his
                  talents and his genius. He even carries his proclivities into his sports, and
                  often at a race-meeting, when a well-known Tory had put his horse in to win, down
                  would come Wharton's "Careless" or his bay gelding, for which the Grand Monarch had in
                  vain offered a fabulous price.
               As an electioneerer he is invincible; Buckinghamshire is all his own, besides
                  various other counties, which he always canvasses in person, and by his good
                  humor, unmatchable impudence, and affability, he always leaves his opponents far
                  in the lurch.
               At this time he is well advanced in years, but is still possessed of all the
                  buoyancy of youth, a dangerous quality to those about him, when you add to that
                  the thorough knowledge of state affairs and party secrets he has gained during his
                  long experience in the political arena. His intrigues were formerly the dread of
                  every honest citizen or jealous Cavalier in London, and even now an uxorious
                  husband would rather see Moloch in his house than old Tom Wharton with his
                  flattering speeches and expressive glances. His temper is imperturbable to the
                  last degree, and he can pink his opponent with the same grace and coolness as he
                  eats buttered whiting at the tavern in Clare Market. "He had never given a
                  challenge, had never refused one; had never taken a life, and yet he had never
                  fought without having his antagonist's life at his mercy."
               He is a steady frequenter of the Saint James Coffee House, where his opinion is
                  always listened to with great attention, and where his eagle eye is always on the
                  young patricians, and if he notes one who he thinks might be useful to his party,
                  he is sure to secure him by his adroit flattery and his consummate diplomacy.
                  Honest Tom, as he is familiarly called by his associates, is a strong Whig pillar;
                  and this is the man who has favored the world with a son worthy of himself, the
                  famous Philip, Duke of Wharton, of whom more hereafter.
               At the instant Lord Wharton caught hold of the shrinking girl there was a loud
                  crash, and a large gabled mansion, which stood a few yards below them, was
                  levelled to the ground by a stroke of lightning; the crowd swayed to and fro in
                  alarm, and amid the incidental confusion she elbowed her way into it, and escaped
                  from his pleasantries.
               He laughs aloud at their terror, occasionally screaming out, so as to be heard
                  above the roar of the wild tempest, a blasphemous remark or an impious jest, until
                  they begin to stare at him with a mixture of awe and fear, and shrink from him as
                  though he were peststricken; and now he stands alone and prominent amid a circle
                  of blanched, gaping faces.
               Here a' prentice lad, in dirty woollen cap and smirched ruff, dries his tears with
                  his greasy fustian sleeve or his greasier hand. There an artificer's pretty wife
                  draggles her skirts in the dirty pools, and glances occasionally at the "wicked
                  lord" who is so bold amid all this crash and ruin; her fine cambric ruff, lace
                  cuffs, and the pretty velvet cap perched on her brown hair are limp and disordered
                  with the combined effects of rain and sundry hailstones which struck her when they
                  first began to rattle down. Now my lord turns quickly on his heel, and cautiously
                  picks his way through the falling debris towards Whitehall. The street he passes
                  through is a fair sample of all London at this moment; narrow, crooked, and
                  ill-paved. Shattered signs, broken coaches and carts lumber the way; fallen houses
                  cover the pavement and kennel with their ruins; the water runs almost knee deep,
                  and is as cold as ice, from the hailstones. Lord Wharton looks for a chair to
                  carry him to his destination, but even the carriers have gone home to see to the
                  safety of their wives and children. He twirls his beard and strides resolutely on,
                  with the muddy water wetting his silken hose, ruining his rapier and velvet
                  small-clothes; but he is a philosopher in these little things, and pleasantly hums "Lillibullero bullan a
                  la," the famous doggerel generally accredited to him.
               He has proceeded but a short distance when a girl's form becomes dimly perceptible
                  through the gray curtain of rain; he quickens his step and exclaims, "Egad! the
                  hussy hath a good shape; I'll e'en speak with her!" She is evidently aware that he
                  is pursuing her, and she considerately slackens her pace until he reaches her
                  side, then she turns to him and says in a sweet, though rather bold voice,
                  "Good-night to ye, my lord, rabbit me if——." She happens to see his face while the
                  lightning plays with unusual brilliancy; she stops suddenly as if spellbound, and
                  then cries in a bitter anguish-stricken tone, "Oh God! Tom—You?" Then her
                  utterance became choked, she ran away from him with great precipitancy, and drew
                  her hood low over her face. He made an effort to stop her, but she eluded his
                  grasp; and now she is lost to view.
               "S'blood! This is strange! A pest on the jade to run away ere I saw her face. 'Tis
                  a pretty one, I'll be bound, or she would not have been so chary of showing it;
                  and to call me Tom, plain Tom! Egad, she must have known me before; her voice hath
                  a familiar ring now I think on't, but I cannot for the life of me recall where I
                  have heard it. Jupiter Pluvius! how it pours."
               Let us follow the object of his thoughts. She does not run far before she bounds
                  up the steps of a gaudily painted house and raps quickly with her knuckles; the
                  door is at once half opened, and a husky voice exclaims, "Who's there?"
               "Nellie," she answers, impatiently; the door-chain clangs heavily on the floor,
                  and she totters in, wet and dirty. Her face, though pale and not over clean, is
                  pretty and expressive; but in her bright eyes there is a wild, hunted look which
                  ill-accords with their azure hue. She goes up stairs, entering a close dark room
                  in the back part of the house, and lights a dirty tallow candle, which she places
                  on the table; now she goes towards a small trundle-bed where lies a pink,
                  flaxen-haired boy, whose pure breath comes softly through his little open lips, on
                  which she imprints a passionate kiss; the wild look leaves her eyes, and in its
                  place a glorious radiance—a mother's love conquers all other feelings. She gathers
                  him up very closely, and strains him to her bosom. "My poor babe, I must deny
                  myself even the consolation of your innocence and your darling prattle; father
                  will keep you for my sake, for the little Nellie's sake who was once his only
                  joy." Her tears fall thick and fast, while outside the storm still continues with
                  scarcely any apparent diminution. The room is bare and gloomy; it has but one
                  ornament in it—a withered bunch of wild violets under a dusty glass case.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER II.
               
                  
                     
                        "He's a downright pest in all sorts of ways."
                     
                     MELEAGER.
                  
               
               THE Wharton estate is situated in the loveliest part of picturesque Buckingham.
                  The castle is venerable and romantic. A spacious terrace surrounds it on every
                  side, luxuriantly beautified with the wanton musk rose, myriads of lime-blossoms,
                  the sweet-smelling hawthorn; and interspersed in artistic profusion are cupids,
                  fauns, dryads, and floras, most of which are draped with the delicate tendrils of
                  the sweetbrier which cling lovingly to their gleaming limbs. The rusty creaking
                  vane, the fluted chimneys of moulded bricks are quaint and bygone, smacking of the
                  Elizabethan period and its customs. Inside are long broad rooms; winding passages,
                  dim hallways hung with stamped leather, or panelled in black oak which is
                  decorated with heraldic devices. The low ceilings are interlaced with heavy
                  rafters of some dark wood, whose gothic corbels are shaped into fantastic grinning
                  faces.
               In the hallways, on the head of the stairs and between the mullioned windows,
                  stands stiff and stern the armor of the Wharton warriors, which adds to the air of
                  antiquity which surrounds the castle and its adjuncts; truly meriting its
                  venerable air, for it was built by the second Baron Wharton about the middle of
                  the sixteenth century. The round, castellated towers which adorn either end were
                  added later to give greater defensive and offensive powers in times of forays and
                  maraudings, of which the whole front shows many traces in broken buttresses,
                  undermined walls, and splintered gateways. A moat, once filled with stagnant
                  water, which was formerly crossed by a drawbridge, is now filled up and
                  transformed into an odorous garden; this adds a glowing loveliness to a picture
                  which might otherwise have been too sombre. In the middle of the hall is a massive
                  stairway wide enough for a dozen bowmen to walk abreast without jostling one
                  another. It is highly polished, and elaborately carved like its surroundings.
               Down it are descending two persons; one of them is the Lady Wharton, who is tall
                  and handsome; her carriage is very stately; she bears herself haughtily, as
                  becomes the female representative of a high and noble family; like her husband she
                  is a Whig, and, to show her politics to all the world, she has stuck two
                  conspicuous patches on her right cheek. Her eyes rest on her companion, who walks
                  by her side with all the dignity and grace of a courtier of twenty years'
                  standing. He has scarcely seen fourteen summers, but he might easily pass for much
                  older. He is tall, well-shaped; his hair is parted in the middle, falling on his
                  shoulders in thick natural curls; in front it is cut low on his forehead, and
                  brushed smooth; his eyes beam with liveliness, wit, and good humor, with just a
                  perceptible trace of arrogance in them, bred doubtless by the servile attendants
                  who are ever ready to obey every nod and beck of young master Philip. His mouth is
                  the most attractive feature about him; it can bestow the most persuasive and
                  endearing smile; it can curl itself into a spiteful bow, and bandy caustic wit and
                  biting repartees with any dame or cavalier who chooses to play with such keen
                  weapons. His nose is a trifle sharp at the extremity, but large at the base; and
                  his complexion surpasses in brilliancy the vaunted skin of any court belle in
                  London. His chin rather detracts from his manliness; it would be perfect in a girl, but for a man it is too
                  feminine, and shows a lack of stability or principle, or both.
               Young as he is he can boast unusual parts; in classics and belles-lettres he is
                  better posted than is many a pedantic professor in a provincial college; in
                  politics, diplomacy, and the use of the rapier he has been instructed by my lord,
                  who saw his aptitude for learning, appreciated his talents and ambition, feeling
                  proud of him, with his handsome face, his reckless courage, and his various
                  accomplishments; among these he is remarkable as a linguist, for he has already
                  thoroughly mastered the chief European language, as also Latin and Greek.
               He looks up at his mother with a caressing smile, and says, "My lady mother, why
                  do you always get so mightily angered if I but look kindly on sweet mistress
                  Margery? Sure she is as proper a girl as your ladyship did ever see."
               Her lips curl contemptuously as she replies, "Why, my little Whig, do'st imagine
                  that I could stoop so low as to fret myself because my son deigns to smile on an
                  awkward country girl?"
               "Nay," he replies in some heat, "you are misled in thinking her an awkward rustic;
                  she is the daughter of General Holmes, whose family vaunts good blood and a score
                  of quarterings, though their revenue is small; and, I pray you, call me not Whig;
                  I hate its very sound; Tory and high church sound more pleasantly in my ears,
                  Wharton though I am!"
               He stops in some confusion, for spite of his bold words he stands in awe of his
                  stately mother; she looks at him in surprise and mortification for a moment, then
                  says in cold, measured tones, "My son, I can dispense with your company; leave
                  me!" He makes a deep obeisance and attempts to kiss her hand, but she waves him
                  away, exclaiming, "No, Philip, not from a Tory!" He blushes scarlet, turns quickly
                  on his heel, and walks proudly along the hall towards the gamekeeper's lodge.
               Her eyes follow him with a troubled, wistful expression in them. "I fear he will
                  be as his father was before him, and as they say he is yet, wild and reckless. I
                  would rather see him in his grave than see him a profligate and a bully, or, worse
                  than all, a traitor to our party. He is so headstrong, so extravagant, and
                  contrary, that if my lord is one thing, Philip is sure to be the other."
               She sits wearily down in the large, high-backed oaken chair, near to the painted
                  window which represents a thrilling incident in the life of one of her husband's
                  ancestors, Baron Godfroi Wharton. It is in reference to a duel he once fought. He
                  had entered the lists against an unknown knight who had grossly insulted him, and
                  then challenged him to the combat à l'outrance,
                  on foot or on horse, with spear or with sword; they fought, and the Baron was the
                  victor; he was just about to dispatch his adversary with a thrust of his
                  misericordia through the bars of his helmet, when his hand was tightly griped, and
                  a voice whispered in his ear, "Desist! most puissant of chevaliers; he is thy son,
                  whom thou didst discard so cruelly some year or so agone!" So his life was spared;
                  when he recovered, they lived on terms of amity until death parted them.
               She is looking at the scene depicted on the glass in all the hues of the rainbow.
                  "I wonder whether they will ever fight against each other? Philip is
                  excitable, and my lord is not slow to anger. But I must go and steep Granny
                  Leedsie's feverwort; she will need it to-night."
               She rises gracefully, walking slowly to the refectory or herb-room to discharge
                  her charitable duties, and also to have an eye to the servants.
               Philip stalked into the lodge with a sullen air, quivering lips, and eyes bright
                  with suppressed tears, and demanded
                  peremptorily of the stripling who was engaged in polishing a long yew bow which
                  looked as if it might take a Goliath to handle, "Where is Shem?" He did not give
                  him time to answer, but again ejaculated, "Quick! Begone! send him here." And he
                  waved his small white hand with a gesture worthy of Louis or my Lord Chesterfield.
                  The boy darted out of the door like a deer "uncovered," startled by master
                  Philip's rough manner, generally so gracious to all the dependents.
               "Mornin', Master Philip," says Shem Throck the gamekeeper, as he darkens the door
                  with his broad shoulders, and touches his cap respectfully. He is a good type of
                  the bluff, courageous Englishman of the lower class; his quick brown eyes are full
                  of conviviality and fun.
               He throws a keen glance at Philip, and continues, "Art sick, sir? Thou dost not
                  look ower weel this mornin'."
               Without noticing his interrogatory, Philip says, "Shem, my crossbow! and select me
                  a few good shafts, well feathered and true."
               Shem executed his commands, and asks, "Shalt want we along?"
               "No, I would rather go alone: if my lord inquires anent me, tell him I have gone a
                  shooting, and will not return till late. Hast seen Mistress Margery in the Chase
                  or the dingle, Shem?"
               "Nay! Master Philip, I did na see her at either of they two places; m'appen I
                  mought have, if I had looked hard eno' down by Rooksnest; she is often
                  thereabouts," and a twinkle shot out of his eye as he turned to the window and
                  hung his crossbow on its accustomed peg.
               Philip steps out and walks swiftly towards the forest, and he is soon lost to
                  sight among the thick hedges and bushes.
               Shem has his eyes on him, and chuckles knowingly, "Little game he wants, I trow,
                  or his memory would no' be so bad as to forget his gamebag forbye; I think mysel'
                  that Mistress Margery has mair to do wi' his hunting the day than e'er the pretty
                  pheasant or the swift red deer, though he has shafts for both. Weel, weel, his
                  young blood is hot and springsome, but an' I were he, I suld think twice ere I
                  braved my lord's scowl once; I ken his lordship is sorely against him meeting her
                  as he does. Philip was aye wilfu', and some day there will be sair greeting and
                  wet een for his sake, for all his winnin' tongue and his bonnie face." He ceases
                  his soliloquy, and proceeds to affix to his door two otter heads and a
                  long-toothed, foam-flecked head of a veteran fox, the spoils of the morning. The
                  stout oaken planks are almost covered with similar trophies, some fresh and moist,
                  others dry and hard; most of them have been caught or shot by Shem; but still
                  there are many of Brad's trophies there also, his father having made him a skilful
                  woodsman and a cunning hunter.
               He stops his work for a moment, and abstractedly lets his arm drop to his side; a
                  perplexed expression ruffles his usually placid countenance; suddenly he roars out
                  in stentorian tones, and with his hand to his cheek as if about to give the
                  view-halloo, "Brad away! Brad away!" "Away—away" echoes in every direction, and
                  repeats itself in varied tones in wood and marsh, mere and loch.
               He appears in obedience to the paternal call—a healthy, rosy-cheeked, sinewy lad,
                  who springs rather than walks into the lodge, flushed and panting. He stands
                  motionless and quiet, awaiting the commands of his father, whose voice had
                  penetrated far into the woods where he had been tracking for otters on the edge of
                  the lake.
               "Brad," he growls in a gruff voice which his genial face belied, for it is one of his notions that if
                  his son found out how tenderly he loved him he might become unruly and fractious,
                  and take advantage of it, so that he always shows him a stern front and no favor;
                  but unfortunately Brad had long ago discovered this trait, and humored his father
                  accordingly.
               "Go down to Rooksnest, just this side o' t' Weird's cave; thou'lt find the young
                  master—mark whether Mistress Margery be wi' him. If she is, come back at once, an'
                  mind! no bow-twangin'; thou mightst be heard. Go!" As Brad set off at a long,
                  swinging pace, he continues, "and bless you, my boy"
               "Ay, Shem, ye may well say bless him, for he is the core o' my heart, the varra
                  apple o' my e'e," burst in his good wife as she shuffles in at the doorway, her
                  hands grasping the corners of her apron, while on her broad shoulders hangs a
                  confused mass of wet fishing-tackle, cords, hooks, and the rest of the
                  paraphernalia with which his lordship had been thinning the scaly denizens of the
                  mere over the low hills.
               "It's thee, is it?" Shem stolidly replies; for, like most of his class, he
                  considers "womenfolk" good for nothing but to obey their husbands, particularly if
                  said husbands happen to be gamekeepers.
               "Ay, it's me. His lordship wants you to clean an' mend the tackle weel, an' put it
                  away carefu' like, so that it will not rust."
               Debbie Throck is the cook at the castle, and she seems well fitted for her office
                  and its onerous duties. She is robust and comely, albeit red and a trifle sooty,
                  for she has been busily engaged all the morning in cooking a dinner to please the
                  palates of the gentlefolk who are to dine with his lordship to-day. She still
                  grasps the corners of her apron, and a vast sigh heaves the expanse of her bosom
                  as she says: "Ah! Shem, to think o 't, all the gude things that mun be sarved at
                  table the day—"
               "Umph!" interpolates Shem.
               "Stewed broth, wheaten flummery, an' hotchpot to begin on."
               He licks his lips and frowns slightly.
               "Then marrer puddings and quakin' puddings; then collops, veal toasts, and roasted
                  partridges."
               Shem is plainly becoming angry, but still she pursues her tantalizing
                  catalogue.
               "To finish up wi' custards, caraway cakes, an' pear puddings, besides the
                  syllabubs, suckets, and—"
               "Stop thy rantin' noise, fule! What need to tell me o' all these when I can touch
                  naught but a bit o' dry ven'-son, or happen a roasted partridge?"
               A demure look twinkles in her eyes, which he seems familiar with, for he encircles
                  her stout waist with his arm, and growls quite amiably, "Come, dame, I know thou
                  hast summut for me: come—what is it?"
               "Go away, Shem; dost see how ta rumples my pinner and a' that's in it?"
               He at once transfers his arm from her waist to the apron, which, he observes,
                  contains something bulky.
               "Ha' done, now; thou 'It spoil all 't syllabub if thou 'rt not more carefu'."
               So saying she gives him a peep at the contents of it.
               He lifts them out carefully one by one—samples of the dishes for the company—and
                  arranges them neatly on his ash sideboard. His eyes sparkle as he discovers fresh
                  tidbits at every incursion, and as he lifts out the last, an orange sucket, he
                  gives her a sounding kiss in sheer gratitude, and then says, in a shamefaced sort
                  of a manner, "Now, dame, they may want thee up at the kitchen." She seems to think
                  so too, and sallies towards her own quarter; but, before she left, she said coaxingly, "Shem, be kind to the lad;
                  don't be over cross wi' him, will ye?" "All right, Debbie; I can manage," he
                  replied in a confident tone; but whether he referred to Brad or the delicacies on
                  the sideboard she was doubtful.
               We will leave Shem arranging the fishing tackle, and watch his son's conduct in
                  his new position—a spy—an office he hates and despises. He had said to himself, as
                  he left his father, that if he did happen to see those for whom he searched, he
                  would not let a soul know aught about it but himself; in fact, he had inwardly
                  determined not to find them if he could help it.
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "She rose, she sprung, she clung to his embrace,
                           Till his heart heaved beneath her hidden face.
                           He dared not raise to his that deep-blue eye,
                           Which downcast droop'd in tearless agony;
                           Her long fair hair lay flashing o'er his arms,
                           In all the wildness of dishevell'd charms."
                        
                     
                     MEDORA.
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        "Thine eyes' blue tenderness, thy long fair hair."
                     
                     GENEVRA.
                  
               
               A FEW yards beyond the cultivated portion of the Wharton estate is a clump of
                  trees, which has borne from time immemorial the name of Rooksnest, on account of
                  the myriads of noisy rooks that have built their nests amid the leafy boughs, and
                  cawed and bred in bold security since the birth of the first Baron of the Wharton
                  line. To the right is a dripping, unwholesome den, which penetrates nearly fifty
                  feet into the solid rock; it is known all the country around as the "Weird's
                  Cave." The tradition in regard to it runs that, over one hundred and twenty-five
                  years ago a wizard, or one who passed for such, lived here, who never left his
                  lair unless misfortune or death threatened the Wharton family. On such occasions
                  he would totter out and bring with him some rude symbol to typify the kind of
                  misfortune that was boding.
               The old Baron had held him in great respect, and in a degree even stood in awe of
                  him, until one day when his eldest born was leaving the castle with an armed
                  retinue to go to the crusades, the wizard prophesied his sudden death, which so
                  enraged him that he at once hung him from the battlements with the sneering remark
                  that "as he was so ready to foretell
                  others' deaths, i was a pity he did not know the time and place of his own and
                  thus escape." The weird had replied solemnly, "My death will not prevent his; he
                  will follow me ere the sun grows yellow in the west." And, sure enough, they
                  brought his son back with his feet to the door and a Lochaber axe-cut across his
                  young head; he had been killed in a brawl with a hostile retinue scarcely a mile
                  from the castle.
               There is not a man in the county who cares to pass by the cave at night, or even
                  to wander too near it in daytime, there are so many treacherous holes and slippery
                  places around and about it. Philip alone had once examined its interior, and
                  brought out as a trophy a flint hatchet of uncouth make, deeply cut in quaint
                  characters; it now hangs on the wall in the banquet-room, where it is regarded
                  with awe by the wondering tenantry and the servants.
               Close by the cave begins a narrow, sequestered alleyway, reaching far away into
                  the forest; along its sides grow in profusion many varieties of vine-flowers, the
                  modest lavender and the delicious sweetbrier, which shed their refreshing perfume
                  on the air; above, the patriarchal trees keep silent watch and ward, lest too much
                  sun dispel the soothing, transparent darkness which they throw over the scene;
                  they form an intricate roof of glorious fretwork through which blue patches of sky
                  are now and then perceptible when the south wind rolls through the long green
                  aisle and tosses the limbs to and fro, making the cheery sunlight dance in quick
                  measure on the ground and flash between the rustling leaves which sigh at the
                  gentle tumult.
               The yielding turf, here green, there dun or black, forms a fitting carpet for the
                  dainty feet of the lovely girl, who stands so quiet; her high-heeled brodequins
                  quins are of pale amber silk, with coquettish bows trimmed with white and gold
                  lace; in the centre of each is set a small stone, which glows and sparkles very
                  prettily; and, truly, she seems to admire them herself, for her eyes are fixed
                  intently on them, as she stands with one charming little hand resting against the
                  low, drooping boughs of an old oak. But why she should tremble, as she certainly
                  does, and breathe so quickly as to cause her young bosom to rise and fall so
                  tremulously, demands a stronger reason than the idle inspection of the most
                  elaborate slippers, or the prettiest French bow, affords. She looks like a picture
                  from Lely, with its languor and wantonness transformed into purity and
                  innocence.
               Her hair diffuses a subtle perfume while the wind blows it to and fro and toys
                  caressingly with the golden tresses; a trustful, devoted expression dwells in
                  every feature of her face, and fills her eyes, which are as blue as the sapphire
                  and as bright as a fresh dew-drop. Her brows are light brown and delicately
                  curved, her complexion as fresh as the flowers in May. Her figure is very girlish,
                  and shrinks sensitively from the hand which rests on her waist, a piece of
                  officiousness she hardly knows whether to pout at or to reward with a glance; but
                  the struggle is not long, love conquers, and she lays her blushing face on her
                  lover's shoulder, whilst he, with face suffused with happiness unspeakable, gently
                  strokes her soft hair, kissing it with a vehemence that tells its own tale.
               "Look up, sweetheart," he says, in low murmuring tones. "Look up, that I may read
                  in your eyes whether your love can fathom mine."
               She bends her head back, looking him fairly in the eyes with such a look of
                  passionate devotion that his head turns around with the sight, and a giddiness for
                  the moment overpowers him; he lowers his face nearer and nearer to hers, and drinks in her every beauty
                  in an intoxicating draught, until her eyes close in ecstatic joy.
               Here in the dim light, and amid the sweet perfumes of the wild flowers, their
                  breaths mingle and send Cupid's arrows stinging through all their veins.
               "Margery, love, my own, why do you tremble? If there did happen to be anybody
                  espying us——." She started, but Philip soon reassures her by a never-failing
                  method in such cases.
               "They might compare me to a gerfalcon flown at a dove; one would not think you
                  were a soldier's daughter."
               "Philip," she replies in a hurt manner, and with a little quiver of her red lips,
                  "you call me a coward; I am when our love is concerned; in aught else, try me, and
                  you will find I am still a Holmes."
               "Tut, darling, I was but joking."
               She looks at him long and earnestly, as if a new thought had struck her. "Philip,
                  will you always love me as now? I know that if you should ever grow to hate me, or
                  even if you should ever fail to love me above all others, it would break my
                  heart."
               He looks tenderly at her, and replies, "Margery, if all England's beauties—but
                  I'll recite you a few lines of a great dean's poem which will tell you in better
                  words than mine what you already know."
               A half thought forms in her mind to deny the possibility of the dean speaking
                  better or even as well as her Philip, but she fears to offend him, and he recites
                  in a low voice Swift's "Receipt to Form a Beauty," a sonnet on Mrs Biddy Floyd,
                  which is ingenious and witty. In the last line he said "Holmes" instead of
                  "Floyd," a change which destroyed the rhyme, but added to its truthfulness, in
                  Philip's opinion at all events.
               As he finishes, she enunciates demurely, yet with an anxious expression, "Lord
                  Wharton!" His face grows pale and angry, and he makes no answer except to strain
                  her more tightly in his arms. Apparently he hears somebody in the bushes, and he
                  steps hurriedly to the place whence the noise comes. He looks carefully around;
                  there is no one in sight, and he can hear nothing except a mellow whistling in the
                  distance which he recognizes as Brad Throck's; he returns to his frightened
                  sweetheart and says regretfully, "'Tis time for us to part, and Margery, if by any
                  chance your father does find out our meetings, you will always find a trusty
                  fellow in Maldran Gudru the gypsy."
               "Oh! Philip, I always feel afraid when he is about, his eyes are so black and
                  treacherous; he never looks me in the face, I would be afraid to trust him."
               "You are childish, little one. Why should he betray us?" he replies, in a chiding
                  tone.
               She answers, rather timidly, and with a downward look, "I fear me he is more
                  faithful to your father than to you."
               He laughs incredulously, as he well knows the power of his fascinating qualities
                  over most people, and keeps them bright by constant use.
               To explain the secrecy of their meetings, it is necessary to recount circumstances
                  which happened some time before.
               Margery and Philip from their infancy had been playmates and inseparable
                  companions; as a natural consequence a mutual love had taken possession of them,
                  which grew stronger and deeper as they grew older; this Lord Wharton with his
                  usual penetration had noticed, and noticed with some uneasiness; accordingly, he
                  determined to put an end to their further companionship, fearful lest Philip might
                  balk his future intentions by declining to espouse the noble dame he had secretly
                     selected lected for him—an alliance
                  with whom would strengthen his political influence, and also till further enrich
                  his overflowing coffers. His first measure was to forbid Philip ever to see her
                  again in private; his second was to converse with her ladyship in a loud tone
                  about the insolence of a Holmes wishing to ally herself with his family. The
                  servants as a matter of course heard the remarks, which in a short time reached
                  the ears of the irate General, who was so incensed at the arrogance of his
                  neighbor that he peremptorily forbade Margery ever to speak or correspond with
                  Philip again. So matters stand—diplomacy and experience against love and
                  innocence; the old, old tale on which so many changes have been rung, and will be
                  rung until the sun ceases to rise and the world to revolve.
               To resume, Philip replies excitedly, "Let them find us together; let them send
                  their spies to watch our slightest movements; if the worst comes to the worst,
                  there are other places in the world besides Buck's!"
               She looks pained at this words, and replies in a pleading, soothing manner:
                  "Please don't dear—I could never consent to leave my poor old father alone and
                  desolate; mother is in the kirkyard, now, and I am the only one he has to love or
                  be loved by now."
               "Then leave me," he says abruptly; nevertheless, he continues to hold
                  her closely to him; she is pained and perplexed; her blue eyes grow brighter as
                  she nervously twitches the long points of her laced sleeves.
               "We will not talk about it, Philip dear, will we?" she says, after a short
                  interval. "I will tell you about my visit to Queenie, and what she—"
               "Wait a bit, Margery; now tell me what you went to see her for?"
               She answers him with a sweet smile on her lips, and without the slightest
                  hesitation, "I thought you might be there."
               "I thought so," he replies, rather egotistically.
               "Well, she seemed very angry and excited when I entered, and she showed me the
                  portrait of a very pretty girl, who she said had been a great friend to her when
                  she was a little child; she said that a noble gentleman had done this girl a great
                  harm, and that if he did not give her enough money to support herself on until she
                  died, she, Queenie you know, would avenge her. I asked her his name, but she
                  replied, with such a curious smile, Philip! that I might learn it soon enough, and
                  she was silent for a long while; then said suddenly, 'Mistrees Margery, Master
                  Philip was here yest're'en, and I read him his fortune.'"
               "Yes, I recollect she did tell me a heap of wonderful things—but proceed with your
                  tale, sweetheart."
               "'His life,' she said, and I almost hate her for it, 'will be an expiation of
                  another's sin, his path will be crossed by one of his own race, and he will never
                  know peace until the expiation is accomplished.'"
               He laughs as he listens to the wild recital, and feels glad to think that Margery
                  should become so excited at the gypsy queen's foolish words.
               "Oh, I forgot," she resumed, "Queenie told me the girl's name; it was
                  Nelly—Nelly——I forget the last, but it is no matter, it it?" as if she dreads
                  displeasing him.
               "I' faith, no. What should I want to know about Nelly unknown or anybody else when
                  I have you, sweetheart?" She looks happier, and a brighter light illumines her
                  eyes at his fond words.
               Brad returned to the lodge and dutifully told his father that he had been unable
                  to see Mrs. Margery, but had seen Master Philip, who was tracking for
                     deer in the forest and seemed rather
                  unlucky. He was answered in this strain by the suspicious Shem: "I'll be bound,
                  thou glamourin' skipjack, that thou looked not too hard for either; like enow thou
                  'st been trackin' thy own game—Meg Busbie, wi' her finicky gewgaws an' her flighty
                  ribbons an' graces; I knaw weel what thou'rt after, so don't stop glowerin' there
                  like a deer in a covert, but set thee down an' eat th' dinner; for th' mun be rare
                  an' hungry." He took his plate and helped him with a wooden spoon to an immense
                  quantity of hot pease and pudding, and a glass of bubbling, humming mead.
               Brad smiled covertly, and proceeded to refresh his inner man, an operation for
                  which he was always ready. He had the reputation of being the strongest,
                  healthiest lad on the estate, and of course it took a deal of food to keep his
                  appetite down; in fact, when he was smaller, the chaplain, a learned man, had
                  playfully christened him "Omnivorous Brad;" a cognomen which still sticks to him;
                  but it has been corrupted by his comrades into "Nevereat," which rolls off the
                  tongue more easily than its ponderous origin.
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Don John.
                           —I heard him swear his affection.
                        
                        
                           Bora.
                           —So did I too; and he swore he would marry her to-night.
                        
                        
                           Don John.
                           —Come, let us to the banquet."
                        
                     
                     MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING. II. I.
                  
               
               THE Wharton banqueting-hall is fully a hundred feet long and about half as wide;
                  at both ends glow two delicately-stained, deeply-embrasured windows, which reach
                  from the shining floor to the groined ceiling. On either side is a large fireplace
                  set in with Dutch tiles, which are painted in stiff, quaint designs; each fender
                  is guarded by stone dogs, one of which has had half its nose chipped off, probably
                  in some bygone brawl of Cavaliers and Covenanters.
               The ponderous, sideboards are carved with bacchanalian subjects, satyrs,
                  vine-leaves, and the jolly Bacchus, who disports himself in attitudes free and
                  wanton, while the grinning satyrs and the dancing fauns keep time with pipe and
                  feet.
               The walls are panelled, and decorated in a fanciful manner with pictures that have
                  reference to feasting and gayety—all except one, a portrait which hangs over the
                  high mantel; it is the full-length figure of a stern, gloomy, straight-haired
                  Cavalier; in his right hand he holds a Bible, the left grasps a long, bell-mouthed
                  petronel; it is old Sir Philip, the father of the present Lord Wharton. One of his
                  eyes is shot out, and in its place is a round, jagged bullet hole; it was his
                  loving son who had maltreated it in this manner after he had received ceived a lesson in obedience from him when he was
                  young and insubordinate to the authorities that were.
               Lord Wharton often tells the occurrence with many a laugh and jest, and avers that
                  he keeps it there as a Roman of old did his skeleton, to remind him of the
                  shortness of life, and the wisdom of enjoying the passing hour.
               The table is set with all the ceremony and profusion usual on such occasions, and
                  the serving-men and the carvers await the advent of the guests to begin
                  proceedings. They have not long to wait; the doors fly open swiftly and
                  noiselessly; Wharton and his guests stroll in, laughing noisily, and exchanging
                  free jests and stinging repartees. Carelessly resting his hand on Wharton's
                  shoulder, and, to judge by the twinkle in his eye, retailing a famous bit of
                  court-scandal or town-talk, is the nobleman, whose arrogance, vanity, and venality
                  have long since passed into a proverb. He has passed over fifty years of intrigue,
                  politics, and turmoil; but, to judge by his smiling face and his jovial manner,
                  one would never imagine that in that time he had been continually involved in the
                  wildest schemes and the most daring villanies; he is of medium height, and dressed
                  with scrupulous care in a costume of black velvet, with laced and slashed satin
                  trunks. On his breast glitter and tinkle the many orders of which he is a member;
                  most of these he has acquired by acts which any courtier might feel too modest to
                  own; he is known as Charles Montague, Earl of Halifax, Dryden's parodist, and the
                  author of a poem on the death of Charles II., which procured him the friendship of
                  the powerful Earl of Dorset, as well as an introduction to Will's coffee-house,
                  with its attendant profligacy and cold-hearted libertinism.
               Here is the venerable Lord Somers, whose long-flowing wig, calm, sedate face, and
                  magisterial air give him a look of quiet dignity which well befits the
                  representative of so many high posts and honors, and one who single-handed coped
                  with fourteen distinct charges, as false and as dangerously sophistical as Belial
                  himself could possibly devise, brought against him by cunning and powerful
                  enemies, and overthrew them all.
               Close by him is a tall, large-chested, robust man, dressed in plain black; his
                  features are strongly marked and manly; his keen blue eyes penetrate and
                  scrutinize everything and everybody; a sarcastic smile hovers about the corners of
                  his mouth; and as he converses with the gentlemen near him he speaks quickly, and
                  snaps his thumbs energetically, as if the subject under discussion were of great
                  interest. You possibly recognize him? Dean Swift! What sad memories of poor Stella
                  and Vanessa does that name recall! Did he never think regretfully of the
                  unhappiness he had caused? The first so trustful and devoted, who gave him the
                  name by which he always wished her to call him; once he was happy only when she
                  was by his side, commanding him in girlish pettishness, "Presto, come and tell me
                  what this is," or "Darling Presto, you must take me to the fields to-morrow." The
                  other so reserved and haughty to all others, yet so humble and loving when he was
                  with her. The man who could thus fill the hearts of two such women with undivided
                  love must have possessed a power of fascination which he did not always choose to
                  exert, or else he certainly would not have had so many enemies as he did have,
                  even with all his vile caustic lampoons, his party squibs and satires.
               It may seem strange that Swift is here, whose Tory propensities and personal
                  animosity towards his host are well known, but he is an erratic being, and this is
                  possibly one of his freaks; or just as likely, his presence may be ascribed to the
                  workings of his astute host, who has
                  always regretted his attachment to the Tory interest; however, be it as it may, he
                  is always welcome among those who appreciate wit and learning, even if the wit is
                  directed against themselves, and the learning is of rather a truculent nature. The
                  remainder of the guests are Whig notabilities, or those who their designing
                  entertainer intends shall be, if it lies in his power so to make them.
               The conversation at table is rather freer than I care to chronicle, so loose are
                  the morals and so depraved the ideas of the gentlemen of this period.
               After a reasonable time has been allowed for the discussion of the well-furnished
                  table, Wharton rises and proposes the following toast: "Her sacred Majesty and the
                  party which supports her!"
               "Umph!" sneers the genial dean. "Pity she can't support the party; but—." His, the
                  only voice that did not join in the cheer, is drowned in the din.
               Montague, who has heard Swift's sneering remark, rises, and as soon as the noise
                  abates, he says meaningly, "Gentlemen, I have a toast to propose which I am sure
                  will mightily please all that are here." He holds his goblet poised
                  in his jewelled hand. "To Cervantes and Rabelais as original writers,
                  and to Lady Somerset as a true woman."
               It is a common charge of the dean's enemies that he plagiarized from these two
                  authors—a lie, for his was a genius that only borrowed from itself, but still any
                  mention of the ridiculous charge sorely vexes him. Lady Somerset is his bitter
                  enemy, so it is plainly to be seen that the Earl intended the toast for his
                  especial benefit, especially as they are not on the best of terms.
               The Dean drained his goblet in company with the others, and is now standing erect
                  and looking straight at Montague, with his blue eyes scintillating ominously.
                  Again he fills his goblet.
               "My Lord Montague, it ill becomes you above all others to touch on so delicate a
                  subject as stealing—you, who were once Chancellor of the Exchequer! As for the
                  Duchess of Somerset, I respect her as an enemy, but would hate her as a friend."
                  He raises his goblet. "To the memory of Cervantes, Rabelais, and the Duchess of
                  Somerset" (he bows obsequiously), "and to yourself, and any other gentleman who
                  wishes to take it to himself."
               He drains his goblet, and turns it bottom upwards on the table. There is a hush of
                  expectancy, and all eyes are turned on the Earl. He is as white as a sheet, and
                  plays nervously with the scented curls of his French peruke.
               Wharton, seeing a brawl impending, rises, and says calmly: "Gentlemen, I pray your
                  attention for a few minutes, and I will recite to you what pleased me vastly when
                  I read it; I think it will please you too. It is a selection from a poem by that
                  marvellous clever fellow, Gay."
               With graceful gestures, and in a loud, sonorous voice, he reads:— 
                     
                        "Far in Cythera stands a spacious grove,
                        Sacred to Venus and the god of love;
                        Here the luxuriant myrtle rears her head,
                        Like the tall oak the fragrant branches spread;
                        Here Nature all her sweets profusely pours,
                        And paints the enamell'd ground with various flowers;
                        Deep in the gloomy glade a grotto bends,
                        Wide through the craggy rock an arch extends.
                        The rugged stone is cloth'd with mantling vines,
                        And 'round the cave the creeping woodbine twines."
                     
                  
               
               All listen attentively, thankful for their entertainer's kindly tact in preventing
                  a quarrel at table.
               
               Swift's countenance beamed with delight while it was being read, for Gay is one of
                  his few favorites, and he is now loud in his praises of its excellences.
               Comments on the poet's style and sentiments pass around the board; some favorable,
                  others unfavorable; the latter unfortunates the Dean attacks with spirit, and
                  vindicates every word or line carped at or ridiculed.
               Lord Somers, who has for some time been the centre of an engrossed admiring group,
                  is about to speak, and rises slowly to his feet; but, unfortunately, at this
                  instant, a rich harmonious tenor trolls out the famous Jacobite song of "Charlie
                  over the Water."
               All listen in blank amazement, and several instinctively lay their hands on their
                  rapiers; some turn to see whence comes the treasonous refrain. Still it rings high
                  and clear above their astonished heads, until Wharton looks up, and starts with
                  surprise and anger. All eyes follow the direction of his, and lo! high up in the
                  embrasured window, with his head touching the groined arch, and his feet supported
                  by the heavy moulding, stands, or rather clings, his son Philip, the destined prop
                  of the Whigs.
               He looks down on the astonished guests with a mocking smile on his lips, and
                  finishes his song with a merry laugh, and a pert request to Swift to throw him an
                     orange. He, fully alive to the humor and spiciness of the affair,
                  tosses one up to the young scapegrace; he catches it deftly in his loose hand, and
                  lays it on the ledge of a grotesque corbel, directly under his feet. This done, he
                  places his heel on it, and crushes it with such hearty good-will that the juice
                  and pips go flying about the room and on the table.
               "Long live the Hanoverian rats," he cries satirically, and adds in earnest tones,
                  "and God help poor King Jamie!"
               He begins to descend from his perilous position, and finally bounds in safety to
                  the floor. He bows gracefully, and stands erect and confident, as though he awaits
                  the reward which surely must follow so good an action as he has just
                  performed.
               He knows well that his father's sentiments, and also the sentiments of his guests,
                  with one or two exceptions, are eminently loyal, and obnoxious to the claims of
                  the Pretender, or James III., as his adherents call him.
               Wharton says, in a stern, suppressed voice: "Philip, seat yourself!" He does as he
                  is commanded, and settles himself in a chair close to Swift, with the finical
                  affections of a beau as to whether his rapier hangs correctly, or the skirts of
                  his satin coat crease elegantly. He pulls his lace ruffles daintily over his
                  hands. These slight details satisfactorily arranged, he looks at his father, and
                  lifts his eyebrows interrogatively.
               "Philip, you must either retract what you have said, and drink to the health and
                  prosperity of her sacred Majesty, and to the eternal perdition of the Pretender
                  and his cause, or, by God! I'll disown you. Make your choice quickly, and in the
                  presence of these gentlemen whom you have insulted." He stops abruptly; his lips
                  tightly compressed, and his hands twitching violently.
               Philip is about to answer him with hot, angry words, but Swift breaks in: "My
                  lord, mayhap Master Philip does not wish to drink; I, for one, would be satisfied
                  if he but admitted that he was not in earnest."
               The rest of the guests declare the same; and Wharton, who fears that he might
                  refuse to drink the toast, wisely acquiesces, and chokes down his wrath.
               Philip rises and says, with an affectation of perfect sincerity: "Gentlemen, I
                  candidly acknowledge to you that I did not mean all I said." He adds in a low
                  tone, which none hear but Swift: "And that part is 'Long live the
                  Hanoverian.'"
               
               He turns to his father and says respectfully: "Is it your wish that I retire?" He
                  nods his head, and Philip saunters slowly out. As he passes the orange he grinds
                  it again with his heel, and mutters "Nassau—seesaw; it may be my turn next."
               Ere long the company disperse, and leave my lord to the companionship of his
                  thoughts, which are apparently not of the most pleasant nature. His brow is knit
                  and furrowed, and his face is troubled. His capacious mind is taxed to its utmost
                  limit for schemes to ruin the ascendency of the Tories, who, with Harley at their
                  head, give him great uneasiness by their bold movements and subtle machinations,
                  which, together with the unfavorable popular opinion of the Whigs, in consequence
                  of the trial of Dr. Sacheverell for his sermons concerning the doctrine of passive
                  obedience, gave the Tories many advantages. The Whigs are under the direction of
                  Godolphin, whose egregious blunder was so hurtful to his party. At the conclusion
                  of the trial bonfires were lighted, and his name was shouted with cheers and
                  acclamations; while Godolphin's met with groans and hisses. These same riotous
                  proceedings were repeated on the expiration of his sentence, and it seems
                  inevitable that Harley will now carry things with a high hand; while at the ear of
                  majesty itself whispers the Tory tool—handsome, fascinating Mistress Abigail
                  Masham, who has superseded the vixenish Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, who had
                  herself made Mistress Abbie lady of the bedchamber, whence she has worked herself
                  into the love of her royal mistress. Wharton muses regretfully over his party's
                  lost power, and the defeat of their pet measure—the continuance of the war with
                  France, which, had it been carried on, would certainly have brought the Bourbon
                  rule in Spain to a conclusion.

                     MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM. III. II.
                  
               
               PHILIP is going a deerstalking to-day with Shem and his son. He is a keen
                  sportsman, and loves dearly to send a whizzing shaft clean home to the feather in
                  the noble game as it in vain strives to outstrip the messenger of death which
                  springs with a twang from the strong ashen bow.
               It is early morn, and the sun is yet entangled in the branches and limbs of the
                  forest, and has still the heavy dew to drink and the rolling mist to scatter.
               All three are on horseback. Philip and Shem are conversing anent slots and scents,
                  and counters, and such-like jargon of the hunting field. Brad canters respectfully
                  behind with the crossbows and ropes to pack the carcass with, and he also keeps
                  the hounds in leash who are fresh and unruly.
               The lair is empty, but the shape of the buck's body is plainly discernible in the
                  flattened grass. Shem makes a motion to jump from his horse, but Philip
                  anticipates him, and, laying his hand on the recent bed, exclaims in loud tones,
                  "It is warm, Shem;" and his eye betokens his satisfaction.
               Shem scans it narrowly, and replies, "Ay, he is none far away." The hounds find
                  the scent, and begin to whimper and strain in their leashes; but a stern "Back! back! Soft! soft!" from Brad quiets them
                  at once, and they stand like statues—heads outstretched and nostrils
                  distended.
               Philip is just about to order Brad to unleash the hounds, when a black-eyed,
                  weather-rusted gypsy thrusts aside the bushes near the lair, bows low to Philip,
                  and places a note in his hands. He is one of a gang that Lord Wharton allows to
                  live unmolested on his estate, and to whom he occasionally gives a feast in his
                  kitchen—which kindnesses have so endeared him to the impressionable Ishmaelites,
                  that they would do anything to please him.
               Philip offers to reward him, but he, shaking his head, retires as silently as he
                  came.
               Philip recognizes the superscription on the letter as Margery's writing. Bidding
                  Shem to wait a moment, he breaks the seal with glad eagerness. He is half afraid
                  to learn the contents for fear something evil has happened to her. He spreads the
                  little, scented sheet, and reads in a low tone.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "My own darling PHILIP: Love, my own, I will be at Rooksnest at
                              midday. I have no time to write any more, so good-bye.
                           
                              Your true MARGERY.
                              HOLME GRANGE."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               He calculates what time he has left for the chase, and finds that he will have to
                  start for the trysting-place before they could hope to run the buck down, for
                  Shem's experience declares it to be full-grown, and one which would lead them a
                  long chase ere he would consent to stand at bay to receive a huntsman's keen,
                  glittering knife deep in his panting side. So bidding them good-speed, he turns
                  back to Rooksnest, his heart bounding in anticipation of the meeting with his
                  bonnie Margery. He tries to sing, but for very joy he cannot, and the words are
                  choked and indistinct. Taking the missive from his pocket, he re-reads it, to be
                  sure that his eyes had not deceived him. He has not seen her for a whole week, nor
                  has even had a line from her until to-day. He has not even been able to write to
                  her, so closely has she been watched by her offended father.
                  How she can get out to meet him he cannot surmise; nor does he care; if only she
                  is there, he will be content.
               He is now within a few yards of the Holmes' Estate, which is contiguous to his
                  father's. Thinking he hears, above the rustle of the trees and the purling of the
                  brook which runs close by, voices in angry discussion, one of which resembles his
                  father's, he presses forward to see who they are that converse in so high a tone.
                  A thought decides him to peer through the trees hiding the disputants from his
                  view.
               A sickening sensation chills his blood as he perceives his father and General
                  Holmes standing face to face, their eyes flashing, and speaking in angry tones.
                  Little Margery leans trembling against a neighboring tree; her hands are clasped
                  on her throat, and her face pales and flushes alternately. Her eyes are fixed on
                  the angry men with a pleading, pitiful expression that goes straight to Philip's
                  heart.
               As he gazes fascinated on a scene which fills him with the liveliest apprehension,
                  the General says, in an excited manner, "My lord, your charges are false, and at
                  some other time"—he glances at his daughter, who turns her eyes on the ground—"I
                  will prove my words, either at the sword's point, or in any way most agreeable to
                  your lordship!"
               "General," Wharton replies, in icy, cutting tones, and with punctilious gestures,
                  "whenever and wherever you please." He raises his hat to Mistress Margery and bows
                  lowly to her father.
               
               Philip determines at all hazards to interfere, and if possible prevent the duel
                  which he sees must take place if they part in this manner. He is aware of his
                  father's aversion to both the General and to Margery—to him for his politics, and
                  to her for Philip's love towards her; and he dreads his father's masterly use of
                  the rapier, feeling sure that he would not lose such an opportunity as the duel
                  presented, to place an impassable barrier between their union. Throwing himself at
                  his father's feet, he cries, "Spare him for her sake! I could not live without
                  her!"
               Wharton looks down on his son with surprise and vexation depicted on his
                  countenance.
               "Philip, rise at once! cease this masquerading! How came you here? Methinks your
                  chase of the wild deer has not been a long one, since you have had time to quarry
                  other game so successfully." He twitches his thumb in the direction of Margery,
                  who has fallen senseless.
               "Father, spare me! If you but knew how madly I love her, you—"
               "Tut, tut; let her be your light-o-love; but never let it be said that a Wharton
                  stooped to a Holmes. Why, man, an eagle never mates with a crow"—he answers in a
                  low tone.
               Philip springs to his feet, and looks him boldly in the face as he replies, "My
                  lord, Mistress Holmes is as proper a woman as was ever begot in our house—and
                  more—"
               He is interrupted by Margery, who has recovered from her swoon. She stands between
                  them, with her back to her lover, and says to Wharton, with a sob that shakes her
                  from head to foot, "My lord, I give him up forever. I'll try to hate him for his
                  own sake.—You will be a friend to my father?"
               My lord stares in astonishment, and allows her to lead him to the General.
                  Beginning to see how matters stand, and convinced, in spite of himself, that the
                  girl is in earnest, he extends his hand to the General, and says persuasively,
                  "General, allow me to apologize for the hasty expressions I made use of in our
                  conversation. It is folly for us to quarrel like raw school-boys."
               Holmes' face brightens as he grasps the hand of the wily diplomat, and he
                  energetically protests that it was all his fault in being so hasty.
               As soon as Margery sees they are friends again, she endeavors to dart down the
                  path leading to Holme Grange, but Philip intercepts her, and clasps her securely
                  around the waist, demanding, in excited accents, to know the meaning of the
                  previous scene.
               "Unhand me, Philip, for Heaven's sake!" Her further utterance is checked by a
                  torrent of tears, which threaten to end in hysterics.
               Philip is amazed at her language, and silently mourns over the fickleness of
                  woman; but soon all his sympathy is aroused by the evident pain she is in. Leading
                  her to a broken rustic seat, made of a huge tree which had been cut down and sawed
                  into many portions, he sits down beside her, while his eyes show his perplexity
                  and vexation.
               "Philip, my own, I cannot give you up."
               "Give me up? What mean you, Margery?" he replies in wondering tones.
               Her conversation with his father had been carried on in so low a tone that he had
                  not heard her words.
               "It means, dearest, that you can do with me whatever you will, forever and ever!"
                  Her soft white arms wind about his neck, and her lips meet his with a passionate
                  kiss.
               "Only a love quarrel after all, Margery, eh?"
               "No," she replied in serious tones, "it was no quarrel at all. I'll tell you all about it.—I was at
                  Rooksnest before the time, and was waiting for you at the very spot where you saw
                  me, when I met father, who asked me—oh, so crossly—where I was going, and what I
                  did alone in the forest, for he had forbidden me to leave the house without an
                  attendant, as you know. I could not answer him, I was so afraid. But Lord Wharton,
                  who happened to be in the same part of the grounds, and must have heard him, said,
                  'Sir, if she is unable to tell you, I can doubtless do so;' and to my terror and
                  surprise he read, in icy, cruel tones, that quite froze my blood, every word of
                  the letter I had written you!"
               Philip starts, and feels for her letter; it is safe in his pocket. "Maldran has
                  betrayed us; a curse on the knave!" he mutters.
               "Then angry words passed between them; and if I had not placed my hand on father's
                  sword, I am sure there would have been bloodshed—and between them!" She shudders,
                  and clings closer to Philip.
               "Margery, sweetheart, I will find Maldran, and if he has done us this foul turn,
                  I'll stab him in his camp, the black-hearted villain!"
               "Please don't, Philip; those gypsies might do you some harm."
               He laughs scornfully at her fears, and is about to scout such an idea; but she
                  turns her head, and says quickly:—
               "Hush! Yes, it is my father. Quick, Philip, hide yourself until he passes. If he
                  sees you, it might anger him again. Quick! he is coming this way. Hide yourself,
                  and I will be in my room before he overtakes me."
               He draws her to him, and—well, she looks happier after the embrace.
               Like the zephyr now she flies, swift and noiseless to hide herself in her own
                  little room, and think over the day's doings.
               Philip has scarcely concealed himself when the General strides by with a firm,
                  commanding step, the plumes on his hat, and his long hair dancing and tossing in
                  the breeze which sighs gently through the tangled branches overhead, and swirls
                  the dead leaves round and round in swift circles of brown and yellow, scarlet and
                  green.
               During the time that his lordship and the General had been left together, the
                  former had employed his time in flattering and endeavoring to sound the latter, to
                  see whether he was in possession of any secrets of the Harley administration; but
                  the General either knew nothing or else was too old a soldier to be caught even
                  with the well-baited hooks which his lordship sent out for him to seize. So
                  drawing his gray velvet cloak about his shoulders, Lord Wharton called to Philip
                  to follow him. He was surprised to find that his son had disappeared. He scowled,
                  and said, "I was a dolt to trust the pretty wench, for all her pleading eyes and
                  innocent ways. Why I should have done so surprises me. To trust a girl's word,
                  after my experience of them!" And he smiled scornfully. "A good impulse probably.
                  Mighty few have found their way to me lately, and I shall take care it is the
                  last. Curse me! She give up Philip? Possible. Philip give her up? Never! He is too
                  much like myself in such things." And the courtly sinner chuckled knowingly. "If
                  he had more sense, and a trifle less of what he calls 'honor,' she might have been
                  his own long ago, sans Hymen. S'blood! if I was not his respected father, I would
                  certainly advise him on that point myself." A malicious smile curls his lips as he
                  says: "Shem will do; I'll to him." And he proceeded in the direction of the
                  keeper's lodge.

                           "York.—

                              Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,
                              And greedily devour the treacherous bait;
                              So angle we for Beatrice;"——
                           
                        
                     
                     MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING. III. I.
                  
               
               SHEM had scarcely finished his luncheon and begun to talk with his son on the
                  glorious run they had, of the feints and doublings of the old buck, of the high
                  wall on the moor which they had taken flying, and to approve the gallant manner in
                  which Brad had sheathed his knife clean to the haft as the desperate beast stood
                  at bay with horns lowered, feet pawing, and back bristling, ere a quick, sharp rap
                  sounds at the door, and footsteps grate on the ground in front of the lodge.
               "Don't be asleep, lad! open the door!" Shem cries; but, before Brad can get there,
                  the latch is lifted and Lord Wharton enters and nods pleasantly to Shem; he tells
                  him that he would like a short conversation with him at once; turning to Brad, he
                  says shortly, "My lad, you may amuse yourself in the chase for a half hour;" and
                  he points to the door.
               Brad, only too willing to leave so high and mighty a presence as soon as possible,
                  walks shamefacedly to the door.
               Shem scratches his curly head, and wonders what his lordship wants to see him for,
                  "rebeck him! may be to arrange a-good hunt, or to chide him for some fault."
               His lordship takes the old arm-chair, close by the lattice window, through which a
                  wide sweep of beautiful and romantic landscape can be seen, and tells Shem to seat
                  himself also. He knows the sturdy upright nature of his gamekeeper, and knows
                  that, in order to have his cordial co-operation in the vile job he is about to
                  broach to him, he will have to glaze it over with sophistry and dazzle his
                  understanding by varnishing it with words beyond his comprehension. He begins in a
                  careless, matter-of-course manner. "Shem, it lies in your power to do me a
                  service, which I know you will do, not only to please me, but to have a hand in so
                  good a joke yourself."
               Wharton looks at him as if he expects him to say something; Shem, however,
                  bewildered by his master's condescension, answers not a word, but appears grave
                  and embarrassed, and shifts his legs and arms about uneasily, looking the very
                  embodiment of awkwardness. He did not dare to refuse my lord's command to seat
                  himself, although at the same time he thought it a sad breach of good manners to
                  do so.
               Wharton continues: "This is what I mean. You are aware that Master Philip has a
                  liking for pretty Mistress Holmes, and he thinks that I know vastly less about it
                  than I do; so, in order to enjoy a mighty good joke at his expense—ah! ha!—I want
                  you, when next you see him, to mention her name, and cautiously insinuate that you
                  think him fondly foolish for not running away with her to London, where she can be
                  all his own!"
               Here Shem is about to ejaculate something, but he restrains himself, and reddens
                  to the roots of his beard.
               "I will pretend to know nothing about it until the last moment; then, to prevent
                  any scandal attaching to her—" He narrowly watches Shem's face, and smiles
                  inwardly as he notes his relieved look, and surmises that the first part of his plan alarmed him for
                  Margery's sake, whom he loves next to Brad and his falcons. "I say, to prevent any
                  scandal attaching to her, I will stop the proceeding, and none will be the wiser
                  but ourselves. If you would not like Master Philip to know that you have a hand in
                  the affair, of course I will never tell him. I will not insult you by offering you
                  a reward, for I know there is not a Throck living who would not feel happy to
                  fulfil my wishes; but if you should like 'Queen Anne,' who is, as you know, by
                  'Careless' out of 'Lightning,' you are welcome to her, and she is as fine a colt
                  as there is in all Buck's."
               Shem can scarcely sit still, so elated is he at his master's present, for it is
                  one of the best horses in the stable, and one for which he has sighed time and
                  again.
               "My lord, I thank ye kindly. Ye could ha' given me nowt I wad prize so highly as
                  'Queen Anne.' As for the favor, it was your lordship's mind to jest wi' me a bit,
                  for well ye knaw whether or no I wad' or wad' not do such an a thing, if only out
                  on' love for a bit o'jollity." He reddens again as he proceeds: "Excuse me, your
                  lordship, but ye are sure that no harm can come out on it to either o' the young
                  folks?"
               "No, no, Shem; you are getting nervous, timid."
               My lord rises, walks to the door, and bids him "goodbye" in a suave, conciliating
                  manner, his scabbard point scattering the white sand which the care of the
                  gudewife had swept into squares on the red tiled floor.
               "Nervous! that's what the gentle folks, more so, the women part be. It's French, I
                  knaw, and modish, so I'm no' nervous; but I wad sair blame mysen if aught I did
                  suld bring sorrow to wee, gowden-haired Margery, for she is mair an angel than a
                  child o' earth. It was once before that my lord wanted to knaw whether master
                  Philip was wi' her down by Rooksnest!—Queen Anne! rebeck me! My heart jumps wi'
                  joy. Sure my lord must mean well? Of coorse, of coorse."
               If Shem had had his eyes at the door, he might have seen Brad standing there in a
                  listening attitude, but his ideas were so taken up with the colt that he had
                  thoughts for nothing but its glossy coat, its great speed, and its docility.

               THE day is drawing to its close. The sun is falling through a sea of fire, glowing
                  in wondrous hues and mazy colors unspeakably lovely and sublime. Vast masses of
                  white clouds float and billow in detached fragments—snow-banks in the blue
                  ether—through which long quivering rays dart fiery streaks that are mellowed to a
                  pearly-pink in their struggle to pierce them through.
               The spot we are on commands an extensive view of the wildest and most glorious
                  part of the country. Here we can revel in all the varieties of an English
                  landscape, and feast on such views as Claude or Hobbema would have thoroughly
                  enjoyed. The moors and the fells; the valleys and the hills; the bounding mountain
                  torrent, tumbling and rumbling over its rocky bed; and the more placid stream
                  winding through forest and meadow—all have a beauty that can only be appreciated
                  by the keen observer and the lover of the beautiful in nature.
               Far off, beyond the reach of bow-shot, can be traced the graceful outlines of a
                  noble buck, his antlered head tossed proudly back; the hawk's shrill cry grates
                  above, as it circles with quickening rapidity over the nest of its frightened
                  prey, and from the meadows beyond comes a faint, nutty smell as of dying flowers
                  and ripening fruit.
               As the vivid tints of the expiring day grow dimmer, lurid lights as of bonfires
                  flicker and gleam in the depths of the woodland. There let us go, being careful to
                  avoid the deep, silent tarns whose waters are icy cold and clear, and the deep
                  gulches whose treacherous sides are covered with luxuriant foliage and thick vines
                  with many-hued berries.
               We reach an open space where a curious scene presents itself, whose rich tones,
                  deep shadows, and picturesque accompaniments would require a Poussin's color to
                  depict. The great, majestic trees raise their heads to the sky, and throw
                  glancingly off the silvery beams of the rising moon which essay to break through
                  their interweaving branches. In the centre of two or three dingy, tattered tents,
                  and as many rickety hovels, stands the gypsy queen's abode, rather larger, and
                  outwardly cleaner than its companions. On the summit waves a small yellow flag
                  adorned with Oriental characters and symbols; it is weather-stained and ragged,
                  looking a fit standard for the motley group who flourish under its shadow, and at
                  present sprawl in ungainly attitude around the fire. At the largest of these the
                  evening meal is cooking in a large iron kettle, which hangs between two green
                  boughs, simmering and bubbling noisily, while its aromatic smell of herbs, meats,
                  and condiments diffuses itself about.
               At the smaller fires are stalwart men, big-limbed and ruffianly; women with long,
                  black hair falling in tangled masses on their bare shoulders; and half-naked babes
                  and children, who warm their feet in the welcome heat, and crow jubilantly at the
                  rising sparks.
               At the entrance to the camp is a tall, muscular vagabond, who stands stolidly at
                  his post, surveying the hotch-potch kettle with listless eyes. It is Nanar, the
                  most cunning tinkler—the best wrestler in the county, and his queen's favorite
                  besides. See! he raises his head and
                  cranes his neck as if to catch a far-off sound. Suddenly throwing himself full
                  length on the ground, he places his ear to it. Listening attentively for a few
                  minutes, he springs lightly to his feet, and cries in a low, but penetrating
                  whisper, "Wha's there?" Almost immediately he receives the answer, "You have a
                  quick ear, Nanar." The voice appears to reassure him, for he assumes his former
                  position with scarcely a look at the intruder, merely pulling his forelock as a
                  sign of respect to a superior.
               The flames of the fires show us Lord Wharton!—an odd, unlikely place for him to
                  visit at this time of the evening. Stamping the thick dew off his shoes, he
                  brushes the wet leaves and twigs from his cloak, draws it tightly around his
                  shoulders again, and steps quickly to the queen's tent, where a password admits
                  him at once. The little room is feebly lighted by a short, clumsy candle which
                  sputters and gutters complainingly in its rude holder—two nails hammered slantwise
                  into the table, and pushed tightly against the soft tallow.
               The queen is a tall, handsome woman. Her face is peculiar and strongly marked; her
                  eyes are blue-black; her brows are well curved, but thick and heavy; eye-lashes
                  very long; her skin is as dark as the darkest of her tribe; and her lips are full,
                  and rather sensual. Greeting her visitor with a respectful smile, she points to a
                  stool close beside her, on which she requests him to be seated. She reclines on a
                  pile of soft deer-skins, looking careless and languid; indeed, her attitude
                  showing a spirit of coquetry and wantonness, exhibits scarce enough dignity for
                  the ruler of such a turbulent, unruly set as are outside. But, under this apparent
                  "easifulness," she has an iron will that can awe the roughest, the most mutinous
                  of her followers, if it is necessary for the sake of law and order, and she can
                  scourge them with words as keen as their own knives, and be as imperious as ever
                  was Cleopatra or good Queen Bess.
               Wharton lays his hat and cloak on the table, and replies, in answer to her
                  inquiries anent his health. "How is it with thee, my bonnie queen?" "As well as
                  ever, my lord, thanks to the good man." He adds—"And just as bewitching." Laughing
                  at his compliment, she says: "My Lord, ye will drink wi' me ere I ask you anent
                  the business that brings you here—though welcome ye be, whether ye come on
                  business or pleasure." "Sooth," he answers, "the pleasure is for myself alone; the
                  business for myself and others." A meaning smile crosses his face as he says this.
                  She notices the expression on his lips; but her eyes give no indication that she
                  is attending to anything but the filling of a pewter pot with an aromatic wine,
                  yellow as amber, and as clear as crystal. This operation finished, she hands him
                  the pot with a hand which, though brown and dusky, is as perfect in contour as
                  ever painter dreamed of or poet imagined. On its index finger sparkles the signet
                  ring used by the tribe as a means of message carrying which insures the identity
                  of the wearer.
               "Queenie," says Wharton, as he raises the wine to his lips, "to yourself, a true
                  descendant of Jockie Faa and the dark-eyed beauties of the East." Tossing it off,
                  he returns her the empty pot. Replacing it and the liquor bottle in the closet
                  behind her couch, she turns to him, and says gravely: "Now, my lord, what can the
                  gypsy queen do for ye or yours? Speak, and let the moon be my witness, I will do
                  it willingly, be your wishes good or bad, true or fause!"
               Crossing her hands on her bosom she awaits his reply.
               "Well, to begin with, I wish to leave this purse with you, half of its contents
                  for yourself, and half for Maldran dran."
                  So saying, he tosses a well-filled purse on her lap. She does not even glance at
                  it, but remains as motionless as a statue, keeping her eyes steadily on his face.
                  He resumes: "And I would see Maldran ere I go, to give him further instructions
                  how to act during my stay in London." She lifts a small silver whistle from her
                  neck, and blows a piercing call on it. The summons is answered like magic; the
                  door opens, and the gypsy enters, greasy with his unfinished supper; saluting his
                  queen, he looks towards Wharton with an inquiring look.
               Says the queen in the Rommany dialect: "Maldran, my praw, his lordship wishes to
                  patter wi' ye anent his going awa'; chee, chee, and you will know." "Baurie
                  Raunie, I listen," he replies sullenly. But the money she hands him creates a
                  palpable difference in his feelings, as his brightening countenance evinces.
               Wharton, who seems desirous of leaving, says hurriedly, "Maldran, I am going to
                  London, and I want you to watch Master Philip and Mistress Holmes while I am away.
                  Take note of all their actions, so that I may know how they behave when I am not
                  near. If anything important happens, send a messenger with the news at once to
                  Christopher Catt's, Fountain Tavern, in the Strand." Drawing a seal-ring from his
                  finger, he proceeds: "This will be his token."
               Maldran nods his approval, takes the ring, and secretes it in a pocket of his
                  dirty leather breeches, which he has worn until they are as black and as shiny as
                  satin, and takes his departure.
               Wharton is about to follow him, but the queen exclaims quickly, "Wait, my lord! I
                  have a word to say to you ere you go!" He drums impatiently on the table, and
                  looks surprised at her request. "'Tis a story I can tell in a few minutes, for all
                  a life's wrong is contained tained in it: I was a little girl once, and I
                  committed a great sin against our laws—I need not tell you what it was. I was
                  sentenced to banishment frae our tribe; but a sweet lady interceded for me wi' her
                  tongue and her gowd, and—"
               "What is all this to me? I have no time to waste on childish fooleries," he cries
                  angrily, laying his hand on the latch.
               Springing from her couch like a fawn, she places her back against the door, and
                  replies: "More than you think, my lord. Hear me out! I say she interceded for me,
                  and procured my pardon. From that moment I became her debtor for life. Now listen!
                  Her name was Nelly Valentin! You ruined her. She is now in London, a
                  starving, shame-stricken outcast. You must send her enough money to keep her from
                  want until she dies, or—I am your enemy for life."
               Her eyes are glittering and angry now, while her teeth show white through her half
                  open lips. Wharton reddening with anger at her audacity, and, unable to control
                  himself, strikes her on the face with the back of his hand, cutting a little gash
                  in her cheek with his diamond ring. She involuntarily puts her hand on the cut,
                  but takes it away instantly, opens the door, and says calmly, "Go, my lord; you
                  and the gypsy queen are enemies." He laughs scornfully, and steps out, past the
                  fires, through the swarthy groups, and into the darkness of the forest.
               "'A God's blood," he mutters, "what a tigress! It is strange how she could have
                  discovered my frolic with Nelly! But I must hie me home, or her ladyship will
                  wonder at my absence on the eve of my departure."
               It is now time to explain how it was that Lord Wharton, General Holmes and poor
                  Margery should have both happened to be
                  in an unfrequented part of the grounds at the same time. It was in this manner: as
                  soon as Margery had given Maldran the message to Philip he took it to Wharton, by
                  whom he was employed as a spy on the lovers. Wharton read it, copied the contents,
                  and then instructed the faithless rascal to take it to its proper destination. He
                  then sat down and wrote in a feigned hand to General Holmes, telling him that his
                  daughter was to meet Philip in the woods at noon; he signed the letter "A Friend."
                  He waited until nearly the time she had appointed for the rendezvous, and sent the
                  letter to him by a disguised servant. He then took his way to Rooksnest and
                  awaited with malignant pleasure the fiasco which he knew must ensue, and which he
                  hoped would at one blow break up the relations between the lovers. How it turned
                  out we know.
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               
                  
                     
                        "There's some exception, man an' woman;
                        But this is gentry's life in common."
                     
                  
                  THE TWA DOGS.
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "My heart is sair, I dare na tell,
                           My heart is sair for somebody;
                           I could wake a winter night
                           For the sake of somebody."
                        
                     
                     MY HEART IS SAIR, I DARE NA TELL."
                  
               
               HOLME GRANGE fronts on a clear, swift stream, which is lined on the other side
                  with drooping water grasses and showy river-weed—Philip's Stream, Margery calls
                  it, as with heart and eyes engrossed by the one object she sees her ideal in all
                  things around or about her. The house is surrounded by a large garden laid out in
                  the Elizabethan style, with sprucely cut hedges and intricate pathways whose sides
                  are clustered with all the flowers that are in season. The "drive" from the gate
                  to the stables is adorned with marble fountains, whose Rubenesque nymphs and
                  Cupids pour streams of water on the gold and silver fish disporting themselves in
                  the basin.
               The old hall was built in the Tudor days, and the effect produced on the educated
                  mind while surveying it is a feeling of true admiration and delight. The roof is
                  of a high pitch, and it is chastely beautified with delicate tracery. Arched beams
                  protect a row of small stone figures, which stand over the main entrance and seem
                  the guardian angels of the house and its pertainings. The square mouldings over
                  all the windows and doorways have the family quarterings cut on them—an arm
                     erect, and clutching in its hand a
                  dagger, on a field gules, and surrounded by the legend "Soyez
                  Tranquylle" in old Norman letters. The long Gothic windows are minutely panelled,
                  and reflect in parti-colors the cloud-flecked sky and the waving, rustling
                  trees.
               The General's stalwart figure can be seen, and the jingle of his spurs heard, as
                  he walks by the side of his daughter, talking to her in a tone of parental
                  reproof, to which she listens with downcast countenance and eyes suffused with
                  tears that momentarily threaten to fall on the dainty pink hood which she twitches
                  so pettishly. He speaks to her in a kindly manner: "Margery, hinny, I desire above
                  all things your happiness, and for yours I would willingly sacrifice my own; but
                  in this case I am determined. His lordship does not wish the match, nor do I think
                  that, with all Philip's talents and his unusual forwardness, he would make you a
                  true, faithful husband. I distrust your geniuses!"
               Margery does not answer him, but her lip quivers, and her hands tightly clutch her
                  trailing dress. He looks at her with pitying sympathy, and heartily regrets that
                  Master Philip is forbidden by his father to betroth himself to his bonnie
                  daughter, both for her sake and his own, for the alliance would be honorable and
                  politic—especially in these times, when it is now Tory, now Whig, who make the
                  laws and break them at their pleasure, and it is well to have a friend on both
                  sides if possible.
               While the father is occupied with his thoughts, Margery lifts her eyes to his face
                  to see whether he really is as firm in the cruel resolve as his speech betokened;
                  and now, as he turns to her to renew the conversation, he finds her sweet face
                  upturned and close to his, with lips half parted, and such a pleading expression
                  in her azure eyes that he impulsively ejaculates: "Bless you, little one! If I
                  could help you in this, God knows I would, natheless his lordship's insolence to
                  me; but I am as helpless as yourself!"
               Margery clasps her hands excitedly, and cries in a joyful voice, "Then you
                     will let me meet him at Rooks-nest sometimes?"—and stops abruptly,
                  with a vague idea that she has said something bold and unmaidenly.
               The father looks perplexed again, and answers firmly: "No, Margery. If he cannot
                  take you for weal or woe, he shall not have you at all. Besides, darling, you are
                  too young yet. Save us! scarcely fourteen, and wants to marry? What is the world
                  coming to, now-a-days? It would be very wrong in you to see him alone under these
                  circumstances; and all that I can allow you at present, is to close my eyes while
                  forbidden letters are flying to and fro."
               After this unexpected outburst, Margery is thankful for even so small a privilege;
                  for is not a letter from him the next best thing to his own dear self?
               The General, almost regretting his permission to allow her to correspond with
                  Philip, mutters: "Even that is more than the jade ought to do under such
                  circumstances." Margery, hearing him, her cheeks pale with apprehension, and
                  anxious to avoid discussion on so dangerous a topic, kisses him good-bye, and runs
                  in to be suitably attired for the rustic wedding which is to take place to-day in
                  the village—Will Happun and Nanny Prevent being the happy couple who are to be
                  united in the "holy bands of matrimony;" and as they are dependants of General
                  Holmes, he and Margery have graciously promised to superintend the ceremony, and
                  also to give the bride a handsome "tocher." She skims along the odorous path, up
                  the high marble steps, across the veranda, through the low window opening on it,
                  and finally bursts almost breathless into her own pretty room, her cheeks flushed and her hair dishevelled
                  with the air and the exercise. "Nanny! Nanny! where are you?" Margery calls, and
                  at the summons the future bride enters to dress her young mistress for the last
                  time. She is a comely, rosy-cheeked, small-waisted lass, whose well-turned ankle
                  and neat foot are cased in clocked silk stockings and bright red brodequins, whose
                  heels are skilfully shod with brass so that they will click-clack properly when
                  she walks up and down the chapel aisle, the first as a maid, the second as a
                  wife.
               "'Sooth, Nannie, you look mighty pretty to-day," says Margery with a smile.
               Nannie turns as red as her shoes, and replies with a demure air, "Please ye,
                  Mistress Margery, that's how I want to look, for Will's sake."
               Margery thinks how curious it is that she has always that thought in her own head
                  whenever she is going to see Philip, and a confused idea of the universality of
                  love crosses her mind.
               "That is right, Nannie," Margery utters with a grave, motherly air; and the next
                  minute she laughs outright at the wonderfully solemn accents in which she had
                  spoken. She resumes: "Quick! or Will may have to wait for you at the chapel door,
                  and that is unlucky, you know."
               At once the girl sets deftly to work, and removes the light coif holding Margery's
                  hair in its place. Whilst she is gently passing her hands through the silky mass,
                  a tap is heard at the door, and she ceases her pleasant duty to inspect the
                  intruder. It is one of the bridesmaids—soon to be a bride herself, by the
                  way—curly-headed, merry, frolicsome Meg Busbie, the possessor of a dangerous pair
                  of hazel eyes, dancing with fun and mischief, and of a trim little waist and
                  swelling bosom. There are a charming demureness and an air of restrained vivacity
                  about her at the present moment which are foreign to her; she curtsies low to
                  Margery, and remains quiet until my lady of thirteen—say fourteen—is ready to
                  speak to her, which will be as soon as she lets fall the golden coil she holds
                  between her red lips.
               Dear reader, as all weddings resemble one another in important particulars, and as
                  the above differs in no wise from the general rules, with your permission I will
                  allow your imagination to finish this otherwise abrupt chapter, and turn to Philip
                  and his doings.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IX.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "King.—

                              That thou art so inhuman—'twill not prove so—
                              And yet I know not—thou didst hate her deadly—"
                           
                        
                     
                     ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL.
                  
               
               WHEN Philip returned to the castle, after the occurrence at Rooksnest, he had felt
                  greatly disinclined to face his father's penetrating eye or hear his sarcastic
                  remarks; but when they sat down at table, my lord never even mentioned the
                  subject—ignored it entirely. He was too politic and far-seeing to hazard any more
                  "scenes" until he saw how the project which was now in hand turned out. If it
                  failed, then he had determined he would send Philip abroad for a year or two, to
                  complete his education under the guidance of some Protestant Whig who could
                  control his actions and put a check on his turbulent spirits.
               My lady and Philip are at present in the blue room, so called on account of the
                  color of its tapestry and its hangings. She sits in a high, straight-backed chair
                  of ebony, inlaid, and fancifully worked in mosaic around the sides and on the
                  arms. Her dark velvet dress is profusely trimmed with black lace, and her glossy
                  hair is dressed in the foot-high mode peculiar to the time. On her right cheek are
                  the inevitable two patches—one a crescent, the other a star.
               She looks admiringly on her beautiful son, who is seated at her feet on a low
                  foot-rest, studying over a speech which he has just finished declaiming before a
                  large company of people who are guests of my lord's, and for which he was loudly
                  applauded. He is boldly giving his opinion of it, and criticizes it with a rare
                  judgment in one so young. He sneers at the falsity of this expression, the bad
                  rhetoric of that, and condemns its style in unmeasured terms of contempt and
                  scorn—the while his mother wonders what he will be in future when he is so
                  talented now?
               She says, in a deprecating manner, but withal a gleam of maternal pride in her
                  eyes: "Phil, dear, you must be wrong! Why, faith! it was written and spoken by as
                  clever a speaker as ever thrilled the Commons, and it is considered mighty fine by
                  all who have either read it or heard it delivered except yourself!"
               "Mother," he answers with kindling eyes, "under favor, I care not who liked it, or
                  who disliked it, I still have my own opinion, and I will keep it, despite them
                  all."
               She sighs as she thinks of the dangers his quick, volatile temperament will surely
                  lead him into if it is not governed more strictly, and she has a faint idea that
                  she ought to reprove him; however, not caring to irritate him further, quietly
                  says: "My son, it is now time for you to practise with Monsieur Vitesjambe; so I
                  will bid you good-day."
               Philip kisses her respectfully, and turns to leave the room, when a better impulse
                  induces him to turn and pick up the speech which he had thrown on the floor in his
                  previous anger. Placing it on the table beside her, he leaves the room without a
                  word, and proceeds to the maitre-de-danse to be
                  perfected in the various dances in vogue.
               The courtly minuet, the lively coranto, and the javotte, as well as the proper way
                  to enter and leave a room, the bow and the congee, Philip practises under the
                  diligent attention of Monsieur Vitesjambe, a dried-up dapper Frenchman, whose affected strut brings forcibly to
                  the mind ludicrous visions of pin-wire and strained catgut. In truth even his
                  ordinary steps are regulated with the nicety and precision of one whose whole soul
                  is in his art—or his heels. Monsieur Vitesjambe was forced to fly from France—that
                  is, Paris—on account of his pecuniary affairs, in which he had been swindled by
                  treacherous friends; and he is never tired of talking and gesticulating about
                     La belle France et le Grand Monarque. And his
                  voice! Voltaire, give me a name for it! Our English "crackling" might do; but the
                  French pétillant is better, and expresses better
                  what I mean. Although openly professing Whig sentiments, he is at heart a Tory, as
                  far at least as he is interested in English politics; and Philip owes it partly to
                  him and partly to his own reckless spirit of opposition, that he is adverse to his
                  father's principles, for his vivid imagination and his chivalrous sympathies were
                  awakened by the Frenchman's tales of the royal exile, who was thrust from his
                  throne by an ugly, phlegmatic Dutchman, who could not speak the language of the
                  people he governed, and whose sad-colored raiment had been the ridicule of his
                  court. Philip even carries his resentment to Anne for her continued usurpation of
                  her brother's throne, and often says that if he ever has the power, he will once
                  more restore their inheritance to the Stuarts.
               After an hour's practising, Monsieur Vitesjambe declares the lesson to be over,
                  and Philip pays a visit to Shem Throck to converse with him about hunting,
                  hawking, and other outdoor sports. When he enters the lodge Shem is busily engaged
                  in feeding a pair of gerfalcons perched on the frame beside him, for he is a
                  master-falconer as well as gamekeeper; although the position is a comparative
                  sinecure, for hawking is not now so fashionable as it was in the days of Queen
                  Bess, when, if an imputation was cast on the courage of one's falcon-gentle or
                  Barbary, it was as necessary to draw Bilboa and fight to the death for its honor
                  as for one's own.
               Shem has just come in from the stream, where he has been flying his pet
                  falcon-gentle at the wild fowl, and in excited accents details to the admiring
                  Philip his courageous deeds. "Kestrils and Sacers! When I cast her off aloft she
                  reet deftly plumed her bird, an' twice remewed it from the river! Then she took
                  her at the souse an' struck her down wi' a rousin' prod! 'Fackins! Master Philip,
                  it were a goodly sight!" He ceases, to look admiringly at the falcon, while with
                  half-closed eyes he points out its various beauties to his attentive listener.
                  "Look ye, Master Philip," he exclaims; "see her wide nostrils, an' her big black
                  e'en an' e'elids! What a roun' head an' a thick blue beak she has! An' did ye ever
                  afore see such broad shoulders an' long wings?"
               "Never," replies Philip heartily.
               Shem continues: "An' the other is a beauty too, I warrant ye! She is as sma' as
                  the tiniest o' them a'."
               "She is, indeed," says Philip. "And her red plumes betray her species; she is a
                  fine Barbary."
               "She is that, Master Philip; she comes from a far-awa country, hundreds of miles
                  away, they tell me."
               "Yes, Shem, from the Levant, where I will go some day to see the long-bearded Turk
                  mumble over his Koran, which he considers quite as good as our Bible."
               "God help us!" cries Shem, with uplifted hands. "Not that I am ower righteous
                  mysen, but it's fearful!"
               Smiling at his horror, Philip begins to tease the falcons, which snap playfully at
                  his fingers. While thus engaged, Shem casts a quick glance at him, and says
                  carelessly: "If I be no too free, Master Philip, it seems queer to me that wi' a'
                  your love for Mistress Margery, you don't
                  run awa' wi' her; then ye see ye could ha' her a' to yoursen, for—"
               Philip's face is ashen pale as he interrupts Shem, and says in quick, angry
                  accents: "Stop, Shem, I know what you are going to say; but that you are too
                  innocent to comprehend the black-hearted villainy there is in my lord's scheme,
                  'fore God! I would sheathe my dagger in your throat!"
               Shem, speechless with surprise, stares like one bereft of his senses, as well he
                  may. At the first outburst he instinctively placed his hand on the haft of his
                  hunting-knife.
               Philip looks at him closely for a few seconds, and proceeds in a gentler manner
                  than before: "Good, faithful Shem, let me tell you the whole of this vile project.
                  I'll lay bare my father's treacherous meaning. You think it is a mere joke to
                  amuse my lord—a harmless jest. His real design is that I shall run away with
                  Margery to London. Once there, he thinks I will certainly ruin her, and keep her
                  as my dishonored mistress. But I tell you, Shem, that when Margery goes to London
                  with Philip Wharton, she goes as his intended wife."
               Shem shudders as he hears the details, and sees how near he has been towards
                  compassing the destruction of his "wee Margery." "Eh! my soul! if I
                     had done it!" he exclaims in thankful tones; and he watches his
                  young master, who paces the room in a frenzy of rage. Well is it that my lord is
                  not at home, or there would be such commotion at the old house as had not been
                  seen since the days of the olden moss-troopers.
               Philip's blood boils as he goes over in his mind the well-planned details of the
                  cunning scheme. Shem breaks the silence by saying, "Ye are sure, Master Philip,
                  that ye are no' wrang i' your thoughts?"
               "Shem," he replies angrily, "I was told of it by an honest, true-hearted lad who
                  overheard every word of the conference. I will tell you his name, but you must
                  keep it a secret; it is Brad Throck!"
               "Bless the beggar!" Shem exclaims. "If I had known that the young loon was so
                  close will us, I 'd ha' put his ear out o' kelter, I warrant ye. But it's a' for
                  the best I trow!"
               "Yes, Shem, it is all for the best," Philip replies; and he looks abstractedly out
                  of the window, while the keeper plays with his hoods and jesses.
               "Good e'en to ye, Shem," Philip says so abruptly as to cause Shem to start from
                  his seat, and he walks out and strides swiftly towards Rooksnest, with bitter,
                  unfilial thoughts in his heart, and with a firm determination ever after to run
                  counter to his father's wishes, and to thwart his purposes whenever he can.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER X.

                     VENICE PRESERVED.
                  
               
               WE are now in the room sacred to Whigs and Whiggery, mutton-pies and politics. The
                  atmosphere is redolent of the fumes of wine and the fragrant Orinoco, whose smoke
                  fills the lungs and calls up visions of Turkey and the colonies. The walls are
                  almost covered with portraits of celebrated belles and toasts, nearly all of them
                  the work of Godfrey Kneller. Around one side runs a row of walnut shelves whereon
                  are the glasses of the previous year, on which, according to custom, the name of
                  the lady who was the toast of that year is engraved. In the centre of the room is
                  a large, circular table covered with wines and edibles, at which are seated a
                  goodly company of noisy, laughing cavaliers, whose gay costumes, slashed doublets,
                  and scented cloaks, curled wigs, and knightly orders make a brave display as they
                  lounge about in careless, graceful attitudes.
               Here an irritated politician exposes to his attentive listener the crafty schemes
                  of the arch Tory Harley, and expatiates at length on Mistress Masham's alarming
                  ascendency at court.
               There is a group of dissolute, reckless gallants. Among them the licentious
                  Congreve; his mouth wide open in boisterous merriment, uncovering a set of teeth
                  which many a beau envies him; he exclaims, in a ringing, manly voice: "Egad!
                  gentlemen, I tell you that Mistress Middleton must be our next toast, or revie me,
                  I'll——"
               "Congreve, man! stop your unearthly clatter," cries the proud Duke of Somerset.
                  "You once said, 'Music hath charms to soothe the savage beast;' so I
                  prithee, quiet, or I'll give you an air on my viol;" and making a motion as though
                  he intended to play. Congreve exclaims, in assumed terror: "Hold! My lord, I am
                  dumb; for truly I would rather keep my tongue between my teeth for a whole year
                  than hear yon thing screeching its direful lays."
               Opposite to Congreve are three keen-eyed, watchful cavaliers, engaged in deep
                  discussion; they whisper in low, guarded tones, and frequently cast stealthy
                  glances about them as if they are fearful of being overheard. And well they may
                  be, for they debate on no less a question than the feasibility of totally
                  overthrowing and destroying the party now governing England.
               The group consists of My Lord Wharton, whose face, usually placid, is gloomy and
                  anxious; Charles Montague, Earl of Halifax, who blows balls and rings of pungent
                  smoke from his Indian bowl, with a grace peculiar to himself—in fact, at Will's,
                  and among the men about town, he is considered a mighty fine smoker; lastly, and
                  least in point of rank, is the architect and dramatist Sir John Vanbrugh, whose
                  indecent writings and immoral doings once aroused the ire of the righteous
                  Collier, who scourged him in such a scathing style that directly after he wrote a
                  moral epic comedy entitled "Æsop," which, as might have been expected, was hissed
                  off the boards of Drury Lane; he is an eccentric genius, and has passed his life,
                  as he once averred, "in sinning and
                  repenting." The reader will recall the couplet written on him by Dr. Evans in
                  allusion to his heavy, solid style of architecture:— 
                     
                        "Lie heavy on him, Earth, for he
                        Laid many a heavy load on thee."
                     
                   His face is handsome, but haggard and pallid, the consequence of his riotous,
                  exciting life.
               In answer to a question put by Vanbrugh, Wharton replies angrily: "Yes, John, it
                  was Sarah Marlborough's waspish tongue which stung Harley and Abbie in, and
                  ourselves out."
               The country is at present in a state of great political agitation. Rancorous
                  violence and malignant speeches are the order of the day. In no previous times did
                  pamphlets and "broadsides" exercise such an influence as they do now. Formerly a
                  man's sayings were confined to the few who heard him, and their influence went but
                  a little way beyond his own immediate circle; but now, where Earl Somers, or
                  Cowper, or Wharton, or any other able speaker enunciates a telling speech, it goes
                  from London to Liverpool, and to all the country around, in the form of a
                  pamphlet, which is widely distributed by zealous partisans and would-be officials,
                  who know the effect that might be produced by a single good speech if read and
                  appreciated.
               Far back in 1707, Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, had—unlucky woman—brought to
                  court a poor relative, Mistress Abigail Hill, and procured for her the post of
                  bedchamber-woman to the queen, who was so greatly pleased by her good nature and
                  unassuming love, that she began to contrast the poor relative's engaging
                  disposition with the vixenish, arrogant temper of her patroness—a temper the queen
                  knew and greatly feared. In consequence, the influence of Sarah declined
                  considerably, and despite her strenuous exertions to retain her old ascendency
                  over "Mistress Morley," as her majesty permitted herself to be called by her,
                  "Mistress Freeman" slid slowly but surely down the royal scale. Once rid of her,
                  the queen determined never to give her a chance to resume her old despotism; so,
                  from that time, Mistress Abbie Hill, or, as she soon afterwards became, Mistress
                  Masham, gradually gained more and more power over her royal mistress, until she
                  now stands the acknowledged favorite. Harley, who is her kinsman, influenced her
                  mind very much, and consequently the Whigs were ousted from power, and himself and
                  his party installed in their place.
               But enough of these dry details. We will return to the worthy members of the
                  kit-cat whom we left so unceremoniously.
               Montague, who listened attentively to Wharton's remark, replies, "My lord, I agree
                  with you. Pity 'tis; but Mistress Abbie governs her majesty, and Harley governs
                  Mistress Abbie—a bad state of affairs for us, eh? Curse me!"
               "The Laärd presarve us from the wicked Moabitess!" whines Montague, clasping his
                  hands on his breast, and turning up the whites of his eyes.
               At this, Vanbrugh laughs aloud; but Wharton exclaims impatiently: "'S 'blood, my
                  Earl of Halifax, be serious! We discuss affairs of moment, and can spare little
                  time for jack-pudding pranks!"
               Montague's face sobers instantly, for he respects and indeed almost fears his
                  crafty, unscrupulous friend.
               Wharton mutters: "If we could but reinstate Sarah! But 'tis impossible; the shrew
                  has ruined us for a time, at least, with her haughty airs and her arrogant
                  capriciousness."
               Vanbrugh interpolates meaningly, "Bribery!"
               
               "Ay," adds Montague; "a few golden plaisters would better us, I warrant."
               Wharton elevates his eyebrows contemptuously as he replies, "Begin with
                  Harley!"
               These three words settle all discussion on that point, and it is not mentioned
                  again.
               A loud clapping and pounding on the table draw their attention to Congreve and the
                  gentlemen opposite. Congreve is strutting with mincing steps and affected gestures
                  across the lower end of the room; speaking with such a laughter-provoking drawl
                  that even Wharton smiles as he looks at him, and says aside: "The light-hearted
                  knave!" He is ridiculing the gait and manners of the most insufferable coxcomb in
                  London—Sir Evelyn Pierpoint—and he hits off his girlish voice and his strained
                  gestures in a really clever manner.
               "Gad!" he cries, "'Fore Gad! I was most mightily astounded that my Lady Betty did
                  not succumb on sight; for 'pon my soul, I had exercised almost half my
                  attractions! And stars and garters! Where I, Sir Evelyn Pierpoint, fail, let no
                  man try—or, trying, fail ignobly, Gad!"
               This wind-up sets the whole company in a roar of uncontrollable laughter—the words
                  dropped so trippingly from his lips, and his eyes ogled them so conceitedly. The
                  spice of truth in the caricature renders it doubly amusing, so much do we all
                  enjoy the sight of a ridiculed neighbor, especially if the ridicule falls on those
                  points on which we are untouchable, or so consider ourselves.
               Wharton, turning to his companions, says in amused despair: "Gentlemen, it is
                  worse than useless for us to converse on serious topics at present. Let us leave
                  them for another time, and help to laugh at or with roistering, careless
                  Congreve!"
               Vanbrugh, nothing loath, joyfully assents; of course Montague follows his
                  leader.
               "A toast! A toast! hurrah!" Glasses clink noisily, and every hand pounds loudly on
                  the table. Wharton rises and says: "Gentlemen, let us all drink 'Long life and
                  prosperity to her majesty, and perdition to the warming-pan prince!'"
               The toast is received with acclamations, upturned glasses, and elevated noses. Now
                  there are sundry calls for "more lights and the card-tables," and the attentive
                  host enters with a bow and a smirk. Christopher is short, stout, and servile; his
                  eyes are like twin specks in a good potato—small and reddish; but there is a
                  twinkle of humor and good-fellowship in them notwithstanding. His nose is a
                  Liliputian carrot, with an upward tendency.
               "Yes, my noble gentlemen—in a minute. Diggory! Sam! You dogs! Quick! the tables
                  for my lords; more lights and—did you say more wine and punch, my
                  lords?" He is answered affirmatively and backs out again with more bows and
                  smirks; reappearing in a few minutes with a bowl of foaming, lemon-scented punch,
                  followed by Sam and Diggory with sundry cases of wine and bunches of candles in
                  their arms.
               In a very short time the noise and confusion subside, and nearly all present are
                  absorbed in the chances of the games they are playing—ombre, basset, whist, or
                  gleek.
               At one table are Halifax, Wharton, and Vanbrugh pitted against one another at
                  gleek; and when Wharton or Halifax plays there are always interested lookers-on.
                  Says Halifax to Wharton: "My lord, I'll vie the ruff."
               Vanbrugh rejoins, "Faith, I'll see it!"
               Wharton adds, "I'll see it and revie it!"
               Wharton, who is a skilful, practised gamester, raises the stakes so high that Vanbrugh says with a curse,
                  "I'll not meddle with it longer. Poor devils like myself must not risk over three
                  figures," and he ceases to play. Accordingly, the contest now lies between the
                  other two.
               It must be known that Halifax is a player of no mean calibre, and is not to be
                  despised by any player, however skilful. He asks, "Two thousand—did you say my
                  Lord?"
               Wharton replies carelessly, "Four would be more interesting."
               Halifax nods his head, and they play on.
               The words two thousand and four thousand at once draw the other players from their
                  tables to watch the contest between the two whose stakes have so quickly reached
                  such formidable proportions; all cluster around and intently survey these veteran
                  gamesters.
               Wharton deals, and turns up the ace. "Tib!" he calls: "fifteen to my score."
               Halifax smiles, and congratulates him on his good fortune.
               After this, the stakes grow gradually higher until Wharton says, "My lord, if you
                  do not object, we will raise it to fifteen thousand—sans revenge; one game either
                  way it turns?"
               A murmur of astonishment runs around the table. The offer is a bold one, for at
                  present Halifax stands the higher. He looks doubtful for a moment, but finally
                  says, in an indifferent, half-attentive manner, "An' you wish it, my lord?" His
                  eyes, however, betray the tumult in his heart; and when his cards are given him,
                  the intensity of his gaze is almost frightful.
               Vanbrugh says with a laugh to Congreve: "It was well I retreated. Faith! Where
                  would I have been now? eh?"
               His words, are interrupted by Halifax, who slowly rises, and asks him in a
                  tranquil manner for the pen which is on the escritoire: he gives it to Halifax,
                  who scribbles an order in favor of Lord Wharton for fifteen thousand guineas!
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XI.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "I think on thee in the night
                           When all beside is still
                           And the moon comes out, with her pale, sad light,
                           To sit on the lonely hill!
                           When the stars are all like dreams,
                           And the breezes all like sighs,
                           And there comes a voice from the far-off streams,
                           Like thy spirit's low replies!"
                        
                     
                     T. K. HERVEY.
                  
               
               THE two large rooms in the Wharton mansion that are kept for special or state
                  occasions are now filled with a large number of patrician dames and cavaliers, all
                  apparelled in their brightest. White and pink tapers, perfumed with delicate
                  scents, dispense a mellow, moon-like lustre, which adds greatly to the beauty of
                  the guests; while low strains of music float about and die away through the open
                  windows.
               Many couples stroll slowly from end to end and back again—flirting, laughing, or
                  feigning love for amusement. Others, older or more sedate, sit about in groups and
                  talk of her majesty's illness, the last pattern in bonelace, the state of politics
                  in France, the best cure for the vapors, or Mademoiselle Scudery's last divine
                  romance, which fills only two folio volumes!
               Fans are in great request—less, we opine, on account of the heat, than for the
                  purpose of tapping attendant beaux coldly, lovingly, or reprovingly; a science
                  cultivated with great assiduity by all who set themselves up for belles.
               Let us listen to the conversation carried on by the couple who walk by us. To
                  judge by their serious countenances and grave demeanor, it is of great import.
               "Most true, Mistress Robsarte; the corranto is in the main superior to the
                  Javotte; in that I agree with you entirely; but as to the minor question of the
                  three tips and a half turn with the left foot, in preference to the four
                  glissades, I would disagree with you had I but the boldness."
               Whereupon they are more solemn than ever, and walk consequentially past, out of
                  earshot.
               Again, a couple of cavaliers come toward us, quietly laughing and twirling the
                  waxed ends of their moustaches, which, by the way, are cut in the Italian fashion.
                  Says the older of them: "Tut! my lord, it had been better if I had touched his
                  heart at the first passado, instead of shilly-shallying with him for fifteen
                  minutes, and then sending him to a parson and six feet of earth, with the conceit
                  in his mind that he was a good swordsman."
               So goes the world. Subjects that are not worth the breath we spend on them, or the
                  ink that we waste in writing about them, are talked of and written about with a
                  solemnity and seeming profundity worthy of the solution of the Sphynx; while such
                  light trifles as life and death are laughed at, and handled with a smile and a
                  jest.
               Philip, standing by the lattice window which looks out on the garden, gazes
                  abstractedly on the assemblage, while his thoughts are far away, as his motionless
                  countenance and his vacant eyes evince. He ponders drearily over his love, and
                  wonders whether he will ever be permitted to enjoy it without a drawback. Anon
                  thoughts of her devotion surge up in his heart, and he grows angry
                  with himself for allowing ideas so saddening to take possession of his mind.
               
               Lady Wharton, who is performing her hospitable duties, and receiving the guests
                  with her usual high-bred courtesy, now and then casts a glance at Philip and seems
                  irritated at his taciturnity and retirement, for she has prepared this party
                  especially for his enjoyment, and to show to the guests how well her Philip can
                  dance, sing, and speak. In these accomplishments he is far beyond his years, and
                  is a match in the lists of love for any London courtier, much more for the beaux
                  of Buck's, who, though refined and well-bred, lack Philip's power of phrase
                  turning and his audacity; they do not possess his quickness of repartee and his
                  comprehensive observation which tell him at a glance how to comport himself in
                  matters that require delicacy or boldness, denial, equivocation, or agreement. In
                  such arts he can be perfect when he chooses; but his innate recklessness, his love
                  of praise, and his rollicking dare deviltry often lead him and others into
                  situations embarrasing to the last degree. Fortunately for himself, however, in
                  such cases, he generally manages to come off scot-free—leaving his companions to
                  flounder about in the slough of mistakes, exposed to the scornful glance of an
                  offended beauty, whilst he basks in her kindest smiles.
               The last guest has received my lady's congratulations, and she crosses over to
                  Philip, who starts impatiently and ejaculates in a decidedly unpleasant manner,
                  "Well?"
               To this monosyllabic interrogation she replies: "Philip dear, do get rid of your
                  gloominess; it only keeps you from enjoying yourself; while your mother cannot be
                  happy while her son mopes in a corner like an owl in a barn; it is not like his
                  usual behavior."
               "Mother," he replies, "I am sick of this riotous gayety and confusion. I would
                  rather be alone. I do not feel fit for company to-night;" half turning his back to
                  her he looks moodily out of the window, as though to put an end to the
                  conversation.
               "Lovesick!" she murmurs with a knowing smile, and bethinks her of a plan to rouse
                  him a little—a plan which, with her knowledge of his weak point, is sure to
                  succeed. She says, as if speaking to herself, "Aha! I see my lord of Dale
                  monopolizes the fair glances of Mistress Hawthorndon, and, faith, she seems
                  greatly taken with him!"
               Philip turns his head towards the couple apostrophized: my lady notices the
                  movement, and returns satisfied to her seat, confident that her words have piqued
                  his vanity, for it is well known that he once laid a wager that he could rival
                  this same Lord Dale in Mistress Hawthorndon's affections whenever he chose, and,
                  although she knows of this same insolent wager as well as any one else, his speech
                  is so insinuating and honeyed that she is powerless to repulse him, and sometimes
                  hopes the wager may result in his really loving her, and terminate in an alliance
                  into which she would be only too happy to enter, although he is two years younger
                  than herself.
               Philip arranges his curls and settles his cuffs; smooths his cravat, pushes his
                  rapier into a more elegant position, and walks slowly towards Lord Dale and his
                  partner. He addresses her in an euphuistic strain, and bestows a cold nod on her
                  cavalier: "Fair Mistress Alice," he says, with a truly refreshing impudence, "I
                  now claim the promise you gave me a se'nnight ago!" Extending his arm, which she
                  takes with a slight hesitation, and at the same time bowing to Lord Dale, he
                  coolly remarks, "My lord, Mistress Hawthorndon can now dispense with your company,
                  as I claim an engagement with her which is doubtless prior to any that you may
                  have!" The deserted beau leaves her with ill-concealed cealed chagrin, and casts a spiteful look at his
                  rival. Philip is not in the least discomposed, but gracefully leads Mistress Alice
                  to the upper end of the room, where he strengthens the influence which he boasts
                  that he is able to exercise over any woman with a heart capable of the tender
                  passion.
               My lady observes the success of her ruse, and after a time calls Philip to her,
                  and gives him some directions in regard to the music. Returning to Mistress Alice,
                  he excuses himself on the score of business, and leaves the room to attend to his
                  mother's commands.
               Mistress Alice is very pretty, vivacious, and sprightly. Her hair is cut short in
                  front, and dances in tiny ringlets almost to her eyes, which fashion, together
                  with her uncovered bosom and arms, gives her the appearance of one of those
                  beauties of Lely, who might have exchanged small talk and scandal with his majesty
                  of blessed memory.
               
               Philip walks slowly along by the spiny, scarlet-flowered hawthorn hedges, and lets
                  thoughts of Margery wander through his brain, dreaming of happiness as he swears
                  to himself that she shall yet be his wife, spite of all obstacles; but his
                  "chateaux en Espagne" are suddenly shivered to fragments by a stealthy noise as of
                  some one treading softly behind him. Drawing his rapier, he turns quickly on his
                  heel, and lo! the figure of a tall brawny man confronts him!
               "In Satan's name! who are you, that you follow me so closely? Answer me at once,
                  fellow! or I'll give you a taste of cold steel in your stomach!" cries Philip,
                  angrily.
               "Master Philip," replies the rough, harsh voice of the gypsy Maldran, "I was but
                  goin' to the camp."
               "Oh! it's you, Maldran, is it? I have wanted to see you for some time! I have a
                  question or two for you to answer ere we part;" he still keeps his rapier drawn
                  and pointed threateningly at Maldran's neck, while his brow lowers and his voice
                  is ominous.
               "Yes, Master Philip," he replies.
               "Fellow! Mistress Holmes some time ago gave you a letter to carry to me! This
                  letter you first carried to my father! Answer me at once, and truly—did you
                  not?"
               He answers sullenly: "I did, for his gowd were too strong for a poor gypsy to
                  resist, and—"
               "Enough!" interrupts Philip; "get out of my sight while you are alive, and never
                  again cross my path, or you and your whole treacherous tribe shall be cudgelled
                  off the grounds;" and he stamps his foot in suppressed rage.
               Maldran, muttering something between his teeth, strikes off at a quick pace in the
                  direction of his camp.
               Philip continues his walk, and, consciously or otherwise, he approaches Holme
                  Grange. Where the heart lieth, do the feet turn. "Why should Maldran happen to be
                  so close to the mansion at this hour of the night? and why should he have been so
                  close to me?"—are questions that arise as he treads on the soft gorse and kicks
                  the fallen leaves and boughs about with vicious energy. Vague suspicions that the
                  gypsy is employed by his father to watch his actions flit through his mind; but he
                  can scarcely think such baseness possible. Anon thoughts of London, and its sights
                  and fascinations enwrap him, and his heart beats high as he foresees how he will
                  some day astonish even London's blasé cavaliers
                  with the beauty of his Margery, and force the sickly court beauties to envy her
                  for her rosy cheeks and her pure complexion! Anon the bare possibility of some one
                  taking her away from him chills his blood and makes him uneasy and restless. But in a short time he
                  smiles confidently as he recalls her undisguised love for him, and exclaims, "Bah!
                  Philip Wharton can hold his own in anything; from a stramazorm or a stoccata—" and
                  he fingers his rapier significantly—"to a fight for a woman's love!"
               He has gradually approached so close to the Grange that he can see into the large
                  hall where the General often sits in the evenings; and a hungry, wistful look
                  lights his eyes as he perceives Margery sitting alone in the low balcony scarce a
                  score feet away from him! A single taper lights up the hall, for it is late, and
                  everybody has retired save Margery. Her face is turned away from the light, and
                  she seems to scrutinize the very spot where her lover lies concealed. She looks
                  aweary and troubled, and her chin rests in her little hand, while her lips are
                  pressed closely together. Once in a while a smile flickers on her lips and dies
                  away in the sad depths of her eyes. Philip can no longer restrain himself, he
                  advances boldly towards her; but she does not see him until he is almost close
                  enough to touch her; when, with a low cry, telling of her intense relief and
                  enjoyment, she flies into his arms and has to indulge in a few womanly sobs before
                  she can control herself enough to say, "Philip, darling! I wanted to see you so
                  much tonight; it seems as if God has heard my prayer, and you have come;" and she
                  lifts her lips to him with a wild look in her eyes. He caresses her tenderly, and
                  eagerly, asks, "Why, Margery, sweet! why are you so agitated?"
               She does not answer him, but her renewed sobs almost madden him. Again he demands,
                  "Tell me quickly, sweetheart; what ails you that you are so sad this evening?
                  There is some trouble, I fear!"
               Scarcely able to articulate, she cries: "Philip, they are going to send me away
                  from you!"
               "Who are going to send you away from me?" he cries in thick, hoarse accents, and
                  holds her closer the while.
               "Father!" is all she can answer.
               "Furies!" he mutters; "what shall we do?"
               She replies, in a broken voice: "Let us fly together, Philip; let us leave this
                  place! I will give up all for you! Do with me as you will!"
               He is perplexed and troubled beyond measure until a ray of hope breaks in on him,
                  and he says, "Tell me, darling, when is the time fixed for your departure."
               "I know not; my father but told me that ere long he would send me to Italy; but
                  whether he means to-morrow or a year hence, I know not; for my heart nigh burst at
                  the news; and I could not trust myself to question him!"
               Her words reassure him, and he replies cheerily: "Let your tears wait awhile,
                  then, lassie; we must not meet trouble half-way; and, darling, cease your violent
                  grief; you will certainly do yourself some harm! 'All's well that ends well,' and
                  the end may yet be as we wish."
               She smiles at him through her tears, and feels, now that he is with her, that all
                     must be right; and she sits chatting in his arms a long, long
                  while before they can leave each other to get the night's rest which is necessary
                  even for lovers.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XII.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "A wanton chaos in my breast raged high,
                           A wanton transport darted in mine eye;
                           False pleasure urged, and every eager care,
                           That swell the soul to guilt and to despair."
                        
                     
                     CHABDE'S "MIRA."
                  
               
               WE turn to events a year later than those recorded in our last chapter, merely
                  intimating that Margery's fears of a separation from her lover were justified only
                  too soon, for the day after her meeting with him her father sent her post to
                  London, thence to set out for Italy. Leaving Philip in great dismay and grief,
                  she, poor girl! felt bad enough; but she had no other resource than to obey, as
                  she was closely watched by her father, who feared that she might do something
                  foolish and ill-advised if she was not looked after with a careful eye.
               Everything after that went on as usual at the castle. Philip employed his time as
                  best he could in hard study, in hunting, hawking, flirting with Mistress
                  Hawthorndon, and in other amusements, but longed continually for the return of his
                  lost love.
               Margery has returned from her travels as beautiful as ever, and just a trifle more
                  womanly and polished by her sojourn in the sunny south.
               Suppose we go to the old trysting-place and see whether we can find any traces of
                  her or her gladdened lover. Listen! We can hear a manly voice exclaiming, in low,
                  murmuring tones, "Margery, sweet! long, weary, weary months have dragged along
                  since you and I last met here—!Has time altered you from my true heart of olden
                  times? If it has—never mind telling me so—but a curse on time and on him who took
                  you from me!"
               As he finishes, his voice is irregular and broken. Her answer is surely enough to
                  reassure the most uxorious lover.
               "Philip, my own, time and life are nothing to me, save when you are with me!"
               There is a long silence after this, until he says, in a serious, determined
                  manner: "Margery, we must part no more! Come with me to London, where we will be
                  united beyond fear of separation except by death."
               She grows pale as she listens to a proposal of so decided a nature, and whispers,
                  "Your father—and mine."
               "A god's will!" he exclaims, fiercely. "Let them do as they wist, if you come. But
                  I see; you are like all the rest—a short absence, and all is forgotten! Once you
                  would have gone with me to the end of the world; now, London is too far!" He
                  speaks in a bitter, reproachful manner, which cuts her like a knife.
               She answers him in two words only: "Oh, Philip!" but in them he reads her consent,
                  and proceeds in excited, happy eagerness: "To-morrow then, darling, we will go!
                  Meet me here at nightfall; we can reach London in a few hours, and—leave the rest
                  to me; I will manage everything rightly!"
               Tears fill her eyes as she kisses him good-night with a fervor telling him how
                  truly she is all his own to do with as he wishes.
               After a night of feverish spells of broken sleep, Philip wanders uneasily about
                  the house and through the garden and stable, and finally saddling "Careless,"
                  rides swiftly through the avenue of old Elms, passes Rooksnest, and surveys with a
                  fond regret all the many spots endeared to his memory. However, a few hours' hard
                  riding soon restores his spirits, and makes him feel that he is ready to do and dare all to call Margery
                  his wife.
               He has packed up over night all that he will need in the shape of clothing, arms,
                  money, and a hundred other little things of more or less importance; and he has
                  also written an explanation of his conduct to his father, in which he tells him
                  that General Holmes is entirely ignorant of the whole proceeding.
               To Philip's great joy, the day begins to draw to its close; never has day seemed
                  so long to him as this; it wants now but an hour of the time appointed for the
                  meeting. He can wait no longer; striding to the stable, where he has the two
                  swiftest horses in the stud, ready saddled and bridled, he quietly leads them to
                  the door. Here he hesitates a minute ere he springs into the saddle, and looks
                  towards his mother's room. "God bless you, mother!" he mutters, in a trembling
                  voice, and he is off like a shot down towards Rooksnest.
               Margery awaits him, with hood and wimple on, tearful but hopeful; and he kisses
                  her with many and many a passionate embrace ere she is mounted on her pillion.
               Away they fly through the forest gloaming, swiftly and noiselessly, for their
                  horses' hoofs fall so soft on the springy sod, that naught is heard but the jingle
                  of Philip's spurs and his rapier clinking against the stirrup. They arrive safely
                  in London without let or hindrance, and a new world is open to their young
                  minds.
               Philip is cognizant of the fact that they are both too young to hope to be married
                  in the orthodox manner; he knows, however, that there are clerical prisoners
                  living within the Rules of the Fleet who are poor, unscrupulous, and
                  characterless, whose marriages are nevertheless held true and valid in the eye of
                  the law. There he determines to go with a pocketful of guineas to stop
                  inconvenient venient mouths which might impertinently question them relative to
                  their ages or their names.
               They take lodgings at the Blue Bell, where the bustling landlady soon has a warm
                  supper ready for them, which neither feels overmuch inclined to eat; they are both
                  nervous and excited, and Margery is so dazed and bewildered that she can scarcely
                  speak.
               As soon as the meal is finished, Philip says to the landlady, in an assumed
                  careless manner, "I pray you, Dame! how may we get to the Fleet without much loss
                  of time. They say it is very amusing to strangers to see the sights about there."
                  He is too new to London life to know that such a question is enough to turn all
                  eyes on him and his companion; fortunately, however, there is no one near enough
                  to hear him, beside the landlady, except, indeed, the bar-maid, who, quickly
                  looking up, grins significantly at the unsuspecting couple.
               "Truss me! I were sure ye were baith frae the coöntry," cries the landlady in a
                  loud voice.
               Philip replies, with a haughty stare which causes her broad face to flush,
                  "S'blood, jade! attend to your kitchening, and meddle not with the affairs of your
                  betters! Either answer my question, or begone and send some one who can!"
               The landlady curtsies deprecatingly, and answers humbly, "My lord, ya mun tak a
                  chair to get there; I'll ca' Pat and Dermont, who can carry ye there, as quick as
                  e'er a horse that rins." And she leaves the room to execute her mission, while
                  Philip, though anxious and troubled himself, consoles his future wife with
                  endearing and hopeful conversation.
               When the chair comes, Philip calls the carriers aside, and tells them of his
                  design, whereat they wink, stick their tongues in their cheeks, and generally show
                  him that they know all about such delicate matters; and they shoulder their burdens, and trot at a long,
                  swinging pace towards their destination. Turning as they near the confines of the
                  Fleet, Dermont asks Philip whether he prefers any particular parson to splice
                  them. Philip replying in the negative, leaves the choice with the carrier,
                  wherefore he replies, "'Troth! thin we'll take ye till the Horseshoe and Magpie!
                  Sam Turenall is as good a clark as any, and Dick Wildair is a roarin' parson."
                  Philip agrees, and in a few minutes they come to a halt, the door is opened, and
                  the carriers obsequiously help them out.
               Philip and Margery hesitatingly enter the bar-room, the usual place for Fleet
                  marriages, and are huskily welcomed by a fat, frowsy, blear-eyed imitation of
                  Silenus, who, by instinct, knowing what they want, wheezes out, "Wildair! ye're
                  wanted here." The door of the public bar opens, and the parson enters. He is a
                  good specimen of a licentious dissipated clergyman of this quarter; he holds a
                  greasy, dog's-eared prayer-book in his hands, and affects a devout look, but the
                  effort is a sad failure.
               Philip smiles as he compares him with the venerable pastor at home; and Margery,
                  in spite of her fears, is amused at his appearance.
               Without entering into minute particulars of the marriage formula, which was
                  mumbled and slurred over as soon as possible, let it suffice to say they are now
                  man and wife.
               A rather laughable incident occurred at the close of the ceremony, which is worth
                  mentioning. The parson, in accordance with his custom, was about to imprint a
                  chaste kiss on Margery's blushing cheek, when Philip interposed his hand to shield
                  her from the profanation, and received the smack of a pair of swollen, unctuous
                  lips on it—a diversion which caused the holy man to redden a trifle, while the
                  host and the carriers roared delightedly at his discomfiture. Philip said nothing,
                  however, but gave him a liberal douceur, out of which the carriers received a
                  shilling; he then led his wife to the chair, and directed the carriers to return
                  to the Blue Bell.

                        "O Nature! we a' maun yield to thee."
                     
                     JAMES HOGG.
                  
               
               ONCE more they are alone in the cheery little room allotted to them. Margery is
                  full of vague terrors and doubts which she scarcely knows how to define, and says
                  distractedly, "Philip, do you—oh! what will father think of me? What will he do?
                  It will break his heart! I have been so cruel to him!"
               Philip consoles her, and replies manfully, "Cheer up, wife! All will be well in
                  time, be sure; and ere long our fathers will be better friends than ever. There is
                  no real cause for trouble. We will remain here awhile, and then return home. I
                  know that all will be right, and then we will all live together and be as happy as
                  the day is long!"
               Margery smiles at the happy picture he has drawn, while her woman's prescience
                  tells her that the odds are against them, and she shudders as Lord Wharton's cruel
                  face passes before her mind's eye, and she involuntarily recalls dark stories of
                  his crafty determination, and his utter lack of principle, which had reached her
                  even in the seclusion of Holme Grange; and she fears that his power may wrest
                  Philip from her again. Her own father, she knows, will gladly welcome her home
                  even after such a flagrant disobedience of his orders as she has been guilty of in
                  running away with Philip. The artful beauty, conscious of her power over him,
                  knows that the old warrior cannot withstand the tears and entreaties of his only
                  daughter.
               Philip's thoughts are of the most mixed and startling character; will his father
                  pursue him? or mayhap disown him? But that, he proudly thinks, cannot harm him;
                  for are there not in this great city fifty things at which he can make, at least
                  enough to keep them both from starving? "Separate us!" he cries; "Pah! I feel
                  myself a giant when Margery is the stake to be fought for! God forfend I should
                  ever draw steel on my father; but—" And he coughs ominously, and says, in a bold,
                  confident tone, "Well, Margery, we will not fret about it. If needs must, we can
                  live by our own exertions!"
               "What can we do?" she asks, with a demure glance at him, as if she knows that the
                  question will pose him. He looks perplexed, for a moment, and laughs
                  good-humoredly as he declines to answer the question; and he closes her mouth by a
                  process commendable in such cases, in which process, by the way, she assists him
                  right deftly.
               The next day Philip proposes a walk to view the wonders of the metropolis, to
                  which she of course assents, and they are now gazing with eager eyes at the
                  strange sights presented to their view. Immersed as he has been in the seclusion
                  of the country, Philip has never thought that he should see so vast a number of
                  houses, or mix in such a beehive of busy pedestrains, who jostle and swarm about
                  in countless multitudes.
               They peep into the china-stores and bric-a-brac shops, and mutually smile at the
                  grotesque josses and uncouth images; and
                  Philip, who has read about such things before, imparts information concerning them
                  to his young wife. She listens admiringly to him, and wonders at his vast and
                  varied knowledge. But I am sorry to state that, on several occasions, when she
                  requests an explanation of something which he knows no more about than she, he
                  draws largely on his imagination, his pride not allowing him to betray his
                  ignorance.
               He buys numerous trinkets for her; in most cases paying far more for them than
                  they are worth, owing to his ignorance of their value, and the adroitness of the
                  sellers, who notice his rusticity, and cheat him accordingly. Once or twice his
                  natural shrewdness tells him that such is the case, but he disdains to bandy words
                  with a tradesman, and so pays all demands with the air of a czar with all the
                  Indies at his nod and beck.
               Now they come to Temple Bar, with its sooty, blackened gateway of Portland stone.
                  Margery shivers in affright as Philip calls her attention to the traitors' skulls
                  whitening on the poles above the arch; and he tells her about the vast processions
                  which have passed through these muddy gates, and how the doors have been barred
                  against the King until the herald sounded a parley, to all of which she listens
                  with intense interest, meanwhile counting the many lumbering carriages that rumble
                  noisily by; she had never before seen so many together.
               Whilst they have been admiring Temple Bar and its adjuncts, they have not noticed
                  the gradual approach of a swaggering cut-purse, dressed in a suit of faded
                  tawdriness who now suddenly clutches at the little package which Margery holds,
                  and makes off with it at great speed. Philip starts to pursue him, but Margery
                  prevents him, and beseeches him not to leave her alone. "She can better spare the
                  trinkets than lose him." A few who have seen the occurrence, gather about them,
                  and officiously advise Philip to go to the nearest magistrate, describe the rascal
                  and offer a reward for his detection; declining their advice, however, he tries to
                  walk away unperceived, as he is not desirous of attracting too much attention, for
                  Margery's sake, who begins to be frightened at the crowd which is gathering and
                  thickening. Various remarks pass around, and a few persons begin to praise
                  Margery's beauty and her freshness, for a face so pure and innocent as hers is
                  seldom seen in jaded London. A gang of mischievous Arabs and pseudo-beggars begin
                  scrambling and pushing about in all directions, in order to excite the testy, and
                  thereby create a fight, which is always looked upon by them as a treat of the
                  highest order.
               Two gallants, ruffled and dressed to the tip of the mode, and scented with
                  pulvilio and honey-sweet, brush rather nearer to Margery than Philip thinks
                  consistent with good manners, particularly as they severally favor her with a long
                  stare, that makes her shrink closer to him; so, placing himself quickly in front
                  of her, he catches the foremost dandy by the nose, tweaking him so fiercely as to
                  cause him to scream with pain, at which the crowd roar and yell with a deafening
                  noise, and cries of, "A fight! a fight! form a ring—fair play!" are heard on all
                  sides.
               Margery swoons in affright, and Philip supports her, while he cries, in a voice
                  trembling with rage: "What now, Sir Malapert? Out of my road, or I'll run you
                  through, and spoil a hangman's carcass!" He draws his rapier as quickly as he can
                  under the circumstances; the tweaked cavalier does the same, and their blades meet
                  with a harsh, rasping sound. Philip is so excited and desperate that he does not
                  care for consequences, and determines to essay his father's famous passado in carte, a sure and fatal lunge; when
                  cries of "The watch! the watch!!" burst from several bystanders; his opponent,
                  sheathing his rapier at once, mingles with the crowd, and is soon safe from
                  detection. Philip, however, less conversant with city life and its stratagems and
                  usages, still holds his blade on the offensive. In a minute a hand is roughly laid
                  on his arm, and he is told in a gruff voice to "sheathe his slitbully, and take up
                  his march to the round-house!" Seeing the futility of resistance, he puts up his
                  rapier, and points to Margery, who lies senseless in his arms. The watchman looks
                  at her a moment, and mutters, in a low voice, "A pest on the trull! We mun carry
                  her, I doubt na!" Philip, who has heard part of his speech, replies sternly, "What
                  say you, fellow, touching my wife?" The man's manner changes as he replies, "Ah!
                  my lord, that alters matters. Zounds! I don't know what to do wi' her;" and he
                  pulls his chin in perplexity. "I think I can help you to a solution of the
                  difficulty," Philip says significantly, and he wisely drops a sovereign into the
                  custodian's dirty, knotty hand. The effect is instantaneous, and the former grim
                  official is now a truckling servant, who, at Philip's suggestion, yells
                  vociferously for a chair, into which he helps him to seat Margery, who is scarcely
                  restored from her swoon; Philip springs in after her, and once more they return to
                  the Blue Bell without any serious mishap, Philip fuming at his ill-luck in getting
                  into a brawl so early in his London life, and Margery still hysterical, and
                  requiring a deal of consolation and many caresses before she fully recovers from
                  her fright.
               Philip, whose appetite is now sharpset, orders the landlady to prepare them a
                  dinner, which in due time is set on the table, with all the ceremony of which the
                  one waitress is mistress, for it is not every day that the Blue Bell has customers
                  who pay so liberally and profusely as does Philip. Veal pies, baked larks, and
                  mutton pottage fill the little table, and send an appetizing odor about the room,
                  and even Margery, who cannot live on cupid's fare altogether, deigns to test the
                  delicacy of a lark's breast, and "just a wee crumb of veal-pie," at Philip's
                  urgent solicitation.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIV.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           So judged the acrid and the austere,
                           And they whose evil heart
                           Incline them in whate'er betides,
                           To take the evil part.
                        
                        
                           But others, whom a kindlier frame,
                           To better thoughts inclined,
                           Preserved, amid their wonderment,
                           An equitable mind.
                        
                     
                     ALL FOR LOVE.
                  
               
               THE flight has been discovered at both Castle Wharton and Holme Grange, and all is
                  confusion and dismay Lady Wharton has despatched a messenger with an explanatory
                  note to Lord Wharton, in which she beseeches him to come home immediately; while
                  she scarcely knows what she intends to say or do when he shall arrive, knowing how
                  fearful will be his passion at the turn affairs have taken.
               General Holmes is wonderstruck at his daughter's wilfulness, and vows that she
                  must have acquired a pretty spirit of independence during her tour abroad, to
                  prompt her to leave him and fly to London with her lover. He regrets the step she
                  has taken, but is somewhat comforted by a confident feeling that when she does
                  return it will be as Philip Wharton's wife. Nevertheless, he has written to his
                  lawyer in London, directing him to search for the runaways, and send him
                  intelligence of their doings.
               When her ladyship fully realized the news, a chill struck to her heart; and she
                  was put to bed, burning in a high fever, produced by thoughts of the meeting which
                  she knew must come, ere long, between father and son, and which she intensely
                  dreaded. Then recollections of her husband's baffled schemes, and her son's fiery,
                  reckless temper, boiled through her throbbing head, and she groaned at the future
                  trouble whose dark wings even now cast a shadow over the house.
               The servants and dependants, congregating in knots in the chambers, the scullery,
                  and the stables, whisper of my lady's illness and Master Philip's behavior, and
                  all concur in the opinion that there never was a better matched couple in the
                  world than Master Philip and Mistress Margery. Shem, who abstractedly plumes the
                  ger-falcon on his wrist, says to Peggy, the housemaid: "Aweel! I allus thought it
                  'ud end i' this way; forbye they were never easy like except in ane anither's
                  company; an love laughs at bolts or bars, ye ken. I remember when I was younger by
                  twenty years than I am now—afore Debbie war my wife—that old grandame Nestbin said
                  to me wi' a shake o' her skinny finger, 'No! Shem Throck, ye canna hae her; sho'os
                  a deal too good for ye or the likes of ye!' Ah! ha! the varra next neet Debbie an'
                  me were spliced by t' ould parson, an' I gave him a shillin' for his trouble. Ay!
                  ay! Love laughs at bolts!" And Shem shakes his head sagely as he delivers himself
                  of this profound and originalthought.
               "Body's alive!" replies Peggy, "thou 'rt no' comparin' thy sen wi' the young
                  master?"
               He answers her with a withering look, and words that must cut her, to judge from
                  her expression, as he retorts, "Mistress Peggy, it 'ud beseem ye better to bide a
                  wee bit an' get the experience o' one older—but mebbe not so much as
                  yersen," which diplomatic allusion to her advanced age for single-blessedness,
                  effectually silences her, and she walks
                  sulkily back to her task of scouring stew-pans and kettles.
               "Hood me, wench," laughs Shem, as he notices her discomfiture, "I but folled wi'
                  ye! Sure ye'll no' get mad wi'me for a bit o' nonsense?" This apology appears to
                  mollify her, for she mixes again in the general talk of the kitchen.
               Brad, who stands near the crockery-laden sideboard, close to Mistress Debbie,
                  boldly volunteers, "I think Master Philip did no mair than reet in rinning awa',
                  an' well I like his darin;!"
               "Hold thy tongue, saucebox," roars Shem, astounded at his son being so audacious
                  as to give such a free vent to his opinions, even when he agreed with him; he
                  proceeds, "Hae mair respect for the hand that feeds us a', an' keep yersel to
                  yersel! Mayhap ye'll try the same thing yersel, some day?"
               This produces a titter through the kitchen, which causes Brad's red cheeks to
                  assume a decidedly scarlet color, as he replies, rather doggedly, "I might do
                  worse nor rin awa' wi' pretty Meg Busbie! I think so, at any rate," and with this
                  parting shot the incended Brad leaves the room in disgust.
               The stable boy, a bow-legged, pimply-faced, red-haired lad, standing outside on
                  the lawn, stares with lacklustre eyes on the "company" within, and drawls out in
                  puling, heavy accents the news that "My löard's two best horses be gone, Careless
                  an' Queeän Anne! wi' their bridles, saddles, and a'. What's more, my la'as best
                  pillion be gone, an' I'm afeared to tell her la'aship o'it!"
               "Out on ye," cries Debbie; "what cares my lady about a pillion or sae? Master
                  Phillip is mair i' her mind now than a' the dirty pillions i' the stables!"
               This scornful rejoinder raises his wrath, and he replies plies, with an injured,
                  stutter, "Mistress Debbie, oi can tell ye that a guid horse an' pillion is often
                  better nor the woman that rides her, wha's naught to recommend her but a red face
                  an' a clackin' tongue! Now, then!"
               Her reply is imperious: "Hold thy tongue, gallows-bird! An' recollect ye are near
                  the kitchen, now, an' not in filthy stables an' among muck an' straw! So hold thy
                  tongue!" And she turns her back to him to end the discussion.
               Shem, walking to the door, starts towards the Lodge. Let us precede him, and once
                  more peep into its mysteries of hunting gear and sportsman's implements. Brad is
                  sitting on the floor; his head rests against the wall, and he is absorbed in a
                  brown study, which is interrupted by the entrance of his father, who, slowly
                  walking to his accustomed seat, says to Brad, who is now looking out of the
                  window: "Brad, did ye knaw aught about the rinning awa' afore it happened?" And he
                  looks searchingly at him as he asks the question. His reply is clear and distinct,
                  and has truth's clear ring sounding in its every syllable, "No, father! I did not,
                  on my honor!"
               Shem is satisfied, and he resumes, "Rebeck me! but I never thought Master Philip
                  was in earnest when he tould me ance in this varra room that if Mistress Margery
                  did go to Lunnon wi' him, she suld go as his woife! He has kept his word, an' the
                  worst I fear now is that my lord may find him out and stop him ere he can be
                  married there. It'ud be a sair thing for wee Mistrees Margery to go to Lunnon a
                  maid, an' come back wi'out bein' a wife! Master Philip is reckless, an' he is a
                  Wharton!"
               Brad says nothing, but whistles "Lillibullero" at the window, and inhales deep,
                  strong breaths of the breeze which has to pass over Meg Busbie's house before
                     it reaches the Lodge, by which time
                  it gains a certain fragrance perceptible only to himself. Suddenly he starts and
                  strides out of the door in such a hurry that wary Shem determines to have a look
                  at his proceedings. He peeps out of the window, and, as he expected, sees Meg's
                  pretty face over the hawthorn hedges, and catches a glimpse of her neat cap and
                  fluttering ribbons as they dance and wave in the breeze.
               Brad walks quickly towards her and exclaims: "Oho! Meg, I was sure you were coming
                  this way, for as I looked out of the window scarce a minute ago, I saw two
                  butterflies sailin' companywise, an' I knew it was a lucky sign!"
               She replies, in a coquettish manner, "Brad, you told me that once afore! Are ye
                  sure that ye are not telling a wee bit o' a lee? for I never see two pretty-wings
                  a mating when ye come to see me!"
               He replies, "Well, Meg, we'll no' discuss the question, as my lord says; but what
                  errand have ye to the castle?"
               "None for ye, be sure," she replies; "I have some lace ruffles for Master
                  Philip."
               "Master Philip?" he cries. "Don't ye knaw that he has rin awa' to Lunnon wi'
                  Mistress Holmes?"
               Meg is so taken aback that, as she afterwards declared, "she was that startled
                  that if Brad had nae pit his arm aroun' her waist, she must hae fallen!" Brad is
                  fully equal to the emergency, in fact seems to enjoy the whole proceeding. Now Meg
                  is in her glory—"such a bold thing to do! So romantic," and plies him with
                  question after question until she knows as much as himself, and with woman's
                  shrewdness, surmises more.
               Thus stand affairs in Bucks.
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Just when we think we've found the golden mean—
                           The diamond point, on which to balance fair
                           Life and life's lofty issues—weighing there,
                           With fractional precision, close and keen,
                           Thought, motive, word and deed—there comes between
                           Some temper's fret, some mood's unwise despair,
                           To mar the equilibrium, unforeseen,
                           And spoil our nice adjustment!"
                        
                     
                     M. J. PRESTON, "EQUIPOISE."
                  
               
               ENGLAND'S last Stuart is no more—hurried to her grave by the cabals and intrigues
                  of two virulent, selfish, parties, each struggling for the supremacy. She died at
                  a most auspicious time for the partisans of the Hanoverian dynasty and the
                  Protestant succession, for, during the last year of her life, her feelings had
                  become strongly enlisted in favor of her brother, the Chevalier, which sympathy
                  had been taken advantage of by the intriguing Jacobites in order to secure to him
                  the accession when she was dead. But, as I said before, her decease at a time when
                  Bolingbroke's plans were immature, frustrated all attempts in that direction, and
                  at once transferred the balance to the Whigs; and Harley, Bolingbroke, and
                  Mistress Abbie were forced into semi-obscurity, with the odium of the termination
                  of the French war and the treaty of Utrecht hanging over them like a pall, while
                  the dominant party were praised to the skies for their diplomacy in accomplishing
                  a work which had baffled and worried the ablest statesmen of the three preceding
                  reigns—namely, the union of England and Scotland.
               
               The Augustan Age, with its hosts of able writers, its pure, humorous "Spectator,"
                  and its many literary luminaries, is no more. The first Hanoverian has brought his
                  gross tastes, his dull brutality, and his fat, ugly, mistresses to Saint James,
                  besides having an eye to his boon companions and advisers, who look on England as
                  a land to be despoiled for their especial benefit. I almost forgot to mention that
                  he has a wife, who came with the rest of the court—the unfortunate Sophia
                  Dorothea. The family quarrels and dissensions of the royal family are too
                  notorious to deserve more than a passing notice. The ministry is composed of
                  Halifax, Cowper, Stanhope, Sunderland, and other eminent Whigs, Robert Walpole,
                  who primarily filled a low position, is now more fully appreciated, and has
                  attained the high eminence of First Lord of the Treasury. Such are the men who
                  hold office under the degraded Othello who imprisoned Philip von Königsmark in the
                  Castle of Ahlden for thirty-two years, for a suspected intrigue with his truly
                  beloved Sophia.
               Lord Wharton, jubilant at the unexpected good fortune that has befallen his party,
                  can scarcely contain himself for joy. He is now Marquis of Wharton and Lord Privy
                  Seal in the ministry, where his unequalled parliamentary tactics secure him
                  respect and admiration. One blight, however, sobers his happiness—the thorn of the
                  rose; it is the news of Philip's elopement with Margery, who, he fears, is by this
                  time his daughter-in-law, for the news has only reached him to-day—the second
                  after the occurrence. Philip's action is a great blow to him, and his heart aches
                  and his head grows hot, as he reviews the advantages, that might have been secured
                  to his family through Philip's alliance with the powerful house which he had
                  selected for that honor. Alas, it is now too late!
               He knows that Philip will reveal himself ere long, either in London or in Buck's,
                  and then he determines to send him out of his sight, on the continent, where, with
                  a due consideration of his volatile, capricious temperament, he can be made as
                  polished a scholar and as staunch a Whig as circumstances will permit.
               It is in the Kitcat room that Lord Wharton muses thus over the unfilial conduct of
                  his recreant son, and thoughts of him fill his mind with chagrin and sorrow. His
                  dreams of Philip's future greatness and his hopes that he would one day be the
                  respected head of the party of which he is a mainstay, are now
                  vanishing. The door opens and Vanbrugh strolls in, humming "Marlborough s'en va en
                  Guerre" with a jaunty air. Noticing his despondent attitude, and his obliviousness
                  of the presence of his friend, Vanbrugh taps him on the shoulder. Wharton raises
                  his head with a displeased expression on his face, but Vanbrugh's laughing, brown
                  eyes force him to be good-humored against his will, and he exclaims, "Peace, you
                  Goth! I am cynical, misanthropical!"
               "Goth yourself, Sir Timon," replies Vanburgh; "we'll have a bowl of Kit's best
                  punch. It will aroint the vapors. As for being cynical, I trow that I have as much
                  right to that disposition as yourself, for the huzzy Malborough swears that she
                  will never pay me my claims on her for the house. Faith, if she does not, my
                  creditors will tremble, and all Jewdom will be in an uproar. Ugh!" he ejaculates
                  with an expression of loathing, "how abhorrent to my feelings it is to have the
                  dirty paw and black-rimmed nails of a bum-bailiff Shylock tap me on the shoulder.
                  Have you ever felt the sensation, my lord?" he queries, laughingly.
               "No," replies Wharton, adding, in a bitter tone, "but I have felt a worse
                  sensation within a mighty short time."
               "Possible! What may that be, if the question is not impertinent?"
               Wharton replies briefly, "A wilful son!"
               
               "S'blood! yes, I did hear something about Philip's escapade. Tell me all about the
                  affair, I beg, if it is not private!"
               "If it was, Vanbrugh, faith! I doubt your power of unquestioning. However, as it
                  will soon be food for London scandal, I'll even tell you; it will take but a dozen
                  words. The lad ran off with a Mistress Holmes, a country squireen's daughter, of
                  course against my wishes—c'est tout!" His face
                  grows gloomy and stern again as he finishes.
               "A trifle like your own freaks when younger, my lord! except that with you, it
                  never ended in hymen, as they say Philip's has—ta-ta," he exclaims; leaving my
                  lord to honor Kit with a visit and so test the purity of his Nantz.
               As soon as Wharton received the intelligence of the elopement, he sent a lawyer to
                  inspect the registers of the Fleet-parsons, to see whether they were married
                  there. The search was disappointingly successful, and for a small fee, the lawyer
                  received a copy of the document, which Wharton stuffed into his pocket with a
                  fierce oath.
               His heart is savage as he muses over Philip's mean alliance, and he is so absorbed
                  in his thoughts that he does not notice the approach of a servant until he is
                  respectfully addressed, "My lord, a letter for your lordship!" He lifts it off the
                  salver, and starts violently as he recognizes Philip's handwriting. Breaking the
                  seal, he smooths the crisp paper on the table, and reads it with close attention:
                  Philip tells him that Margery is now his wife, and the object of his deepest
                  love—at which part my lord mutters, "Cursed idiot!"—and it now depends on his
                  father whether he shall return to Buck's or remain in London; and he hints that it
                  matters little whether or not his father disowns him altogether. The tone of the
                  letter is cool and haughty, and is written in a spirit of careless indifference
                  which cuts to its reader's heart. He considers long and seriously over Philip's
                  communication, and notes his defiant attitude in every word. He knows that, if he
                  disowns him, Philip will necessarily go to ruin in a very short time, and he has
                  no wish to create further topics of scandal and incur the odium that will surely
                  attach to him if he pursues harsh measures.
               Lord Wharton resolves to go and see Philip at the address which he has given in
                  the letter. Rising, he leaves the room, and sets out at a rapid pace toward the
                  Blue Bell, which is about a half mile from the club-house.
               In reply to his inquiry of the bar-maid, he is told that "Mister Wharton and his
                  lady are both up stairs." He asks to be shown up, and says, "My name is Mr.
                  Johnson!" Leading the way up, she announces, "Mr. Johnson, sir;" and Wharton
                  enters. It is dusk, and the father enters unrecognized. Philip begs him to be
                  seated, and asks his acceptance of a glass of canary, which he silently refuses.
                  In spite of his chagrin, the father is amused at the part which he is performing
                  in so laughable a play. Before him is his son, not yet sixteen, and married to a
                  girl—a year younger than himself—against his express orders; while he, the father
                  of the first, sits unknown to them in the same room. The situation touches his
                  sense of the ridiculous so keenly that while he can scarcely keep from laughing
                  outright, he is at the same time bitterly angry and sore at their doings.
               "Your business with me, sir? My time is rather occupied, at present, with matters
                  of pressing importance!"
               "Oh, well! if it is of very pressing importance, Master Philip, I
                  will call at your convenience!" cries my lord, in loud, mocking tones, that make
                  Margery ejaculate a little shriek of terror and even force his son to turn pale.
                  Although Philip had in a manner prepared himself self for a meeting, still his father's sudden
                  appearance takes him aback, for he had not the slightest suspicion of the identity
                  of his guest when he entered, and he is struck dumb.
               "So! Philip! you are married, eh? It was unkind of you not to let me know about
                  your intentions. I would have taken great delight in giving away the bride! I—"
                  Feeling that his anger is fast gaining the mastery, he stops for a moment, and
                  resumes in graver, sterner tones: "Master Philip, for the present you had better
                  remain in London, and I think—as no doubt you will agree with me on
                  consideration—that 'your wife' had better return to Buck's for a short time. Think
                  on what I have said. If you would like to hear my reasons for my wishes, come to
                  that address!" giving him a card with the words, "Marquis of Wharton, Kitcat Club,
                  Fountain Tavern, Strand," scrawled on it; he leaves the room without another word,
                  and repairs to the club-room to spend the night in drinking and gaming.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVI.
               
                  
                     
                        Omnia vincit amor; et nos cedamus amori—?
                     
                     VIRGIL.
                  
               
               AS his father's footsteps die away up the street, Philip exclaims to Margery, "Did
                  I not tell you that all would be right? See! my father is now appeased, and all
                  that remains is for the General to follow in his steps; then we can return to
                  Buck's and live in happiness!"
               Margery replies, "My own Philip, I mistrust his lordship! Forgive me for the
                  words! But he looked so stern and cold; and did you notice? He said never a word
                  to me;" and her eyes fill with tears of wounded sensibility.
               Her emotion affects him, and he replies warmly, "What need we care, Margery, if
                  all the world forsake us? We have each other. Now listen to my programme. I will
                  to my father, and hear what he advises. If his advice chimes with our wishes, we
                  will obey him. If it does not, we can—"
               He stops to consider on what they will do, but apparently comes to no definite
                  conclusion, for he says no more on the subject, but proposes that they go to the
                  theatre, a proposition to which she gladly assents; and so, instead of discussing
                  a disagreeable subject, they go to Drury Lane to see the mimic heroes and
                  heroines, kings and queens strut their hour on the Thespian boards.
               Margery is both pleased and shocked at the play—pleased by the tender romance, the
                  deep passion and gorgeous paraphernalia of the loving heroine and hero; and shocked by the coarse language and
                  free jests of some of the performers, part of which she cannot fail to understand;
                  and not being accustomed to them, like the regular habitués, her scarlet cheeks attest her wounded modesty at each
                  fresh allusion, until she begins to attract the attention of some of the blasé dames sitting near them, who are patched,
                  powdered, and scented to the last degree. Philip enjoys it all with infinite
                  gusto, and his appreciative laugh sounds again and again at the repetition of
                  every spicy saying or highly-flavored allusion. He is charmed with this first
                  glimpse of London life, and determines to see it more fully ere long. The play is
                  Nick Rowe's "Fair Penitent," and the character of Lothario—Richardson's
                  "Lovelace"—pleases him immensely, while Margery's sympathies are exclusively
                  enlisted in favor of the ruined Calista.
               After they have returned to their room at the Blue Bell, and as they are eating a
                  light supper, Philip says, "Sweetheart, I will see my lordly father to-morrow and
                  arrive at a full understanding as regards his position towards us."
               Margery replies in an anxious manner, "Do not anger him, Philip dear, or speak too
                  haughtily; for until we are all friends again, I shall feel unhappy, for I have
                  been the cause of all this trouble."
               He replies, "Tut-tut; if you value my love, dearie, never say another word about
                  such absurdities! Why, what would have become of me if you had not been my own
                  true love, when I begged you to fly with me and be my wife? And never was I so
                  happy as when we were joined forever by that drunken, tattered Fleet parson. My
                  benediction on him, if it will do him any good! 
                     
                        "And the best and the worst of this is
                        That neither is most to blame—"
                     
                  
               
               
               The next morning Philip attires himself in his azure velvet suit, and dons his
                  drooping hat—the one whose long pearl plumes dangle on his shoulder—and buckles
                  his jingling spurs on his square-toed shoes; then slinging his rapier on his
                  thigh, he helps Margery into the chair which waits for them, and finally enters
                  himself. In a short time they arrive at the Fountain Tavern, and are accosted by
                  Kit, who looks admiringly at the handsome boy, and bows deeply as he enters the
                  door.
               Says Philip, "Is my Lord Wharton to be seen?"
               Kit rejoins, "Yes, my lord; his lordship instructed me to send you up to him as
                  soon as you came."
               Philip is ushered up stairs, and directly finds himself in the room which he has
                  so often heard about as the sanctum of wits, beaux, and statesmen. His father, who
                  is writing at a low table in a corner by the fire, does not rise, but bids him
                  "Good morning" in a curt tone, and waves him to a seat, but Philip's gorge rising
                  at the authoritative gesture, he declines the silent command, and lounges
                  carelessly around the room. He admires Kneller's beauties, looks at the engraved
                  goblets, and inwardly sneers at the emblems of whiggery decorating the walls,
                  ceiling, and the tables. On a small card table which stands beneath Anne's
                  portrait, is a glass case, containing a lock of dark, wiry hair; below it is a
                  placard on which is written 
                     "A lock of hair from the head of his most gracious majesty KING WILLIAM
                        III."
                  
               
               A profane idea strikes him to raise the case, and make some ridiculous alteration
                  in the lettering of the placard, or to filch the lock, or to do something
                  irreverent to it, for he hates the memory of the taciturn, phlegmatic William; but
                  a side glance at his father, who has been watching his movements, at once dispels
                  all thoughts of his intentions; still, even with his keen eyes on him, Philip curls his lips scornfully, and
                  mutters, loud enough to be heard, "Pah! the big-breeched Dutchman." My lord's eyes
                  blaze, and his brow contracts, as he catches this loyal exclamation; but he says
                  nothing, and resumes his writing.
               Philip waxes restless and impatient, and at last says testily, "My lord, tempus fugit! and, under favor, I would like to finish
                  my business, if you are at liberty."
               The cold, cynical tone in which Philip speaks, cuts Wharton to the quick, and he
                  looks at him, and replies in an injured manner, "My son, I will not keep you very
                  long with one you seem to hate so much!"
               As Philip meets his gaze, he feels for the first time contrite and repentant, and
                  suddenly determines to be in future a better son, and obey his father in all that
                  he asks; he discovers also that he is loved with all a parent's love, more, far
                  more than he deserves. He exclaims, in a thick voice, "Father, you can trust me in
                  future! Be a friend to my Margery, and do with me as you will;" and extends his
                  hand. His father presses it in his with a cordial grasp, and his eyes grow
                  brighter as he exclaims: "Let bygones be bygones, Philip; and if you obey me in
                  all things as you have promised you will, we can once more live happily
                  together!"
               After a short conversation, Philip asks, with some hesitation, "What do you advise
                  us to do under these circumstances?"
               He replies, "Philip, I still think it better that Margery should return home, and
                  yourself also, in order to explain matters there. After that, return to me at
                  once, and we will discuss your future travels, for you know as well as myself that
                  it is necessary to the education of a gentleman that he should be thoroughly
                  acquainted with foreign manners and usages, and also be somewhat familiar with
                  their politics, all of which enable a man to bear himself properly in the eyes of
                  the world."
               Here Philip smiles, and thinks to himself that he is a master of that art, at any
                  rate.
               "And when you have been away a year or two, you will welcome Margery with the
                  greater fervor for your long absence from her!"
               Philip looks a little gloomy and doubtful at this, which his lordship noticing,
                  adds, in a matter-of-course manner, "If you find that she is really essential to
                  your happiness, after a trial of a month or so in Paris and the Low Countries, you
                  can easily write home, and I will send her on to you!"
               With his usual prescience, Lord Wharton sees that in time Philip's affection will
                  cool, and he is sure that when his son is surrounded by the frail beauties of the
                  continental cities, his fond recollections of Margery will be effaced by their
                  allurements and their artful tongues, for he greatly fears that Margery will
                  strengthen his Tory proclivities, in her romantic, womanish sympathy for the
                  Pretender, and he determines to strain every nerve to make him a staunch Whig and
                  a Protestant, and for that purpose he intends to look about him for some one who
                  will be able to control him and instil into him the good seed that will ripen to
                  the advantage of the Whig party.
               Philip, finally overcome by his father's arguments, promises to do as he wishes in
                  all things, with the proviso, that his travels shall not begin for a couple of
                  months, and that Margery shall stay with him in London. Wharton gladly acquiesces
                  in this plan, for the longer the young couple are together the more the defects
                  they will find in each other—a knowledge which may produce a mutual satiety and
                  dissatisfaction between them! Moreover, he can regulate their domestic life to a
                  certain extent, and he sees a very easy way of creating a bad feeling between them, although at the same
                  time his scheme will certainly do Philip a deal of harm. But he consoles himself
                  with the jesuitical maxim, "The end justifies the means." A short outline of his
                  plan may not be unacceptable.
               There are in London two or three notorious societies of demoralized young
                  scapegraces, who consider that ruining a woman and then running her husband or
                  lover through the body for his insolence in interfering, is quite a laudable
                  action; and boast of their shamelessness and profligacy as if they are cardinal
                  virtues; and the way in which they make the night hideous with their ribaldry and
                  obscenity is a disgrace to the city. No man is safe from their skilful rapiers; no
                  woman safe from their wiles or violence. They designate themselves Mohocks or
                  Spitfires, and are the scourge of London's honest cits, who curse and fear them.
                  These patrician bravos stab a man to death in the most gentlemanly manner; and
                  then, if the hue and cry become dangerous, they find a refuge in Thieves'
                  Sanctuary, and laugh at the puny efforts of the law to apprehend them.
               It is into this reckless society that Wharton determines to throw his son, in
                  order that ill-feelings may arise between him and his wife, for Margery will
                  naturally feel aggrieved at the amours, intrigues, and late hours which Philip
                  will be, in a measure, forced into in such company, and will remonstrate with him.
                  The result is plain to him. Philip's love will fade away and with it the influence
                  of his wife. Thus, in a short month, he may gain more power over his son than he
                  has ever had before. My lord, be it remembered, is no great enemy to the Mohocks,
                  for among them are many men of high birth and great wealth.
               So his father kindly agrees to all his son says; and it is arranged that in a
                  month's time, Philip will leave England with a tutor who is to be selected by his
                  father. Wharton rises and embraces him, and bids him adieu with an apology for the
                  state affairs that prevent him from indulging in a longer conversation.
               Philip tells Margery of the result, while they are riding home, and she cries
                  bitterly when she learns that their honeymoon is to be so short. He agrees with
                  her that it will be "vastly unpleasant," and continues, "but you know I intend to
                  send for you at the end of a month!" This communication comforts her a little, and
                  she converses in more cheerful tones about the future, and is pleased beyond
                  expression at his lordship's reconciliation.
               As Philip draws her nearer to him and looks tenderly in her pure eyes, he says,
                  "Wifie, he tells me that whilst I remain in London, he wishes me to associate for
                  a time with a party of gentlemen who can enlighten me on many matters, which are
                  essential for me to know regarding city life; for you know that I am a trifle
                  ignorant on some points!" Here she looks at him with a smile, as though to deny
                  such a disparaging statement; but he continues, "This may take me away from you a
                  little; but for both our sakes I must learn the properest way of holding myself;
                  manners here are so different from those of dear, quiet Bucks!"
               She acquiesces with a troubled sigh, and they talk of Rooksnest, and Elm Avenue,
                  and of her father, who, by the by, is to be in London to-morrow—a recollection
                  that causes her to blush even to her shoulders, which glisten like veined Parian
                  under the soft lace thrown modestly over her bosom.

                     VII. THE REVENGE.
                  
               
               ALL England is ablaze with the news of Earl Mar's "hunting match" in the
                  Highlands, and the later tidings of the battle at Dunblane, where he met with a
                  check by the Duke of Argyle. During the action, the right wing of the Highlanders
                  had become so excited that they broke their ranks, and swooped on Argyle's left
                  wing with irresistible impetuosity; and hewed them down with deadly two-handed
                  sweeps of their broad claymores and their long Lochaber axes, the while screaming
                  harsh, Gaelic war cries; but they receive a terrible retribution in the utter rout
                  and destruction of the clans on the left of Mar, who, although Stewarts,
                  Mackenzies, and Camerons, were tumbled over like sheep by Argyle's veterans and
                  almost to a man destroyed.
               Lord Lovat, who was in command of the castle of Inverness, and who has hitherto
                  borne the reputation of being a staunch adherent of the Pretender, has surrendered
                  it without a struggle, and in England Preston has followed suit. It is the same
                  Lord Lovat who afterwards sneered, as he mounted the scaffold that expiated his
                  villanies, "God save us! Why should there be such a bustle about taking off an old
                  gray head from a man who cannot get up three steps without two assistants!" And
                  now Mar's army begins to melt away very perceptibly, for the scum, which was ready
                  enough to side with a rising cause, now, like rats, desert the sinking ship. The
                  brave Earl sat in his camp-tent, and mused over the events of the last few days,
                  and he began to grow disheartened by his misfortunes, when the news reached him
                  that "King James III." had landed at Peterhead, and was on his way to visit him.
                  His heart bounded within him as he exclaimed, "Thank God for this! I could wish no
                  better news, short of hearing that he held his own again;" and the soldier bowed
                  his head and wept.
               Wharton, busier than ever with his political and domestic affairs, and absorbed in
                  his many schemes and intrigues, gave never a thought to Him who nips all
                  intrigues, ruins all schemes, and sends their fabricator to his last account. His
                  benevolent design of placing Philip amid the select society which he had chosen
                  for him, and also his scheme to estrange him from his child-wife, have failed, not
                  because he lacked either the will or the power, but because death struck him with
                  his chill arrow and sent him unassoilzied to the eternal shades. He died in great
                  agony and remorse a few days after his conference with his son: with friends and
                  servants about him, but neither his son nor his wife to wipe the death-dew from
                  his face and lips, and kiss him good-bye forever. His last words were,
                  "Philip—send him to me!—my boy is—" and the death rattle forced him to finish the
                  sentence in heaven or——.
               Philip is promenading Vauxhall's shady avenues with Margery, or rather was, for
                  they are now sitting at a little, bowlegged, rustic table in one of the alcoves,
                  eating cheese-cake and syllabub—dishes that are quite à la
                     mode. As Philip is about to call for another platter of cake and
                  'bub, a messenger brings the news of his father's death. Margery turns pale, and
                  looks anxiously iously at Philip, who
                  seems cool and collected, and puts some few questions to the bearer of the news,
                  and rewards him for his trouble. Then turning to Margery, he says gravely, "This
                  is a sad ending to our day's pleasuring, Margery! Let us go hom;" and they return
                  to their chair.
               During the ride home, he scarcely speaks a word, and seems immersed in thought.
                  Margery, who has hardly seen Lord Wharton a dozen times, grieves chiefly for
                  Philip's sake, for she thinks that she appreciates his position by changing places
                  with him and by thinking of her own father as dead instead of Philip's; and tears
                  burst from her eyes at the thought.
               Philip now hurries to the side of his dead father, and looks sadly on all that
                  remains of the great Whig statesman. He drops a great tear on his brow, which
                  courses slowly adown his cheek, enters his open lips, and rests between them on
                  his white, clenched teeth, quivers there an instant, and disappears.
               "Egad!" he exclaims, "it had pleased me better to see you once more ere you had
                  left me forever; however. God or the Devil hath decreed otherwise, and faith I'll
                  not repine at the decree, whoever put it forth. Now I am my own master, Philip,
                  Earl of Rathfarnham and Marquis of Catherlongh! but not as yet First
                  Lord of the Treasury;" and an exultant smile crosses his boyish face. Anon
                  thoughts of his dead father rise in his mind. Kneeling down by the bedside, he
                  grasps his cold, right hand, and breathes a prayer to Heaven! after which he steps
                  softly out and leads Margery in to look on the man who once conspired so cruelly
                  against her happiness. But all is forgotten in the dread Presence; leaning over
                  the corpse she kisses his cold forehead, and breathes a heartfelt prayer for the
                  future salvation of her husband's father.
               Philip leads Margery out again, and closes the door after her. He asks of the
                  servants, whom he dismissed at his entrance, and whom he now recalls to renew
                  their care of the body, whether his lordship left any orders for him; whereupon
                  his former secretary replies, "No, my lord, his lordship died so suddenly that he
                  had no time to say anything, except to call on your name!"
               "Say you so?" he replies; "I did not think his death had been so sudden—that is
                  all!" Leaving the death chamber, he goes to Margery, to whom says, "I must send
                  that sad intelligence to my mother at once, and she can be here by to-morrow
                  evening."
               So saying, he sits down and hastily scrawls a letter to her, signing it "Wharton,
                  Earl of Rathfarnham and Marquis of Catherlough," but, on second thought, runs his
                  quill through them and blots them out; and the death-summons goes post-haste to
                  Bucks.

               "REBECK me!" growls Shem, "I want ye to do as ye like, Brad, if ye will get wedded
                  till her; I canna say but I think Meg's a good lass. Debbie can gie ye pots an'

               After this unusually lengthy peroration, Shem becomes flustered and slightly
                  shame-faced, and thinks that he was rather maudlin and soft in talking so
                  familiarly with his son about his approaching marriage with Meg Busbie; so, to
                  take off any appearance of undue mildness that he may have been guilty of, he
                  adds, grumly, "An' a pest on the fuilish pair o' ye!"—an observation which i
                  firmly believe he repents of as soon as he makes, for he kicks the dog away from
                  his seat, and recalls her with a low, coaxing "Down, my brach! down," and she
                  crouches again and licks the booth that kicked her.
               Brad, who looks cheerful and handsome in his best suit, smiles as he watches his
                  father's manœuvres, and finally cries, "Well, good-bye, dad! I will be in wi'
                  Meggie. If you want me, sound the horn, and I will return at once;" and, with a
                  step as light and springy as a panther, he steps out on the greensward in all the
                  blithe-someness of a pure conscience and requited love. He has put the momentous
                  question to Meggie, and after a dozen different refusals—according to the general
                  custom of women in such cases, who half fret a man's life out in order to
                  experience the keen, trembling delight of hearing and refusing an offer of
                  marriage as many times as possible—has been accepted, all the preparations have
                  been made, and the wedding is to take place this very day.
               He strikes off in the direction of Dame Busbie's cottage, and is running like one
                  of the wild red deer which he has so often shot, when the deep-voiced bell in the
                  round-tower clangs an alarming summons far and near, and he stops and stands as
                  still as a statue. Clang! Clang!! Clang!!! boom out the slow and measured strokes.
                  Brad knows that the large bell is never rung except at a birth, death, or marriage
                  of some of the family, and his heart is full of a vague, uneasy sensation, as of
                  some impending danger.
               Clang! Clang!! Clang!!!
               Quickly retracing his steps, he looks into the lodge; it is empty. Now he catches
                  a faint, confused murmur like the sound of summer waves on the seashore, or of
                  many people whispering or talking in a low voice! Then a long, woman's wail comes
                  to his ears from the direction of the castle, thither he runs with all his speed,
                  and there hears the story of my lord's death told in hurried, awe-stricken tones.
                  The women folk are crying, and the men are grave and sorrowful, for despite his
                  wickedness and his profligacy, Wharton was a kind, good-humored master to them
                  all; and if some of them could recollect a daughter or a sister who owed her shame
                     to him, the recollection is drowned
                  in pity for his fate: dying alone in London, neither his wife nor his son to close
                  his eyes and pray with him for his future redemption.
               When the news was conveyed to her ladyship, she had fallen into strong
                  convulsions, and was carried stiff and senseless to her bed.
               Most of those who are assembled before the castle are attired in their gayest
                  dresses and their chapel-going clothes in honor of Brad's wedding, for he is a
                  great favorite amongst them on account of his good nature and his generosity. But
                  here a lad and there a lass can be seen unpinning a gay rosette or a fluttering
                  ribbon and then hiding it from view in a pocket or a bosom, for they all know that
                  the wedding will not take place this day. As for poor Brad! he is a double
                  mourner, for at one blow he loses a good master and an expectant bride.
               Mistress Meggie is here in all her wedding finery, her eyes are full of tears and
                  her lip trembles pitifully—whether most at Lord Wharton's death, or the stoppage
                  of her marriage, I know not. Brad glides to her side, and, unobserved by the
                  crowd, puts his arm around her trim waist and presses her side sympathizingly. She
                  seems to take little heed of his actions, and does not offer the slightest
                  resistance to his caresses, but exclaims in a low, half-crying voice, "Oh, Brad,
                  how unlucky! I am sure we will never be married now; it is so unlucky for a death
                  to come betwixt a marriage!"
               "Don't say so, Meg!" he exclaims. "It makes my heart ache."
               Meg replies, affectionately, "Well, Brad, I winna say it, then, but I am afeared
                  sometimes that I might lose you—dearie!"
               His hands clasp more tightly around her waist, and he feels his heart grow bigger
                  and bigger in his throat, until it chokes his utterance so much that like a
                  sensible lad he deems silence better than speech, but looks volumes
                  out of his sunny, hazel eyes, and she seems satisfied.
               "Well," he thinks to himself, "if our love is enough for man and wife, it will
                  keep a fortnight."
               Dame Throck, who is talking to Betty, says, "Yes, an' I recollect that yest're'en'
                  a crow flew three times aroun' the tower, an' then pecked for nigh ten minutes
                  again the rim o' the bell. I knew summut evil would befa' the house afore the year
                  war' out!" and the bystanders shiver as they listen to her doleful tale. "Ugh, I
                  feel a grue," says one impressionable gossip. Another adds, "I knew his lordship
                  war goin' to happen summut, for I dreamed o' a weddin' last neet, an' that is
                  allus a sure sign o' evil." So they go on.
               Shem, who is in a rather isolated position, calls Brad and Meg to him, and says,
                  in a low voice. "Of coorse the weddin' will no come off the day; it is a sad thing
                  that prevents it; but the Lord does it a' for the best;" and he turns away to hide
                  his emotion by scowling fiercely at two little children who look up at him with
                  streaming eyes, crying because others cry, and without the remotest idea of the
                  reason of their grief.
               Clang! clang! clang! 
                     
                        "Heavy, slow
                        Tolls the fun'ral
                        Note of woe."
                     
                  
               
               Lady Wharton has lain for two whole hours, scarcely breathing, and more dead than
                  alive. When she does awake it is to realize to the fullest extent her misery and
                  her loss, while her thoughts revert to Philip whom she has not seen since his mad
                  escapade, and she trembles as she wonders whether she will be able to control him
                     now that her husband is no more; she
                  feels that she will not, and is sick at heart.
               A servant enters, who exclaims, "My lady, General Holmes wishes to see you?"
               She replies, "Admit him! this is no time for ceremony!" And she orders her maid to
                  arrange the pillows behind her so that she can recline in a sitting position.
               The General enters with a soft step, and a sorrowful expression smooths his worn
                  face. He salutes her respectfully, and says, "My lady, words are useless. That I
                  deplore his loss, you must know, particularly at this time, when we might have
                  been drawn nearer together in friendship and interest."
               She does not speak, for her heart is too full for speech, and she presses his hand
                  thankfully. He gulps down an obstruction in his throat, and busies himself in
                  arranging his waistcoat, whose creases seem to displease him, to judge by the
                  pertinacity which he exhibits in smoothing it and pulling it awry. Now he plucks
                  at his moustaches, bites them abstractedly, and at last he blurts out, with a
                  reddening face, "My lady, you are not angry at Margery?"
               "No, General," she replies, plaintively, "though I opposed the match, yet, as it
                  is now accomplished, I say with all my heart, God bless them and keep them both
                  happy, for Margery is a sweet, lovable girl, and was always vastly to my liking; I
                  hope and trust that Philip will be steady and keep out of vicious company." And
                  she sighs as she finishes.
               "You are going to London, my lady?"
               She replies, "Yes, General; and can I venture to ask you to accompany me? Will it
                  put you to much inconvenience?"
               He replies energetically, "My lady, there is nothing I would prize more than to
                  have the honor of attending your ladyship to London or anywhere else!"
               He is delighted at the request she has preferred, and feels himself a greater man
                  now that her ladyship reposes so much confidence in him as to desire him to
                  accompany her on her journey.
               She says, "We will set out to-morrow, then, if I can leave my room, and—Oh, Tom,"
                  she cries as her thoughts revert to her lonely position, "why did you die? I feel
                  so desolate now that both my husband and my son have left me!"
               Holmes, unused to such scenes, does his best to console her, but feels his utter
                  inability to cope with a distressed woman. "My lady, moderate your grief; it is
                  useless; you cannot bring him to life again! Egad, though, that is the very reason
                  that you do grieve! But, egad, I'll stop talking, for I only make matters worse.
                  It was ever a hopeless job to console a woman!"
               She smiles faintly as she notices his evident embarrassment, and dismisses him by
                  saying, "Well, General, I will not detain you any longer. If I am able to go
                  tomorrow, I will send a messenger to the Grange to let you know."
               Glad to escape, the General bows low, and leaves her apartment.
               The next day she felt well enough to start, and in due time they arrived in London
                  without any casualty.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIX.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           But where began the change; and what's my crime?
                           The wretch condemn'd, who has not been arraign'd,
                           Chafes at his sentence. Shall I unsustain'd,
                           Drag on love's nerveless body through all time?
                           I must have slept, since now I wake. Prepare,
                           You lovers, to know love a thing of moods;
                           Not like hard life, of law.
                        
                     
                     GEO. MEREDITH.
                  
               
               THEY are now on the threshold of his lordship's town-house, and Lady Wharton is so
                  weak and agitated that the General is forced to put his arm around her to keep her
                  from falling to the ground. They are quickly announced by the attentive
                  hall-porter, and in a moment she is in Philip's arms, and is crying bitterly. She
                  is too overcome to speak for a time, and can do nothing but hold Philip around the
                  neck and sob and sigh piteously.
               Margery's little hands are both clasped in her father's camp-hardened palm, while
                  she looks shyly at my lady, who, noticing her hesitancy, exclaims with an emphasis
                  which shows that she appreciates her feelings: "My daughter, come to a mother's
                  arms!" and she turns to Margery with a loving light beaming in her saddened eyes.
                  Margery, overjoyed at her words, embraces her fervidly, and the aged dame and the
                  budding woman are friends through the medium of sorrow and joy—sorrow, keen and
                  piercing for a husband's and a father's loss; joy for a disobedient son's
                  return.
               Her ladyship finally performs the sad, painful duty of looking on the inanimate
                  form of her departed husband, after which she retires to her room, heartsore and
                  fatigued, to pray to the Almighty to give her strength enough to support her great
                  affliction.
               Philip, Margery and the General gather together to exchange news and to talk of
                  home and its familiar objects; Holmes, in reply to an observation by Philip, says:
                  "No, Philip; I fear that her ladyship will not long survive your father's death.
                  When she received the sore tidings, she was attacked with strong convulsions, and
                  for over two hours she was not expected to live!"
               Philip whitens with fear at the prospect of such an event, and replies in a shaken
                  voice, "God help me if she dies too! Sometimes I think that I have been the cause
                  of his death, and the thought weighs heavy on me. My mother must not die yet; I
                  cannot bear it until I have shown her how much I regret my wild conduct and
                  reckless behavior while he was living!"
               Margery, frightened at his appearance, moves closer to him, and lays her hand on
                  his arm with a look of sympathy; but turning his face away from her, he gently
                  removes her hand, and a curious expression of suppressed dislike momentarily
                  disfigures his features. She notes the gesture with love's keen eyes, and a heart
                  sickness comes over her as she tries to think that she must have been mistaken in
                  imagining that he looked on her with aversion. Alas! the first cloud has come
                  between them—a cloud from which peers a dead father's look of upbraiding and
                  reproach. The General has watched Philip's behavior, and too truly reads its
                  meaning; but keeping his thoughts to himself, he draws Margery to his side, and
                  casts a searching side glance on her face, which is troubled and anxious; and they
                  are all silent, and not a sound is
                  heard but the slow, monotonous tick-tack of the old clock which stands on the
                  landing outside.
               Philip, anxious to break the dreary silence, which begins to harass him with its
                  painful quietude, asks, in an uninterested voice, "General, has Brad Throck
                  married Meg yet? They were to be united a week ago—so I understood."
               Holmes answers in as vacuous a manner, "No, they were going to be married the day
                  that we received the news of his death, which sad event, of course,
                  put an end to their festivities."
               "Yes," he replies; and again there is dreary silence.
               Margery once more shrinking close to Philip, impulsively throws her arms around
                  his neck, and says, while the tears rain down her cheeks, "Philip, darling! do not
                  look so strange at me. I know that your heart must ache. Philip, have I done aught
                  to offend you? I—"
               "Margery," he replies regretfully, "you are too good for me. I feel hard and
                  cruel, now; yet withal I am sad and conscience-stricken."
               Her quick perception solves his enigmatical words;" she turns from him with a
                  heart too full for speech, and falls into her father's arms with a low, broken
                  sob, and whispers, "Oh, father, he hates me for his father's sake! Hold me
                  tightly. I cannot bear to look him in the face again—he hates me;" and her body
                  shivers from head to foot.
               "General!" Philip exclaims in a sharp, strained voice, "I pray you excuse my
                  departure. I have business outside;" and with these words he leaves the room.
               When his footsteps have died away in the distance, the General says to Margery,
                  "My daughter, tell me truly. Do you love Philip as much now as you did before your
                  marriage?"
               She replies in a passionate voice, but without lifting her head from his breast,
                  "Father, why do you ask such a question? Such love as mine never diminishes, it
                  grows greater by its food?"
               The General seems as if he would have answered her, but thinks better of his
                  purpose, and keeps his words between his teeth.
               "He has grown tired of her—possession has sated him, and he now regrets his
                  step—in time he may hate her! God help thee, Margery! It will kill thee. Thou wert
                  never made for rough speech or cold looks!"
               Drawing her on his knee as in olden times at the Grange, he strokes her hair and
                  cheeks until she falls asleep with a long, deep sigh; while his own weariness
                  produces the same effect on him. And he has a dream, and in his dream he thinks
                  his child has died, and he awakes with a great start, causing his "little girl" to
                  cling more tightly to him, and nestle her bonnie face closer to his shaggy beard,
                  while her rosy lips half open as though she listens to a distant sound. The soul
                  is freer when its case is inert and asleep, and can often foresee events which are
                  unknown to the wakened mind. Does she foresee her future! Would it be better if
                  she could?
               When they meet at table in the morning, Philip is affable, but restrained, while
                  the general conversation is naturally tinctured with a grave sadness. He seems
                  regretful for his treatment of Margery the previous evening, and is now devoted
                  and attentive to her, which Holmes perceives with glad feelings and a relieved
                  mind. Her ladyship is pallid and tearful, the consequences of a night passed in
                  sleepless sorrow and uneasy thought, and she seldom joins in conversation with the
                  others.
               During the day Philip gives orders regarding the funeral, which is to take place
                  to-morrow with due pomp and splendor
               
               
               The chamber is crowded with the dead man's friends, many of the mighty ones of
                  London—chiefly members of the Whig party, who come to have a last look on the man
                  who first in all England welcomed William the Third on his landing, and who had
                  since led them to so many victories by the power of his able tongue, his subtle
                  reasoning and his Ciceronian eloquence.
               Charles Montague, who will also be laid in his grave ere the bones of his former
                  friend are bared by the worms, stands by the side of the glittering coffin, and
                  says gravely to Vanbrugh, as though he feels the nearness of his own dissolution,
                  "I doubt that I'll long survive him; so, egad, Van! you may shortly have the
                  pleasure of looking on me, as I at present look on dear, old, honest Tom."
               "S'life," replies Vanbrugh; "we can ill afford to lose another good man and true;
                  we are weak enough already. One such defection from our ranks is enough for one
                  while, I trow!"
               Philip entering at this moment, is warmly greeted by the visitors, who sympathize
                  with him, and express their condolences with his loss in words and actions. He is
                  dressed in sombre black, a long crape veil is attached to his right arm, and he
                  has also a neckcloth of the same material, which gives a pallidity to his skin
                  that is ghastly and startling. His mother, who walks beside him, is covered from
                  head to foot in the trappings of death, and tears are bursting from her eyes. Her
                  grief is not for comfort or sympathy, and so all feel with an intuitive
                  knowledge.
               Philip leads her to her room, and kisses her tenderly; when he has closed the
                  door, she says, in an anxious manner, "Philip, dear, for your own sake as well as
                  mine, avoid those men, Vanbrugh and Lord Halifax. They are too dissolute and too
                  old for one of your years."
               He draws himself up haughtily, as he replies, "Philip Wharton, though young in
                  years, needs not their adventitious aid to make him all men's equal, and the
                  superior of most."
               She does not reply to this outburst, but looks fixedly at him for a minute, and
                  says sadly, "Good-night Philip, and God keep you from harm!"
               Philip bows and returns at once to Vanbrugh, with whom and Halifax he converses of
                  many things.
               All day the room is crowded with visitors coming and going. All day long the
                  rumbling coaches draw up before the door, and titled dames and famous men go and
                  come.
               Margery, who is with her father in a retired corner near the head of the coffin,
                  surveys with curiosity or respect the owners of the famous or infamous names that
                  are continually announced in measured accents by the pompous, powdered lackey who
                  keeps out curious intruders.
               The funeral next day was gorgeous and solemn; plumes waves, horses pranced, sable
                  streamers fluttered in the air, and all the details and ceremonies that are
                  essential to a noble's funeral were there. All that now remains of the great Whig
                  is a fresh, earthy mound and an imposing tablet with its "Hic jacet Thomas
                  Wharton", with a long array of virtues which he never possessed, and never a word
                  of the vices which he did possess. Truly, sinners while we live, the world,
                  thankful for our demise, almost canonizes us when we die.
               A curious incident occurred just before the coffin lid was screwed down, which I
                  hope it is not amiss to mention. Two burly carriers set their chair down in front
                  of the door, and handed out of it a lady dressed in deep mourning. Her face must have once been very
                  beautiful, but it had become wrinkled and disfigured by care or trouble. There
                  were great hollows in her cheeks—caves wherein lurked despair and melancholy; and
                  her large eyes were wild and haggard. Pushing the guardian lackey aside, and
                  walking swiftly down to the corpse, she kissed its pale lips and laid a bunch of
                  dusty, withered violets on its shroud, she then left as silently as she came,
                  without vouchsafing a word to any one. Her face somewhat resembled that of the
                  girl whom Wharton had once met many years ago—during the storm of 1703! The
                  company stared at her abrupt entrance, and wondered at her singular action, but no
                  one interfered with her by word or deed.

               ST. DUNSTAN'S clock has just struck one. The moon diffuses a glorious light, and
                  the many-storied houses throw deep shadows over the streets. All is quiet, and a
                  solemn, thought-inspiring tranquillity broods over the city, disposing the mind to
                  the consideration of high and important topics—when suddenly a loud shout,
                  followed by noisy laughter and obscene curses, breaks in on the stillness of the
                  night. A crowd of drunken, brawling rufflers sally out of a tavern, which is
                  notorious as being one of the stopping places of the most ruffianly, drunken, and
                  cruel of all associations, the Mohocks, many of whose members are of high birth
                  and famous i' the state, but whose innate depravity has reduced them to the level
                  of a Fijian.
               These are the Mohocks who now desecrate the night's calm beauty with their
                  infernal orgies. They take their name from a tribe of red men, who are natives of
                  the colonies. Their leader is invariably the worst one of their worthy company;
                  his title is Taw-Waw-Eben-Zan- Kaladar,
                  Emperor of the Mohocks, and he regulates their actions and proceedings with
                  absolute powers and unquestioned authority. They are nearly all dressed in the
                  extreme of the fashion. Velvet cloaks laced to a miracle, silken hose,
                  ostentations ruffles, long plumed hats, and wide, lace collars are common to them
                  all. Some hold a black satin mask or vizard in their hands, and a few have them on
                  their faces. Two or three are flourishing their glittering rapiers above their
                  heads, and occasionally pound on the shutters of the houses which they pass; and
                  woe to the man, woman, or child who dares to remonstrate. They would be in
                  imminent peril of their lives, for the crew are mad drunk and reckless.
               The leader, whose forehead is adorned with a golden crescent, which is gummed to
                  the skin, lifts his hand and at once there is comparative silence. "My lords and
                  gentlemen—members of the Chosen Band! This night Philip Wharton, Earl of
                  Rathfarnham and Marquis of Catherlough, a new member of our honorable company,
                  must exhibit his valor and dexterity by either tipping the lion, or doing a
                  sweater on such person or persons as we may meet to-night; or, as in case
                  provided, pay a penalty of one hundred guineas. Have I said well?"
               The noisy approval which greets his speech shows that all are satisfied, and
                  content to abide by his words.
               To those who do not understand the terms "sweater" and "tipping the lion," I will
                  venture a short explanation. The "sweaters" operate in parties of four, five, or
                  six. Surrounding their unfortunate victim, they form a circle with swords drawn
                  and pointed toward him. They then begin to prick and prod him with the sharp
                  points until they are tired of the sport, or until they think it is dangerous to
                  continue the sport any longer. "Tipping ping the lion" means to slit the nose, or
                  to bore out the eyes with the knuckles.
               Such are the amusements of the society into which Philip has been introduced by
                  Vanbrugh, who kindly volunteered to guarantee his character as a gentleman when he
                  proposed him. In 1712, a royal proclamation was issued "to rout the association
                  and arrest the members," but it was of no use; for the judges who should have
                  enforced the law and brought the villains to justice, had in many cases, friends
                  who were themselves Mohocks. Shadwell's observation is doubtless familiar to you;
                  but I quote it because it gives a very accurate idea of the terror which this club
                  inspired. "A man cannot go from the Rose Tavern to the Piazza once, but he must
                  venture his life twice."
               Philip, reeling and staggering in drunken uncertainty, replies to his chief's
                  address with grandiloquent gestures and in a husky and indistinct voice: "Most
                  mighty Emperor, I swear that the first human being who crosses our path, or
                  violates the air of Drury Lane with his pestiferous carcass, shall suffer by my
                  hands any penalty that you may adjudge—demme!" Whirling his rapier, with a rapid
                  turn of his flexible wrist, he brings it gracefully to the salute. The consummate
                  skill with which he performs this difficult movement would be creditable to a
                  professed maitre d'armes.
               
               "Bravo, egad, well done!" screams Lord Catachresis, delighted with his new
                  confrère.
               "Hist!" hiccups the Emperor, "I hear a step. Fall back, gentlemen! Leave my lord
                  to deal with this daring invader of our nocturnal rights!"
               With these words and an injunction to Philip he retreats into the darkness of a
                  shadowed doorway, the rest follow his example with more celerity, and
                  noiselessness than one would think possible in such a rackety set; while Philip is left alone to accomplish his
                  first duty in his character of a Mohock.
               The unsuspecting pedestrian, who is coming rapidly toward him, is a man of medium
                  size, and strong, heavy build. As the clear light of the full moon strikes on his
                  features, Philip discovers, much to his surprise, that he is his father's former
                  secretary, Geoffrey Scribset! "Curse the luck! The fellow will recognize me, to a
                  surety!" Philip exclaims, as he pulls his hat down over his eyes to hide his face
                  as much as possible.
               He is now within a couple of yards of him, and Philip calls to him in a feigned
                  voice, "Halt! knave! where goest thou at this—hic—hour of the night? St. Dunstan's
                  has tolled this quarter or more. Speak!" and he draws his sword arm back in a
                  striking position.
               Geoffrey is no coward, but the sudden challenge frightens him, and the sharp point
                  against his throat makes him start back in dismay; unarmed as he is he sees no way
                  to better his condition than calling for help, which he does, in stentorian tones,
                  "Help! Watch!! Murder!!!"
               In an instant he is griped from behind, and the doughty Catachresis gags him with
                  his fist, whispering in his ear, "Silence, or you are a dead man. We are the
                  Mohocks!" The poor secretary turns pale with fear as he hears the dreaded name,
                  for he has once before been maltreated by this same crew of precious scoundrels.
                  Lord Petronelle, a pallid but fine-looking man, now comes on the scene, and
                  whispers to Catachresis, who releasing Geoffrey, nods significantly to Philip to
                  put the usual questions to the prisoner before he is tortured. But Geoffrey, who
                  has watched an opportunity, suddenly trips Petronelle—who falls with a thud of his
                  head against the cobble-stone—and attempts to run. Philip, quick as thought,
                  grasps him by the scuff of the neck, and endeavors to secure him. In the struggle
                  his hat falls off, and Geoffrey recognizes him and exclaims: "Lord Wharton?" "Yes,
                  hoddy-peck;" he replies, nettled at his discovery. "Is there aught
                  remarkable—hic—in that?" and he shakes him fiercely, for he is both sinewy and
                  muscular.
               The advent of the rest of the crew interrupts any answer that he may have made,
                  and in an instant he is the focus of a dozen bristling rapiers which goad him
                  almost to madness. Geoffrey clenches his teeth, and looks his tormentors calmly in
                  the face, until Philip, whom his cool endurance begins to shame, cries, "Come
                  gentlemen, I think we may let him go now. He is well punished for his late hours
                  and his insolence to my Lord Petronelle; and I'll warrant that he behaves himself
                  better in future." Accordingly they each give him a final prick and sheathe their
                  stained rapiers.
               Poor Geoffrey is about to stagger home, when Philip stops him, and slipping a
                  well-filled purse into his hand, says, "Master Scribset: prithee, what is the
                  cause of your being abroad at so late an hour?"
               "My lord," he answers, as he slyly pockets the peace-offering, "my lady sent me
                  out to question of your lordship's whereabouts."
               Philip's eyes sparkle as he asks, "Which 'my lady?'"
               Geoffrey replies, "Please your lordship, her la'aship, your wife!"
               "Umph! Go home again and give her my compliments. Tell her of everything that has
                  happened—everything, mark you! or I'll thrash you to-morrow with my own hands.
                  Tell her also that the next man who comes to seek me as if I were a truant
                  school-boy, will not only be sweated, but will get a short shrift and a long
                  sword!" and turning his back on the secretary his face becomes purple with passion and a sense of offended
                  dignity.
               His listening companions cheer him and pat him on the back for his independence.
                  They now proceed to wrench the knockers off the doors, tear down signs amid storms
                  of hurras and curses, and do all the mischief they can imagine, until the Emperor
                  cries in a loud voice, "Away! Away! hide yourselves—the patrol!"
               All disappear with wonderful rapidity down the dark alleys, which are plentiful in
                  this neighborhood, all save Philip, who not as yet au
                     fait in all of the stratagems of his confrères, stands irresolute,
                  and bewildered at their sudden disappearance. The foremost of the patrol lays his
                  hand on Philip's shoulder, and cries, "I arrest you, in the king's name!"
               "Deil take you and the king," replies Philip, as he springs back, draws his
                  rapier, and stands on the defensive; but second thoughts decide him to run ere
                  they can close in on him, and at once he bolts down one of the alleys through
                  which the others escaped.
               He hears the hue and cry that is raised, but outdistancing all his pursuers, he
                  arrives at the mansion flushed and bewildered. When he enters the drawing-room, he
                  is dismayed at finding Margery there, who has waited for him until she has fallen
                  asleep; she is curled in the large armchair formerly belonging to his dead father.
                  Her hands are on one of the arms, forming a pillow for her head, and her breath is
                  slow and regular, she looks so child-like, so innocent and pure that all of
                  Philip's former affection for her—which I regret to say has been slowly but surely
                  waning—comes back to him, and he presses his wine-heated lips on hers with a
                  passionate kiss.
               "Philip," she murmurs in her sleep, "My darling!"
               A loud knocking at the outer door echoes through the hall, and awakes her. When
                  she sees Philip before her, she puts her hands over her eyes for a moment as
                  though dazed at his appearance, and exclaims, "How you frightened me, Philip! I
                  was dreaming of you. I thought that we were both back in dear Bucks and at
                  Rooksnest! and I thought that you had the old look in your eyes which used to
                  please me so and which I seldom see now: why—" she stops suddenly, for she sees
                  the frown gathering on his face, and adds abruptly: "Oh, I know, dear. You have so
                  much business to fret you, now that your father is dead, that you have no time for
                  me; but I do not care so long as you really love me."
               He nods his head in an intensely grave manner, but says nothing, for he feels the
                  wine fumes rising in his head, and dares not risk an answer.
               Margery, who has seen her father under the effects of wine at many a dinner and
                  supper, at once divines that he has been drinking, and she asks him whether it
                  would not be better for him to retire; and he assents with drunken gravity. As
                  they are ascending the stairs, the butler, a crusty, purplish old man, bursts into
                  the room, and exclaims in terrified accents, "Lord have mercy on us! My lord,
                  Master Scribset has been waylaid and wellnigh killed by the Mohocks; he is all
                  covered with blood;" and after this wonderful piece of intelligence he bows and
                  leaves hurriedly.
               "Poor man!" exclaims Margery, turning pale with terror. "Attacked by the Mohocks!
                  Who are they, Philip?"
               "What should I know about them?" he demands angrily; "there is a company of very
                  proper—hic—gentlemen who call themselves by a somewhat similar name; but whether
                  these are the same that attacked Scribset, I know not and care less." His testy
                  tone brings tears to her eyes, and she asks no more questions.
               
               Geoffrey Scribset has roused the whole house with his cries, and all the servants
                  are sympathizing with him as he relates the tale of his troubles and shows, as
                  proofs of his veracity his many wounds and his torn clothes. He does not criminate
                  Philip, but apostrophizes the whole of the lawless troop as a "cowardly, guzzling
                  set of murdering swash-bucklers and bullies."

                     CONGREVE'S MOURNING BRIDE.
                  
               
               THIS day Brad is determined that he will wed pretty Meg despite all obstacles and
                  remonstrances; and told his father so the previous day. Shem wanted at least six
                  months to elapse before the ceremony should take place, but the impetuous Brad has
                  overruled all his objections on the score of ill-timed gayety and frolicking by
                  promising to have the momentous affair conducted with quietness and very little
                  merry-making.
               Shem is in the lodge conferring with Debbie anent the wedding tocher which the
                  young people are to have. Says Debbie: "I mun gie the lad what I can, for he'll
                  have none too many o'this world's goods to begin life on! Let me see. Ye say,
                  Shem, that he is to have thy post o'head falconer? That's summut, to be sure!"
               "Ay, lass. It's more than I began the world on. D'ye recollect, Debbie, we wed on
                  five shillin's, a bedstead wi'out coverings, an' a cradle, wi' m'appen a few pots
                  an' pans, an' we have got along well enough. Brad is a defty, clever lad, an'
                  he'll manage a'reet I doubt not."
               Debbie replies, "Ay, ay; he'll do reet, never fret; he was allus a steady-like
                  lad."
               
               As Shem must have his little growl, he answers, "Little thanks to ye, Debbie, for
                  keeping him steady. If I had not been about to keep him in bit order, I'd not like
                  to think what might hae come of him wi' a' they easiful an' saft ways wi' him.
                  It's a wonder that he has na come to harm afore this!"
               She replies good-humoredly, but with a slight flush, "Out on ye, Shem!" Ye knaw
                  better than that."
               "Weel, Debbie," he returns, "we'll not quarrel about him; get yersen ready, an'
                  we'll trudge to t'chapel."
               At this juncture Brad enters with a sorrowful mien, and eyes welling with
                  restrained tears. Debbie looks keenly at him as she asks, "What now? Who's been
                  crossin ye? Ye look like a draggled hen."
               "Ay! speak out, Brad; what's the matter?" chimes in Shem, and taking a seat, he
                  begins to nurse his leg while he waits for an explanation of Brad's sudden change
                  from his previous blithesomeness to his present dispirited appearance.
               "She says she winna be wedded!" bursts out from Brad with a noise of something
                  between a sob and a sigh.
               "Winna wed! What does the jade mean!" Shem echoes. "Winna wed! Ye willing! What
                  tom-foolery is this?"
               Thus gently questioned, Brad tells his piteous tale to his sympathizing
                  hearers.
               It seems that Dame Busbie, who was nurse to the old lord, had told Brad when he
                  called on her to make the final preparations, that Meg should not be married to
                  him until this day three months on account of my lord's recent death. In vain has
                  he promised that the wedding should be conducted very quietly, and has even
                  declared that he would allow no dancing or singing. All was useless. The old dame
                  was obdurate, and Brad was forced to return home almost broken-hearted at this
                  second cruel stroke of fate.
               "Go ye to Dame Busbie, and try to persuade her, Dad," cries Debbie. "Ye can do
                  more wi' her than anyone else hereabouts;" and she finishes in ireful accents:
                  "Mak' t' ould fool do as Brad wishes!"
               Shem grumbles, but acquiesces, and crushing his forest-cap hard down on his head,
                  he starts for Meg's abode, which is about ten minutes' walk from the lodge.
               Brad awaits his return with burning impatience, and yet dreads it, lest he too may
                  be unsuccessful. This idea he endeavors to ignore altogether, but it will persist
                  in cropping up again and again, turning him almost crazy, for he dearly loves the
                  girl, and would give the whole world besides to call her his wife. Debbie fusses
                  about arranging and disarranging Shem's hunting gear and his fishing tackle with a
                  recklessness which is almost appalling, considering Shem's irascibility and his
                  dread of any one meddling with his affairs.
               At last Shem's tread is heard, Brad turns pale, and Debbie stands stock still with
                  her lips firmly closed, and her eyes fixed on Brad. Shem enters slowly, seats
                  himself in silence, removes his cap, lays one knee gravely over the other, and
                  finally, with many prefatory admonitions to Brad anent the folly of being in a
                  hurry, says: "I went there, and after a bit talk o' the weather wi' t' dame, I
                  hinted what we wanted." At this important part of the recital, he gives a pitcher
                  to Brad, and orders him to go down into the vault and to fill it with the best
                  October. Brad obeys and returns with a marvellous quickness. Shem's eyes twinkle
                  as he notices his impatience, and he resumes his story, "After I plagued her a bit
                  aboot it, she said that ye might wed one anither if—" Here he stops to drink a
                  draught of the bubbling ale. "If there is not too much merry-makin' or noise."
               Brad, leaping to his feet, gives a view-halloo which makes the old rafters ring
                  again, and he proceeds to hug first the
                  stolid Shem, and then his more impressionable mother, who is so happy that she
                  must needs cry to relieve her feelings.
               I will not inflict a description of the wedding on you, but merely mention that
                  everything passed off pleasantly, and that Brad received the post of head falconer
                  from his father with proper thankfulness for the gift.
               Brad and Meg are standing together to the right of the chapel and are conversing
                  in the strain usual under such circumstances, when they are suddenly startled by
                  the deep, harsh tones of Maldran Gudru, and find him close beside them.
               "Mistress Meg," he says, "may the moon look down wi' a lucky light, on your pretty
                  face to-night, an' on yours too, Master Brad. Could ye give the poor gypsy a few
                  pennies to drink to the health o' the first born?"
               Meg blushes, and is so indignant at the man's impudence that she scarcely knows
                  whether she is standing on her head or her heels; pulling out her little
                  silk-netted purse, however, she gives him a couple of pennies, which gratuity Brad
                  generously doubles; whereupon he invokes the blessings of the moon and all the
                  starry host upon them, and turns to go, but stops again and inquires: "Master
                  Brad, did his lordship leave a message for the queen wi' any o' ye afore he
                  died?"
               Brad and Meg both answer negatively, and Maldran walks away in the direction of
                  the camp.
               As the happy couple no doubt prefer silence and their own company to ours, we will
                  now turn our attention to Maldran and his proceedings. He taps at the queen's
                  door, and enters with a lazy air. She is lying in her old place, and she looks at
                  him inquiringly with her black, eloquent eyes. Maldran scowls as he replies, "He
                  died wi'out sayin' a word about ye, either by word o' mouth or by way o'
                  writin'."
               A frown furrows her olive brow, and her full red lips press close together as she
                  replies, "So be it. When he struck me for daring to shame him for her sake, I told
                  him that it would take a thousand pounds of his gold to clear his mark from my
                  cheek! gold for her who starves in London. Maldran, hear my oath;" rising from her
                  lounge she stands erect, and utters in low, vindictive accents: "I swear, on my
                  royal oath, that his son shall suffer for his father's sins—unless he pays me my
                  demand!"
               Maldran bows his head as she draws from her breast the symbol of the gypsies'
                  religion, which she kisses, as does Maldran also.
               "You can go," she says, and Maldran leaves the room.
               "Poor Mistress Nelly little thought that her kindness to me when I was a wee
                  bairn, who thought of nothing but the pretty flowers and the wild forest, would be
                  recollected these many years; but my memory for a kind word and a cruel one has
                  ever been good. A favor done me or an insult given me, I ne'er forget. When I
                  think that he was her ruin, and think too of her being a starved, pointed-at
                  outcast in London, my blood boils, and I feel wicked enough to kill him." She
                  lifts her hand and passes it gently over a small cicatrice on her cheek which mars
                  the beauty of its smoothness. "His son shall rue that day, and his soul will
                  writhe as it feels my vengeance on his darling;" and the fiery, vengeful girl
                  grits her teeth in very anger. Her naturally violent temper is rendered still more
                  ungovernable by the power which she wields as queen of her tawny band. In moments
                  of great excitement she is subject to fearful paroxysms of rage, which almost tear
                  her frame asunder, and then woe to the follower who crosses her will or disobeys
                  her slightest command. "I would forego my revenge," she continues, "to make her
                     comfortable!— I'll send a message to
                  the young lord. If he obeys my commands, I'll forgive the past;" sounding her
                  whistle, Maldran enters.
               "Maldran, go to London at once! Find the young lord and give him this message;"
                  she makes known to him the details with which we are already acquainted. "If he
                  agrees, take the money to this house." She hands him a piece of dirty, greasy
                  paper whereon are the words Nelly Valentin and also her address. "Tell her that it
                  is from a friend, but mention no names. If his lordship refuses my offer, return
                  at once." Dismissing him with an imperious gesture, she closes her eyes.

                              Hold any conversation, in the forum
                              Or in the street. The manners of this age
                              I know bad men would fain corrupt the good,

                     PLANTER'S TREASURE. II. II.
                  
               
               GENERAL HOLMES, who has taken up his quarters with Philip for the present, is in
                  the front parlor of the house, looking out of the window, and watching the
                  numerous passers-by. He looks on with an amused air at the strained gestures and
                  dandified grace of Sir Welle Kneebend as he pays his devoirs to his fair
                  companion, and loads her with euphuistic compliments and honeyed speeches.
               "Pardie, fair Mistress Allstile! Believe me when I tell you that you are the Venus
                  of my thoughts, the Aphrodité of my dreams, and if Cupid will tip his shafts in
                  the fire of your eyes, can I help it if they rankle in my heart?"
               She favors him with a pleasant smile as she replies, "As I am virtuous, sir, you
                  are pleased to flatter me today." And she manœuvres her fan with the most
                  dangerous adroitness, artfully leading him on to give her more of his newest
                  compliments and well-turned periods.
               The general is interrupted in his observations of London don life, as compared to his own quiet home, by a
                  pair of little, soft hands which clasp tightly over his eyes, while a pair of
                  fragrant, dewy lips press his scarred and bearded cheek.
               "Good-day, father mine. Truly, I think yon pretty girl, who trips so lightly on
                  the pave, must have bewitched you. I made noise enough when I entered, but you
                  never even turned your head!"
               "I was thinking about something, Margery, and I became too absorbed to pay
                  attention to anything else, I suppose."
               Pushing a low stool close to his feet, she sits down on it, and rests her chin on
                  his knee, while her eyes look up to his face; they have lost the old look of
                  perfect happiness which once glowed in them and diffused its light over her.
               "Well, father," she begins, "you desired to have a long talk with me to-day. I am
                  all ready now, so pray proceed!" and a saucy look sparkles for a moment in her
                  eyes. She adds, by way of parenthesis, "I do trust that there is nothing
                  disagreeable coming?"
               "Daughter," he replies, gravely, "I know that the topic will be disagreeable to
                  you; but it is one which must be faced sooner or later; therefore, the sooner the
                  better. Never let the enemy flank you when you can attack him in front!—a good
                  maxim, my dear!" He coughs once or twice to clear his throat, and resumes: "It is
                  about Philip that I would speak, hinny!" At these words she buries her face in her
                  hands, and is very silent. "I have observed a sad change in his demeanor toward
                  you of late. He has not only grown indifferent and careless, but he has often
                  treated you with a cutting cruelty which I will not allow!" Margery shakes her
                  head in denial, but will not raise her face. "His conduct has become the talk of
                  London, and it is confidently reported that he is one of the ringleaders of the
                  Mohocks—a vile rabble who cut, maim, and insult whom they wish in perfect
                  security. It is a well-known fact that his losses at the gaming table are immense,
                  which losses necessitate his raising money among the Jews who invariably get cent
                  per cent. If he persists in this course, or continues to neglect you any longer
                  than this week—back to Bucks you shall go!" He notes how her fingers press tightly
                  against her temples, and his heart yearns for her. Altering his tone of command
                  for one of entreaty, he adds, "You will do as I wish, hinny?"
               She shivers slightly, but no answer comes from her, and he feels the hand which
                  touches his own grow cold and deathlike. He raises her head, and to his great
                  alarm sees that she is lifeless and still. "Peggy! ho, Peggy!" he calls in loud
                  tones, but before the servant can enter, my lady herself sweeps in and cries:
                  "Heavens, General! What is the matter? What ails Margery? What have you done to
                  her? As I live the poor thing has fainted!"
               In answer to her questions, he replies distractedly: "I believe I have killed her!
                  I told her that if Philip did not in future treat her more like a wife and less
                  like a quean, she must go back again to Holme Grange. Look at her! His conduct has
                  made her grow thin and pale, and I know that if he continues his brutal treatment
                  of her much longer, it will not be long ere I shall lose my darling. The thought
                  almost crazes me!"
               Lady Wharton, turning pale, falls into a chair close by her, and cries in stifled
                  accents which seem wrung from her heart, "Philip, Philip! she will not be the only
                  victim," she adds abruptly, "General, I love Philip more than myself, far more,
                  and you can understand my feelings when I can tell you that I think that your
                  advice to poor Margery is good! Philip—my tongue almost palsies as I say so—is already worse than half the
                  rufflers in town. I have had spies who have informed me of his movements—of his
                  disgraceful intrigues and insolent demeanor to high and low; and I have listened
                  to their accounts with an aching heart. Time and again I have tried to reclaim
                  him; but he invariably repulses me with a ribald jest or an impious execration. O
                  God! it cannot be long ere I am laid with my husband."
               The General's eyes flash as he listens to a mother's detail of her son's crimes
                  and blasphemies; and he exclaims sternly, "Put him under the control of some one
                  who can master him. Send him away from London and its associations. While he is
                  amid such a crew as the Mohocks, he can never come to anything creditable either
                  to himself or us."
               She replies in a firm voice, "Thank you for the suggestion, General; he shall
                  go!"
               Holmes, satisfied that she will follow his advice, rejoices accordingly, and
                  replies, "When Philip returns, I will tell him of my purpose, and see what effect
                  it has on him!"
               Margery has recovered from her swoon, and she weeps silently. Poor child! she is
                  too heart-sick and wearied to offer any opposition to her father's words. Suddenly
                  she raises her head as though she hears a well-known foot approaching, and looking
                  alternately at her father and Lady Wharton, she gasps, "Philip! he is coming!" The
                  door is thrown open with a crash, and Philip enters. His clothes are all awry, and
                  his tangled curls hang in matted bunches on his torn and rumpled collar; one of
                  his shoes lacks its buckle, and the plumes of his hat are broken and muddy. He
                  looks sullen and haggard, but an amused smile flits across his face as he
                  exclaims, "Que le Diable! here 's a pretty spectacle for a gentlemen to view. Let
                  me cast you, i' faith!" he begins in a drawling voice: "Scene first. Room in my
                  own house. Characters: General Surlysides—stern and angry. Mistress Prettypouts,
                  his daughter—tearful but shrewish! Umph! My Lady of the Goodson—imperious, but
                  weakminded; and last, though not least: Philip, her model son—good-natured and
                  obliging, but ill-used by the other characters. Umph! Time uncertain. Draw up the
                  curtain! The prompter's bell has tinkled." Taking a chair, he twirls it around two
                  or three times, and finally seats himself on it, with his face to its back, which
                  is the approved fashion at the Highway, an inn of unenviable notoriety as the
                  resort of thieves, gamblers, and rooks.
               Holmes, giving Margery in charge of her ladyship, desires her to leave him to deal
                  with Philip alone, to which she accedes, and they leave the room without a glance
                  at Philip, who looks on with a smile on his lips and a sneer in his eye.
                  "Hoity-toity" he exclaims, and turns his attention to Holmes, who says in a stern
                  manner, "My lord, it is high time that we arrive at a mutual understanding. Of
                  late your conduct to my daughter has been such as I will not brook. You treat her
                  as though she were your light-o'-love, and not your innocent, loving wife. I have
                  heard of your brave deeds in Drury and the Strand, and also of your reckless
                  gaming and your profligacy, which must in time lead you to destruction and ruin.
                  Where are all your nights passed? I doubt not that you would be ashamed to tell me
                  where you spent last night?"
               He is interrupted by a flourish of Philip's hand as he rises, and says, in a cool,
                  irritating manner: "Hark ye, General! your most monstrous curiosity shall be
                  gratified. Last night I passed in a mighty pleasant manner at Dollie Hawke's.
                  Various gentlemen and myself honored her house with our presence. We played
                  several games at whist, and s'blood, I
                  regret to say I lost a few hundred guineas. After that we walked Drury and Newgate
                  till we were tired. After—but you have had enough, General, eh?" and he laughs
                  heartily.
               Holmes replies, "My lord, you are not fit to have charge of my daughter. I shall
                  take her back to Holme Grange, and there she shall remain until I hear better
                  accounts of you than at present! Good-morning." And he leaves Philip to think over
                  the turn which affairs have taken.
               Now the door opens again, and his mother enters. Whistling a prolonged note, he
                  runs his fingers through his hair. "Egad!" he exclaims; "another battery to open
                  fire."
               "Philip," says her ladyship, in a voice which compels his attention, "what I
                  purpose saying to you, and why I say it, require no explanation, nor need you
                  offer any resistance to my wishes; for you must do as I desire you.
                  Ere this week is out you will be under the charge of a tutor who will take you
                  abroad in order to teach you to be a gentleman, a Whig, and a Protestant. You have
                  ample time to make all your preparations in the three days which are allowed you
                  ere your departure. Do you understand me?"
               "Yes, I think I do," he replies, awed by her determined manner and the steady look
                  which she concentrates on his face. "You are rather peremptory, but what can I do?
                     che sarà sarà."
               Surprised at her easy victory, she goes to him and kisses him with a renewed
                  confidence in his nature, and she leaves the room with a pleased expression on her
                  face.
               "Scylla and Charybdis without a choice. At one blow I lose Margery, and am sent
                  abroad with, most probably, a long-haired, prick-eared, shambling pedant, of whose
                  didactic propensities I shall have the advantage. At any rate, the rose of my
                  thorns is that I can get to the place where England's anointed king lies perdu,"
                  and he strikes up in a low key— 
                     "The king shall hae his ain again!"
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Queen.—
                           "I know your projects and your close cabals."
                        
                     
                     THE EARL OF ESSEX, I. I.
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           King.—
                           "O, Gormaz! O, Alvarez! stop not here."
                        
                     
                     XIMENA, I. I.
                  
               
               THE chevalier had received Earl Mar at Fetteresso with great kindness and
                  affability, and had then taken up his march to the royal palace of Scone. There he
                  expected to find a large and well-disciplined army; instead, he saw crowds of
                  unarmed vagabonds who were rioting and drinking with a sublime indifference to the
                  orders which had been circulated among them. James's soul was not big enough to
                  encounter such a grievous disappointment, and he re-embarked at Montrose,
                  dispirited and hopeless. He landed at Gravelines after a short voyage, and thence
                  he travelled to Saint Germains.
               He was tall and slimly built; his countenance was tinged with a gloomy cast, and
                  the Stuart frown was oft bristling in his brows. His presence was imposing and
                  kinglike, but his lack of energy, his vacillating mind, and his distrustful nature
                  belied his looks. The outside white marble and fair to the view—the inside
                  corruption and decay.
               His first step was most unwise and impolitic, and surprised at once friends and
                  enemies. Even his sympathizing half-brother, the Duke of Berwick, admitted that
                  "he must have lost his reason to dismiss the only Englishman he had that was able
                  to manage his affairs;" and he spoke highly of his able management and his astute
                  policy in directing matters. The dismissal of Bolingbroke, which occurred about a
                  year after his disgrace at the Hanoverian court, was occasioned partly by his
                  incautiousness in speaking of state secrets and his irreverent fashion of
                  ridiculing the grand pretensions of the miniature court, and partly by other
                  indiscretions. At any rate, he was deposed from his office, and the seals were
                  transferred to the gallant Earl of Mar.
               James then proceeded to Avignon, where he held his court hard by the Palace of the
                  Popes—a sombre Gothic pile of the twelfth century, which was raised high upon the
                  bold rock of Doms. In one of its dripping dungeons, deep down in the solid rock
                  and dark as Erebus, was once immured the Roman Tribune, great Rienzi. It was in
                  Avignon, the favored, also that Petrarca first saw that Laura of Noves, who is as
                  real to our senses as though she stood before us now.
               Bolingbroke was intensely piqued at his disgrace, and he at once renounced all
                  connection with the Jacobite cause, and, it is affirmed, made overtures to my Lord
                  Stair for a pardon. To the Queen-mother, who had circumspectly sent him a kindly
                  letter to inform him that "his dismissal had taken place without her knowledge and
                  consent," his answer was prompt and curt: "I am now a free man, and may my arm rot
                  off if ever I draw sword or pen again for your son!" Thus the chevalier created a
                  new and powerful enemy at a time when he was in the direst need of friends.
               In England the leaders of this ill-omened rebellion reaped to the utmost their
                  reward for their attachment to the Pretender. Many minor officers underwent a
                  short court-martial and were summarily shot; whilst the more prominent were
                  escorted to London with fifes and drums playing a "triumphal march" to grace their
                  "public entry." They were all tied with their arms behind their backs, not even excepting Forster, the
                  Parliament member—a stern, cold man, whose face was granite, and who held his back
                  as stiff as steel as he scowled on the yelling crowd who pelted him with eggs,
                  apples, and dead cats, after the chivalrous custom of the mob at all times. In the
                  House of Lords were impeached the Earl of Derwentwater, first cousin to the
                  Pretender and a Roman Catholic, either of which circumstances was enough to behead
                  him during the fearful excitement which prevailed in London; and the Earls of
                  Nithisdale and Carnwath, both of whom narrowly escaped the axe; and various other
                  nobles with whom history has more to do than romance.
               In the Commons some of the staunchest Whigs inclined their ear to mercy, and
                  regretted the necessity of robbing England of her noble families; but Sir Richard
                  Steele, who had risen and moved some milder measures than the rope or the axe, was
                  violently attacked by Walpole, who cut about in such a slashing style that
                  "Literary Dick" almost swooned to find what a villain he had been—almost an
                  abettor of rebels and parricides! Walpole saw the necessity for a terrible
                  example, and he was merciless, determined that the disaffected should be taught an
                  example which would never be forgotten.
               
               Philip slowly saunters down Pall Mall, dressed in a suit which makes many a
                  dandy's heart fill with envy as he ruffles by, scented, curled, and pomatumed. In
                  his right hand he carries a thin malacca switch or whip whose head is of gold and
                  incrusted with diamonds. With it he gingerly taps a little girl who carries a
                  bundle of clothes which have just undergone the laundress' operation of cleansing,
                  signing her out of his way with a condescension which is simply overpowering.
               As he arrives in front of that resort of wits, fools, and quidnuncs, the Smyrna
                  Coffee House, he halts at the door for a short time, takes his snuff-box from the
                  pocket of his azure satin waistcoat, opens its jewelled lid with a twist which
                  excites the admiration of the bystanders, and delicately titillates his nose with
                  the aromatic powder—taking especial care, by the way, that a few grains shall fall
                  on his snowy lace bosom. Entering with an easy grace, he lays a guinea on the bar,
                  and entirely waives his claim to any change, while he looks around at the various
                  idlers who lounge at the bar or sit in groups at the tables. "Ah! Swift, how d' ye
                  do?" and he nods across the room to the Dean, who is drinking coffee with Mat
                  Prior at the centre table, which is reserved exclusively for distinguished
                  guests.
               "Ah! Wharton, how d'ye do?" Swift irascibly retorts; he is nettled at his rather
                  insolent bearing and the apparent condescension of his manner.
               Philip, walking up to the table, extends his snuffbox, which favor the Dean
                  reciprocates, and after the delicate operation of inhaling it is accomplished,
                  Swift says, "My lord, I hear that you are to be shipped off on your travels
                  shortly. Let me see! what is the name of your future governor?"
               Philip angrily replies, "Governor? Demme, sir, secretary—secretary!"
               "Well, then, secretary," replies the Dean with an ill-concealed smile.
               "To-morrow I set out for Geneva. My secretary's name is Monsieur de Savatte, a
                  right worthy Frencher."
               Swift cries in affected alarm, "Save me! For your mother's sake, I hope that his
                  principles have been Anglicized?"
               A few of the bystanders titter at this remark, for in the time that he has been in
                  London, Philip has contrived to let everybody know how widely different are his
                  views from those of his mother's both
                  as to religion and politics. He feels the thrust, and hears the titter; but he
                  coolly replies, "No, my dear Swift; I understand that he is still too French to
                  believe in the creed of which you are one Christianly expounder; but he is a
                  Calvinist and a loyal gentleman." He turns his back on the Dean as he says this,
                  and facing the group who have clustered near him, he exclaims in a scornful voice,
                  "In what low hole am I that I can see in one lump such a pack of snuffling curs as
                  ye? S'life! but that my sword has been in good blood, I'd e'en have a few
                  passadoes at ye for my amusement!"
               Instantly cries of "Stab him! knock him down! cudgel him!" are heard from those
                  who are more concealed from view. Drawing his rapier, Philip whirls it once above
                  his head, a motion which makes the nearest shrink from him in affright, and he
                  stands on the defensive in expectation of an attack; those who surround him,
                  however, are chiefly men of peace—poetasters, small wits, and literary hacks—and
                  none of them offer to molest him. Looking at them for a moment, he bursts into a
                  hearty laugh, and curses them soundly for a pack of cowards. When he has finished
                  his tirade, he shows his back to them, and sheathes his blade with a vicious snap.
                  What now? Mat Prior springing quickly to Philip's side elevates his thick cane
                  above his head parallel-wise. No sooner has he done this when thwack! falls a
                  heavy cudgel on it with such force as to make the protecting stick flatten
                  Philip's hat over his eyes.
               Directly he turned his back on the titterers, one cowardly fellow aimed a blow at
                  him which would have certainly broken his head if Prior had not diverted its
                  destination, and returned the compliment by levelling the would-be hero to the
                  ground. The landlord now pushes in and swears, if order is not restored, that he
                  will give the alarm and have them all arrested.
               Philip thanks Prior for his good service, and asks the favor of a bottle of wine
                  with him, of which he also invites Swift to partake; but the worthy Dean declines,
                  and pleading an engagement in St. James' Park, he leaves them to discuss it
                  alone.
               "It was a lucky ward-off which saved my skull that time, Mr. Prior! Allow me:
                  'Your health and success.'" And the glasses clink together before they are
                  emptied.
               "Thanks, my lord," replies Prior. "You spoke of going abroad. Do you design
                  travelling in France at all?"
               "Very probably I shall. I should like to see Paris vastly well."
               "Avignon is not far from there?" adds Prior, in a low voice.
               "Well, even Avignon has its sights," replies Philip with a smile, which his
                  companion returns. "How is it with yourself and the government now, Mr. Prior? All
                  quarrels settled?"
               "Yes, my lord, and I am thankful for it. My long confinement seriously impaired my
                  health." He refers to the two years during which he was kept a prisoner in his own
                  house.
               "S'life!" replies Philip, "I'd have run away long before two years expired or a
                  week either, or else I'd have fired my prison. But I must leave you! Bye-bye! I am
                  off for the park and a bit of fresh air." And paying his bill, he goes out.
               He has not strolled along very far when he encounters his friend, Sir Harry
                  Hautefort, whose arm he takes and they walk off together: ogling the fair dames as
                  they pass, or criticizing the dresses of the fops and cavaliers. Sir Harry unluckily steps on a loose stone just as
                  a glistening beau is passing him, and the mud spirts in a dirty stream on his pink
                  silk stockings. The injured cavalier, laying his hand threateningly on his rapier,
                  scowls at the author of his misfortune, but pursues his way in silence, while
                  Philip recites, in a tone loud enough to be heard a dozen yards off, the following
                  consoling couplet:— 
                     
                        "Oh, bear me to the paths of fair Pall Mall;
                        Safe are thy pavements; grateful is thy smell!
                     
                   Those who have seen the occurrence enjoy a laugh at the expense of the
                  spattered gentleman, who, however, does not deign to notice Philip's audacity in
                  thus making him a public jest.
               "Faith!" says Sir Harry, "if I had been in his position, and he in mine, it is my
                  calm opinion that he would have received a kicking for his carelessness."
               Philip laughing, and directing his attention to a couple of well-known Whig
                  noblemen who are conversing together a short distance from them, says, "Harry,
                  drop a few yards behind me, and mark the row I'll raise in St. James!"
               Accordingly, Sir Harry lags behind, while Philip advances to within a few feet of
                  the gentlemen whom he had pointed out, and with a few prefatory flourishes he
                  begins to sing in a loud voice:— 
                     The king shall hae his ain again
                  
               
               All stop and turn in surprise as they hear this treasonous refrain sung in broad
                  day, and in the most frequented part of the park. Still Philip continues his song,
                  while the bewildered Whigs look with horror on the daring gallant who thus openly
                  defies them.
               Sir Harry takes himself off as soon as he sees how matters are going, and he is
                  now ensconced behind a tree at some distance from Philip. The crowd is rapidly
                  thickening, still Philip is unmolested, and still his song is heard. But now cries
                  of "Papist! traitor I rebel!" begin to sound from some of the angry spectators.
                  Suddenly the crowd opens and falls back, and the guard appears. Their captain
                  walking straight to Philip, demands his sword, and informs him that he is under
                  arrest. Philip stopping his song, exclaims, "My sword? You'll get it in your
                  vitals if you interrupt me again!" and making a grasp at its hilt, he attempts to
                  draw it; but the officer, striking his hand, knocks off Philip's grip, and drawing
                  it out himself, he commands his men to "lay hold of the prisoner." Philip, seeing
                  the utter futility of resistance, spitefully finishes his song, and says, half to
                  himself and half to the officer of the guard— 
                     
                        "The Earl he drew out half his sword;
                        The guard drew out the rest!"
                     
                   Luckily for him, the justice before whom he is taken happens to be Jacobitish
                  in his principles, and has a predilection for the bonnie king who never got his
                  own again; so that he is merely reprimanded and mulcted in the sum of five guineas
                  for creating a public disturbance and then discharged, neither a wiser nor a
                  happier man, but with an idea that home is the right place to favor with his
                  presence after his late wise actions.
               No sooner has he entered than her ladyship desires his attendance in the
                  drawing-room, and thither he goes. The occupants are my lady and a tall,
                  cadaverous, pedantic-looking man, whose lantern jaws give an unnatural length to
                  his pinched face. His rusty, cropped wig is pulled down too much in front, for it
                  nearly covers his bushy eyebrows; his dress is faded and sombre, and it has scarce
                  an inch of lace or edging on it from his collar to his square-toed shoes.
                  Poverty-stricken learning ing betrays
                  its presence in his every motion or gesture, in every seam and band about him.
                  Philip's first thoughts are, "This must be Monsieur de Savatte. S'life! what a
                  scarecrow! I shall have to dress him decently before I'll be seen with him in
                  public. What an air of Calvinistic morality incrusts his antique person! Even his
                  buttons are precise and formal, and his shoes are actually devoid of buckles!
                  'Sooth, I have an aversion to the man already."
               Her ladyship introduces this personage to Philip as his future governor, with many
                  commendations of his learning and research, which he acknowledges by a stiff bow.
                  Philip shakes hands with M. de Savatte, and says, in incisive accents, "Monsieur
                  de Savatte, I wish you to distinctly understand that in future you are in my
                  employ as private secretary, not as governor. I object to the latter title
                  decidedly."
               M. de Savatte replies, with a gesture of surprise, "My lord, may I ask why the
                  worthy title of governor is obnoxious to you?"
               Philip says blandly, "Of course, I object on the score of veracity. The title
                  governor would be an untruth, for you will never govern me, though you may advise
                  me."
               M. de Savatte extends his hands in amazement at hearing such rebellious words from
                  his future pupil, and turns to his mother with a look of inquiry. Greatly
                  mortified at Philip's words, she forces a smile as she replies, "Philip often says
                  more than he means; he does—"
               But Philip ruins her palliative by saying, "In this case, though, I said less than
                  I meant, Monsieur!"
               A lackey entering at this instant, hands a letter to Philip, who, bowing
                  apologetically to my lady and M. de Savatte, goes to the window to read it. He
                  looks perplexed and mystified, as though he cannot comprehend the meaning of the
                  letter. Finally he throws open the window, and calls down to the man, who awaits
                  his answer, "Here, fellow, take your precious scrawl back to your mistress, and
                  tell her that I never honor dead men's drafts. Leave, now, and never trouble me
                  again about matters of which I am as ignorant as the king himself!" So saying, he
                  throws the letter out of the window, and once more addresses himself to his future
                  tutor. "We start to-morrow, I suppose. Where is our first stopping place? Paris,
                  or Geneva, or where?"
               M. de Savatte replies, with a stiff jerk of his body, "Geneva was mentioned by her
                  ladyship as the best place for the instillation of the right principles into your
                  mind!"
               "Ah!" Philip adds with an incredulous look.
               My lady, who begins to fear that Philip's insolence may create difficulties which
                  will be hard to adjust if the conversation is prolonged, now bows the learned man
                  out, with an injunction to be all ready by the morrow, to which he replies, "I
                  have only to pack a few books—my classics and metaphysics, and then I am
                  ready."
               As the door closes after him, Philip begins to criticize his looks and his speech;
                  but his mother, good-naturedly defending, beseeches her son to pay great attention
                  to M. de Savatte's teachings, and to profit by his learning.
               "Rely on me," he replies with a sudden twinge of conscience: "Hereafter I'll try
                  to be less rackety in my actions. I fear that I have been the cause of many a sad
                  day and night with you!"
               She replies: "My son, I cannot deny it; but if you will conduct yourself better in
                  future, you will be the cause of more happiness to me than ever you have been
                  misery."
               
               Philip kisses her affectionately, and a pang of remorse touches him as he sees how
                  wan and worn she looks. Poor woman! as she kissed her darling "good-bye," the next
                  day, she was heavy at heart, and felt an indistinct foreboding that she would
                  never see him again.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Chremylus.—
                           
                              Phœbus protect us! Gracious deities!
                              Why, what the mischief has this fellow met with?
                           
                        
                        
                           Chremylus.—
                           Hey day! whom have we here?
                        
                     
                     ARISTOPHANES' "PLUTUS."
                  
               
               PHILIP and M. de Savatte land in safety after an uneventful voyage, during which
                  Philip's conduct has been most exemplary, and has agreeably surprised his
                  governor, who thought he had caught a tartar when he saw him for the first time;
                  and in the letter which he wrote to Lady Wharton, the tutor gave her a glowing
                  account of her son's actions.
               They do not tarry long in any of the towns or principalities through which they
                  pass, except in a small electorate on the road to Hanover, where Philip insists on
                  stopping for a whole day despite the remonstrances of M. de Savatte. He has seen a
                  pretty German flower-girl pass before the window of his room, and has at once
                  taken a violent fancy for her; he replies to his impatient governor, "Monsieur,
                  she is lovely, divine! I must see her again even if it is only for five minutes!
                  Such a sensation as admiration is not to be sneered at, sir, in my blasé condition."
               "Eh bien, my lord! as you wish; but the sooner
                  that we arrive at Geneva, the better."
               Philip finally agrees not to remain here longer than to-day, whether or no he sees
                  the flower-girl again. He occupies his time in going to court and raising a
                     flutter among the punctilious
                  princelings and the court dames who are all agog to see the son of the great
                  English nobleman, whose reputation has extended even to this dull region. He is
                  feted, caressed, and—greatest honor of all—decorated with an order of knighthood,
                  which he is assured by the courtiers will insure him respect in any quarter of the
                  globe, to which modest assertion he replies, "My lords, I do not value the ribbon
                  the worth of a groat on that account. My name is a warranty of respect, as you all
                  know;" and he feels a trifle offended; nevertheless, he is quite proud of his
                  decoration, and wears it in a prominent place on his waistcoat lapel.
               Philip does not find his flower-girl, however, as he has forgotten all about her
                  by the following morning; M. de Savatte does not recall her to his memory, and
                  they set out for Hanover, "England's royal nursery," arriving in the capital safe
                  and sound. For two or three days they stop at the best hotel which the town
                  boasts, when they receive an invitation from a German nobleman, who places his
                  house at the disposal of the young lord. Philip accepts the invitation, and he and
                  M. de Savatte are now the guests of Count von Erschlief.
               Philip and his host are together in a bright, sunny room, which faces the Platze,
                  whose linden trees are agreeable to the eye and fragrant to the smell. In guttural
                  German, Von Erschlief questions, "How are politics in England, my lord? The mails
                  are so irregular that I am often behindhand with outside news?"
               In his own estimation, the count is a great politician—skilful, sapient, and
                  shrewd, but in truth he is as dunderheaded a German as ever waded through musty
                  tomes of metaphysics or dabbled in abstruse philosophies. He is short and stout,
                  and his fat cheeks fall in unctuous layers from his lacklustre eyes to his neck.
                  M. de Savatte vatte is in the back part of the room, where stands a small library
                  of books and MSS., and he is so absorbed with its treasures that he ignores
                  everything else.
               "My dear count," replies Philip with a mischievous look, "I am rather ignorant of
                  affairs in England at present myself; but it is confidently reported that Madame
                  Robethon is in high favor with his majesty, and moreover that she has turned high
                  Tory, i'faith!"
               The count stares at him in surprise, and, after a moment's silence, he splutters
                  out, "Mein Gott! is it so? This is news indeed!" To which Philip nods
                  affirmatively, with a countenance of regretful solemnity and a deep sigh.
               To fully understand the ridiculous nature of Philip's assertion, it is necessary
                  to know that Madame Robethon is a Hanoverian lady of low rank, who has a body so
                  squat and a voice so disagreeably coarse and croaking, that she has been
                  christened at court by the cognomen of Madame Grenouille.*
                   Her principles are Whig to a proverb. Taking his departure, after the
                  above astounding intelligence, Philip leaves the count in a most unenviable state
                  of mind on account of the vexatious aspect of affairs in London.
               
                  
                  *Frog.
               
               M. de Savatte has remained so absorbed in the treasures he has found, as to miss
                  entirely the conversation which has taken place at the other end of the room.
                  Philip looks towards him and smiles at his rapt gesticulations. The tutor is
                  grasping in both hands an immense vellum-bound folio, which is protected at the
                  corners with wide strips of tarnished brass; he has not taken the trouble to go to
                  the table and lay it there for easy inspection, but he has placed his right foot
                  on his left knee, thereby forming a projection on which the folio reclines, and
                     he cranes his neck in a painful
                  manner in order to peruse the top lines. His countenance is serious and earnest.
                  "Right, right," he exclaims; "Cato in his time knew of three kinds of myrtle—to
                  wit, the white, the black, and the Conjugala, so called haply of wedlock or
                  marriage, and peradventure it may!" Philip leaning over to see what it is that
                  interests him so much, reads on the top line, the title: "Plinie's Naturall
                  Historie."
               "Parbleu, Monsieur! Plinie seems to engage both your eyes and ears. I have
                  romanced most wonderfully for the last half hour, and have not been once
                  corrected!"
               The studious pedant raises his head in bewilderment, blushes and apologizes: "My
                  lord, pardon my rudeness, I pray you. I was so interested that I recked not of
                  time or place!"
               "All right," Philip carelessly replies; "I feel as though I should enjoy a
                  promenade to-day. The weather is glorious. Will you accompany me?"
               The tutor replies, "My lord, your wishes are my commands!"
               "Provided the wishes are of the right sort!" adds Philip.
               Monsieur pays no attention to this remark, but launches at once into enthusiastic
                  praise of Pliny and his works, proceeding in learned jargon to explain his system
                  until Philip impatiently tells him to drop the subject and walk out with him.
               Whilst they are out, Philip casts his eye on a fine English stallion, whose coat
                  is as glossy and smooth as satin and as black as ebony. The rider bestrides the
                  horse with the ease and grace of a practised horseman, extorting an exclamation of
                  pleasure from Philip, who appreciates his thorough command over the animal.
                  Regardless of his total ignorance of the equestrian, Philip advances towards him
                  and raises his hat, a salutation tation which the rider returns, at the same time
                  checking his horse.
               "I beg a thousand pardons, sir, for this intrusion," says Philip; "I am Lord
                  Wharton of Rathfarnham and Catherlough."
               "And I, my lord," replies the stranger, "am Sir Geoffrey Mountairy."
               Philip resumes in an abrupt manner, "Sir Geoffrey, I have a desire to purchase
                  your horse. It pleases me mightily. Will you sell it?"
               "Really, my lord," Sir Geoffrey replies, taken aback at the strange proposal, but,
                  as he is rather reduced in circumstances at present, willing to dispose of the
                  animal if a good price were offered; "hitherto the desire has never entered my
                  mind, nor do I particularly wish to sell him; but if you will promise to treat him
                  well, I may be induced to part with him!"
               Philip hurriedly replies, "I will give you any sum you may deem him worth—five
                  hundred guineas!"
               Sir Geoffrey, rejoicing at the mention of so large a price, closes with the offer
                  at once.
               M. de Savatte in vain argues and expostulates. Philip is deaf to reason, and tells
                  his tutor, with a sprinkling of oaths, "I will have the horse, cost what it may!"
                  and resumes to Sir Geoffrey: "Send him to Count von Erschlief's, and I will give
                  you a draft on London."
               Sir Geoffrey replies that he will go thither at once, if Philip so wishes; to this
                  proposition Philip agrees, and he hurries his angry governor off home again to
                  await the distinguished arrival.
               In due time the stallion comes, and of course, receives its meed of admiration and
                  praise. The count is highly pleased with him, and declares that it is a horse fit
                  for the Czar, an opinion in which Philip concurs.
               Philip is in his room glancing through an abstruse work on the law of nations, which he comprehends as
                  thoroughly, after two or three industrious readings, as an ordinary mind would
                  after a month's hard study; for with a memory wonderfully retentive, he combines
                  reasoning faculties of no common order. Throwing the book from him with a
                  disdainful gesture, he exclaims, "Tut! Savatte told me to devote at least a day to
                  the study of the polemical introduction. Ah, ha! I would wager heavy odds that I
                  already know his theories better than himself! when he—Eh? come in!" he cries in
                  response to a low tap at the door.
               M. de Savatte enters with a lugubrious expression on his dried features. He holds
                  in his hand a letter whose edging is black an inch deep—a sign that death has
                  robbed some one of a friend or a relative. Philip turns a trifle pale as he takes
                  the letter, and when he sees his own quarterings on the black seal, it almost
                  falls through his trembling fingers. M. de Savatte considerately leaving him
                  alone, softly closes the door after his exit. Philip reads a few lines, and his
                  hand crushes the paper with a convulsive grasp.
               "Mother, mother! I am all alone now! O God! Why did you die?"
               His tears patter on the paper thick and fast as he resumes the perusal; "Your
                  property will be taken in charge by trustees appointed as by law. You will be
                  allowed an income of ¥2000 per annum, until you are of age!" "Trustees, eh? cent
                  per centums," he mutters; "a charge of twelve shillings for their care of a
                  guinea!—Mother! mother!" he cries in a savage, bitter manner! "a curse on the fate
                  which robbed me of you! Mother is dead? dead? My head whirls so I cannot
                  comprehend!"
               
               He awakes next morning gloomy and taciturn. M. de Savatte observes his moodiness,
                  and justly ascribes it to the ill news which he has received, for a document has
                  been sent to him from the trustees authorizing him to retain his position as tutor
                  to his lordship. At breakfast few words pass between them, but when Philip has
                  finished he says, in a low voice, "Monsieur, to-day I begin a new course of life.
                  I shall eschew Toryism, and be the Protestant which my—which I ought to have
                  been!"
               Monsieur nods assentingly, and with rather a mystified air, for he has not known
                  Philip's proclivities for Jacobitism and the Scarlet Lady.
               All the morning Philip is obedient and attentive to the instructions of his really
                  talented tutor, but towards evening he becomes the same irrepressible pupil as
                  before, and instead of working out some knotty problem, or construing some
                  difficult passage, laughs the questions away with a clever pun, or an amusingly
                  inappropriate question, causing his troubled tutor a world of thinking to
                  answer.
               Early the following day they depart for Geneva, where Philip is to remain until he
                  shall have completed his education.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXV.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Cleon.—
                           With all speed I fly—
                        
                     
                     SOPHOCLES.
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Cleon.—
                           
                              One word at parting—I have left your service.
                              Who follows me, believe, will prove a knave
                              Still greater than myself.
                           
                        
                     
                     ARISTOPHANES.
                  
               
               PHILIP is far better pleased with his new quarters than he thought he would be. At
                  present he is lazily sauntering through the jeweller's region in company with M.
                  de Savatte, and he examines with great interest the rare workmanship which is
                  displayed in their watches, rings, and bracelets. Gennaro Lemontri's shop he
                  admires most of all, and in return for Gennaro's kindly attention to him during
                  his inspection of the trays of costly gems, Philip purchases three tiny watches,
                  beautifully chased and enamelled, and seven or eight sparkling rings, besides
                  various other knicknacks, amounting, as the bill declares, to 350 guineas and 15
                  shillings, in English money. Gennaro generously throws off the latter item, and
                  Philip, giving him an order for the amount, requests him to send the purchases to
                  his lodgings.
               Philip surveys the rapid torrent of the Rhone, as it dashes under the bridges
                  connecting the several parts of the town, with a vivid appreciation of the beauty
                  of the scene. The glaciers of Chamouni, and Mont Blanc the mighty, fill him with
                  indescribable feelings. M. de Savatte, whose varied knowledge is always useful,
                  regales his charge with romantic stories of the passes of the Tête Noire, and the
                  dangerous foot-paths of the Col du Geant, which lead into beautiful Piedmont: and
                  he thrills him with graphic accounts of the terrible crevasses of the Mer de
                  Glace, that are so deep and green and cold.
               Philip thinks that he would like to live here forever, and he is sure he will
                  never tire of Geneva, asking himself, "Can there be a more beautiful place in all
                  the world than this city of frozen beauties?" He proposes a walk about the
                  environs, to which Monsieur assents; before they have got fairly under way, they
                  are joined by a friend of Philip's—Sir Edgely Warely—with whom he has become
                  acquainted among the riotous crew of the Mohocks, who asks permission to make one
                  of his party, a request which Philip gladly grants.
               Although Sir Edgely has openly professed Whig sentiments in England, he has been
                  viewed with suspicion by that party; indeed, there are some who have not hesitated
                  to insinuate that he maintains a treasonable correspondence with the exiled court,
                  and that he is a disciple of the Scarlet Lady. These charges, however, have never
                  been substantiated, and as he is clever, witty, and handsome, he has always mixed
                  in tolerable society. Mayhap his dexterity with the rapier and his quickness to
                  avenge an insult or a slur, have tended to make questioners or accusers wary in
                  their actions.
               "Are you in Geneva permanently, my lord?"
               "Yes," replies Philip. "This is my resting-place for a year or so."
               "Under favor, my lord, may I ask who is M. de Sav—I really forget his name;"
                  adding, with a laugh, "he looks like an ossified epitome of learning!"
               "Oh! M. de Savatte? He is my secretary!"
               After a short conversation on minor topics, the beauty of the surrounding scenery,
                  and the odd dresses of the Germans, Sir Edgely says carelessly, but with a
                     quick, comprehensive glance at
                  Philip; "Eh! my lord, oranges once more top the gallant oak!"
               Philip replies hotly, "Yes; poor Jamie met a crushing defeat both on the field and
                  in the house, when two such gentlemen as Derwentwater and Kenmure were eased of
                  their heads to delight a pack of gaping curs!"
               A curious, triumphant-like smile lights up his companion's face as he replies,
                  "Ay, my lord. When King James heard the news, he came as near crying as a king
                  can."
               Philip starts as he hears the Pretender called by his Jacobite title, and says
                  musingly, "I should like well to go to Avignon to note how James and his courtiers
                  compare with our head and his creatures at home."
               "Compare!" returns Sir Edgely; "the thought is absurd! England's best blood is
                  with his sacred majesty, and all that are chivalrous and brave enough are with
                  their true king awaiting but an opportunity to follow him to his stolen kingdom,
                  there to reap the reward of their loyalty and affection; and those who have
                  cringed to the Dutch glutton and his vrows shall be banished the kingdom root and
                  stock!"
               M. de Savatte, who has been engaged in the examination of some pieces of rock or
                  spar a few yards away, catching a few words of Sir Edgely's reply, bustles towards
                  his pupil, fearful lest the stranger may be a Jacobite agent on the lookout for
                  converts. Sir Edgely noticing his approach, however, adroitly turns the
                  conversation to more general topics, and descants admiringly on the grandeur of
                  the scenery and its chastening effect on the mind.
               In a little time Sir Edgely announces his intention of leaving; before doing so,
                  however, he slyly slips a small packet into Philip's hand which closes on it
                  immediately. After this, he returns to town, whither Philip and Monsieur soon
                  follow.
               Arriving at the hotel, Philip waits until his tutor is engrossed in the contents
                  of a musty volume called "A true accounte of ye Dryads and Hamadryads." He then
                  takes the packet from his pocket to inspect it. He finds a ribbon within it about
                  six inches long; its color is red, with a white space in the centre whereon is
                  depicted the chevalier holding a sponge in his right hand to signify that if he
                  ever regains his kingdom, he will wipe off the public debt, which debt is the
                  cause of much bitter feeling in England, and affords a great rallying cry for the
                  Tories. Around the sides runs the legend "For our wronged king and our oppressed
                  country." Attached to the silk by a gold pin made in the shape of an oakleaf, is a
                  white cockade. Philip's heart beats quickly as he unpins it, and he exclaims, with
                  a glance at Monsieur, "It smells Mar-ish!" He holds it in his hand a moment as if
                  in consideration. Finally picking up his coat, he puts it on. Now he proceeds to
                  attach the cockade to the right breast, pinning the ribbon on his inner coat. Thus
                  attired he consults the glass. The adornments do become him! The pink
                  lapels of his waistcoat do not accord with the red ribbon as well as they might
                  have done; but taking the effect all in all, it is satisfactory; and for variety's
                  sake he avows himself high Tory and Jacobite.
               It is early morning, and the sun's rays scarcely glint on the waters of the Rhone.
                  Philip leaves his room, and walks to the stable, where his new purchase munches
                  the straw in lazy contentment; stepping into the stall, he pats the stallion
                  soothingly on the side. "Oho, my beauty, you belong to a Wharton now. To-morrow
                  you will belong to even a greater than he—a Stuart!" The animal whinnies and paws
                  as though he understands him, and half
                  turns his head to lay his nose on the shoulder of his new master: "Yes, to-day
                  decides me. I'll go to Avignon, and leave that crusty curmudgeon of a pedant to
                  get along without me. Faith! the separation will not kill him. His books are more
                  to his taste than I am, parbleu!"
               Laughing noisily as if at the contemplation of a good joke, he resumes: "I'll
                  leave him a companion suited to his nature i' faith!"
               He steps out at a rapid pace as though he suddenly bethinks him of an important
                  commission. Yesterday he saw a party of itinerant Savoyards who had with them a
                  led bear, which danced and capricoled to the rude music of their rustic pipes; and
                  he noticed them as they entered a small cabaret in the lower part of the town.
                  Towards this cabaret he goes. He opens the door, and steps inside, to the surprise
                  and joy of mine host, who seldom sees a gallant of such feather enter his humble
                  place; he is almost too overcome to reply to Philip's question, "Are the Savoys
                  who exhibit a bear about the streets lodging here?" after a short pause, he
                  replies, "Yes, milord, I will call them;" and he bawls to them in the peasant
                  patois to come downstairs immediately as milord wishes to see them. Turning to
                  Philip he asks him whether the bear shall come also, to which he replies with a
                  smile: "Of course! that is the animal which I most desire too see." The order is
                  repeated, and shortly Master Bruin is heard treading heavily down the stairs, and
                  he flumps into the bar in company with his masters.
               Philip tells them that he wishes to purchase their animal, but they are so sleepy
                  that they can scarcely comprehend him. However, when he thrusts a handful of
                  guineas in the hand of the foremost of them, and grasps Bruin's chain, they seem
                  satisfied, for they nod their acquiescence quiescence in a thankful manner, and
                  slowly reascend to their sleeping place.
               Philip marches triumphantly along the still-deserted streets, while his prize
                  follows meekly after, his long, scuffling strides compelling Philip to proceed at
                  a mighty brisk pace. As he draws near to his lodgings, he calls to one of the
                  three lads who have joined him on the way, and tells him to hold the animal until
                  he returns. The lad looks at Bruin distrustfully, but as the bear is muzzled, and
                  appears tolerably peaceful, he agrees, keeping a respectful distance from him
                  withal. Philip stepping carefully inside, indites the following polite epistle to
                  his unsuspecting governor, who reposes soundly in bed and has never a thought of
                  the scene which will greet him when he enters the beloved library.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Most erudite and omniscient governor: No longer able to
                              stand your inquisitorial ill-usage, I leave you. However, that you may
                              not want company, I have left you a bear as the most suitable
                              companion that could be picked out for you.
                           
                              Your long-bearing pupil,
                              PHILIP WHARTON.
                              
                                 To M. DE SAVATTE."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Philip, chuckling maliciously as he folds and seals it, lays it in a prominent
                  pigeon-hole on the escritoire, where Monsieur will be sure to see it at a glance.
                  Now he packs his most portable things, and puts them under his arm; the coat and
                  waistcoat which he wears are those that are so loyally decorated. He returns to
                  the future companion of Monsieur, and rewards the lad who has held it during his
                  absence, promising him an additional gold piece if he will lead it into the
                  library and leave it with an old gentleman who will enter there in a few minutes. The boy gives the promise, and
                  receives the gratuity.
               In order to enjoy the joke to its fullest extent, Philip stations himself at the
                  latticed window of the library. He knows Monsieur's regularity in his movements,
                  and momentarily expects him to enter.
               "S' life! he comes," cries Philip.
               The tutor enters and gazes at the note with inquiring eyes, and slowly,
                  deliberately puts on his horn-rimmed spectacles. Breaking the seal, he examines
                  the writing; his brow knits, and his lips compress and open alternately. Turning
                  around as if at some interruption, he opens the door: Philip almost chokes with
                  laughter as he sees him jump back in affright. The grinning urchin leads the bear
                  into the middle of the room, and before its astonished occupant has a chance to
                  speak to him he is gone. Monsieur looks first at his shaggy guest and then at his
                  letter, while Bruin rears himself on his hams, and rubs his ears and his nose with
                  a comical clumsiness; Monsieur compromises matters by entrenching himself behind
                  the wide table and keeping a wary eye on the enemy whilst he reads the letter.
                  Philip can surmise what his sensations are by the varied expressions of his face
                  during the perusal, and he enjoys the affair hugely.
               "Sapristi! I must decamp, or else I'll be caught," he mutters, and with a farewell
                  look at his governor, he repairs to the stable where his stallion "King Jamie" is
                  ready saddled and bridled.

                              Here is a windfall, truly! Is there more
                              To come?

                           Withal the king——
                           With his thin, anxious face and pale,
                           Sat leaning forward through the tale,—
                        
                     
                     MORRIS' "THE MAN BORN TO BE KING."
                  
               
               PHILIP is at present wandering alone through the streets of Lyons in order to have
                  a look at anything amusing or interesting, for wherever he goes he invariably sees
                  everything that is worth seeing; and as he has heard of the ancient Chapel de
                  Notre Dame de Fourvières, he determines to have a survey of it ere he leaves the
                  city. This chapel is not remarkable for its grandeur or beauty; on the contrary,
                  it is very plain and modest; its richly stained windows alone redeem it from a
                  charge of ugly bareness.
               Philip stands in front of the light-flooded altar and takes in at a glance all the
                  gorgeous paraphernalia of the Romish creed; and a feeling of solemnity and awe
                  strikes his senses; yet vague, troubled doubts rise in his mind at the sight, and
                  the prejudices of other days surge in his heart.
               He turns to leave, but a sudden change in his feelings decides him to remain, and
                  kneeling reverently before the altar he breathes a prayer—it is his first in the
                  house of the Pontiff of Rome. He rises and seats himself on one of the low stools
                  which stand near the confessional. "I wonder if my mother looks down on me now? If
                     so, she will think I am a most
                  dutiful son; Jacobite and Papist—the one from principle, the other from fancy
                  or—conviction? At all events the one seems to have led to the other, so that I'll
                  e'en call it a sequence of consequences." Hearing a footstep behind him, he looks
                  around to see who the new-comer is; it is Sir Edgely Warely.
               "My dear fellow!" cries Philip, "on my life I am glad to see you! However did you
                  manage to scale this holy height?"
               Sir Edgely, who looks as surprised as Philip, replies, "Well, my lord, I chanced
                  to be in the neighborhood, and so I thought I would pay Notre Dame a visit, and
                  recite a few pater nosters for the benefit of my soul!" as he finishes, he glances
                  at the decorations pinned on Philip's coat. Philip notices the direction of his
                  glance, and says: "Let me thank you for these, Sir Edgely;" and he points to the
                  ribbon and the cockade. Sir Edgely starts as if surprised, and exclaims, "My lord,
                  I was sure that your heart was true to his majesty! Do you intend to go to
                  Avignon, where the court is to be held for the present?"
               Philip looks perplexed as he answers, "In truth, I know not how he would receive
                  the son of the great Whig leader! No, I will not go. I'll write a letter to him,
                  and proffer my allegiance! Sir Edgely, do you intend to go there? If you do, let
                  me beg you to be my messenger."
               "I am going thither," he replies.
               "Good! You will take a stallion which I have bought especially for his majesty,
                  and present it to him with my compliments?"
               Sir Edgely, eagerly replies, "My lord, I am only too glad to be able to oblige
                  you. I will set out at once."
               Philip replies, "We must first retrace our steps to town, and I will write the
                  letter; then off you go with lightning speed to our gracious master!"
               Philip writes the letter, and the Jacobite agent sets out post for Avignon to
                  carry in the adherence of this most important ally. Philip awaits an answer in
                  great impatience, and can scarcely sleep all night. The next day he is notified
                  that a gentleman is awaiting him in the bar-room. He dresses himself in the
                  violet-satin suit which is slashed with amber-colored silk and heavily laced,
                  attaches the ribbon and cockade to his breast, takes a final look in the glass to
                  curl his embryo moustaches properly, and then walks down stairs in a flutter of
                  excitement to see the royal emissary. He observes a tall, broad-shouldered
                  cavalier who is attired quite as gayly as himself, and who is resting one arm on
                  the oaken bar, while the other clasps the waist of the pretty serving-maid, whose
                  face is as red as a peony. He is speaking to her in the French patois, and calls
                  her by many fond names. He turns as Philip enters, and favors him with a haughty
                  stare, which is returned with one even haughtier and more insolent; but the girl
                  explains matters by saying, "Milord Wharton—Milord Winton!"
               The stranger's attitude changes at once; extending his hand to Philip, he says,
                  "My lord, allow me to apologize for my boorish conduct; for which I shall never
                  forgive myself. My name is George Seton, Earl of Winton."
               Philip is pleased at James' condescension in sending a peer to meet him, and he
                  cordially responds to the compliments which Seton delivers with the grace and
                  affability for which his lordship is noted. His face is a picture of careless,
                  jovial good-humor and nonchalance; his tawny moustaches surmount a mouth that is
                     delicate cate enough for a woman;
                  and his eyes betoken a cheery, hopeful disposition. Mad George, as he is called in
                  London, for his many odd freaks and escapades, engaged in the last insurrection in
                  England, and was sentenced to death despite the clever defence which he made, and
                  the manifold tricks by which he tried to evade the law. During his trial, the high
                  steward Lord Cowper, having overruled his casuistical objections with much
                  asperity, he replied with scornful emphasis, "I hope you will do me justice, and
                  not make use of Cowper-law; as we say in our county—hang a man first, and then
                  judge him!" He managed to escape, however, by sawing the bars of his cell with a
                  file which one of his light-o'-loves—a Mistress Wilsome—threw into his window at
                  midnight, after the warden had gone his rounds. Before the insurrection he had
                  lived for some time with a blacksmith in France in the capacity of bellows-blower
                  and odd-jobber; and during that time he did not hold the slightest communication
                  with his family, nor did he send for a penny of the vast revenues which he
                  inherited, and which are now confiscated by the government.
               Philip plies the emissary with questions relative to the chevalier and his
                  surroundings, waiting impatiently for him to disclose the royal message with which
                  he has been intrusted.
               "My lord," says Seton, "his gracious majesty has done me the honor to appoint me
                  as your conductor. He has expressed his royal desire to see you at court; and has
                  also authorized me to express to you his thanks for the superb horse which you
                  presented to him. If you are ready to set out, we may as well be off for Avignon
                  at once."
               "With all my heart," cries Philip, joyfully.
               James reclines in his chair of state with dignity and grace, and as he extends his
                  hand for his new adherent to kiss, he looks a proud Stuart from head to foot.
                  Philip rises at his request, and makes a low obeisance, retiring backward until he
                  stands by the side of the Earl of Winton, who is engaged in a serious flirtation
                  with Mistress Arual Dolling, a beauty of sixteen summers, who has been spoiled and
                  petted until she is as imperious and exacting as an eastern despot. Her figure is
                  small, but plump, and in all her motions she is as graceful as a fawn. Her
                  complexion is bright and fair, and she owns a pair of azure eyes which swim in
                  coquettish expressiveness. On the left side of her dimpled chin are two round
                  patches, and the curled, pouting lips above seem made expressly for love's kisses
                  to die upon.
               Philip is introduced to her, and at once the fickle beauty bestows all her
                  attention upon him, shamefully neglecting "Mad George," who lifts his eyebrows,
                  and smiles deprecatingly, as if to say, "All right—as you please—it is your
                  nature, and you cannot help it!" Philip exerts himself to please her; and his
                  well-modulated voice, his wit, and his vivacity keep her in a state of piqued
                  pleasure and half-admiration of a man who dares to cross words with her, and even
                  come out the victor, while protesting his defeat, and begging for quarter. It
                  seems that her laughter disturbs his majesty, for he taps significantly on the arm
                  of his chair, and contracts his brow in a frown. Hiding her face behind her
                  sandal-wood fan, she makes a moué of defiance at him, which amuses Philip beyond
                  measure. "S'life!" he says, in a low voice, "I am so angry at your léze-majesté
                  that I must e'en let Seton into the affair;" turning to the earl, who has been
                  scanning the assembled demoiselles and courtiers with a critical eye, he says,
                  "Come, my lord, you desolate us by turning your back on us so coldly. Give
                  Mistress Dolling and myself the benefit of your conversation!"
               
               "Transfix me! but I'll do so right willingly; more for my own sake, though, than
                  for yours."
               James, who has been conversing in low whispers with Earl Mar, who seems to have
                  pressed some subject to which he is averse, finally consents, and Mar, after
                  begging permission, steps to Philip's side, and whispers in a low tone, which none
                  overhear except Seton and Mistress Dolling, "My lord, allow me to unofficially
                  announce to you that his most gracious majesty designs to confer upon you the
                  title and privileges of Duke of Northumberland. I have the honor of first
                  congratulating your grace!" shaking his hand cordially he returns to James, who
                  has watched the proceedings from under his eyes with a half-dissatisfied look.
               Philip is overjoyed at this new sign of the royal favor, and his blood tingles
                  with loyalty and devotion to James, who is, in this instance, wise against his
                  will, through the diplomacy of Mar, who sees that Philip may be of great use in
                  furthering the designs of the exiled court. Philip's whole mind now centres itself
                  on the idea of doing something to show that he appreciates the honor which has
                  been shown him; but all at once this idea flies to the winds at the recollection
                  that he has left his prettiest snuff-box in his room at Lyons, and he determines
                  to return for it immediately, and get back again in time to take an active part in
                  Jacobite politics or battles. He whispers his intentions to Seton, who stares at
                  his affection for a trifling snuffbox; and excuses himself to Mistres Dolling, who
                  is highly offended that he can leave her for anything in the world, so high an
                  opinion does she entertain of herself.
               James beckons to Seton to come to him, an order which he obeys, and stepping
                  behind his chair he awaits patiently any commands that may be given him. After
                  finishing his discourse with Mar, James turns his attention tion to Seton, saying,
                  with a kindly smile, "Where found you our new subject, my lord?"
               "In a dirty cabaret in the lower section of Lyons, your majesty."
               "And how did he express himself at our message?"
               "He was overjoyed, your majesty, and seemed to feel the great honor bestowed upon
                  him."
               James nods his head sagaciously, and says, "We have finished with you, my lord."
                  At this Seton retires from the presence and renews his flirtation with Mistress
                  Dolling, who welcomes him with an enchanting smile.
               James, leaning over to Mar, inquires: "Think you it is possible that the heroic
                  Winifred of Nithisdale will be at our court to-morrow? 'Faith we would like to see
                  the woman who is so ingenious as to have deceived the veteran gaolers of our
                  London Tower! Have you the particulars of the affair? It is said that you have
                  received despatches from England lately containing a detailed account of her
                  husband's escape? We would enjoy its recital."
               "Your majesty, it will give me great pleasure to tell all I know of the subject,"
                  and he relates his story, which reads more like a romance than a stern
                  matter-of-fact recital, in which a gentle head was saved by the fearless devotion
                  of its owner's wife—the beautiful Winifred—who is thus described by one who saw
                  her: "She is delicate and feminine in appearance, and her hair is light-brown, and
                  generally powdered. Her eyes are large and soft; her features regular, and her
                  complexion is fair and pale."
               James listens with great attention, and as he reaches that part where Winifred
                  travelled to Traquhair to rescue the family papers, and returned safely to London
                  with them, his majesty claps his hands in great glee; but when he hears how
                  spiteful the king was towards her, and
                  how he said that "Lady Nithisdale did whatever she pleased in spite of him, and
                  that she had given him more trouble than any woman in Europe," he grinds his
                  teeth, and the Stuart frown mantles on his face. "The boor!" he exclaims; "there
                  is as much chivalry in him as there is in one of his native hogs!"
               "Or his mistresses," adds Mar.
               James smiles as he answers, "Ay! neither von Schulenberg nor Kilmanseck can boast
                  of much but adiposity, idiocy, and the hatred of our loyal subjects." He remains
                  silent for a few minutes, while Mar occupies himself in running his fingers
                  through his towering wig. "Mar, the Duke of Argyle is said to be tired of this
                  Hanoverian usurper!"
               "Your majesty, he is a great friend of the Prince."
               "Ergo, an enemy to his father," adds James.
               Mar, laughing low, wonders aloud at his majesty's astuteness. "Your majesty, it is
                  surmised that Walpole is being mightily worried by my Lord Sunderland and divers
                  others at court, and it is thought that he will resign ere long, and take his tool
                  Townshend along with him!"
               "Ah! I did not know of that!" replies James, and he begins to count the beads of
                  his rosary, and his lips move quickly as he recites a pater-noster or an ave
                  Maria; the while his eyes are cast devoutly on the floor; suddenly he ceases his
                  devotions, and asks: "Where is Mademoiselle Delamour? We would see her." And again
                  his beads occupy his attention, while Mar goes in search of the notorious and
                  beautiful Desirette Delamour, a favored mistress of James—and only a few of his
                  courtiers.

               INSTEAD of returning to Avignon, as he intended when he set out for Lyons to
                  regain his precious snuff-box, Philip bethinks him that Paris will be better
                  suited for one of his parts and acquirements; and so to Paris he goes. His first
                  act of wisdom in this city is his visit to the Queen Dowager, the consort of James
                  the 2d, residing at St. Germains, surrounded by the exiled or disaffected nobles
                  who still retain the idea of seating the chevalier on the throne and then reaping
                  the reward of their constancy. The papers which endow Philip with the empty title
                  of Duke of Northumberland have been forwarded to him from Avignon, and under that
                  title he now goes, to the surprise and disgust of the loyal Englishmen who chance
                  to be in Paris, and to the immense delight of the opposing party.
               He takes a superb residence in the vicinity of the Tuileries, and has it furnished
                  and adorned with such lavish extravagance as to excite comment among even the
                  spendthrift Parisians, who fritter and gamble their fortunes away on the whims of
                  a mistress or the turn of a dice. His equipage is the finest in town; for
                  out-riders he has two negroes, whom he calls Mustapha and Mahoment, in ridicule of George's back-stair
                  attendants. His runners are considered the finest and best-winded men inside of
                  the gates.
               Drawn by four large, black stallions, his coach conveys him swiftly down the
                  Boulevard, while he reclines against the cushions in an easy, but studiously
                  graceful attitude. Now he calls to the driver to stop, and the horses draw up with
                  a clattering din before the door of Anatole Cherprix, the famous dealer in
                  pictures, art productions, and articles of vertu. Philip has noticed in his window a group of statuary—Circe
                  and her victim—which he thinks would look pretty in his private room; it is carved
                  with high artistic skill, and is, as Anatole declares, "a perfect gem."
               "I will sacrifice it for ten thousand francs, milord. Shall I send it to milord's
                  house?"
               Philip replies, "Yes. Send it before night to la
                     maison Northumberland, and I will give you an order on London;"
                  returning to his coach, he majestically once more displays himself to the admiring
                  Parisians and the resident English as he retires to his magnificent abode.
               After partaking of a rich lunch, he sallies out again in quest of amusement or
                  excitement that will pass away the time until dinner. As he proceeds lazily
                  towards the Tuileries, he feels a hand laid familiarly on his shoulder. He turns
                  quickly, and to his surprise recognizes Sir Edgely Warely, who cries, "As I am
                  alive! It is strange how often I meet your grace! I was wandering about
                  disconsolate and friendless, when I thought I saw your grace's form—which I could
                  recognize among a thousand—and I am vastly pleased to find that I was not mistaken
                  in my surmise."
               Philip is flattered and pleased with Sir Edgely's speech; moreover he is glad to
                  have some one to whom he can talk, for his residence in town has been so recent
                  that not even the watchful tuft-hunters have had time to run him to earth.
               "Sir Edgely," says Philip, in cordial tones, tempered, however, with an almost
                  imperceptible condescension of manner, "I cannot express myself in suitable terms
                  for the pleasure of this meeting."
               Sir Edgely bows in acknowledgment, and replies in a careless, haphazard manner:
                  "How would your grace like to call on my Lord Stairs? He is at home now, I am
                  certain!" He knows that Philip will visit Stair before long, and fearing lest he
                  should be regained to the Hanoverian party, he determines to beard the lion at
                  once, and go with Philip to the ambassador in order to counteract any influence
                  which that oily diplomat may attempt to secure over his actions or his
                  thoughts.
               Philip replies: "The very place of all places. I have a desire to see his
                  excellency, who, they say, is a marvel of good-breeding and astuteness. I promise
                  myself a little amusement when he discovers these on Whig Wharton's son, eh?" and
                  he points to the ribbon and the cockade; whereat they both laugh heartily, and Sir
                  Edgely praises his boldness and encourages him in his foolish intentions; for he
                  would like nothing better than to produce a complete estrangement between
                  Stair—who is so inimical to his party—and Philip.
               Their names are announced, and they are ushered into the hall, in a few minutes
                  the ambassador descends the stairs. Polished and graceful in his deportment, his
                  manners are complaisant and insinuating. Welcoming Philip with great warmth and
                  cordiality, he condoles with him on the recent loss of his mother. He compliments
                  him on his good looks and fine appearance, but purposely neglects to call him by
                  his new title, and Philip is so charmed with his conversation that he does not wish to raise a discussion in which
                  he fears he would be worsted.
               Not so Sir Edgely, for as Stair addresses Philip as my lord, he coughs twice or
                  thrice in a very significant manner, and as he finds that his hints are unheeded
                  an angry feeling glows in his breast at Philip's lack of self-assertion.
               Stair gives Sir Edgely a very cool welcome, paying little or no attention to him,
                  for he knows him to be a rank Jacobite and a partisan-hunter for the Pretender.
                  After a few observations relative to matters at home and abroad, Stair says to
                  Philip: "Your father was a true friend to his country, and when England lost him,
                  she had one great man the less: I hope and trust that you will follow so
                  illustrious an example of fidelity to your prince, and affection to your country,
                  by treading in the same steps!"
               Philip, averse to advice under any circumstances, is, in this case, particularly
                  incensed at what he considers his excellency's impertinence both to himself and
                  his friend; and he replies in a sneering tone and with a spiteful glance, "I thank
                  your excellency for your good advice; and as your excellency had also a worthy and
                  deserving father, I hope that you will likewise copy so bright an original, and
                  tread in all his footsteps."
               This allusion to his father's disgraceful share in the Glencoe massacre, and his
                  remorseless hatred and destruction of the Macdonalds of that ilk, after the
                  submission of their chief Mac Ian, causes the earl's pale face to burn with
                  mortification and rage; subduing his first impulse of revenge, however, he replies
                  in a tone which makes Philip almost despise himself for his insolence to one so
                  much older than himself. "My lord, my father did what he thought right and just,
                  and it was his unfortunate over zeal which prompted him to an action, at the
                  recollection of which his son now hangs his head in shame. My lord, I thank you
                  for the rebuke conveyed to me so gently."
               It is now Philip's turn to flush, and he looks so shame-stricken that Stair
                  involuntarily extends his hand in token of forgiveness, and Philip gripes it with
                  a pressure which is a better apology than a volume of words. Sir Edgely's brow
                  lowers as he sees that the shrewd diplomat has thrust home a wedge which may split
                  his design to pieces, and he bites his nether lip in anger.
               Says his excellency, "My lord, can I have a few minutes' private
                  conversation?"
               At these words, Sir Edgely seems as if he would remonstrate; but if he so
                  intended, he wisely controls himself.
               "Certainly, your excellency," replies Philip. "Excuse us for a short time, Sir
                  Edgely."
               Stair, leading Philip to his private apartment, requests him to be seated, and
                  continues: "Under favor, my lord, are you aware of the character of this Sir
                  Edgely?"
               Philip demands rather warmly, "In what respect?"
               "In everything, both his public and private character?"
               Philip replies, "Well, no! I met him in London a short time since. He seems to be
                  a good-natured, clever gentleman, and as he rather courts my acquaintance, and yet
                  is neither servile nor insolent, I have taken a slight fancy to him! As for his
                  public character, I know that he is greatly attached to the Chevalier: small blame
                  to him for that, however."
               Stair affects not to notice the last remark, and replies, "My lord, he calls
                  himself Sir Edgely Warely; his real name is plain Edgely Valentin; and
                  unfortunately he has never known who was his father. Not his fault, to be sure;
                  but you know the world's opinion in regard to these things! He is a traitor to his king, and a
                  spy and inveigler for the Pretender, and well is he adapted for his offices, for
                  he is crafty, unscrupulous, and daring:—three qualities that make him a dangerous
                  friend and a worse enemy!"
               Philip is so astonished at these revelations that he does nothing but mutter in a
                  low tone, something about "insulting his friend—reparation and false charges;"
                  mutterings which Stair ignores, by crossing to the other side of the room,
                  ostensibly to open his window.
               By the time he returns Philip is more composed, and he remains sullenly quiet,
                  while his face is flushed and perplexed.
               "If the question is not offensive, my lord, why do you wear those gewgaws which
                  dangle on your breast?"
               Philip flushes more deeply as he retorts, "Your excellency was once my father's
                  friend, or you should certainly expiate this insult to my king on the field of
                  honor!" and bestowing a haughty look upon him Philip descends to Sir Edgely
                  Warely, or, as he shall be called after this, Edgely Valentin.
               Stair bites his nails in vexation as the young "quicksilver" disappears, and
                  utters, "Honest Tom, without his coolness!"
               As Philip descends the stairs, he makes up his mind to find out whether or no the
                  ambassador's accusations are correct, so, before he enters the reception chamber,
                  he calls, in a low, indistinct voice, "Valentin! Edgely Valentin!" and watches the
                  effects of his words. The Jacobite turns in an instant, and casts his eyes in
                  every direction with a wild look in them, while his trembling lips enunciate in a
                  thick unnatural voice, "Who calls?"
               "I! Philip Wharton, you forsworn liar! Go! Never let me see your face again; never
                  call me friend again, or I'll have your face slit so that your father—excuse me,
                  your mother—would not know you again. 'Tis a pity that I cannot do it with my own
                  hand; but a Wharton never stoops to cross steel with a—" He holds back the last
                  epithet, and half-regrets his cruel words. For a moment Edgely staggers like one
                  drunk, then drawing his cloak over his face, he walks out with staggering,
                  uncertain steps.
               "A pest on my scurrilous tongue! Poor man; I turned his head when I spoke so
                  villainously to him;" and he walks home with a slight compunction pricking at his
                  heart.
               Philip receives a message from the ambassador early in the day, in which he is
                  invited to call and be presented at court; so, at the time appointed, he dresses
                  himself with elaborate care, and orders his coach. Stepping carefully inside, he
                  cries out, "His Excellency the Ambassador."
               Stair receives him with as much graciousness and affability as though he had never
                  passed a disagreeable word with him; and when they arrive at court he guides him
                  through the intricate hallways and amuses him with descriptions of the various
                  people with whom he will be likely to be brought in contact during the
                  presentation to royalty.
               After the ceremony is over, Stair renews his character of guide, taking Philip to
                  all the parts of the palace that are beautiful or interesting. He points out the
                  beauty of the pavillon de l' Horloge, and tells
                  him a strange story of its architects, Delorme and Bullant, who were matches in
                  impiety and blasphemy. They had impiously placed a statue of Catharine de Medici
                  on the facade, directly over another of the Virgin Mary; and just as they were
                  sending in the last rivet which was to hold it in its place, a thunderbolt from a
                  cloudless sky struck them both, and
                  killed them immediately; while the statue of the queen was nowhere to be seen.
               They are promenading the vast gardens of the Tuileries, and enjoying the pure
                  breeze wafting over the clear bosom of the lovely Seine. Stair is saying, "My
                  lord, honor me with your presence to-morrow! I expect to have quite a company at
                  my house, most of whom are either talented, witty, or beautiful; and I'll take my
                  oath on't that you will enjoy yourself. I shall expect you as my guest if you have
                  no prior claims."
               "Your excellency may depend on me," replies Philip; "I revel in the anticipation
                  of the morrow."
               Stair, who has business within the palace, now excuses himself, and advises Philip
                  to look about him, and enjoy the surrounding scenery.
               "Edgely Valentin! Umph! the man is clever and unassuming. 'Tis a pity he cannot
                  speak of a father; but he can console himself with the fact that half the world is
                  in the same quandary; the only difference is that some know it, and others do
                  not."
               Philip is already beginning to gain many friends in Paris; for his fine parts,
                  ready wit, and especially his reckless expenditure have begun to produce quite a
                  good effect in the courtly circles of the city. He is known to many by the title
                  of Le Beau Wharton, and if the story of his marriage had not preceded him, he
                  would have been looked on as a godsend by intriguing dowagers with penniless
                  daughters. As it is, his society is eagerly courted by many of the wanton beauties
                  and profligate monseigneurs who make up the celebrated coterie in which the
                  influence of Ninon de I'Enclos and l'Abbé Scarron are strongly felt.
               Once or twice he has endeavored to procure an interview view with the ci-devant "La Belle Indienne,"*
                   who buried herself in the Convent of Saint Cyr on the dissolution of
                     Le Grand Monarque; but his attempts have been
                  fruitless, and in his chagrin at being foiled, he perpetrates the following
                  couplet on her, which he sent in to her by the portress:— 
                     
                        Yes! lie hidden! perverse Indienne,
                        You scorn of women and love of men!
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  *Mme. de Maintenon, the instigator of the revocation of the Edict of
                     Nantes.
               
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVIII.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Sittah.—
                           How now, dear Saladin, what play is this?
                        
                        
                           Saladin.—
                           Indifferent? Yet I thought it good.
                        
                        
                           Sittah.—
                           For me——
                        
                     
                     LESSING'S NATHAN THE WISE.
                  
               
               STROLLING oward the main Boulevard, Philip joins in with the crowd of essenced
                  fops and mincing beaux who hail him with complimentary protestations and welcoming
                  smiles, which he accepts with a calm consciousness of his right to such
                  attentions. One of the nearest fops, a Count Bétenoire, says to him, with a
                  flourish of his cocked hat, which he carries in his hand to show his glossy
                  periwig, "Ah-ha! Your grace has heard of the accident that occurred to his
                  Excellency, my Lord Stair!"
               "Accident!" replies Philip. "No, I have not. Tell me all about it, I beg of
                  you."
               The Count resumes: "Voici! Monsieur Killmahl, a young English surgeon, who came
                  here to study in our Hospital, and who is a great friend to your King James, had
                  occasion to pass by his excellency's door an hour or more ago, and irritated, I suppose, by his
                  enmity to his excellency's master, he smashed his windows, and nailed a placard to
                  his door, on which was written, 'King James forever! Death to the Dutchman!!' Of
                  course he was arrested, and Monsieur Killmahl is now on his way to the prison of
                  Fort l'Evèque, where he will have ample time to cool down and repent of his
                  rashness."
               Philip is amused at the affair, and willingly joins in the laugh at the foolish
                  saw-bones. Turning to Maréchal Tiernan—an Irish officer in the service of
                  France—he says, "Maréchal, give me the aid of your trusty arm, and I will at once
                  repeat M. Killmahl's performance. Then we shall see whether they dare mention Fort
                  l'Evèque to me or not!"
               The Maréchal smiles at the oddity of the proposal, and answers, "I advise your
                  grace by all means to give up the enterprise. But if your grace is resolved to
                  execute it, I beg you to leave me out of your party; for it is a kind of
                  war-making to which I have not been accustomed."
               Philip colors slightly at the imputation. However, he laughs it off as a joke, and
                  the conversation turns on other subjects.
               Bétenoire proposing an adjournment to the Salon of la Comtesse de Petitscrevé, a
                  notorious gaming-hell in the fashionable quarter of Paris, the suggestion meets
                  with unanimous applause, and thither they proceed.
               Madame's mansion is aristocratically situated, and all its surroundings are
                     au fait. The "Grand Chambre" is on the second
                  floor; it is spacious and airy, and richly adorned in the Louis Quatorze style.
                  The walls are divided into oval sections, in each of which is a highly-colored
                  painting, either by Watteau or after him. Between each picture are four delicate
                  clustered pillars of variegated marble, that ascend from the floor to the ceiling,
                  where they spread into the rich Corinthian apex. The vaulted ceiling glows with
                  rich allegorical designs, not over chaste or refined, but artistically beautiful.
                  Two of the most noticeable are the depictions of Britomartis, and the interview
                  between Iachimo and Imogen. The floor is covered with rich velvet, which gives no
                  echo to the tread; but there is not a mirror in the room. The reason is obvious: a
                  gamester who risks his hundreds or his thousands would not care to have his cards
                  reflected for the benefit of his adversary. La Comtesse is a lovely, sparkling
                  woman, rather inclined to embonpoint. Her eyes and hair are coal black, her
                  glances keen and penetrating. She is known to keep marvellously cool and collected
                  under the most trying circumstances, and she is as crafty as a fox. At ombre,
                  whist, or basset she can successfully cope with the best players in Paris; yet,
                  for all, the young lordlings who frequent her salön are always delighted to lose a
                  few thousand francs to her, merely for the purpose of being able to say to friends
                  less favored, "Parbleu! I lost an odd thousand to Petitscrevé yesterday; good
                  player—very!" For La Comtesse seldom plays with any save distinguished visitors,
                  thus bestowing a certain caste on her opponents. Those conversant with private
                  court scandal aver that on one occasion she won over a hundred thousand francs of
                  his majesty in less than two hours; but such aspersions on the dead monarch must
                  be received with caution.
               Philip and his friends engage a table, and they are soon deep in the varying
                  fortune of the blind goddess.
               Count Bétenoire, although the representative of a noble family, is unfortunately
                  compelled to live more by his personal ingenuity than by his "flowing coffers,"
                  and his game is always safe, wary, and high. Philip is his adversary; and as the
                  game finishes, he finds himself five
                  thousand francs poorer. Though the loss does not deeply trouble him, he is
                  somewhat mortified at his defeat, and he says to the Count, as they are leaving,
                  "Do you care to throw a few mains with me, Count?"
               "Sangdieu! yes: as well that as anything else;" and they return to the table.
               A servant in velvet livery hands the ivory dice on a silver salver, and Philip
                  sweeps them into the box. At this moment the Maréchal whispers Philip to avoid
                  high play, "for the Count is always lucky at a main." Philip resents this kindly
                  admonition with a haughty stare, and throws his cast.
               "Deuce, quatre, deuce—your grace counts low," says Bétenoire, and he throws.
                  "Trois quatres! good!" he exclaims.
               Philip raises the box again, saying, "Count, I double the stakes!"
               "Doubled it is," replies the Count.
               Philip's cast is fifteen. Bétenoire rattles the cubes well before he throws, while
                  Philip leans back in assumed indifference, and exchanges a few words with the
                  Maréchal. The Count taps him on the shoulder to draw attention to his cast.
               "Sixteen, eh? You are fortunate, Count."
               The Maréchal adds, in an aside to Philip, "Cela va sans dire!"
               Philip replies with a shrug, "It is nothing. Golconda is not ruined by a pearl's
                  abstraction!"
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIX.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           —Whom the grea
                           Choose for companions tête-à-tête;
                           Who at their dinners, en famille.
                        
                     
                     SWIFT.
                  
               
               THE ambassador looks around at his guests with a gratified complacency, and well
                  he may, for within whispering distance of him sit renowned authors and celebrated
                  statesmen, famous beauties and honored soldiers. Philip is distinguished by a seat
                  on the right hand of his host, who is determined to flatter him into being a Whig,
                  if it is possible. On the left of his excellency, leaning over the table and
                  flirting with Mlle. Toutedetruire, a beauty notorious for the duels fought in her
                  honor, is the celebrated, stammering priest Abbé Dubois, son of a Correzian
                  apothecary—once valet to a pedagogue, now a member of the council and the
                  possessor of the two richest abbeys in the country. His ability, wit, and tact are
                  amazing; but his viciousness and selfish profligacy are indisputably more so. He
                  is the most trusted counsellor of the Due d'Orleans; yet his character is so
                  horribly corrupt that even Philip*
                   was once compelled to say to him, "Abbé, a little honesty,
                   for God's sake!"
               
                  
                  *Orleans.
               
               Farther down Rollin's kindly honest face illumines the board, presenting a fit
                  contrast to the Abbé's flushed, sardonically sarcastic countenance. Philip, who
                  has pleasurably noticed the gay vivacity of Mlle. Toutedetruire whilst she has
                  been conversing with Dubois, is amused
                  by seeing her turn her back on him with an angry expression on her mobile
                  features, the consequence, doubtless, of his scurrilous wit; after which she turns
                  her attentions to himself, while her eyes beam in an encouraging manner. She has
                  an olive complexion, eyes dark and expressive, and a straight, narrow nose, whose
                  thin nostrils dilate tremulously as she breathes. Her mouth is a trifle over
                  large, and rather sensual. Unlike the high and weighty coiffures of Madame de
                  Maintenon, her hair is cut short and twisted into flighty little curls which
                  dangle wantonly on her brow. Half a dozen patches adorn her chin and its vicinity,
                  and her deftly-wielded fan is a miracle of delicate traceries.
               Says Philip, "Mlle. Toutedetruire, why so cruel to the precisian Abbé?"
               "Bondieu! What do you think is my reason for treating him so coldly?"
               "I could never guess! May be he called you a Jansenist?" Rollin glances at him at
                  these words. "Or depreciated your perfume's delicacy: or, let me see—surely he did
                  not dare to presume to offer himself as your confessor!"
               The Abbé laughs until the tears come to his eyes at this last surmise.
               "No!" she replies; "your grace is wrong in all your hazards. Listen, and you shall
                  hear the reason. L'Abbé proposed to settle a benefice on my nephew, with the
                  proviso that he must undergo his pupilage with him! Such an insult, when he knows,
                  too, that I have always intended my relation to be a pious, God-fearing man!" and
                  she casts a mischievous glance at the aspersed Abbé, who is sipping a goblet of
                  ruby wine with evident enjoyment.
               Dubois pretends intense chagrin at her insinuations, and in revenge he inclines
                  his head towards her uncovered shoulder, and therefrom blows a tiny cloud of
                     pèrle poudre—a fashion to which she conforms
                  more for fashion's sake than for any real need of its enhancing effect. Watteau,
                  who is sitting close by her, quickly draws off his laced 'kerchief and affectedly
                  essays to catch the snowy atoms ere they fall: for which strained chivalry he is
                  punished by a tap of her fan on his cheek.
               The atmosphere of the salon is close and stifling with the odors of perfumes,
                  pastilles, and scented cigarettes, that are now the necessary concomitants of a
                  fashionable assemblance. Le Dieu-donnè, as they called Louis, had strictly
                  prohibited the use of all scents or perfumes at court under penalty of his
                  displeasure. Consequently, after his decease, a reaction took place, and now every
                  beau and belle dispels Arabia's perfumes about them as they walk, move, sneeze, or
                  cough; while in every salon pastilles are burnt and fountains of perfume make the
                  atmosphere heavy and trying to the nervous or excitable.
               The ambassador drinks to Philip's health and prosperity, and in conclusion says,
                  "And as true a lover of his country and as loyal to the king as was his gifted
                  father!" In responding, Philip says very little beyond acknowledging his
                  excellency's compliments; very soon, however, the heavy wine which he has been
                  drinking begins to fire his head, his tongue wags looser, and soon his wit and
                  bold remarks keep his side of the table in cachinnatory convulsions. Stair,
                  conversant as he is with Philip's ready speech and his biting pleasantries, is
                  surprised at him. The more he drinks the greater seems his thirst, until Stair
                  fears that before the repast is over he will either be under the table or else
                  will have to be carried away to sleep off the effects of his hard drinking.
                  Hammering noisily on the table to attract attention, Philip springs up on the seat
                  of his chair, and places one foot on
                  the table, while the company cheer and applaud with hand and foot.
               "Mesdemoiselles et Messieurs, fill up—my toast will suit you all!" and he glances
                  at his host, who begins to arrange a few sentences in order to acknowledge the
                  toast of which he is to be the subject. "May Orleans dare to follow in Louis's
                  wake, and send a diamond hilt once more to England! Until then, long live our
                  exiled monarch James the Third. After—my toast will be: long live our restored
                  king, and death to the Dutch invader!"
               For a moment there is a hushed quietness, but Stair is cool and self-possessed;
                  signaling with his hands, a band of hidden music sends out a low, entrancing
                  strain which helps to dispel the restraint and relieves the necessity for any
                  remarks on such an untoward event as has occurred.
               Philip has descended from his eminence, and he is at present by the side of Mlle.
                  Toutedetruire, who left the table in order to visit the mirror to inspect her
                  laces, her ribbons, and her countenance. "Ventrebleu!" she exclaims, "your grace
                  has caused a grand sensation with your absurdities! What could have put such a
                  foolish toast into your head, vous bête?"
               He replies with a smile, "Your own sweet eyes, that betrayed your sympathy for
                  poor Jamie!"
               She bestows an arch look upon him as she says, "Fi
                     donc, your grace! What would the Duchess of Wharton say if she heard
                  you speak to me in such a gallant manner?"
               "Curse me if I care what she would say," he rejoins in an excited manner.
               With a cautioning glance from her eyes, she presses a little, plump hand on his
                  lips, and steps quickly to the other side of the room; where she is soon engaged
                  in a witty, wordy warfare with l'Abbé Dubois and his excellency.
               Claudine de Tencin, the ci-devant canoness and
                  Orleans favorite—now the mistress of l'Abbé, who sustains her in an almost regal
                  style—has been unusually quiet during the evening; but as soon as she observes
                  that Philip is alone, she calls to him to come to her and sit down on the sofa
                  beside her. Philip obeys with as much alacrity and grace as are possible under the
                  circumstances; and as wine and women combined tend to sharpen his wit and render
                  it more piquant, the two are soon engaged in lively conversation. The lady is a
                  mistress of the art of badinage and coquetry, and is moreover an unusually
                  talented woman. Her figure is lithe and graceful, revealing a charming languor in
                  its attitudes. Her eyes are dark brown, sparkling, and intelligent; lips full and
                  red; while the slight down shading her upper lip tells of her southern origin and
                  her fiery nature. She wears her hair in long, loose curls, which fall on her neck
                  and shoulders. She is dressed in a very négligé
                  manner, almost as much so as were afterwards Pompadour and Paraberé. Her costume
                  is made of a thin, transparent Indian fabric of a pearl color, studded with golden
                  crescents—the coa vestis of the period.
               "Your grace," she says, "pray glance at l'Abbé and Toutedetruire! One would say
                  that his very existence depends on her kindness, to judge from the expression of
                  his eyes; poor man!"
               "I have had an eye to them, Ma'm'selle Tencin; he is after one of her gloves which
                  she has hidden in her dress!"
               She replies: "I have heard—between us—that the Chevalier St. George once made
                  overtures to Emilie, and that the politely declined on account of what she called
                  'his pious fanaticism!'"
               
               "Faith! if she wants the opposite of a friar, recommend me to her."
               "She tries well for an abbé, though, in spite of her worldly scruples!"
               "Ah ha!" laughs Philip; "an abbé may be worse than a king!"
               "Or better!" replies the Tencin, adding rather abruptly, "Will your grace be in
                  town any length of time?"
               "No, ma belle, I will not. I must shortly return
                  to England to inspect my estate, and also attend to some vastly entertaining
                  advice anent them given by my family lawyer!"
               "Eh bien?"
               "A downwright Whig, who will test my orthodoxy, and nasally advise me to 'model
                  yourself after your blessed father, who was a pillar to the state and a prop to
                  the church.'"
               "And you will, I suppose?" she says, and casts a quick glance at him while
                  pretending to look at Dubois.
               "Sainte Vierge! will I? See!" and he directs her attention to the Jacobite badges
                  concealed under his coat. "You heard my sentiments at table. Do you think that I
                  was joking? No! I was in earnest, and, as for Protestantism, to —— with it and all
                  its exponents!"
               "Ingrate!" she murmurs, pressing her fan on his hand.
               Already the intoxication of her presence is stealing over him; he whispers in her
                  ear, "You could make me Whig or Tory—Protestant or Papist!"
               She lifts her eyebrows, and draws down her lips sanctimoniously as she replies,
                  "Truly, I would be a valuable adjunct to Holy Mother Church, if I had the power
                  which you say I have."
               Philip's answer is certainly to the point: "Test yourself, and you will be
                  assured."
               Philip is not altogether sober, but when he tells her what she can do with him, he
                  knows what he is about, for he is aware that she is a firm Jacobite and a trusted
                  Romanist; while, on the other hand, she does not know that he is already half
                  Catholic in his heart, but ascribes his offer to an excited brain, of which she,
                  as a true Catholic, must take advantage.
               She resumes, with a certain degree of gravity, "I am not, as your grace probably
                  knows, the most suitable person in the world to turn converter; but if I thought I
                  could induce you to embrace the only true faith, I would think it a condonation of
                  many guilty words and actions which I have committed;" she looks straight into his
                  eyes with a long, persuasive glance, and purposely lays her hand on his. Its warm,
                  living pressure thrills though him from head to foot, and he takes it up and
                  kisses it in a semi-drunken delirium.
               "Dear Claudine from this moment I am a devoted son of the church, and a true
                  believer in the Holy Catholic Faith!"
               She smiles sweetly on him, and tells him how glad she is that she has "made, at
                  any rate, one convert for Mother Church."
               We will step across the room to where a party of gentlemen are engaged in dicing—a
                  mode of passing the time of which his excellency is very fond; at present, however
                  he does not take part in the game, for he is secretly engaged in writing a
                  description of Stanrig Bartoslav, the long-bearded Russian who is now rattling the
                  dice; he has a stern, proud look about him which is far from ingratiating, and his
                  curls in supercilious pride. His excellency overhead a few remarks that he made in
                  the early part of the evening, and he had discovered that he intends to visit the Pretender in order to
                  give him assurances of sympathy from some eminent Russian noblemen, after which he
                  purposes visit England; and these remarks his excellency is jotting down in order
                  to forward to his royal master.
               As the evening advances, and more wine is poured down craving gullets, the noise
                  and confusion increase, and license and freedom from restraint reign triumphant.
                  But we will leave this scene ere the mad intoxication of a Regency supper pollutes
                  overmuch our reading, which is hard enough to keep clean and pure and yet furnish
                  any idea of this period and its morals. Here, as everywhere else, is illustrated
                  the great law of the equilibrium of forces. France, relieved from the gloomy
                  devotions of Louis and the Maintenon, experiences the reaction which breeds
                  wantons and rakes, midnight orgies, and protracted gaming.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXX.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Portius.—
                           
                              Marcus, the friendships of the world are oft
                              Confederacies in vice, or leagues of pleasure,
                              Ours has severest virtue for its basis.
                           
                        
                     
                     ADDISON'S CATO, III. I.
                  
               
               THERE is an unusual crowd collected in the Rue Saint Denis, who ever and anon
                  exclaim in admiring ecstasies: "Parole de Dieu! Beautiful! solid silver, on my
                  word! wonderful!" and expressions of admiration and astonishment are many. The
                  sergeants de ville hurry to the scene of confusion, and hustle the bourgeoisie
                  aside with the martial scorn for civilians; but when they see the object which has
                  produced the unwonted disturbance, they become quite as noisy and excited as any
                  one else. The innocent cause of all this wonder and surprise is a small carriage,
                  the entire body of which is covered with silver filigree work, wrought at
                  intervals into heraldic quarterings, still further enriched with set-in gems. The
                  hubs of the wheels are also decorated with precious stones. There are two vacant
                  seats in front, while in the box behind sit in stately silence two huge negroes,
                  black and ugly as twin Calibans, and as shiny as if they had just been dipped in a
                  candle-tank. They are dressed in azure velvet jackets trimmed with gold, and
                  knee-breeches of the same material. They are without hats of a civilized
                  fashioning, but their thick, crinkly wool is combed into fantastic semblances of
                  cocked hats, retaining their shapes through a plentiful use of bandoline and
                  pomatum. The equipage is drawn up before the door of M. Enivrant, jeweller and
                  perfumer, and from there to the carriage the crowd has formed a narrow pathway of
                  craning necks and wondering eyes. ""Il vient! il vient! le
                     beau Wharton!"
               Philip steps composedly over the threshold in company with a gentleman of peculiar
                  aspect. His dress is white satin slashed with azure; and his knee-breeches tinkle
                  with many oak-leaf buttons, all of which have a small diamond in their centres;
                  the buckles of his square-toed shoes are resplendent with diamonds and sapphires.
                  His companion is almost his fac-simile in dress, with perhaps a shade less of
                  magnificence. His stature is small, his shoulders slightly contracted and
                  stooping. His face seems familiar; but, if we recollect aright, he was in an
                  abbé's costume the last time we saw him. It is Dubois, who is Philip's companion
                  in this new freak which has set half Paris by the ears. Some say that le beau
                  Wharton is doing this on a wager; some, that he is endeavoring to ingratiate
                  himself with the Parisians in order to subvert the Regency; while others
                     maintain that there is a deep policy
                  hidden under his apparent madness. In fact the more wonderful the tale, the sooner
                  it is believed. Dubois has so well disguised his features by the aid of cosmetics
                  and a long, military beard, that he escapes recognition and the consequent censure
                  which he would incur through his complicity in such nonsensicalities; he is at
                  once christened "Le Chevalier Inconnu."
               This wonderful carriage and its occupants have been exhibited through all the
                  fashionable streets and boulevards, and wherever they have stopped for a few
                  minutes Philip has scattered handfuls of money to the people, and then harangued
                  them in a speech of Jacobitical tendencies; after which he would throw hundreds of
                  the Jacobite cockades to them to wear as emblems of their sympathy with the cause
                  of the Pretender.
               L'Abbé's witty and scurrilous remarks draw roars of laughter from the admiring
                  bourgeoisie, and as Philip rises from his seat to reprimand his friend for his
                  shocking obscenity, in words more shameless than the other's, their merriment
                  knows no bounds, and they scream applaudingly: "Vive le Wharton! Vive le Chevalier
                  Inconnu"—expressions which both acknowledge by raising their hats and kissing
                  their fingers.
               Finally the excited people unharness the horses from the shafts, place their own
                  shoulders to the task, and triumphantly drag the carriage and its burden to la
                  Maison Northumberland. Philip rises and steadies himself by holding on to the
                  splashboard, as he says, "My worthy plebeians! we appreciate your great kindness,
                  and are really thankful for your evident admiration of our persons; still, the
                  return of our horses would make us feel yet more grateful for your attention
                  toward us." The crowd clap and hurrah as a burly blacksmith leads forward the
                  horses, and re-harnesses them, and Dubois screams in a shrill, falsetto voice,
                  "Largess—largess!" Philip, thrusting his hand into the box on the bottom of the
                  carriage, whirls a shower of newly coined francs among the expectant crowd, who
                  curse, bellow, and fight like tigers in their thirst for the silver distributed so
                  madly and culpably. After this, Philip grasps the reins and drives rapidly to the
                  Ruelle de Venise, where he jerks the horses up with a loud cry in front of the
                  Tête du Frère, a cabaret of very humble pretensions.
               Dubois exclaims, "In the name of all the saints! Wharton, what is your idea in
                  coming here!"
               "'Faith, I know not—except—"
               Dubois interrupts: "I fear Bacchus reigns in your grace's brain at present."
               "Et tu, Brute!" he retorts, and resumes: "Let us
                  load the carriage with wine bottles; what say you?"
               Dubois does not reply, but begins to hum a parody on Marlborough s'en va en guerre. Philip, springing to the pavement,
                  enters the cabaret, and in a few minutes he reappears with his arm linked in that
                  of the host—a fat, red-faced, vulgar fellow, who is ready to fall to the ground at
                  Philip's condescension. Philip has promised him five hundred francs if he would
                  alter his sign to Tête de Jacques.
               Dubois exclaims in surprise, "Your grace!"
               Philip replies, "All right, my man of many churches. I have made these agreements
                  with this honest fellow! first, that he shall change, the word Frère for Jacques;
                  and secondly stow as many bottles of wine in the carriage as it will hold at a
                  nominal price of fifty francs per bottle!"
               "Eh bien!" replies Dubois, testily: "But there is no necessity for you to make a
                  friend of the fool!"
               The man wriggles his arm from Philip, and drops behind in a shame-faced manner, as he mutters, "My lords,
                  it is not my fault! I hope I know my place better than that."
               Philip, drawing him forward by his ear, cries, "Here! my red Boniface, put your
                  hands in there, and help yourself;" and he lifts the lid of the money box.
               The man, with a dazed expression on his face caused by the sight of so much money,
                  begins to count out the sum agreed upon. Philip watches him for a minute, and then
                  bids him drop all that he has counted, and to hold his apron, which he does.
                  Philip scooping up two handfuls, dashes them in it, and then scrambles over the
                  bottles of wine with which the carriage is filled, and regains his seat beside the
                  Abbé, who exclaims amusedly, "What does your grace intend to do with all this
                  second-rate wine? You are certainly not going to drink it?"
               "Drink it! No! I have too high a regard for my teeth and digestive powers to do
                  such a thing, I assure you, mon abbé. I have a
                  use for them, however, as you will see in time. Shall we drive to
                  Petitscrevé's?"
               Dubois assents, and tries to think what Philip intends to do with the wine.
               As they roll along in high spirits, Dubois whispers, "Orleans is coming this way,
                  your grace. If he stops to talk to you, recollect that I am Sir Charles Castle—an
                  English friend of yours; for he dislikes me to have a hand in anything tending to
                  make my memory more respected than it is at present."
               "Tres bien! pull your hat over your eyes, and
                  draw your collar up to your ears, mon abbé, and
                  if you are forced to speak, talk in a gruff, disagreeable way, that will repel any
                  advances which he may make to you!"
               "By the calendar! he comes straight towards us!" exclaims Dubois.
               "Sure enough!"
               The Duc rides a superb animal, which he brings to a halt before the carriage; he
                  salutes Philip, who rises and removes his hat, while Dubois affects to be absorbed
                  in the gambols of a ragged gamin on the opposite side of the way.
               "Your grace is determined to astonish even Paris with your magnificence? Pray, who
                  is your companion? His form seems familiar to me."
               "Companion!" returns Philip; "he is my servant Sêche Péteux, and an excessively
                  impertinent jackanapes he is!"
               "Ah! a thousand pardons," returns the Regent. "The Duchess of Berry has desired me
                  to invite you to the Luxembourg?"
               Philip replies in a flippant manner, which causes Orleans' face to flush: "Thanks,
                     mon duc. I will take the earliest opportunity
                  of seeing her!"
               Orleans bestows a stiff nod upon him, and rides off so quickly that he almost
                  upsets a group of gamins who are clustered near his horses' heels.
               "Duchess Berry—Palais Royal—Luxembourg!" sneers Dubois. "Your grace had better
                  season yourself with a few suppers at Orleans' ere you test your powers of
                  drinking and your competency in regard to filthy wit and meaning oglings in her
                  grace's violet boudoir."
               "Come, come, Abbé; her grace and yourself must be at daggers drawn, you talk so
                  bitterly about her!"
               "Not at all; but her wild orgies and amours are terrible in their evil influences
                  on Parisian society; for, when the rest of the sex see such a shining example,
                  will they not follow it? and if they do, how long shall we have faithful wives and
                  pure daughters? As for men, they now get drunk from policy, and for the same
                  reason are confessed libertines! What shall we do when women rival them in private
                  life, and participate in what are known all Europe over as Regency orgies, and
                  known too for their profligacy,
                  wantonness, and utter shamelessness? Ugh!"
               "Encore! Abbé, encore! It does me good to see you virtuous for once: Ah ha! I take
                  credit to myself for the discovery."
               The Abbé rejoins bitterly: "It is a part of my character, which I show but seldom.
                  When I do, it is called hypocrisy! Sure, that is not an unusual trait in church
                  exponents?"
               Philip replies: "I am not competent to answer you, Abbé! When I first knew you—or
                  at least before you enunciated your anathema maranatha against her grace—I should
                  have said, taking you as a specimen, that hypocrisy held no place in the church,
                  your peccadilloes were so bold and open. But since—" He shrugs his shoulders, and
                  casts a sidelong glance at the off horse.
               By this time they are opposite to Mme. Petitscrevé's, and Philip astounds the Abbé
                  by reaching down for a bottle, and then hurling it through the salon windows into
                  Madame's especial apartment. Crash! and it flies through the thick, stained glass
                  which Madame had imported from Italy at a large expense.
               "Mille diables, your grace! What do you
                  mean?"
               "Amusement, my dear Abbé, amusement. You see there will be an infernal uproar in a
                  few seconds. I shall allow Madame and her attendants to yell and curse for
                  awhile—that you must admit will be amusing?—and then I will pay for all
                  damages—make everybody about drink King James's health, then exit in a shower of
                  blessings."
               In a minute all is confusion. Petitscrevé's head is out of the window, and she is
                  talking and gesticulating in a most angry manner; the hall door is opened, and a
                  posse of gentlemen, croupiers, and servants appear, who simultaneously demand the
                  reason of this outrage. Dubois draws his hat entirely over his face, folds his
                  arms, and vows to let Philip get out of the scrape the best way he can. Philip
                  grasps two more bottles. One he tosses slowly up to Petitscrevé, who dodges it and
                  begins to grow almost frantic; the other he sends through the window above her
                  head. The assembled habitués of the salon,
                  although exasperated at his audacity, are yet impressed with the splendor of his
                  equipage and the dress of himself and Dubois, and some call out to him to cease
                  his throwing; none interfere with him, however, until one servant grasps at the
                  head of the nearest horse, whereupon Mahomet springs from his seat and knocks him
                  down with an accompaniment of foreign oaths, and then springs back to his
                  place.
               Dubois, fearful of consequences, says: "Your grace! put an end to this affair, or
                  it may end more seriously than we think for."
               Philip seems to think so too, for he opens the money-box, and calls out, "Ma belle Petitscrevé, what is the cost of your broken
                  window?"
               She will not answer him, thinking that he only means to taunt her; but, as he
                  repeats his question, she replies in a troubled voice: "Your grace, this window
                  alone cost me two thousand francs, for which I have Monsieur Chondrille's
                  bill!"
               Philip replies: "Send your bill to la Maison Northumberland, and it will be paid,
                     ma belle;" and he does not wait for an
                  answer, but kicks the rest of the wine into the street, and drives off
                  homewards.
               As they turn into the Boulevard, they pass Edgely Valentin, who throws a malignant
                  look upon Philip, which he returns with an amused smile. Dubois, who has noticed
                  the scowl, says: "Certes, if that man could ever poniard your grace and escape
                  detection, he would most assuredly do it! Did you mind how he looked at you? His eyes said vendetta as plainly as
                  ever tongue spoke. Pardieu!"
               "Oh," replies Philip, "he is an understrapper at court—a spy for my party. He once
                  foisted himself on me as a friend; but when my lord. Stair informed me of his true
                  character, of course I declined further acquaintanceship with
                     him, so that I do not think he would injure himself to do me
                  a favor."
               As they stop at the door of la maison, Philip
                  says abruptly, "Abbé, I return to England to-morrow in order to wind up some
                  little affairs which I had in hand when I left London with your countryman, M. de
                  Savatte;" and he smiles as he thinks of the trick he had played on him, and he
                  tells it to the Abbé, who laughs heartily at the contre-temps, in spite of his surprise at Philip's sudden
                  resolve.
               "These English!" he murmurs apologetically, as if that title completely justified
                  any amount of freaks or idiosyncrasies. However, he asks: "Is your grace so soon
                  tired of Paris?"
               Philip replies: "Well, no, I am not tired of Paris so much as I am of myself;
                  wherever I stop long, I always find myself repeated to a nauseating extent."
               "How repeated?" queries Dubois.
               "Mon Abbé, it is ever the privilege of great men
                  to produce followers."
               "Parbleu! You give me a negative answer. So you mean to say that you have created
                  so many would-be fac-similes of yourself that you are tired of seeing them. Is it
                  not so?"
               "Right, Abbé," he replies; and his face—I am sorry to say—is disfigured with
                  conceit and arrogance.
               Says Dubois: "Do you intend to take your seat in the House on your return?"
               Philip colors as he replies: "No; I think not, for the present."
               "No!" exclaims Dubois in apparent surprise; "I should have thought that that would
                  have been your primary object."
               Philip being under age is of course ineligible to Parliament; this the priest
                  knows, but he also knows how to make a friend by two or three questions or
                  answers; and he is aware of Philip's desire to appear older than he really is.
               "We French," continues Dubois, "never could understand either yourselves or your
                  politics. When you arrive at Court I should feel infinitely obliged to you if you
                  would present my compliments to Madame Kiel-mansegge—a lady who, by the way, might
                  be useful to you at Court; her acquaintance is quite worth cultivating."
               Philip replies, half angrily: "Really, Abbé, you are forever telling me whose
                  acquaintance I should cultivate! You forget that a Wharton is to be approached—not
                  to approach!"
               Dubois smiles, but agrees with him in every point. "Lord Stair will probably
                  secure the pardon for Bolingbroke?" queries Dubois.
               Philip replies: "Pah! the man is a fool. Let him return to his rightful king, and
                  ere long he will need no pardon!"
               "What means your grace?"
               "I mean that it will not be long ere a Stuart shall again sit on a hard-won
                  throne!"
               "Say you so?" replies Dubois dubiously. "How comes it that your grace is so
                  violently opposed to your deceased father's party?"
               Philip replies, with a laugh: "Pardieu! I have pawned my principles to Gordon—the
                  Chevalier's banker; and until I can
                  repay him, I must be a Jacobite. When I do repay him, I'll turn over a new leaf,
                  and embrace Whiggery forever."
               It is a fact that, even with the immense annuity which he is continually receiving
                  from home, he is always in debt, and that to an immense amount; although he often
                  has the money, he would rather squander it in extravagances than liquidate his
                  numerous bills.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXI.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Now change the scene; a nobler care
                           Demands him in a higher sphere:
                           Distress of nations calls him hence.
                        
                     
                     SWIFT.
                  
               
               PHILIP is once more in London, and he is busily engaged in superintending the
                  altering and re-furnishing of his mansion, which he is having decorated in a most
                  fanciful, extravagant manner. He is at this moment in his father's death-chamber,
                  and it is now in a state of confusion and uproar. Artisans and artists are
                  intently occupied in measuring, plumbing, plastering and painting. Philip speaks!
                  Let us listen with respect to this symbolization of economy, who actually
                  superintends his own affairs!—a wonderful thing for him to undertake considering
                  his thorough aversion to business of a practical nature.
               "Here—s'death! fellow. I ordered the green screen to be left in its former
                  position, and now you have—tuttut!" and he pishes angrily, and screams: "Take your
                  vile tools out of my sight! Fool! get you gone! And here, you cabineteer! I want
                  my private room finished in ebony; a type of myself—sombre and inflexible."
               To tell the truth, his orders impede work far more than they forward it, for they
                  are so contradictory and confusing that the workmen secretly wish his lordship
                  anywhere but in his own house. A servant enters with a letter, which Philip
                  glances over, and exclaims: "Harry Hautefort! Ask him to step up at once!"
               He scarcely finishes the command when Sir Harry steps gingerly towards him: "My
                  lord, allow me—"
               "Ah! Sir Harry, you have come at last! It is high time, let me tell you!"
               "True, my lord," he responds, and he presses his scented handkerchief to his brow:
                  "I would have been to see you sooner, but—"
               "But me no buts, my dear fellow; it is all right. Have a glass of wine with me, or
                  rather without me, and I'll change my clothes, and go out with you to get rid of
                  these glue-scented, varnish-stuck pack of rascals who are pulling my house to
                  pieces, and nearly distracting yours ever—" and he is gone.
               "Rackety as ever!" murmurs Sir Harry. "There are strange rumors about his doings
                  abroad. I question the truth of the report which makes him a Jacobite, but he is
                  so headstrong that all one would have to do to make him one thing would be to
                  persuade him to be its opposite!"
               Sir Harry is himself a Tory—or Trimmer denotes his principles better; for,
                  although apparently a violent Tory, he really believes in a middle course. But in
                  these days it is necessary for a public man to be an extremist, or else he runs
                  the risk of being attacked by both parties who unite in the one particular of
                  hating half-way men or Trimmers.
               Philip re-enters, and exclaims: "I am a quick dresser, you see."
               Sir Harry replies: "As I live, my lord, our London sparks will groan in envy at your suit; it is
                  glorious! superb!"
               "The last Parisian cut!" replies Philip.
               "'Sooth, you'll be more successful than ever in your heart affairs with such a
                  covering to help your face."
               Philip answers: "Yes, the dress is quite pretty; the quadruple slash on the
                  doublet is my own idea, as is also the bone-lace frill on the outer edging."
               "Possible?" exclaims Sir Harry, and he stoops to admire Philip's taste and
                  ingenuity. "It must have taken a deal of study to originate these devices."
               "Oh no—not for me!" Philip replies, and he jerks his swordbelt a trifle to the
                  right to make it lie more conformably to his waist.
               "Where shall we go?" queries Sir Harry.
               "Wherever you wish. Yet stay—I have a message from a friend in Paris which I
                  promised to deliver as soon as possible. Let us to court, and see the great George
                  and his greater mistresses."
               "As you say, my lord," replies Sir Harry. "His majesty's ministers hold a levee
                  to-day."
               They walk together arm in arm, feathers flying and spurs tinkling. As they proceed
                  on their way to the cockpit at Whitehall, Philip meets many of his former friends,
                  all of whom are delighted at his return, and speak in high terms of his increased
                  good looks and manlier bearing; which compliments he returns so profusely that
                  even were those to whom he speaks enemies they must become his friends; for Philip
                  possesses all his father's powers of cajoling and flattering, and whom he wishes
                  to be his friend, he can make so, often in spite of himself.
               "Harry," says Philip, "I think I'll change my mind, and defer my visit to the
                  wiseacres. You will not be offended at it, I know?"
               Sir Harry replies with a smile: "Faith! no. On the contrary, I feel quite
                  relieved—as if an incubus were taken off my mind."
               They retrace their steps, and Philip proposes a trip to Hampton Court, to which
                  Sir Harry agrees, and they proceed to one of the many water-stairs in the vicinity
                  of the palace, and engage a wherry. The day is delightful, and the sun showers its
                  genial warmth over all. A soft breeze ripples the swelling surface of the water;
                  and the foam which the wherry's prow makes under the strokes of the athletic
                  oarsman flies to their faces in cool, silvery spray. Noble elms and beach trees
                  slope down to the water's edge on either side, and throw a deep shade in by the
                  banks where numerous parties lie in their roomy wherries, and flirt, play on the
                  cithern, dilate on the new brocade, marvel at the fine flavor of Mistress Jonson's
                  tea, or explain the last passado or entréchat brought from Paris.
               Away they go—past imposing mansions and modest cottages—past loving couples who
                  saunter the walks so absorbed in themselves that they are ignorant of the
                  amusement which they give to the spectators of their innocent diversion—and past
                  lumbering ships which float the wealth of the prolific Indies to our colder, less
                  productive clime. Both Philip and Sir Harry doff their hats ceremoniously as a
                  gayly decorated bark shoots by manned by three burly watermen. The coronet
                  emblazoned on their right arms evinces that the fair occupant may boast the
                     sangre azul of poet's parlance. She is the
                  loveliest woman in all London who has just passed them—Mary Bellenden. Her cheeks
                  are like the mellow half of a ripe peach, her lips as red as the wild sumac of the
                  American colonies. Her eyes are as blue as the sweet wild violet, and her hair is
                  the rich chestnut so usual among English girls. Her virtue and goodness are well known. She is much courted in
                  society and even the prince had made some overtures to her a short time since,
                  which she had indignantly rejected, and told him, with fiery looks and burning
                  cheeks, "Prince! I tell you that Mary Bellenden could not turn Mistress to the man
                  she loves—much less to one she hates!"
               Says Philip: "S'life! Harry! I saw a few beauties at the court over the water; but
                  Mistress Bellenden pales them all. Even in my dreams, I have never seen such
                  perfect loveliness." He stops, and an angry shade crosses his brow, as he adds to
                  himself: "If I had not been such an arrant dolt, I might have honored Mistress
                  Bellenden myself."
               "Yes, my lord!" interpolates Sir Harry; "and her temper matches her looks, as our
                  virtuous Prince found out to his cost!"
               Philip adds, in a disgusted manner: "Faugh—the Dutchman! He thought he had a
                  Kielmansegge, or one of that stripe to deal with. He has yet to learn our English
                  women! Apropos of women—have you heard aught of
                  Lady Wharton or General Holmes since I have been away? I have not had a letter
                  from them since I left for the continent."
               This is false, for he received several, but did not answer them, nor in some cases
                  even read them during his riotous career in Paris.
               Sir Harry replies: "No, my lord, but I know that they are both in the country
                  somewhere, and tolerably well!"
               "I shall have to run over to Bucks, ere long."
               "Hampton! my lords!" cries the waterman, as the boat's keel grates on the clean
                  sand. And now there ensues a good-natured dispute between Philip and Sir Harry as
                  to the right to pay the man; who shrewdly settles it by saying: "Troth! yer
                  lordships can both pay me; d'ye see?" They smile at his new way of settling a
                  dispute, and the fellow receives double his fare for his impudence.
               They proceed to the Palace, and are ushered in with the etiquette and ceremony
                  usual in such cases—a description of which would only be tiresome and
                  profitless.
               Attracted by the laughter and merriment proceeding from a room to the left of the
                  wide vestibule, they enter, Philip leading the way. There are present about a
                  dozen ladies and fully as many gentlemen, busily engaged in chatting and flirting,
                  talking politics or scandal, and sipping Souchong out of large, shallow saucers,
                  or drinking wine from cut-glass goblets. Philip is at home in such places, and he
                  is soon surrounded by an admiring party. Lady Deloraine congratulates him on his
                  return, and inquires, with a significant glance, about his wife. She is a graceful
                  woman, slightly built, but easy and unconstrained in her movements. Her face is
                  pleasing and attractive, and her prominent chin and bright eyes show that her
                  temper is none of the mildest. As an instance of it, you shall hear of her reply
                  to the Countess of Buckenburgh—a retort which is even now the subject of
                  conversation among a few of the scandal lovers who are here. While she was in the
                  royal presence yesterday, the Countess had said, in the hearing of his majesty and
                  Lady Deloraine: "These English women do not look like women of quality; they ever
                  have their eyes on their feet, and always look in a fright; whereas our
                  countrywomen hold up their heads and hold out their bodies, and they make
                  themselves look great and stately, and more like quality than the poor English
                  women." To which Lady Deloraine replied in a loud voice: "We show our quality by
                  our birth and breeding, madame, and not
                  by sticking out our bosoms, and making the throne shake with our strides!"*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *The Countess of Buckenburgh was very stout, and her tread was remarkably
                     heavy, while her long strides were the occasion of many a laugh at her
                     expense.
               
               Lord Harborough is sipping Souchong and exchanging bonmots with Mistress
                  Nostitz—the Polish Envoy's lady—a sparkling, witty little body, with very black
                  eyes and a dazzling white skin. M. Nostitz might have felt justifiably jealous if
                  he were about, to notice how warmly my lord regards her, and with what
                  affectionate solicitude his hand rests on her arm; however, as the action is
                  unknown to all but themselves, the lady demurely allows it to remain there,
                  amiably unconscious of the audacity.
               "Ha! ha!" laughs Sir Harry, in a low voice. "Behold la Grenouille. Let us go over
                  and talk to her! She is in the sulks, and I'll coranto for an hour if she fails to
                  amuse you."
               Nothing loth, Philip steps across the room to where Madame Robethon sits alone
                  with an angry scowl on her low forehead. Her cheeks are fat and shaky, and she has
                  innumerable chins which rest on her almost invisible neck; while the way in which
                  she is sitting is ludicrously suggestive of an immense toad, for her eyes are dull
                  and watery, and her mouth——Pope! aid me to a simile!
               "Ah, Madame Robethon, how is your health to-day? Good, I hope? for, when you are
                  unwell, England moans the illness of one of the few beauties who adorn her
                  sea-girt shores, and cause less favored countries to grow green with envy!"
               "Ach! milord Wharton, you speak untruth with me!" she rejoins angrily.
               Philip lays his hand on his breast in an earnest manner ner as he replies:
                  "Madame, I feel your cold, cutting sarcasm in my very marrow!"
               She half bounces from her seat as she exclaims, "Marry? Mein Gott! You haf too
                  good a wife now for—" and the remainder of her words are lost in the peal of
                  laughter which the rest of the company find it impossible to repress; and really
                  her croaking voice, her shaking body, and her squat rotundity are enough to excite
                  the risibles of St. Dominic himself.
               After about an hour's conversation with Lord Harbrough—who has vainly attempted to
                  probe his views on the ministry, for Philip has seen his design, and foiled him
                  with double-edged answers which might mean yes or no, and which have perplexed his
                  questioner with their ready wit and nonchalant reprising—he motions to Sir Harry,
                  and they retire from the room. He says in a careless, off-hand manner: "Well,
                  Harry! I feel as if a trip into the country would do me good! I think of going to
                  Bucks, and rusticating amid the Phillises and Corydons of my native village. Town
                  dissipation is telling on my nerves; I need solitude and fresh air to recuperate
                  my flagging energies."
               "Recuperate! my lord. 'Faith, if I had half your energy, I would count myself a
                  lucky man! Your face is fresh and rosy, and your long, quick step half kills
                  me."
               Philip replies: "Yes, my constitution is good, I admit; but it could be better:
                  moreover, I want to see her ladyship and her stern old father, who once on a time
                  gave me a mighty severe raking."
               "For some practical joke you played on his venerable person, I presume, or an
                  intrigue that shocked his ideas of morality and virtue. Speaking of intrigues, did
                  you ever hear the story of your respected father and a Nelly Valentin?"
               
               Philip thinks a moment, and replies: "Nelly Valentin? I have heard that name
                  before; but my memory fails me in regard to the circumstance. Yet when I think of
                  it, I recollect that I once received a vile scrawl signed by a gypsy—whom I permit
                  to live on my estate—who demanded a thousand guineas or threatened me with some
                  vague but dire vengeance. I was mad at the time it came, and I paid but little
                  attention to it, except to order the scaramouch mercury to depart."
               "The same, probably, but of that particular incident I was ignorant; but I may as
                  well tell you the whole story as we go along, unless indeed you have something
                  better with which to pass the time. This Nelly Valentin—"
               A man soberly clad, whose face is partly concealed by a broad-brimmed hat, and who
                  has appeared to dog Philip and his friend for some time, now draws closer to
                  them.
               "Was a rustic beauty," continues Sir Harry, "whom your father saw and—"
               "And God's curse on him for the vile deed!" hisses rather than speaks Edgely
                  Valentin, who has heard Sir Harry's every word; and he throws off his hat and
                  reveals himself to the astonished gaze of Philip, who thought him in Paris; while
                  Sir Harry half draws his rapier, and glares in a puzzled manner at the insolent
                  intruder.
               "Nelly Valentin!—Edgely Valentin!" exclaims Philip, and a sudden light breaks in
                  on his mind. "This man must be a relative of hers, who is rightly enraged at our
                  jesting over Mistress Nellie's disgrace: particularly as I am the son of her
                  betrayer!" He exclaims haughtily: "Master Valentin, your insolence deserves a
                  severe chastisement. However, if the lady of whom we spoke is any kin to you, we
                  apologize, and promise you that we will not renew the conversation until you are
                  without earshot."
               "Any kin!" he sneers, and his face grows livid with his great passion. "I would
                  give up my life if her seducer could appear before me! He should know what a
                  gall-hearted, lying villain I deem him!" and he gripes the pommel of his heavy
                  sword until his hand is white with the strain.
               "A God's life, sirrah!" exclaims Philip; "this is insolence with a vengeance! A
                  good thrashing from my servant would cure the ill humor that plagues you!" and
                  Philip looks sternly at him; but he proceeds in a softened strain as the thought
                  passes through his mind, how he would feel under like circumstances: "Come, my
                  good man, you have now aired your opinion of my dead father—an opinion which he
                  doubtless merited; and your best plan now is to decamp with a whole skin and be
                  thankful for my forbearance."
               "Yes," chimes in Sir Harry. "If I had thought you were a gentleman, you should
                  have felt the new Italian passado tickle your scandalizing gullet. As it is—I
                  leave you your life."
               Edgely Valentin looks scornfully from one to the other as he replies: "Good lack,
                  my lords! 'Tis a pity I have no title to stick to the front of my good name, or I
                  should, as you desire, be gratified with a sight of your steel; and more pity 'tis
                  that my blood would disgrace your weapons." He picks up his hat again, draws it
                  over his face with a savage jerk, and walks rapidly away.
               "S'life, Harry!" says Philip, with a laugh, "we must tear reputations to pieces in
                  a more secret manner, if we would avoid a repetition of such scenes, for which, to
                  tell the truth, I have but little stomach."
               "Umph!" grumbles Sir Harry: "if we cannot talk of a far-away country lass but a
                  defender springs up in the shape of a
                  sad-garbed clown, what shall we do in town, where every woman has so many
                  relatives—right-handed or otherwise?" And he finishes the story that had been
                  interrupted, and Philip chuckles admiringly at his father's adroitness. An erring
                  son can find a real consolation in the faux-pas
                  of his lamented sire.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXII.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Then all for women, painting, rhyming, drinking,
                           Besides ten thousand freaks that died in thinking.
                           Blest madman, who could every hour employ
                           With something new to wish or to enjoy!"
                        
                     
                     DRYDEN.
                  
               
               PHILIP does not enter by the usual gateway, but leaps his horse over a low stone
                  wall, and lands in the forest a few yards distant from Elm avenue, pushing forward
                  toward the old trysting-place—once the loadstar of his thoughts; he draws rein and
                  springs from his saddle:—
               "Margery Holmes—Margery Wharton!—I did not think the difference had been so great,
                  or I would not have dispelled my love-dream by such a common-place means as
                  marriage. Poor girl!" and a remorseful pang shoots across his heart as he rests
                  his hand against the same seat on which they once sat by the hour together and
                  where she had leaned her dear head on his shoulder which had trembled with its
                  precious burthen. Here, he pressed her soft lips with kisses that sunk down to her
                  heart, and left their traces in a deep, unchangeable love. He thinks of the night
                  when she sprang into his arms with that little sob of joy and grief, and told him
                  with a tearful smile that he could do with her as he wished; and every little
                  circumstance and incident of that meeting ing—even to the tearful glisten of her
                  eyes in the moonlight—surges up in his mind. He gulps down some obstruction in his
                  throat, and mounts his horse in a slow, dispirited manner. Suddenly he strikes the
                  spurs deep into her sides, and the animal leaps so violently that she nearly
                  unseats him, despite his perfect horse-manship; "Steady—steady, Het!" he exclaims,
                  and at the sound of his voice she calms down, but still proceeds at a quick pace
                  until he checks her at the Weird's Cave, where he takes a long look around before
                  he again sets off toward the Castle.
               His home appears desolate and cheerless to him now, for there is neither a father
                  nor a mother to welcome him with a grasp of the hand or an embrace. He looks
                  wistfully at the window where his mother would have been, and his eyes grow
                  brighter, and their lids grow tremulous. He glances cautiously about to see
                  whether there are any watchers; then, satisfied that he is unobserved, he angrily
                  dashes off his cheek a tear, which would come whether or no; for his young heart
                  yearns for his dead parents.
               A minute, and he is at the lodge-door, and he draws a long, deep breath, places
                  his hand to his mouth in hunter fashion, and screams in piercing tones the
                  view-halloo. The door opens with wonderful rapidity, and Shem's honest face and
                  curly pate protrude in questioning wonder. "Well, Shem!" exclaims Philip, and he
                  grasps Shem's hand with a hearty shake.
               Shem is thunderstruck for a moment, but finally releases Philip's hand, bends his
                  knee, and begins to address a welcome to his master in the words of an old formula
                  which is customary on these occasions; Philip interrupts: "Up, Shem, up! Never
                  mind your welcome. Your face is a better index to your heart than the words of a musty old parchment. Where's Debbie
                  and Brad? Call them at once!"
               In spite of Philip's command Shem remains stolidly in the same position until he
                  "has had his say," then he hurrahs with a rare good-will, and quickly reaches for
                  his hunting horn, upon which he performs such a shrill, far-reaching call that the
                  very lodge shakes with the air's vibrations. "That 'ull bring 'em, my lord! Rebeck
                  me, but your lordship has grown tall and big sin' you left for furrin pairts."
               "Good sakes, Master Philip! have ye come back at last! Gie me a buss for the sake
                  o' old times when you an' Brad were dandled on the same lap! good sakes! how
                  weel-favored ye've grown, to be sure!" exclaims Debbie in a breath; while Brad
                  stands in the background with his mouth opened in a smile, and his eyes sparkling
                  an eager welcome to his former playmate and yet dreading to come forward for fear
                  of "makin' a fule o' himsel'," as he afterwards explained. Philip notices his
                  hesitation, and with kindly tact he goes up to him and shakes him by the hand, and
                  inquires about his wife Meg Throck, the former Meg Busbie, who is well and happy.
                  He then says: "I must leave you now, for I want to run over to Holme Grange!"
               "Ay, do!" adds Debbie; a warning glance from Shem, however, and she holds her
                  tongue.
               "You must consider my visit as a secret not to be divulged, for I return to London
                  to-morrow, and I have no time to spare—not even enough to sleep one night in my
                  former chamber; and as I shall not be able to see you again before I go, I'll bid
                  you—'good-bye,' and my blessings on all of you. And Brad! give my love to Meg, and
                  tell her that when I come again I shall pay her a visit!"
               As he approaches the Grange, he rides more slowly until his champing, restless
                  horse proceeds at a pace more in accordance with a funeral than a proposed meeting
                  with a loving wife. He is now behind the bushes whence he looked out on her one
                  well-remembered night; and with an exclamation at the uneasy movements of his
                  horse, he springs from the saddle. At first his step is slow; now he strikes out
                  at a quick step straight up to the low window where Margery used to sit, and play
                  with her spaniel or converse with her father.
               No one is about, and the room is very dark; for the heavy curtains are drawn, and
                  they keep out the light. He steps inside and remains motionless for a moment until
                  his eyes have become accustomed to the darkness. Now he can see distinctly; and
                  his quick, stifled breath shows that he recognizes the form which lies on the
                  blue-velvet lounge under the bay window. Stepping noiselessly to the window he
                  half draws one of the curtains, and a broad ribbon of pink light falls athwart
                  Margery's face. She looks more like a marble effigy than a living, breathing girl;
                  the lily has vanquished the roses on her cheeks and left them pale and waxen. Her
                  lips are tightly closed, while the corners of her mouth are drawn and curved as
                  though she dreams of some sorrowful thing. Her sunlit hair falls in fragrant
                  tresses on the dark velvet, and undulates and glitters golden-like on her fair
                  neck and bosom, which rises and falls in irregular starts as though she has a
                  half-consciousness of the presence of an intruder.
               Philip kneels down by her side, and looks at her long and tenderly, until, no
                  longer able to control the power of his newly-awakened love, he put his arms
                  around her waist and draws her to his breast, while his lips touch hers with a
                  kiss so passionate that she screams in affright, and wakes to find herself in
                  Philip's arms. "Philip!" she exclaims, and her body becomes cold, and heavier
                     than before, and she is unconscious;
                  at this juncture Philip hears the General's well-known step coming toward him, and
                  he awaits the denouement in some anxiety.
               "Margery! Margery!—I'm sure she called—Margery!"
               Philip, disengaging himself, faces Holmes, and says calmly: "Well, General! Philip
                  has returned, you see!"
               "Bilboes and lobedoes! my dear, dear boy;" he exclaims, in excited gladness. "Why
                  did you outflank me in this manner? If I had known, you should have been met with
                  all the honors of Holme Grange. Have you seen Margery?" he goes to the lounge and
                  endeavors to rouse her, thinking that she is still asleep, and Philip does not
                  undeceive him. "Wake, Margery, hinny! Here is somebody—Heavens! she is dead!
                  Philip, Philip! come here! Have you—"
               Philip adds: "She knows I am here, General! She fainted when I showed myself to
                  her."
               Holmes looks relieved at the explanation, and replies: "That's all, eh? All right,
                  then; here—" and he calls for a servant to bring in the lights and iced wine for
                  "Mistress Margery."
               For a time ensues confusion worse confounded by the General's impetuous movements,
                  and his excitement at the return of his daughter's husband. Margery has recovered,
                  but she is still too weak to stand, and she is half reclining on the lounge with
                  eyes all ablaze and a glorious color in her cheeks; whilst Philip gives an outline
                  of his wanderings abroad, and as he finishes, she says pleadingly: "You will never
                  go away again, Philip? I have been so lonely here, even with father."
               The General adds: "Yes, stick to home and us now. You are surely tired of
                  travelling by this time."
               "Yes, I am," replies Philip, "but I really must set out for Dublin in a few days.
                  I have political business to attend to there which I shall shirk as much as
                  possible, you may be sure."
               Margery's face grows troubled as she hears this intelligence, and the color slowly
                  fades away from her cheeks.
               By this time Philip has recovered his equanimity, and he begins to blame himself
                  for having a hand in so theatrical a display as he has himself created. The
                  General goes to the door, and apologizes for his departure, and now Philip and his
                  wife are alone together. She rises from the lounge, and sits down on a footstool
                  close beside him. She looks up into his face so long and anxiously that Philip
                  begins to feel guilty and embarrassed, and to break the painful silence, he says:
                  "Sweetheart, tell me what you have done during my absence."
               The old smile momentarily dimples her cheeks as she replies: "Always call me
                  sweetheart, Philip dear! It sounds like Rooksnest and the dark, cool avenue. The
                  time has dragged—but never mind, darling! You are with me now, and I am happy—so
                  happy." And she hides her face on his knees to conceal her tears of joy.
               Philip elevates his eyebrows, shrugs his shoulders, and mutters, "As bad as ever,
                  curse me!"
               She lifts her bright eyes to his face, and says, in a voice which is deep and
                  thrilling with repressed emotion: "Did you speak, darling?"
               "No, Margery; I was but thinking!"
               "Of me?" she asks.
               "Yes, Margery, of you!"
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXIII.
               
                  
                     
                        ——Took proper principles to thrive:——
                     
                     SWIFT'S "LIBEL."
                  
               
               THE gypsy queen still holds her court in the forest's heart, but Maldran Gudru is
                  there no longer. He has been disgraced, and expelled the camp for two years as the
                  penalty of insulting his royal mistress. When he returned from his errand in
                  London and told her of its fruitlessness, she reproached him for his lack of
                  energy and idleness, to which he replied in an insolent manner which angered her
                  so much that she struck him on the mouth with her hand, and he caught her by the
                  neck in his blind rage, and tried to throw her down. In return she drove her
                  four-edged poniard through his traitorous arm, signalled for help, and Maldran was
                  disgraced.
               Philip feels a passing desire to view once more the forest camp, where he
                  gambolled and played at hide-and-seek with his tawny, ragged playmates; and he is
                  now walking thither. The day is clear, cold, and bracing, and the keen north wind
                  rushes down the lungs icy-cold and nipping. He enters the camp, and unperceived
                  walks to the queen's tent by a back path with which he is familiar, and he calls
                  in a low voice, "Queenie! queenie!!" The door opens at the summons, and the queen
                  ejaculates in surprise, "My lord!" "Yes, queenie!" he replies, and he catches her
                  in his arms and salutes her with rather more fervor perchance than friendship
                  alone calls for, and so she thinks, for as she disengages herself, she exclaims,
                  "For shame, my lord; you almost squeezed the life out o'me. Recollect that ye are
                  not the little Philip of other days now, but a grown gentleman, an' ower old to
                  kiss an' hug me as ye used to do!"
               He laughs at her remonstrance, and replies: "You are in a bad temper this morning,
                  queenie!"
               Her face clouds with a moody expression as she answers, "Am I? Mayhap I have
                  cause."
               Philip is about to put his arm around her waist, when she shrinks from him with a
                  gesture of dislike, and cries: "Stop, my lord! I care not for such fooleries!"
               "The more fool you!" he retorts, nettled at her petulance. "I thought you would
                  like to see me ere I left for Ireland; but as I am not welcome I'll go away as
                  quickly as I came!"
               "One minute, my lord!" she says, and she lays her hand on his arm. "I have
                  something to say which ye must hear before ye leave queenie."
               Philip is a little surprised at her words, and ascribes them to some whim or
                  freak, but willing to humor her, he waits for her to proceed.
               "My lord, I did not ask ye to break bread or sup wine wi' me when ye came in. This
                  is the reason. Your father—"
               But it is useless to narrate her words, for we know her story. As she finishes
                  Philip cries: "A plague on these Valentins! Wherever I go, it is Valentin!—in
                  Avignon, in Paris, in London, and now here on my own estate. A thousand guineas
                  were a small sum to be rid of this tiresome persecution. Send to Shem Throck's for
                  it to-morrow, and it will be there. I pity the poor woman; but s'life I do not see
                  why my father's peccadilloes should be punished through me! A fico for your
                  'vengeance,' as you so magniloquently term it. I give the money out of pure
                  charity to Mistress Valentin. I can go
                  now, I suppose—eh, queenie? Come! give me a kiss for my good-nature; I deserve
                  one!"
               Her face is brighter now, and she smiles demurely as she replies, "My lord has a
                  right to poach on his own manor when he chooses!"
               Philip requires no other permission, and he presses his lips on hers again and
                  again until she repulses him with a good-natured scolding. "Good-bye, queenie! I
                  am going over to your Irish cousins, now, and maybe you will never see me
                  again."
               The General is up and walking briskly about in the garden for the sake of his
                  health, and, as he expresses it, "to keep my sword-belt from growing too small."
                  But Margery still sleeps, for it was very late ere she could compose herself after
                  the exciting event of the previous day. Philip informs the General of his
                  intention to start for Dublin at once, and bids him good-bye amid his half-angry
                  protestations and entreaties; and he tells him that he will go up to see Margery
                  in her room.
               "Well! if you will go, bless you, my boy, and let your shadow darken my gate again
                  as soon as possible."
               Philip steps lightly to the bedside, and sees that Margery is sound asleep. He
                  opens his escritoire, and hurriedly writes a short letter in which he tells her
                  that he "leaves her in this manner in order to spare her the pain of a parting,
                  and that he will soon return, or else send for her;" he finishes with, "Good-bye,
                  wifie! I kissed you adieu whilst you slept, so that you might dream of me: for
                  Debbie used to tell me that 'a sleeping person kissed will dream of the kisser.'
                  Hoping that the saying is true, I bid you good-bye for a short time." He lays the
                  letter gently on her bosom, touches her lips very lightly, and goes softly down
                  the stairs and through the hallway to the front of the Grange, where his horse
                  stands ready saddled and bridled. He shakes hands with the General once more,
                  vaults into the saddle, and off he gallops at full speed! Away—down the avenue,
                  through the forest, across the meadow lands and hunting-ground—he flies, fearing
                  that Margery may awake and send after him; for tearful partings are "mightily apt
                  to disturb one's equanimity and enjoyment!"
               While in London Philip had endeavored to take his seat in parliament, but being
                  under age he was ineligible, and to his extreme chagrin and regret he found that
                  his aspirations for political honors were foiled, at least in England. His fertile
                  mind had other resources, however, and he determined to go to Ireland, and see
                  whether the more hot-blooded, mercurial Shamrockites would have the same objection
                  to receive him as their English brethren, for his Irish peerage entitles him to a
                  seat in their house. Of course he is ineligible there, also, if his peers see fit
                  to make him so; but he is hopeful and sanguine, and he has great confidence in his
                  powers of persuasion over the impressionable people whom he purposes to honor with
                  his person. As he pushes forward at a quick gallop, which sends his young blood
                  tingling joyously through his veins, he soliloquizes: "If I cannot gain my point
                  there, I am beaten for a couple of years! But I cannot, will not fail, for, young
                  as I am, I feel certain that I can topple over half the arguments and decisions
                  that are given there, provided they are no better than are those delivered and
                  registered by our London orators and judges. They say in Ireland that a steel
                  point must prop a hard word, which is certainly a point in my favor; for if such
                  is the case they must all be gentlemen, either from nature or necessity." His mind
                  gloats on the future when he will be, as his father and Harley and Stanhope were
                  before him, the cynosure of an admiring people, and the leader of an enthusiastic
                  parliament who will applaud his tactics or compliment him on his wit, learning, and bravery; and his
                  heart throbs an Io Triumphe in the glorious
                  anticipation of the future.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXIV.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Thus, with each gift of nature and of art,
                           And wanting nothing but an honest heart.
                        
                     
                     POPE'S "WHARTON."
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        He must be greater than his sire:—
                     
                     SWIFT.
                  
               
               PHILIP is soon a great favorite in Dublin, with both Whigs and Tories, for his
                  daring, his generosity, and his great powers of drinking, frolicking, and
                  conversing. He is unanimously admitted to the House, where—to every body's
                  surprise and possibly his own—he turns sides and becomes as violent a Whig as
                  before he was a Tory.
               He finishes his maiden speech with these words: "My only thought will be to
                  support the ministry, the government, and to advocate the Orange cause." It
                  abounds in terse reasoning, strong arguments, and scathing sarcasm against the
                  Opposition; and it is adorned with all the flowers of rhetoric and fancy. Cheer
                  upon cheer bursts from his excited listeners, which he acknowledges by a graceful
                  bow, and he takes his seat. His hand is grasped "many a time, and oft" before he
                  receives all the congratulations which are poured in on him. Says Lord Carnbregh,
                  a well-known orator and lawyer: "My lord, I heard your father when he was quite
                  young, and he was wonderful; but, if you continue as you have begun, you will
                  eclipse his achievements altogether."
               Philip's eyes glitter, and his cheeks flush as he replies: "My father led his
                  party in London. Sure I can do the same in Eblana?"
               His words sound prophetic, and as his audacious answer is circulated around, it is
                  received with cheers and laughter. A few veterans among them shake their heads
                  doubtingly at his words, but they are not heeded in the general hubbub and
                  brouhaha.
               That night Philip retired with his head in a whirl of exciting and ambitious
                  thoughts, engendered by his triumph at the House and the hearty applause of its
                  members. His sleep is broken and restless, and the sun still slumbers as he
                  arises, dresses himself, and strolls down to Liffey's banks. The river undulates
                  dark and dismal in the gray morning light, and he compares its dull, heavy surface
                  to his past life, which has been spent in riotous debaucheries and enervating
                  excesses that, for the time being, deadened and saddened him, mind and body. Now
                  ambition's sun lifts him above his former life, and makes him worthy of
                  commendation and admiration, as heaven's sun will brighten and beautify the now
                  murky Liffey.
               "If I had been by his death-bed, I know that his last words would have been:
                  'Philip, sustain my party!' And I will. I would rather see the Chevalier on his
                  throne; but as he is not there, and doubtless never will be, it is my duty as a
                  true Briton to uphold the government and stand by the ministry. No more shall it
                  be said of me that— 
                     
                        'I see the right and I approve it too,
                        Condemn the wrong, and yet the wrong pursue!'
                     
                   Now I'll pursue the right as well as see it, i'faith! 'Tis a pity though that
                  his majesty is so mightily Dutch, and keeps two such frowsies as Kendal and
                  Darlington continually by him—duplicate Grenouilles, devoid even of her sense and
                  passable acquirements—"
               "Your lordship is up betimes," interrupts Lord Hintflam, who has approached him
                  unobserved.
               
               Philip turns to him, and they converse on different subjects, the beauty of the
                  far-stretching bay, or pass remarks on the weather, until Philip, whose whole mind
                  is now absorbed in politics, says: "My lord, do you think it possible that his
                  majesty and the prince will ever be better friends than they are? Their bickerings
                  disgrace the country and scandalize its statesmen."
               "They will never be in amicable relations with each other. His majesty views the
                  prince with the deepest aversion. Do you recollect, when he set out for Hanover,
                  how he tried to prevent the prince from assuming the regency, and also his
                  dismissal of Argyle?—No, they can never be friends."
               Philip replies: "I recollect; his majesty's hatred and jealousy of him were the
                  talk of Paris."
               "Speaking of Argyle," continues Lord Hintflam, "the prince's connection with him
                  is indiscreet to the last degree, and only tends to widen the rupture!"
               Philip replies approvingly: "You are correct, my lord."
               A favorable criticism at which Hintflam seems rather nettled, and rejoins rather
                  pointedly: "I am glad you think so!"
               Philip nods assentingly, and resumes: "What do you think about Townshend?"
               "The prince's cat's paw," returns Hintflam.
               "Yes, he deserves his dismissal for his weakness and his utter lack of diplomacy.
                  It is unfortunate for us, though, for our only support now is Stanhope."
               Hintflam rejoins: "And he should have resigned on Townshend's dismissal."
               "Certainly not!" replies Philip, "Stanhope is right. Why should we lose two
                  supports because one is fallen?"
               "He ought to accept of Ireland. He will only increase bad feeling against him by a
                  refusal!"
               Philip replies: "Well, well; we must all do our best to keep our Tory friends
                  within bounds, or else they may send us under again."
               Philip's reason for ending the discussion so quickly is that he has just caught
                  sight of a very pretty girl crossing the muddy street which compels her to expose
                  a foot and ankle worthy of a Gaditana of sunny Spain. He is desirous of viewing
                  her at a closer distance, and hurriedly excuses himself to Lord Hintflam, and he
                  follows after the object of his desires at a leisurely pace in order not to
                  attract attention. She is tall, and magnificently proportioned. Her eyes are dark
                  hazel, and delightfully expressive; and her cherry lips look very inviting, while
                  there is that nameless grace about her which seems more fitted for the saloon than
                  the street—more suitable in a countess than in a lonely girl strolling about
                  Dublin at an early hour in the morning.
               She walks briskly on toward the cathedral—a noble structure of great antiquity,
                  and a mass of historical incidents, from the spire on the high sloping roof down
                  to the lowest dungeon of its underground vaults. As she enters the arched doorway,
                  she turns round and smiles coquettishly to Philip, who salutes her, and signs to
                  her to wait for him; but she declines to obey him, and goes inside. Nothing
                  daunted, Philip follows after her. The interior of the cathedral is solemnly
                  grand. The lofty ceiling is an immense, azure vault, dotted with golden stars;
                  while at regular distances the holy fathers look down from the dizzy height with a
                  saintly calmness on their grand faces. Around the extreme circle of the
                  ceiling—almost trenching on the walls—are rose-windows of warm, glowing colors,
                  which fleck the stone floor with mingling dashes and splashes of all the rainbow
                  colors and suffuse the quaint, crumbling, oaken stalls with a delicious
                  mellowness.
               Philip never asks himself why the unknown comes here. There is no service to-day, and the cathedral
                  is lonely and deserted. He walks up the centre aisle, and casts his eyes about in
                  search of her; but she is nowhere to be seen: "Faith! this is a good joke!—a woman
                  hiding from me in a church! ha-ha!" and he calls in a loud voice, "For mercy's
                  sake! my unknown siren, tell me where you are?"
               "If my Lord Wharton wishes to see me—lo, I am here!" she answers in musical,
                  mocking accents; and she walks towards him. Her face is concealed by a black silk
                  vizard, which she holds on with her left hand, extending to him her right. He
                  raises it to his lips, but she snatches it away, and exclaims: "My lord, I give
                  you my hand as a friend, not as a conquest! Your tour abroad has rendered you
                  conceited. You doubtless consider me as a prize whom your very good looks have
                  captivated—eh?"
               He is rather taken aback at her words, but he replies, with a look of profound
                  devotion, "Fair lady, such insolent presumption could not find a place in my
                  thoughts."
               She laughs as she replies: "Hoity-toity! Who dares to accuse his grace of
                  Northumberland of presumption?"
               Philip starts as he hears himself called by a title which he has not claimed since
                  his return to England: "None could lay such a charge to him merely for following a
                  lady in the streets, and then inflicting his presence on her in the house of
                  holiness." Rather piqued at her sarcastic manner, he angrily replies, "S'life,
                  I'll not inflict it any longer!" and he turns to leave her. But she
                  starts forward, and lays a little, white hand on his arm, and says, in a half
                  pleading manner, "Pardon me, your grace, I—"
               He turns so quickly that he strikes against her, and, to keep herself from
                  falling, she catches hold of his arm, whereat he is rather pleased than otherwise;
                  and, as an attentive cavalier, he thinks that he can support her better by putting
                  his arm around her waist. This little attention she declines, and she removes his
                  hand, and says, with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes, "For shame! you a married
                  man, and I a wife—perchance!"
               He replies with a sigh: "The first is unfortunately true, but under favor the last
                  is false!"
               "Many thanks for your grace's courtesy. Since you know so much, maybe you can tell
                  me who I am—my name, pedigree, and country?"
               "Madame," he says, "that is an impossibility, which is my misfortune, and which
                  will be your fault unless you enlighten me;" and he raises his hand to remove her
                  vizard; but she anticipates the movement by drawing back a step, and she holds her
                  taper finger up warningly as she exclaims: "Not yet! but I may tell you my name,
                  if you promise not to reveal it!"
               Of course he gives the promise, and a low, rich laugh displays her pearly teeth as
                  she replies, "Madame Grenouille!" He laughs aloud at the ludicrous images which
                  the name brings before his eyes; but his companion appears highly offended, and
                  she conducts herself in such an absurd manner that he is well nigh out of patience
                  with her. Finally she says, in a graver manner: "Let us seat ourselves in this
                  stall, and I will tell you truly about myself, and about others whom you may
                  know." He obeys her, and she proceeds: "Before I say any more, your grace must
                  give me your word of honor that all I say or do in our interview will go no
                  further than ourselves?"
               Philip hesitates a moment before he gives her the promise, for he resolves to stop
                  her if she has anything to reveal to him that is inconsistent with his honor to
                  keep secret.
               "My name is Nora O'Beirne;" here she pauses, removes her vizard, and draws a packet from her bosom. "I
                  have but just arrived from Madrid. You will find in this packet a letter of
                  introduction from my friend Mr. Bubb,*
                     and also a message from his eminence the Cardinal Alberoni!"
               
                  
                  *The British Minister at Madrid.
               
               He looks suspiciously around, but she reassures him with a gesture. He opens, and
                  reads the letter from Mr. Bubb first. In it the minister highly extols Mistress
                  O'Beirne, and praises her loyalty to the government—a recommendation well enough
                  by itself, but rather peculiar when coupled with a message from Alberoni—a man
                  whose gigantic mind and daring courage did not once quail when he singly defied
                  the combined powers of England, France, and Holland, and coolly insulted the
                  haughty court of Vienna.
               As he finishes reading the Cardinal's message, his head hums with vague thoughts
                  and half-formed projects. The wily priest, who is tolerably conversant with
                  Philip's character through the accounts of his emissaries in London, broaches to
                  "His Grace," in the most delicate manner, the advisability of "His Grace" resuming
                  his allegiance to "His Majesty James III.;" enlarges on the sufferings of the
                  exiled monarch; sneers at the "happy Dutch family;" and offers him, if he will
                  support the Jacobite cause, the command of a large Spanish troop, an order of
                  knighthood in the highest order of Spain, and a large amount of money and
                  jewels.
               As Philip opened the message, Mistress O'Beirne leaves him, apparently to examine
                  the many tombs on the opposite side of the aisle; but she momentarily casts
                  stealthy glances at him, and anxiously waits for him to finish. She looks
                  perplexed and doubtful, and her fan trembles slightly in her hand. Philip's good
                  resolutions almost melt away at the Cardinal's promises, and he tries to balance
                  the advantages of the two positions with strict impartiality—a loyal Whig, or a
                  traitorous Tory? On the one side his estates and future wealth will be
                  confiscated, and his name attainted. On the other, he will reap glory at the head
                  of an army, receive a coveted order of knighthood, and a large sum of ready
                  money—an important item, for he cannot yet have full control of his properties,
                  and, although his allowance is large, his expenses are far beyond it.
               For nearly an hour does he think over the Cardinal's proposition without coming to
                  a decision. "If I but loved George more and James less, my mind would be easy in
                  quick time; but one the —— S'life, I'll leave the issue to Dame Fortune in the
                  shape of Mistress O'Beirne." And he calls to her, and says:—
               "Mistress O'Beirne, Mr. Bubb's letter is a blind, I suppose?"
               She nods assent.
               "Alb—, the other, is the real cause of your embassy?" Again she nods.
               "Very well! Now I will take my dagger, and scratch two marks on this flag;" she
                  looks surprised at his manœuvres, but follows his motions with watchful eyes. He
                  continues: "My opinions are so exactly balanced, Mistress O'Beirne, that I intend
                  to let fortune decide whether I shall be Hanoverian or Jacobite." She is amused in
                  spite of her anxiety to secure him for her employer, and she laughs nervously.
                  Philip resumes: "One of these scratches will turn me Jacobite; the other will keep
                  me Hanoverian. I will be that which your pretty foot shall first touch." He
                  scratches two long lines on the stone flag, and moves a few steps backward. She
                  replies: "I entreat your grace to consider the question more seriously! you—"
               He shakes his head and points calmly to the scratches. She flushes, as she resumes with a forced smile:
                  "Really, your grace affects an odd way of determining a choice in which loyalty,
                  fame, and pecuniary rewards are pitted against a fancied attachment to a Dutch
                  usurper! But if you will have it so—Holy Mary, help me to save your grace from an
                  inglorious disloyalty to your true king!" She places her foot on the scratch
                  nearest Philip.
               "Is that your choice, Mistress O'Beirne?" he asks, with a half relieved expression
                  on his face.
               "Yes, your grace," she replies, and her face becomes slightly paler and
                  anxious.
               "Then long live —— King George, and success to the Hanoverian line!"
               She turns scarlet at his words, and exclaims: "Lost! and Alberoni foiled by a
                  farcical 'chance'——His Eminence's message, your grace?"
               "Here it is!" he replies, and he turns to pick it up from the seat of a stall on
                  which he left it; but it has disappeared. She notices his start, and exclaims:
                  "Your grace, that letter must be found! Your have dealt fairly by me, and I have
                  lost, and I would not like to see your grace impeached for high treason, as you
                  certainly would be if that letter were to fall into the hands of an enemy to
                  you."
               He replies earnestly: "Yes, it must be found; it cannot be far away!"
               But it cannot be found. High and low they seek for it, but all their efforts are
                  in vain, and finally they are forced to come to the disagreeable conclusion that
                  it is lost.
               "Your grace," says Mistress O'Beirne, in a bitter, regretful tone, "it is useless
                  for me to urge you further. His Eminence has explained to you all the advantages
                  that you can gain by returning to your true allegiance; and as my unlucky mission
                  is accomplished I will return to Madrid, and encounter his reproaches for my
                  unfortunate failure. I shall probably never see you again; so I will bid you
                  good-bye, and wish you every success in your mistaken future."
               She extends her hand, which he presses kindly, draws her veil over her face, and
                  walks slowly down the aisle and disappears through the open doors.
               In consequence of the triple alliance, the Pretender was forced to cross the Alps
                  and reside in Rome under the shadow of the Pontifical cloak. While there, Alberoni
                  corresponded directly with him, and urged him to rouse all his energies for
                  another invasion of England, which should be headed either by himself or Ormond,
                  and he also sent him many assurances of the king's warmest sympathy and
                  assistance. In Spain Philip is governed alternately by his confessor and by his
                  mistress, the black-eyed, laughing Señorita Dona Inez, who in turn are the queen's
                  tools, whom Alberoni moves to his will like a jointed puppet. In disposition and
                  temper Philip is very like the Pretender, but with even less honor and energy. But
                  even if he had more energy and self-reliance, the former country curate would
                  doubtless absorb them in his own impetuous genius, except indeed he possessed a
                  Cromwell's iron mind and unswervable will.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXV.
               Pro tempore.
               PHILIP'S career in the Irish Parliament reads like a romance. Never, in the annals
                  of Irish history, had there been an admission under age except in this instance.
                  His winning address, oratorical powers, and his wonderfully precocious talents are
                  the talk of London as well as Dublin. Wherever he goes, he is sure to meet with a
                  flattering welcome and the attention of old and young; for his power of adapting
                  himself to the capacity of those with whom he is thrown in contact causes all to
                  respect and love him, from the enthusiastic lad still in his teens to the veteran
                  politician or lawyer. The Whigs speak of him as their future leader, and prophesy
                  great things of him. His past offences are now regarded as the mere coruscations
                  of the too forward intellect, and are condoned accordingly. In various discussions
                  an which he has taken part in the House, his arguments have been so clear and
                  conclusive, his delivery and reasoning so admirable, that the side on which he has
                  thrown his voice has been uniformly successful.
               The government, anxious to show its appreciation of his services in defending a
                  bill of vital importance to them, has created him Duke of Wharton, and moreover
                  set forth in the patent that "this is but an earnest of still further favors which
                  you may reap if you continue in the course you have begun." His private life has
                  been almost irreproachable. Margery has been living with him for the last year and
                  a half in an uninterrupted state of domestic felicity. To Philip's great joy she
                  promises soon to be a mother. Under these circumstances, he proposes to her that
                  she shall return to Bucks for awhile, where he will follow her in a week or so—a
                  proposition to which she unwillingly acquiesced for she dreads to be away from
                  him.
               We will enter and view our reformed rake in the light of a good husband and a
                  steady Whig. The room is fitted up in the most expensive, even extravagant manner,
                  and the different ornaments and curiosities in it evince an oddly fantastic, but
                  refined taste. It is not cold, but a glowing fire crackles on the hearth and
                  diffuses an aromatic odor of sandal-wood and cedar—woods which Philip is fond of
                  smelling, and burns accordingly. A round, ebony table, whose surface is a clear,
                  polished slab of steel, is drawn near the fragrant blaze, and beside it sits
                  Philip and Margery conversing about her intended departure. He passes his hand
                  down her cheek, and says in an anxious voice: "Margery, you look unwell—feverish.
                  Let me ring for a dish of tea!" and he taps on a little silver bell, and the
                  summons is answered immediately by a liveried lackey. "Her grace wishes a dish of
                  tea; and, hark ye, bring a decanter of brandy with it!"
               "Yes, your grace!"
               "Philip," says Margery, as the door closes, "why do you drink that fiery stuff? In
                  time it will surely make you nervous and irritable."
               He answers with a laugh: "In that case, wifie, I shall be reduced to the dire
                  necessity of physicking myself with a decoction of hicra-picra and aqua vita. But
                  I'll risk it for the sake of the grapy flavor the brandy leaves in my throat."
               "I never knew you were so fond of the grape before, Philip. I'll get you tons of
                  them if you will give up the brandy!"
                  And she looks triumphant, as if her point is gained; but he replies:—
               "You argue well, my little lawyer; but your case is lost! I prefer my brandy and
                  grapes together, for, as the axiom says, 'In toto et pars
                     continentur!'"
               The lackey returns, and carefully spreads a damask cover on the steel surface
                  before he lays on it the waiter, on which stand in company the brandy and the tea
                  with a dish of caraways. Philip swallows a glass of the former, nibbles at a cake,
                  and stretches himself lazily back in his chair. He is more manly now, and his
                  moustaches have some pretence of visibility and tangibility.
               "What have you been doing all day, Margery?"
               "Everything," she laughingly replies. "Let me see! I was dressed—I breakfasted—oh!
                  do stop asking me tiresome questions, Philip. I want to enjoy my tea quietly."
               "Ah, I see; you 've been as usual busy about nothing."
               She replies pettishly: "You were not admitted to the sight, at any rate, so you
                  need not laugh!"
               Margery looks very lovable as she nestles in the cosey arm-chair and extends her
                  slippered feet to the crumbling logs. This night she keeps entirely for Philip and
                  herself, and her instructions to the servant are to let no one disturb them short
                  of his majesty or her father, and of these she expects neither. She is in an
                  enchanting dishabille, and her hair tumbles in a mass on her bare shoulders.
               "What did you do in the House to-day?—But never mind! I am afraid you
                  will give me some long, wearisome descriptions of a speech from my Lord Prosy
                  this, or his Lordship Tiresome that, or—"
               "Never fear, saucebox. I'll tell you about my fling at Lord Kellmoll, who had the
                  audacity to insinuate that I was overbold for my years!"
               "As I live! what an ill-bred fellow!" she exclaims, angrily. "What did you say to
                  him? Quick—tell me! How you must have punished him!"
               He replies calmly: "Certainly. I never allow insolence to go unchastised. I told
                  him that 'if age constituted wisdom, and youth folly, I succumbed to him.' At the
                  same time, I prayed to the gods I might always remain young, or at least never be
                  able to ascend so high on Minerva's mount as had his lordship."
               "You served him right, Philip; only you should—I mean, how crestfallen the poor
                  man must have been!"
               "Well, little one, he provoked me to it, you know."
               She acquiesces in the force of his reasoning, and looks intently among the
                  smouldering embers to discover omens of births, deaths, or marriages; and lo! in
                  the corner nearest Philip she sees as plain as daylight, a cradle! "Oh! Philip,
                  come here! Look! look! see the—" and she stops. He hurriedly rises from his chair
                  to discover the cause of her exclamations. She does not conclude her sentence, but
                  blushes as red as her own English roses, and buries her face in the chair. Philip
                  sees no cause for alarm, and replies: "Margery, I think I shall order a dose of
                  hicra-picra for you instead of myself, if you persist in this nonsensical
                  conduct;" and he reseats himself, and laughs loudly at her attitude, for she is
                  cuddled up all in a lump, and her hair hangs over the arm of the chair, and falls
                  to the floor in a wavy, shimmering mass.
               After this episode, they pass the time very pleasantly in discussing questions of
                  literature and the fashions, and of the most "modish" style of dressing the
                  hair—whether the small steel shoe-buckles are superior or equal to the richer and
                  more elaborate jewelled ones; and in mutual remembrances of dear old Bucks.
               Early the next morning Margery set out for Bucks under the protection of Count Hussite and his lady.
                  The day was bright and clear, and the water shone resplendent with the sun's warm
                  rays, and everything promised a safe and speedy voyage.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXVI.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Persuasion tips his tongue whene'er he talks."
                           Graced as thou art with all the power of words,
                           So known, so honored, at the House of Lords.
                        
                     
                     POPE.
                  
               
               PHILIP is standing on the floor of the House busily engaged in arguing a point at
                  law with Lord Hintflam—a veteran speaker and parliamentary tactician. Says his
                  lordship: "Your grace, it would run counter to the statute which was framed to
                  correct that very evil." Philip is about to reply, when he is interrupted by a
                  messenger who whispers in his ear the intelligence of the birth of an heir to his
                  name, and he leaves the House immediately.
               Philip's heart beats high as he walks rapidly homewards, and he feels himself to
                  be a greater, nobler man than before, and the future programme of his son's life
                  is already laid out. "It shall not be like his own in every respect; but he shall
                  be a Whig, and a great man of course!" Finally his thoughts end in a determination
                  to visit Bucks again to see with his own eyes the infant scion of a noble
                  sire.
               
               Philip shakes the General by the hand in the most violent manner, and they
                  joyfully congratulate each other on the happy event. The head-nurse—a fussy, testy
                  body, arrayed in a black cap of portentous size and stiffness—leads Philip, with
                  all important gestures, to the room. Margery is overjoyed to see him,
                  and she proudly shows him their son. "Philip, darling, the nurse tells me that she
                  never saw in all her life such a pretty baby."
               "She is a sensible woman, and her services must be well rewarded," replies Philip;
                  and he kisses the end of its little nose in admiring happiness, and then beats a
                  retreat from the severely watchful eye of the head-nurse.
               That night Philip and the General sit up very late, and consume uncounted goblets
                  of well-spiced punch. I will add that the standing toast was: "The young one's
                  health, and his future prosperity."
               Philip stays at Holme Grange for nearly a month, during which time he amuses
                  himself in hunting, fishing, and various other pastimes, not forgetting the
                  dandling of the baby. Then he begins to tire of rustic happiness, and to long for
                  the gayeties and excitements of town life.
               They are eating supper, and Philip has just declared that he has important
                  business in town which must be attended to at once; to which Margery replies, with
                  a pleading look: "Am I to go along with you, Philip?"
               "No, Margery," he says, regretfully, "it is impossible; I must post with the
                  utmost despatch; but I will return in a few days—at least, I hope so!" She
                  replies:—
               "I hope you will. I always feel lonely when you are away, for father is always
                  busy about his own affairs, and he has no time to spare with me. If I had not my
                  little darling to keep me company, I should certainly not let you go without me;
                  but come back as soon as ever you can."
               "S'life! Margery, you can rely on me, I'll not stay in London any longer than I
                  can help." She looks half-doubtful
                  doubtful; but drinks her tea in silence. Philip continues in fatherly tones: "Take
                  great care of the child, wifie!" She indignantly tosses her head at this piece of
                  unnecessary advice; as if it were possible she could be careless of his—their
                  son.
               We will precede this unwilling traveller to London, and look about us for old
                  sights and familiar faces. Philip's mansion is now finished and ready for
                  occupation. The decorators and cabinet-makers have left their little mementoes on
                  the table in the ebony room, where he will be sure to see them when he enters. The
                  sides of this room are panelled with polished ebony, and the ceiling is ornamented
                  by fretted rafters picked in with gold as a relief to the sombre black. His arms
                  are carved in every panel, while the violet windows also display his quarterings.
                  This peculiar apartment he designs to keep sacred to himself alone, "not even the
                  housemaid shall enter; he will keep it in order himself." Its minor decorations
                  may in a measure account for his aversion to visitors. Underneath the centre
                  window is a Prie-Dieu and a hassock of black velvet to kneel upon. On a curiously
                  carved pentagonal table behind the Prie-Dieu is a Parian statue of the Virgin Mary
                  with hands extended in the act of invoking a benediction. Philip bought it in
                  Paris. Its workmanship is perfect; a halo of mild piety seems to burst from the
                  white face, and in the sightless eyes there is a vague expression of purity and
                  holiness. Around her, long white tapers stand out in bold relief against the rich
                  dark windows. There is also an amber rosary; and a Latin missal incongruously
                  leans against a toy that Philip also bought in Paris. It is a flesh-tinted copy of
                  Praxitele's Cnidian Venus—the immortalized form of the courtesan Phryne, and the
                  wondrous work which alone rescued Cnidus from obscurity and gave it a history.
               To this room there is apparently no means of entrance; no door is visible. How,
                  then, can Philip enter this, his sanctum sanctorum? Click! rings the noise of an
                  opening spring, and a small door concealed in the panelling falls down, and Philip
                  enters. "Faith! it's solemn enough!" he exclaims, with a shrug. "The darkness
                  strikes a chill through me with its depressing gloom." He throws off his hat and
                  cloak, kneels down before the Prie-Dieu, and recites a paternoster in a low but
                  sonorous voice. This finished, he makes an inclination to the Virgin, and rises.
                  He attempts to light one of the tapers, but his flint fails to do its duty; and
                  with a half-uttered curse he relinquishes his intention, and sits down on the
                  hassock to consider what he will do, where he will go, and on whom he will call to
                  help him to enjoy the pleasures of which he determines to taste quite freely
                  before he returns to his humdrum life at Bucks.
               "There's Harry Hauteforte; he will do if I can think of none better; or there's
                  Peterborough—wofully conceited and arrogant, but a jolly dog and vastly clever in
                  his ways! I must see him—I wonder whether Mr. Young is in town! I would wager
                  fifty guineas he is either dangling at St. James's, or else puffing some
                  influential idiot with fulsome flattery. At all events, I'll run down to the
                  Rainbow, and watch who lays his penny on the bar," and he rises, creeps through
                  his secret doorway, and emerges into the street, where a chair soon carries him to
                  the Rainbow coffee-house in Fleet Street.
               He lays his fee on the bar, and orders the particular dish for which this house is
                  famed—stewed cheeses and oat cakes. Charon Skewer, the noted highwayman who has
                  eased the pockets of half London in his time, and who chances to know Philip by
                  sight, cries: "Ah, your grace! 'tis a plaguy long time since I have had the pleasure of a canary cup with you!"
                  Unluckily for Charon, Philip is aware of his character, and he answers not a word,
                  but draws himself up scornfully, and with a right-about turn he gives him the
                  expanse of his back to look upon. "A murrain on his ill-breeding!" mutters Charon,
                  and he strikes up a conversation with the barmaid to hide his discomfiture; while
                  an elderly man, whose appearance betokens wealth and refinement, exclaims, "Well
                  done, your grace! served him right." Philip looks toward the speaker, and says,
                  "Sir James, this is an unexpected pleasure. I thought you were at Ipswich among
                  the hawthorn lanes?"
               "I was there," Sir James replies, "but London has charms which never pall, and I
                  have returned again to my old haunts."
               "For which I am thankful, as I find so good a companion, and so merciless an enemy
                  of Madame Ennui, of whom you have probably heard?"
               "Yes, but never experienced her attentions."
               "Fortunate man!" replies Philip.
               Sir James Thornhill is sergeant painter to the king. He was once very wealthy, but
                  fashionable excesses have reduced him considerably, and it is his daughter who is
                  Hogarth's future wife. Beside him sits a gayly dressed cavalier whose handsome
                  face is tinged with a grave sadness. He salutes Philip in courtly phrases, and
                  flatters him in the most unconscionable manner. This is Edward Young, who not only
                  composed "Night Thoughts," but also wrote the most fulsome, adulatory poem which
                  ever disgraced any age, "The Epistle to Lord Lansdowne." 'Though nominally his
                  friend, Philip openly shows his contempt for the poet's truckling servility.
                  Philip's hand is now grasped by the erratic genius, Charles Mordaunt, Earl of
                  Peterborough. Mordaunt is small, and singularly spare in person; his features are
                  attractive, and his nose is prominent; his eyes are lively and penetrating, and
                  his face is rather long and meagre. He has come to town to take part in the
                  debates of the session. He addresses Philip with the bluff heartiness and jovial
                  good nature of a soldier.
               They all sit down together, and order a plentiful supply of canary. In the course
                  of the conversation, Peterborough says to Philip: "Your grace, I hear that
                  Alberoni is to assist the Chevalier in another attempt. He is even now fitting out
                  an immense armament at Cadiz, and he is said to rely greatly on friends in
                  England. It will be a hazardous matter for any one to have aught to do with this
                  next effort. It will be a short thrift and a long rope; I should be loath to see
                  any of my friends favor a scheme so foolhardy as that of the
                  Cardinal's."
               The Earl says this so meaningly that Philip begins to wonder whether he conveys
                  the warning as a hint to himself or not, and he regrets the loss of the message in
                  the cathedral at Dublin.
               Peterborough now calls out: "More wine, fair Hebe! more wine!" and he trolls out 
                     
                        "That which most doth take my muse and me
                        Is sure a cup of rich canary wine."
                     
                  
               
               "Ah ha!" laughs Thornhill, his whole body shaking with his merriment.
                  "Peterborough's muse! I appeal to your grace whether he should not be fined an
                  additional bottle for mentioning impossible monstrosities?"
               Young, who is invariably the last speaker, laughs at Philip's answer of
                  "Certainly!" and adds, "It left him when his majesty came in."
               The earl flushes as he replies, "Yes, Mr. Young, and I went out along with it to
                  make room for one who has since managed to scrape his way into decent society and
                  ape his betters."
               
               Young feels the taunt, but, true to his policy of ingratiating himself, he only
                  smiles and requests the "favor of a cup with him."
               "Come, gentlemen," says Philip, "let us take a stroll through Fleet Street;" and
                  at his request they rise and walk out. As they pass by Dick's coffee-house, the
                  Earl notices a friend of his at the bar, who is both wealthy and miserly; and he
                  throws a shilling through the window to the maid, and exclaims in a loud voice,
                  "For my Lord Sansor! Take out your penny, and give him a custard for the change;"
                  a remark which creates a laugh against the cavalier pointed out, who lays his hand
                  on his rapier hilt for a moment, but instantly withdrawing it, however, when the
                  Earl notices his movement. Philip proposes a visit to that hotbed of Toryism,
                  Saint James' Coffee-house, and thither they go.
               They enter in a noisy, careless manner, which causes some of the quieter
                  frequenters of the place to scowl disapprovingly. They indulge in several glasses
                  of punch, and sandwiches of prime Yorkshire beef, and before they leave,
                  Peterborough mounts a table, takes off his hat, and whirls it above his head while
                  he exclaims: Oyez! oyez! my lords and gentlemen, attend all to the great Mordanto.
                  He intends to recite to you a selection from a great divine's greatest poem—the
                  subject, to be sure, has something to do with its sublimity." The inmates of the
                  house direct their attention to this address, and many crowd around the table in
                  expectation of amusement. He enunciates with dramatic gestures and grandiloquent
                  airs the following squib of Swift's:— 
                     
                        Mordanto fills the trump of fame,
                        The Christian world his deeds proclaim,
                        And prints are crowded with his name.
                     
                     
                        In journeys he outrides the post,
                        Sits up till midnight with his host,
                        Talks politics and gives the toast.
                     
                     
                        Knows every prince in Europe's face,
                        Flies like a squib from place to place,
                        And travels not, but runs a race.
                     
                     
                        Heroic actions early bred in,
                        Ne'er to be matched in modern reading,
                        But by his namesake, Charles of Sweden.
                     
                   He is listened to in silence until he finishes, when there ensue roars of
                  laughter at his tipsy rendering of the poems. He adds gravely: "The only thing
                  which I find fault with in the poem is the comparison between myself and Charles!
                  I protest against being reduced to his level!"
               As the uproar subsides, Philip fills a cup, and exclaims, "Gentlemen, to his grace
                  of Shrewsbury and Alberoni—the one an enemy to the world, the other to England;
                  may—" Loud cries drown the rest of the toast, and the crowd begin to hustle Philip
                  and his party quite roughly until the Earl, Sir James, and Philip draw their
                  rapiers and form a front which does not invite too close quarters. Philip, who is
                  half tipsy and reckless, swears to finish his toast, and resumes: "May they be
                  bound together in h—, and be doomed to gnaw at each other for all eternity!"
               Symptoms of a dangerous fracas now begin to appear. Belts are tightened, and
                  swords half drawn by many who were favorable to Shrewsbury while living, and who
                  are enraged at the wanton insult to his memory, and hisses and curses resound
                  through the room.
               Philip cries to Young: "Draw, man, draw! We shall have to fight our way out of
                  this. There is no end to the Jacobite fire-eaters amongst you pack o' fools."
               "A Mordanto! a Mordanto!" yells Peterborough, and, maddened with rage and wine, he
                  thrusts viciously in front of him. "S'blood! if ye do not make a path for us out of this den of thieves and
                  cut-purses, we'll slash one." And he draws back his arm.
               How it would end if the watch did not push in and separate the crowd, it is hard
                  to say. Their leader orders everybody out of the room except those with drawn
                  swords—a command which produces sundry clicks and raspings as rapiers are
                  hurriedly sheathed. None of Philip's party follow this wise example, however,
                  except Young, who slips behind the watch, and leaves the room in a hurried manner.
                  The honest guardians of the peace now begin to remonstrate with their "Ludships,"
                  and "regret the necessity of taking them to the round-house; but it is their duty,
                  and must be done;" protestations which Philip silences by thrusting two or three
                  gold pieces into the hand of the spokesman; a never-failing stratagem, and they
                  leave perfectly contented.
               "Egad!" exclaims Peterborough, "we raked them up, Wharton!"
               "You say truly, Mordaunt; and it shall not be the last time, eh?"
               Sir James asks, in thick, hiccuping tones, "Where's Young? Has he made wings unto
                  himself and flown?"
               "Yes," replies the Earl; "'tis an old trick of his. When steel shines, Young
                  leaves."
               The landlord unbars the door, and lets his noisy guests out again, and they are
                  greeted with groans and hisses by the crowd standing on the pavement. They answer
                  with scornful jeers, and dare any gentleman to a few passadoes with them! but none
                  respond to the invitation, for both Philip and the Earl are known as thorough
                  experts with the rapier; and Sir James, though not so famous, is yet a dangerous
                  opponent.
               They ruffle it gallantly back to Fleet Street, where they are joined by Sir Harry
                  Hauteforte, who has been "biting Bacchus" a bit himself, and he is about as
                  boisterous as any of the party. A cavalier, who is walking on the opposite
                  pavement, happens to look over at our party, and he smiles amusedly, which so
                  rouses Philip's ire that he calls over to him in an insolent manner: "Sir, the
                  scent of your wig offends me greatly! I pray you step here, and give me the
                  satisfaction of a gentleman, for I call you arrant knave and jackanapes!" and he
                  handles his rapier. The cavalier thus roughly accosted, instead of coming over to
                  avenge his wounded honor, passes on with a flushed face and a quick step; while
                  Philip calls after him, "Coward! braggart!" and he reels after his companions who
                  have gone ahead.

                           The club must hail him master of the joke.
                        
                     
                     POPE.
                  
               
               HIS majesty has returned from his German states, and has opened Parliament in
                  person. The most important measure discussed is the celebrated Peerage bill. Once
                  before, the creation of twelve peers was inserted in the articles of a peer's
                  impeachment; but the bill is expected to pass in the House of Lords without the
                  slightest opposition, and although the Tories in the Commons fight against it, the Whigs have a large majority.
                  It is on this bill that Addison and Steele, once firm friends, take opposite sides
                  as the "old Whig" and the "Plebeian." To everybody's surprise the Commons reject
                  the bill almost unanimously, and Stanhope and Sunderland are foiled in their
                  darling project; while Walpole, who opposes it strongly, is highly praised for his
                  share in its defeat. Philip carefully watches the progress of the bill, and when
                  it is defeated, he speaks admiringly to all about him of the "Independence of the
                  Commons," whereat many are astonished to hear such suspicious sentiments from so
                  warm a Whig as he has been.
               Philip received a blow at this time which almost broke his heart. Margery had
                  become lonely and nervous at Bucks, and fearful lest Philip might go back to his
                  old courses, or be taken sick and lack proper attention, she had come to London,
                  and brought the child with her. Philip reproached her for the step, and ordered
                  her to return at once, for fear of infection from the smallpox, which was raging
                  at that time. She obeyed him; but it was too late. In a few days he received the
                  news of his son's death. He shut himself up for nearly a week, and refused to see
                  any one; indeed, he would scarcely eat; but instead he drank large quantities of
                  brandy which deadened his grief as well as satisfied his hunger. His servants
                  denied all visitors: "They are his grace's orders!" was the only answer that
                  inquiring friends received. His grief was very poignant. He had set such great
                  store on his boy, and he hated poor Margery with all his heart as the cause of his
                  loss. He did not once write to her, but sent his commands to the steward to have
                  the body buried with all the honors, and he would not go down to superintend the
                  burial. When he re-entered society he firmly repulsed all offers of sympathy, and
                  sternly forbade all mention of his loss within his hearing.
               He is now the President of the Hellfire Club—a set of blasphemous profligates. He
                  was solicited to be a member, but he declined except he should be made president,
                  and sooner than lose him the club agreed to his demand, and he is now publicly
                  known as the leader of "the most shameless, impious crew that ever existed." He is
                  far more reckless and heedless of all restraints now than he ever was before; and
                  he brings things to a crisis by avowing himself a Tory and a Jacobite, an avowal
                  which requires a bold heart and a steady hand to support.
               Harley has been zealously advertising the great scheme which is to make England
                  the richest country in the world, and his partisans are loud in their praises of
                  his South Sea Scheme. Its origin and progress are too well known to need any
                  recapitulation, and "the idea that is worthy of Sully or Colbert" is gradually
                  working itself into favor among merchants and traders, nobility and gentry.
                  Philip, who is now of age, and in Parliament, enthusiastically favors it, and
                  fails to see the ruinous future which lurks within it. "John Law! Rue Quincampoix!
                  actions and shares," entirely supersede the ordinary scandal and topics of the
                  day. The Scotch adventurer is all powerful in Paris, and when he and my Lord Stair
                  quarrel, his Excellency is recalled and Sir Robert Sutton is installed in his
                  place.
               As soon as the scheme bill has received the royal assent, subscriptions are
                  opened, and they are taken with such avidity that another and another follow in
                  quick succession. In a short time stocks rise from 130 to 1000, and this wonderful
                  success produces fifty other schemes, many of them of the most absurd nature. The
                  Prince is head of "The Welsh Copper-Mining Company," and in two days he gains
                  forty thousand pounds, then wisely withdraws and thus escapes the subsequent
                  consequences.
               
               Change Alley begins to rival the Rue Quincampoix. Here alone do Whigs and Tories,
                  churchmen and dissenters mingle in amicable agreement to effect transfers, or open
                  new subscriptions. London's noblest dames go masked and hooded to the alley to buy
                  and sell, like any broker. Behold a few schemes selected at random from a crowd of
                  similar absurdities:—
               "For importing a number of large jackasses from Spain."
               "For a wheel, for perpetual motion."
               "For an undertaking which shall be revealed in due
                  time."
               London is crazy. Let us mingle with the mad crowd which roars and surges in the
                  alley. Here is a man with his hands, pockets, and hat full of papers, yelling in
                  shrill, cracked accents the peculiar merits of his scheme, while a near rival
                  vaunts his above all the others, and glances around in search of buyers; and all
                  are either buying or selling with the lust of greed flushing their faces, or
                  making their hands tremble. There is a beautiful woman whose mask has fallen off,
                  and whose hair is rumpled and disordered. She is bargaining with a vulgar wretch
                  for some rising shares. Her name is Lady Winifred Rabic, and she is endeavoring to
                  gain enough to sustain her in her extravagant manner of living. Yonder is Dr.
                  Radcliffe, who has already lost ¥5000; he is busy calculating the odds on a new
                  scheme which has just been offered to him. The Duke of Chandos is also engaged in
                  the same occupation. "Way for the Earl of Westmoreland!" and his lordship takes
                  his accustomed place as buyer or seller. The king's favorite, Bernstoff, glides in
                  and around the fevered speculators, and warily watches his chances. Now we can
                  distinguish Philip's fair curls and handsome face. He is conversing with an aged
                  cavalier, whose peruke tells of other days. He is tall, and not ill-favored, but
                  his neck is too low between his shoulders, his countenance is furrowed and haggard
                  with his long career of intrigues and cares; it is the crafty Mr. Craggs. He is
                  persuading Philip to invest in a few hundred of his shares at five thousand, to
                  which he finally agrees, and the transfer is made. Philip pockets the slips, and
                  Craggs chuckles over his gains. At this moment Philip is joined by Peterborough,
                  and simultaneously he is accosted by a masked cavalier who offers to sell him five
                  hundred shares of a company, which at present ranks high in the Alley, for a
                  hundred guineas the share. Philip, who is sure that he can dispose of them at any
                  time for one hundred and fifty, closes with the offer, and the stranger exchanges
                  the shares for a draft for the amount. Peterborough tries to dissuade Philip from
                  buying, and Philip laughs at his ignorance of their value, and calls out to the
                  Earl of Westmoreland: "My lord, will you take five hundred 'Arabian' at one
                  fifty?" "No, your grace, nor at a shilling apiece! 'Arabian' is sunk—president
                  absconded, and treasurer invisible." At this startling news Philip at once
                  vindicates his powers as President of the Hellfire Club, and tears the worthless
                  scrip to pieces. His first thought is to send a messenger to stop the payment of
                  the draft, but it is too late for that now, for the man who has shrewdness enough
                  to make such a coup d'état would certainly cash
                  the draft as soon as possible.
               "Peterborough," says Philip, with a grimace, "that makes about fifty thousand*
                     I have frittered away in this foolery!"
               
                  
                  *Fact.
               
               The Earl replies: "I suspected the fellow, but I had not the slightest idea that
                  Arabian was totally worthless."
               "This collapse is the beginning of the end, Peterborough borough. During the last few days, I have thought
                  what an unstable foundation all of these schemes rest on, and I fear Change Alley
                  will be many a man's ruin, as it would be mine if I kept at it much longer."
               The Earl says, musingly: "Your grace, it strikes me that the fellow who sold you
                  the 'Arabian,' is the same who was once implicated in a Jacobite plot which nearly
                  cost him his life! If I were not sure that Sir Edgely Warely is in Rome, I would
                  swear—"
               "Edgely Warely," interrupts Philip, in an excited manner. "Ay, now I recall his
                  voice and his figure, I am sure it is he—the treacherous villain!"
               The Earl is a little surprised at his emotion, but he does not ask any questions,
                  and they stroll off together.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXVIII.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           They reel and stagger to and fro,
                           At their wit's end, like drunken men.

                           "The swan-feathers the arrow bore
                           With his heart's-blood they were wet."
                        
                     
                     THE HUNTING OF THE CHEVIOT.
                  
               
               PARIS and the Rue Quincampoix have repeated themselves in London and Change Alley.
                  Crash after crash of the various companies has ruined thousands who foolishly
                  invested their whole wealth in the delusory hope of a hundred-fold return. All
                  London and the adjacent towns are in a ferment. The train-bands can scarcely keep
                  order or prevent many riots and disturbances. Parliament has met in alarm, and the
                  members are frightened at the aspect of affairs which greets them. The Commons
                  present a curious, but dreadful scene: Whigs and Tories change places, while the
                  watchful Jacobites note the embarrassed state of affairs with open delight, and
                  add all in their power to the general confusion, hoping to take advantage of the
                  occasion to improve their plans.
               In his opening speech his majesty laments the sad state of affairs, and presses on
                  Parliament the necessity of finding a remedy. His speech is received in the House
                  of Lords in deep silence—the presage of the storm; but in the Commons a member,
                  who has lost very heavily, rises and with excited gestures and white lips reviles
                  the South Sea Directors in the most violent terms, and calls them: "Miscreants!
                  scum of the people! and enemies to the country!"
               In the Upper House Lord Molesworth says: "My lords, I admit that the directors
                  cannot be reached by any known laws, but extraordinary crimes call for
                  extraordinary remedies. The Roman lawgivers had not foreseen the possible
                  existence of a parricide, but as soon as the first monster appeared, he was sewn
                  in a sack and cast headlong into the Tiber: and as I think the directors of the
                  South Sea scheme to be the parricides of their country, I should willingly see
                  them undergo the same punishment." Not a dissentient voice is heard until Walpole
                  replies with his usual calmness and suavity, "If the city of London were on fire,
                  wise men would be for extinguishing the flames before they inquired after the
                  incendiaries."
               A bill is brought forward to "punish the authors of our present misfortunes," and
                  it is carried nemine dissentiente, for those who
                  have been guilty do not dare to oppose it for fear of being found out, and the
                  innocent for fear they may be suspected. After a short recess for Christmas
                  festivities! Parliament reassembles angrier than before, and with a determination
                  to be avenged on the company which has
                  issued over half a million fictitious stock to bribe their king and his
                  mistresses—her grace of Kendal and Madame de Platen.
               General Ross states, with angry mouthings: "We have discovered a train of the
                  deepest villany and fraud that Hell ever contrived to ruin a nation;" and at the
                  conclusion of his speech, four of the directors—members—, are expelled the House
                  and taken into custody.
               In the Lords the excitement is intense: John Blunt, a sturdy, independent man, is
                  interrogated, but he refuses to answer any questions put to him relative to the
                  South Sea Directors. This occasions a debate which soon branches into more general
                  topics, and scurrilous personalities take the place of cool discussion. Philip,
                  who has hitherto been restrained by Peterborough from taking an active part in the
                  discussion, now rises and claims his right to the floor. The assembled peers, who
                  have long expected a speech from him, now subside into temporary quietness, and
                  await his views in anxious silence—all except a few vehement Whigs who heartily
                  hate him for his renegade conduct. His speech ranges over the whole
                  administration, and he adverts to the dissension in the royal family, and more
                  than hints that "Stanhope has done his best to feed the flames of so unnatural a
                  fire." He cries in trumpet tones: "Look to his parallel in Sejanus: that evil and
                  too powerful minister who made a division in the Imperial family, and rendered the
                  reign of Tiberius hateful to the Romans!" As he sits down a murmur undulates
                  through the House like the wind in autumn branches, and a crowd of hungry eyes
                  turn to Stanhope for his answer to this bold Philippic.
               From the time Philip mentioned the dissension, Stanhope has been on his feet, his
                  lips tightly closed and his hands clutched so strongly on his breast that he has
                  torn his lace cravat in two. He draws a long, broken breath, and turns yellow with
                  passion and hatred as he looks directly at his accuser. In his reply he ably
                  vindicates his own conduct, and justifies every act of the administration. He
                  extends a trembling hand towards Philip, and exclaims, in an ominously calm voice:
                  "Such virtuous sentiments and patriotic thoughts sound most strange coming from
                  the lips of the president of the Hellfire club, whose godless schemes, wild
                  excesses, and suspicious political tendencies are the scandal of England; and now,
                  most noble duke, allow me to compliment you highly on your studies in Roman
                  history, and I hope that you have not overlooked the example of the patriot
                  Brutus, who, in order to assert the liberty of Rome, and free it from tyrants,
                  sacrificed his own degenerate and worthless son! Moreover—ah!" His utterance
                  becomes choked, his face turns to an unearthly livid color, and his eyes close
                  with spasmodic twitchings. He sways to and fro like one drunk, and his eyes open
                  and he surveys the house with a vacant gaze. My Lord Townshend rushes to his
                  support, and grasps him by the shoulders. Stanhope slowly turns his face to him,
                  and opens his lips as if to speak; he cannot! A thin black stream trickles through
                  his lips, and runs slowly down his gown, and falls softly, splashing on the floor.
                  A cry of horror bursts from all, and he is immediately assisted outside. While
                  being carried out, the dying man throws a revengeful glance at Philip and his
                  friend.
               Philip and Peterborough converse about the terrible incident in the house, and
                  Philip regrets his attack on the Secretary of State, an attack which produced such
                  dreadful effects, and he says: "If I had thought Stanhope was so vastly sensitive
                  to a little bluster, I would not have pricked him so smartly. I trust he will soon
                  recover—he looked mighty unwell when he was carried out."
               
               The Earl replies: "I'faith! I think he gave you as good as you sent, and he gave
                  me a dig as well—small thanks to him for it. But I forgive him, 'he knew not what
                  he did;' but if he had not been taken ill, Mordanto would have buckled on his
                  armor."
               Philip says: "Yes, 'tis a pity you did not get a few words in: it would have made
                  additional amusement."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXIX.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Hel.—
                           
                              I do beseech you, sir,
                              Since you are like to see the king before me,
                              Commend the paper to his gracious hand.
                           
                        
                     
                     "ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL."
                  
               
               WE must retrace our steps to the cathedral at Dublin, in order to discover where
                  Alberoni's message disappeared so mysteriously. The case is very simple. As soon
                  as Philip and Mistress O'Beirne left, Edgely Valentin darted out from behind the
                  altar, where he had been concealed, and shook a paper or letter in the air with
                  frenzied gestures. He then exclaimed: "At last I have an opportunity to fulfil my
                  vow!" This letter was Alberoni's message, of which he had unseen taken possession.
                  His face was pale but triumphant, and he read the contents of his stolen prize
                  repeatedly.
               "Ah ha! Mistress O'Beirne, this pays me for dogging! I thought your errand was to
                  him. Thanks to his carelessness, his life is now, to a certain extent, in my
                  power: London is in no mood to trifle with traitors, and to London I must go and
                  await a fitting opportunity to present this document to their high mightinesses in
                  the Lords." And he took off his left shoe, and ripped the leather lining from the
                  side, enough to allow the letter to slip between it and the outer surface. That
                  accomplished, he drew it on again, and walked rapidly to the banks of the Liffey,
                  where a fishing-smack—whose owner combined fishing and smuggling in a very
                  profitable manner—was to sail for London in a few hours.
               In a vile den in Wapping is a rag and junk-shop, kept by an old woman who is a
                  sister of the notorious Dame Brett. 
                     
                        "When Wharton's just, and learns to pay his debts,
                        And reputation dwells at Mother Brett's:"
                     
                   She is known to all the foot-pads and cut-purses of London as Dame Grab-all,
                  for she willingly purchases everything that is brought to her, from a diamond set
                  of the first water down to the dirtiest rope's end. On the second floor of this
                  house and in the front room is Edgely Valentin. He is standing by a grimy,
                  latticed apology for a window, and he taps abstractedly on the mouldy walls, whose
                  plastering drops off in a little cloud at every touch of his knuckles. On the sole
                  piece of furniture in the room, a bed, lies a woman, whose face is drawn and wan;
                  and she has great hollows under her glistening eyes and in her flushed
                  cheeks—hollows which tell of fast-running sands. She must have been a lovely girl
                  once, for in spite of the ravages of time and sorrow, her features are still
                  prepossessing and delicate: her hair is very thick and long, and it lies in a
                  tangled mass on the whitey-brown pillow.
               He turns to her, and says in a kindly manner: "Have you heard how Lord Stanhope
                  came by his death?"
               "Yes!" she replies in a hesitating voice.
               He says: "He befriended me once, and saved me from being set on by a crowd of
                  springalds who thought fit to taunt me with my birth—a birth which it strikes me
                  is very generally known in town!" and he clenches his teeth till his jaw-bones
                  harden his features.
               
               The woman replies, in pained accents: "Edgely, drop that subject, I entreat you—it
                  is worn threadbare between us."
               He does not answer her, but resumes his tapping at the wall. She casts a stealthy
                  glance at him, and draws from her bosom a tiny miniature portrait, and exclaims in
                  low tones: "God! that he might know all! But my promise—I cannot—will not break
                  it—yet awhile at least;" and she secretes it, and sighs deeply.
               He suddenly exclaims: "I will go to the Tower! A large meeting of people will
                  collect there to-day, to mob Parliament and hoot the Houses for their leniency
                  toward the Directors—a worthy set of gentlemen, and more sinned against than
                  sinning—" A rumbling sound like distant thunder is heard, and he continues: "St.
                  Jago! there they are! good-bye! I'll return shortly."
               Valentin mixes with the crowd of 'prentices, traders, butchers, and watermen who
                  are yelling and roaring in angry confusion, and he helps them in their outcries.
                  "Hang them! hang the cannibals!" "On to Parliament, and we'll see to matters
                  ourselves." The mention of any name known in connection with the South Sea scheme
                  is greeted with curses and execrations. "Stanhope" seems to be the rallying cry.
                  Valentin clambers on top of a huge hogshead that is close by, and cries in a voice
                  which rises above the tumult: "Friends—fellow-victims! let us demand justice
                  now—at once. On to Parliament! we will let them know that we are men. On, on to
                  Parliament!"
               "Ay, lad! on to t'Lords, and make 'em return us the money they've robbed us on!"
                  exclaims a tall, grimy smith who flourishes a gigantic hammer as though it were a
                  cane; the mob echo his sentiments, and Valentin leaps to the ground and places
                  himself at their head.
               As they come in sight of the object of their ill-will, they salute it with a
                  perfect shower of yells and groans. Valentin thrusts his hands into his breast,
                  apparently to search for something, and assured of its safety, he carefully
                  rebuttons his coat, and his eyes blaze with a baleful expression.
               The Houses are in session. Harley's "master-piece" is still under discussion, and
                  penalties and imprisonments are still the rule rather than the exception. The king
                  has been spoken of in terms far from flattering; and it shows the general
                  exasperation and angry feelings which reign in the house, that, when his majesty
                  asked them for a large subsidy to Sweden for the trade in naval stores, Lord
                  Molesworth protested strongly against the measure, and finished by saying: "I own
                  hemp is a very necessary commodity, especially at this juncture, but in my opinion
                  we can be supplied more cheaply from our plantations in America."
               Philip, whose renegade conduct and determined opposition to the government and all
                  the schemes of the ministry have incurred the ill-will of both his majesty and
                  those in power, is attacked by a special proclamation issued against the Hell-fire
                  Club and its president. The subject is now being debated. Chesterfield's son—Lord
                  Stanhope—is speaking in grave, earnest tones: "This club, which his majesty so
                  justly rails against, is a disgrace to our city. Its members are, with scarcely an
                  exception, notorious for their blasphemy, riotous living, and violent conduct. It
                  is said—God forfend that it is true!—that many of our worthiest families have sons
                  who do not scruple to avow themselves aiders and abettors of this most scandalous
                  and godless organization. If it is true, then will we do a good deed if we can
                  destroy it, and pull from the fire the burning brands!" and after a few more
                  observations on religion and morality, he takes his seat.
               
               Philip rises amid an ominous silence to answer this scathing attack, while
                  Peterborough stands by his side. He casts his eyes slowly around he expectant
                  assembly, and with a sneer on his lips, he whispers to the earl. He begins: "My
                  lord has chosen to attack the honored president of a club, whose door he is not
                  worthy to guard, and also to reflect on his want of godliness, as well as all the
                  other members." Here he pauses, and turns to Peterborough, who hands him a small
                  Bible with a great affectation of reverence. Philip then turns his lips down in a
                  sanctimonious manner, as he resumes: "I am no patron of blasphemy, as I shall
                  prove out of this holy book, which my saintly friend"—he points to the
                  earl—"invariably carries with him in order to controvert the arguments of the
                  ungodly."
               "Amen!" snuffles the earl. But Philip's answer is so utterly shameless and impious
                  that I dare not give it to you.
               As he finishes, Peterborough rises, and in reference to a theological point which
                  Stanhope has raised, replies: "Though I am for a Parliamentary king, s'life! I'll
                  never have a Parliamentary religion."
               Philip says: "Mordanto! you are an honor to the H. F. C. If I were not Duke of
                  Wharton, I would certainly be Earl of Peterborough."
               "S'life," he replies, "but your grace is unjust; the exchange would be uneven. How
                  ever could I live with your debts and reputation pulling on me? how would you
                  remedy that?"
               "Easily enough," Philip says with a laugh; "I would throw my duchess and her good
                  qualities into the scale."
               At this moment there is a noise in the hallway which attracts Peterborough's
                  attention, and he leaves his seat to inquire into the cause of the
                  disturbance.
            
            
               CHAPTER XL.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           I am no love for you, Margaret;
                           You are no love for me.
                        
                     
                     BALLAD OF "FAIR MARGARET'S MISFORTUNES."
                  
               
               THE earl is surprised to find a man struggling with the doorkeeper, and is still
                  more so when he recognizes the intruder to be Edgely Valentin; he says to the
                  keeper: "What is the matter? What ails the madman?" But the doorkeeper is too
                  busily engaged in attending to the infuriated Valentin to answer the earl, and he
                  merely nods. The earl, whose strength is wonderful for such a slightly built man,
                  grips Edgely by the nape of his neck and shakes him so fiercely that he drops his
                  hold on the keeper, and endeavors to free himself from the new assailant. The earl
                  exclaims: "What means the insolent fellow? What do you want here? Speak, or I'll
                  choke ye black in the face."
               "My lord," he exclaims, "An infamous plot—Alberoni—wait till I gain my
                  breath!"
               Peterborough notices a paper in his hand, and he snatches it away from him and
                  then releases him.
               "To his grace of Northumberland—Alberoni?—" exclaims the earl, and he crushes the
                  letter into his pocket.
               Valentin sees his motion, and he gasps: "The paper—my lord, if you—it must be read
                  before the House. It is part of a treasonous correspondence I have
                  discovered."
               The earl asks quickly: "Ah! you say you have more!"
               "Yes, my lord, and I can produce them at any time."
               "Do the others criminate the duke as much as this?"
               
               "No, my lord, but they are from well-known Jacobites in Paris, Rome, and
                  Avignon."
               "Have you them with you! quick! We are beginning to attract attention."
               "No, my lord; but I can get them in a few days!"
               "Speak low now—from whom are the others?"
               This question perplexes him, and he hesitates. The earl looks sternly at him and
                  says: "Look ye, Sir Edgely Warely! If you—who are such a stern patriot—do not
                  bring me all the letters in your possession which can do any harm to the Duke of
                  Wharton, I'll see that you receive lodgings in the Tower. Now you can go! You know
                  that I always perform what I threaten."
               Valentin's countenance assumes a frightful expression, and he stamps his foot in a
                  mad paroxysm of rage as he comprehends that his plans are foiled, while
                  Peterborough smiles at his impotent mouthings. Suddenly he rushes on the earl, who
                  is too quick in his actions to be caught unawares, and as Valentin grasps at his
                  throat, Peterborough hurls him headlong out of the doorway
               As the earl takes his seat again Philip says: "My lord, you left me so suddenly,
                  that I feel half justified in asking the reason of your absence?" Peterborough
                  replies in a careless manner: "I heard a noise at the door, and went to
                  investigate the cause. I found a friend of yours there who requested me to give
                  you this document, and to advise you to be more careful in future where you leave
                  your letters."
               Philip opens the document, and he is astounded to find it is Alberoni's lost
                  letter. He eagerly requests a description of the person who brought it, and asks
                  Peterborough whether he was suitably rewarded.
               "Yes, I amply rewarded him for his trouble; but as to describing him, I am very
                  bad at descriptions. I did not especially observe him."
               Philip replies: "Well, if you have rewarded him, it matters little who he is."
               The Earl dryly replies: "Umph! sure?"
               Philip's answer is lost in the terrific yell which shakes the windows, and makes
                  the Spanish Armada tapestry tremble with the concussion.
               Philip thrusts the letter in his pocket, and runs to see the cause of the tumult;
                  Peterborough follows, as do most of the peers. The mob which collected at the
                  Tower has been swollen with hundreds more of men and lads who have joined them
                  along their route.
               "Look!" exclaims Philip: "There is Edgely Valentin at the head of the mob! S'life,
                  the fellow looks like a modern fury. He is all awake for mischief."
               "'Faith," says Peterborough, "he looks as if he has just escaped from a mad-house
                  or the tender mercies of the Mohocks! and 'faith, he must have a spite against
                  you, Wharton; he has just favored you with a particularly disagreeable look!"
               Philip shrugs his shoulders disdainfully, and laughs at the idea of such a
                  foe.
               Philip and Peterborough do not return to their seats after the dispersion of the
                  mob by the guard. They proceed to the Rainbow in Fleet Street, and there they
                  remain until late in the evening, when they adjourn to the Pope's Head, in the
                  alley of the same name. The bar is small and clean, and the floor is nicely
                  sanded, while the walls and ceiling are hung with pewter mugs or blackjacks. The
                  landlord Jack Hood is a stout, florid man, and he is so good-natured that he was
                  never known to be angry but once, and that was on an extraordinary occasion; and
                  as Peterborough, who was present at the occurrence, is telling the story to
                  Philip, we will listen: "I'll tell you about it, Wharton. Bowen—that fiery-blooded
                  Irishman—whom you have probably heard of as a clever handsome actor—was in this very room about
                  four years ago, and I was talking to him about Quin of whom he was vastly jealous
                  and hated like—well, like Congreve does the great Sarah.*
                   I jestingly told him that Quin was universally considered as his superior,
                  whereat he waxed mighty wroth and sent for him. Quin no sooner entered than Bowen
                  cursed him and commanded him to draw, at the same time he brandished his blade in
                  his face. At first Quin refused to fight, but Bowen gave him no alternative; so he
                  drew, and—egad! there's the mark on the panel where Quin's point touched after
                  passing through t'other's midriff! S'life! he played prettily! a stramazorm, a
                  half whirl with a passado, and the blade fleshed home."
               
                  
                  *Douchess of Marlborough.
               
               Philip passes his finger over the cut in the door, and says: "Better Bowen than
                  Quin, for if he had gone where would our Falstaff have come from? A sight worth a
                  year of any man's life to see."
               They loiter here until Jack intimates it is closing time, so they settle the
                  score, and each wends his way homeward with unsteady steps and bewildered
                  brains.
               Philip feels cynical and unwell as he opens his eyes after the night's debauch,
                  and he calls for a goblet of iced canary to clear his muddled head. He glances
                  towards his escritoire, and there among various other letters is one from Holme
                  Grange. He groans inwardly as he imagines its probable contents, and he takes it
                  up and tears it open in a pettish manner. It is quite lengthy, and he is fully ten
                  minutes in learning its contents. This done, he tosses it aside, and exclaims
                  wearily: "What I expected! Fatherly objurgations, marital pleadings—and general
                  persuasions and entreaties—heigh-ho! a ridiculous waste of time and paper. She
                  disobeyed my orders—killed my son, curse her! and she shall never—what nonsense!
                  Philip, you will certainly destroy your calm quietude by such frenzies. The only
                  item of interest is the paragraph about Brad and Meg; the rest reeks of Margery
                  and her troubles. S'life, as if I am in fault!" And he thrusts his head down in
                  the pillow, and falls asleep.
            
            
               CHAPTER XLI.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "His learning none will call in doubt;
                           Nor Pope would dare deny him wit."
                           "I own he hates an action base,
                           His virtues battling with his place."
                        
                     
                     SWIFT'S LIBEL.
                  
               
               IN front of the quaint little house known as Dan Button's, are two persons who
                  whisper together in low tones and seem desirous of secrecy. The elder of the two
                  is smaller than the average of mankind, and from his thin, bony neck, down to his
                  diminutive feet, his body has a curious resemblance to a large S. His hands are
                  small, pallid, and very thin; but his eyes compensate for his deformities—they are
                  piercing and eloquent, and they seem to shine with a mute appeal for sympathy,
                  blended with the sarcastic expression of a defiant, scornful wit. He is well known
                  at Button's and Will's as a vastly clever man and a fine scholar, but he is not
                  over-popular at either place, for he is too fond of retort and repartee. His
                  companion is Mr. Morice, who is dressed in a frock suit of brown and silver lace;
                  he is the son-in-law of Francis Atterbury, Bishop of Rochester. As their
                  conversation seems of some interest, we will turn eaves-droppers and listen to it
                  in spite of Pope's keen eyes or Mr. Morice's steel hilt.
               
               Pope exclaims: "All England cries shame on my Lord Walpole for his severity toward
                  the best and wisest man living!"
               Mr. Morice adds: "The pigeon-pie which I sent him yesterday was opened by the
                  dirty turnkey to see whether or no I had secreted a letter or a ladder in it, in
                  order to assist him to escape."
               "Escape!" says Pope angrily; "Francis Atterbury attempt to steal from prison like
                  a common felon? Never! His soul is too lofty to stoop so low. When he leaves the
                  tower, it will be amid the huzzas of a million tongues which will chant a pæan to
                  his greatness! Pah! this is the first time that dead pigeons have
                  been accused of carrying messages."
               Mr. Morice says: "Think you that my Lords Orrery and North will say aught to
                  criminate Atterbury?"
               "Criminate, man! I must misunderstand you! What can they say to criminate him?"
                  and he anxiously awaits an answer, but Mr. Morice only shakes his head.
               Pope resumes: "His grace of Norfolk will probably be honorably discharged?"
               "I doubt it, sir," he replies.
               "Your reasons, Mr. Morice, for doubting his acquittal!"
               "I will give them inside," he replies, and they go in and take a bench in a remote
                  corner of the bar. Mr. Morice proceeds: "In addition to the letters signed
                  'Jones,' and 'Illington,' which I fear me will be proved to be his, there is this
                  wretched 'Harlequin' affair. You are aware that Mar sent Mistress Atterbury—before
                  she died—a little spotted dog which she named Harlequin. About a month ago, I
                  unfortunately trod on its foot and broke it, so that I had to send it to Mistress
                  Barnes in Houndsditch to be cured. It seems that this dog has been mentioned
                  several times in the letters. Mistress tress Barnes was examined by the council,
                  and was asked the question: 'Does the dog Harlequin which you have belong to the
                  Bishop of Rochester?' To which she replied immediately: "Yes, it does.' Slight and
                  ridiculous as this evidence may seem, it is really a strong link in the chain of
                  circumstances with which it is connected."
               Pope listened in silence, and he murmurs the bishop's answer when he was brought
                  before the council: "If I tell you, ye will not believe; and if I ask you, ye will
                  not answer me nor let me go!" And he recalls Atterbury's well-known hostility to
                  the Hanoverian succession, his offer to head an army in his lawn sleeves, his
                  haughty and ambitious temper, his refusal to sign the Declaration of Abhorrence of
                  the rebellion of 1715, and his turbulent spirit, and he begins to fear that the
                  government may be able to furnish strong proofs of treason and disloyalty when the
                  bishop is put upon his trial.
               Mr. Morice says musingly: "They say that seven cardinals presided by the pope's
                  orders at the birth of Charles Edward. This future pretender has pleased our
                  Jacobites mightily."
               Pope replies, with a twinkle in his eye: "Yes, and they had a chance to show their
                  feelings in safety on Lord Mayor's day by calling: A Stuart, a Stuart—high church
                  and Stuart, for the mayor's name is Stuart; rather a disagreeable coincidence,"
                  and he smiles as he recollects how pleased his mayorship had been at the unusual
                  rejoicings and acclamations which took place on his election.
               "I believe you are the bishop's solicitor, Mr. Morice?"
               "Yes, and Sir Phipps and Mr. Wynne are his counsel."
               "But is it not against the order of the House for a lord to appear by counsel
                  before the other House?"
               
               "Yes, but he has permission to appear either with counsel or without, as he
                  pleases!"
               "I am glad to hear that; but Mistress Barnes? what a witness against a
                  bishop—Rochester versus a Houndsditch
                  quack!"
               "Bad enough! It is reported that his protean Grace of Wharton intends to defend
                  Atterbury in the Lords. Do you know whether there is any truth in the
                  assertion?"
               Pope replies scornfully: "His grace is constant only to inconstancy; he is an
                  antithesis, a consistent inconsistency. I doubt that he will belie himself. If he
                  defends him before the trial, during it he will be his opponent. But it would be
                  well if Atterbury could secure him; he is a powerful speaker, and he is fuller of
                  tricks and legal subterfuges than any man in London."
               Suddenly Pope pushes his companion to one side, and a smile of welcome lights his
                  face as he discerns a familiar form standing at the bar in conversation with the
                  bar-maid. The new-comer's countenance wears an expression of jollity and good
                  fellowship. He is clothed in a faded cinnamon coat, whose huge lappels and pockets
                  are adorned with very coppery silver-lace, which tells of long service and hard
                  wear. His ruffles are torn and dirty, and his whole air bespeaks the Grub Street
                  hack who has seen better days.
               Pope scrambles quickly towards him, and exclaims: "John, John! this will never do!
                  idling at a pot-house, instead of being at the labors which are to enable you to
                  scale Parnassus' heights!"
               He replies: "Hallo! is it you, Mr. Pope? What were you saying? Labors—Mount
                  Parnassus—rubbish! I earn as much talking with pretty Polly here, as I do in my
                  attic, and that is—nothing."
               Pope remarks: "Fudge! John, come and have a jack of canary with Mr. Morice and
                  myself; you are acquainted with him?"
               He nods assent, and the three sit down together.
               The trial of Francis Atterbury is at present the great topic of conversation and
                  discussion among all classes of society, and especially literary and theological
                  circles. The treasonous correspondence which Walpole intercepted deeply embroils
                  the bishop, and although the people in general side with the imprisoned prelate,
                  it is feared there will be too many proofs of guilt for him to escape a sentence
                  of exile—may be death.
               "For my part," says Gay, "I concur with the opinion of several learned gentlemen
                  who frequent my spare chambers, that his lordship's correspondence and conduct are
                  at least worthy of censure, if not of more stringent measures."
               At this, Pope presses his friend's foot and glances at Mr. Morice as he remarks:
                  "Marry, Mr. Gay, we will take your opinion on Ma'am'selle Scuderi or Hanover
                  scenery, but on this subject you are in the clouds."
               Mr. Morice adds: "Yes, give us your opinion on Scuderi's Grand Cyrus; you have
                  read it, I suppose?"
               "I have, sir," says Gay, "and I can assure ye that she is another Sappho—the most
                  proper tenth muse that has, as yet, illumined the literary horizon!"
               Pope replies, with a perceptible curl on his lip: "Bravo! John! One would think
                  you had been to the Hôtel Rambouillet and been patted on the back by that Olympian
                  novelist."
               "No, Mr. Pope," says Gay; "should any one pat me, the act signifies a—" And he
                  stops in confusion.
               Pope maliciously adds: "A superiority in the patter, and you, John, are at least
                  equal to the tenth muse."
               Gay reddens, and Mr. Morice says: "To change the conversation, Mr. Gay, what is
                  your opinion of this Erasmus Lewis who
                  is engaged to prove the handwriting of the bishop. Is he a man of good character,
                  and honest?"
               "Too much so for the bishop's good, I fear," is Gay's curt reply, at which Pope
                  looks anxious and troubled, for Atterbury is a very demigod to him.
            
            
               CHAPTER XLII.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Though small the time thou hast to spare,
                           The church is thy peculiar care."
                        
                     
                     SWIFT.
                  
               
               PHILIP is sauntering down Ave Maria lane in company with a cavalier of commanding
                  presence and distinguished bearing, whose name is Lord William Cowper, alias Will
                  Bigamy, alias Cowper-law: the first pseudonym he has acquired from an absurd story
                  set afoot by Voltaire; the other was given him by his political opponents for his
                  impartiality and severity in awarding punishment to malefactors and criminals.
                  They intend to pay a visit to Dolly's, in Paternoster row, a tavern famed for its
                  juicy steaks and gill-ale.
               As they enter Paternoster row Philip chants, in a doleful voice, "Sancta Maria,
                  ora pro nobis," and casts a glance at his companion as he finishes; and Cowper
                  exclaims: "Your grace seems affected by the associations of the row."
               Philip replies: "Yes, my lord; it reminds me of Avignon and the holy fathers."
               "Tut-tut," says Cowper; "drop the subject, your grace. It ill becomes me to listen
                  to aught pertaining to papistry."
               Philip promises not to offend again, and they enter Dolly's tavern, which has a
                  portrait of Queen Anne as its sign.
               "Prithee, Master Dolly," says Cowper, "let us have a pipe of sotweed apiece and a
                  jug of claret;" an order which is promptly filled, and they are soon involved in a
                  cloud of the soothing and enervating Oronooko, which rises in blue wreaths to the
                  raftered ceiling. Philip is a good smoker, and he ejects the smoke from his nose
                  marvellously well, and he can send it expertly from his mouth either in balls or
                  circles; but Cowper is not so dexterous; he contents himself with simply inhaling
                  it and puffing it out again.
               Philip sententiously observes: "A blessing on Sir Walter! King James' fulmination
                  and his counterblasts did little good, thanks to the power of common sense."
               "Ay, and a most proper and good measure it was; but unfortunately his fulmination
                  is now more honored in the breach than the observance. By the way, the trial will
                  soon take place."
               Philip answers quickly: "And then we will see whether Parliament dare deprive a
                  minister of God. S'blood, the sacrilege!"
               Cowper gravely remarks: "I agree with you, and rejoice to hear you are against
                  that most unjust measure."
               Philip replies in a settled manner: "My Lord Atterbury may count on me as his
                  friend and defender."
               Cowper is about to reply, when Philip is startled by a tap on his shoulder, and he
                  turns his head and sees behind him a stalwart, morose-looking man, whose black
                  hair and eyes and brown skin show conclusively that he is a gypsy.
               "S'blood, what do you mean by laying thy filthy finger on a gentleman, eh! What do
                  you want?" cries Philip fiercely.
               
               The gypsy answers, in a humble manner, "Your grace, my master, I am Nanar the son
                  of Ma-Krillac. Queenie gave me this for you; I want an answer." And he hands
                  Philip a dirty letter sealed with black wax.
               Philip tears it open and reads it, and a smile comes to his face as he finishes
                  its perusal. He turns to Nanar, and says in a milder manner: "Oh! Nanar, I recall
                  the circumstance. One moment, and I will write you a draft for the money." And he
                  borrows a quill and a sheet of paper from Dolly, and writes as follows:—
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Pay to the order of Mistress Nelly Valentin the sum of one thousand
                              guineas (1000) for value received.
                           
                              PHILIP WHARTON."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               A grim smile crosses his face as he gives the draft to Nanar, and says: "Here, and
                  never trouble me again." Nanar takes it and leaves the tavern, and Philip says
                  explanatorily: "A promise to a woman which I forgot to fulfil."
               Cowper shrugs his shoulders, as he remarks: "Wharton, you are a sad rake. I fear
                  you will have many of those drafts to write out before you die, if you are not
                  more circumspect."
               Philip replies: "You are wrong, my lord. This is one of the punishments that
                  descend from father to son."
               Cowper nods his head, and says: "Your grace is justified, and now let us have a
                  turn at ombre."
               "With all my heart," answers Philip, and they draw their chairs closer around the
                  table.
               We will leave them for a while, and turn to Nanar, who is walking rapidly in the
                  direction of Wapping; nor does he slacken his pace until he arrives before Dame
                  Graball's junk-shop, where he walks in and asks the woman a question, to which she
                  nods affirmatively and points her thumb toward the stairs, which he mounts; he
                  knocks at the first door which he sees; it is opened, and he steps inside. As you
                  doubtless guess, its inmates are Edgely Valentin and Mistress Nelly. Nanar says,
                  in a monotonous voice, and as if he is repeating a lesson: "The gypsy queen sends
                  Nanar with a duke's recompense for Mistress Nelly Valentin."
               Valentin replies with an oath: "Gypsy queen. You lie! the Duke of Wharton sends
                  it; take it back to him and tell him that the only recompense Edgely Valentin will
                  receive is a clear field and no favor!" and he crushes the draft into Nanar's hand
                  again, who quickly smooths it out, and he glides towards the bed where lies the
                  woman, and he says to her: "Sweet lady! queenie begs you to take this draft as a
                  payment for some money which you once loaned her, and also to show her that you
                  still think as well of her as you did long years ago when she was a wee child and
                  you spoke so kindly to her!"
               She shivers, but says never a word, and Nanar stands there until Valentin, no
                  longer able to restrain himself, takes hold of him by the shoulder and pushes him
                  out of the room.
               Nanar appears quite contented and unruffled, and he philosophically returns to
                  Dolly's with the draft carefully held in his hand. Again he taps Philip on the
                  shoulder, and at the same time he lays the draft on the table.
               Philip exclaims angrily: "A pest on you, Nanar! What do you want now? and what do
                  you return the money for?"
               He replies: "Your grace, a fair-faced gentleman who was wi' the lady would not let
                  her take it, and he gave me this message for you:—the only recompense Edgely
                  Valentin will receive is a clear field and no favor!"
               Philip is astonished at the insolent message, and he glares angrily at the gypsy, but he makes no
                  impression on Nanar's stolidity and calmness; finally he says with a curse: "Take
                  it to your queen; I told her she should have it; and now get you gone ere I juggle
                  your head with a claret-decanter!"
               Nanar carefully secretes the draft in a pocket of his jerkin, and again bows
                  himself out.
               "Egad!" says Cowper, "the fellow has a spirit."
               Philip answers: "He is a low, nameless hound! and he shall have his nose slit for
                  his insolence if he is not careful. But, come, we'll go down to the House and see
                  whether Walpole and Mr. Yonge are behaving themselves. They are both bitter
                  against our friend Atterbury. I wish Peterborough was in town; we could rely on
                  him."
               Cowper says, "Mordanto is a wonderful fellow; he is never quiet, and he has seen
                  more cities, theatres, bagnios, princes, and kings than any man in
                  Christendom."
               "And fewer priests and church interiors than any man in heathendom," adds Philip,
                  an observation to which Cowper replies regretfully: "I fear that inattention to
                  church matters is not peculiar to Peterborough alone, your grace."
               Philip returns warmly: "How could it be when a Kendal and a Darlington rule the
                  country through a senseless, miserly usurper?"
               Cowper is startled at his language, and he exclaims: "Your grace, I must demand
                  that you speak in more respectful terms of his sacred majesty, or else I will have
                  to leave you. Consider that you are talking treason, and as long as I suffer
                  treasonous language in my presence I am to a certain extent a sharer in your
                  guilt."
               "Pardon me, my lord; I did not mean what I said; but my feelings are hurt at the
                  recollection of the women who sit on either hand of his majesty, they are so
                  peculiarly liarly ugly—they are a disgrace to us!" and he laughs and kisses his
                  hand to Sir Charles Hellwell, who is passing on the opposite side.
            
            
               CHAPTER XLIII.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           My soul no longer at her lot repines,
                           But yields to what your providence assigns;
                           Though immature I end my glorious days,
                           Cut short my conquest, and prevent new praise;
                           My life, already, stands the noblest theme.
                        
                     
                     LUCAN.
                  
               
               THE space in front of the Houses is thronged with an anxious crowd who are all
                  agape for further news of the trial; the watermen are jubilant at their increased
                  profits, for since early morning thousands have been ferried from the opposite
                  side of the river, and from the various suburban towns along its banks. Just at
                  present the silence in the Lords' is intense and impressive, and its members are
                  anxiously awaiting Walpole's answer to the previous speaker. Some look stern and
                  implacable; others appear ill at ease and troubled: Walpole, the accused Bishop,
                  and Philip alone seem calm and tranquil. Atterbury is dignified and unmoved, and
                  his eyes are sharp and penetrating, yet kindly; his forehead is broad and
                  expansive, and his nose is well-shaped but rather coarse: his double chin—which is
                  almost hidden in his clerical tie—evinces his fondness for high living and
                  epicurean dishes, and his wig is large and curling. Philip holds in his hands a
                  mass of notes and jottings connected with the trial, and he reclines in his seat
                  in a careless attitude.
               A whispering buzz runs through the chamber, and Walpole rises. In clear, concise
                  tones he reverts to the posthumous
                  testimony of Mr. Neynoe which accuses him of bribery in order to make sure of the
                  Bishop's crimination, a charge which it is of vital importance to his interests to
                  prove false. He entirely disavows all knowledge of Neynoe, and indignantly repels
                  the accusation of bribery and corruption. As he sits down, Atterbury rises, and
                  questions him, in a soft, modulated voice, in regard to a few facts and dates
                  which have an important bearing on the case. All pay breathless attention to this
                  conflict between the two great masters of language and oratory. Atterbury almost
                  exhausts his powers of twisting and turning sentences and words in his endeavors
                  to make his wily enemy contradict and falsify his own assertions; Walpole,
                  however, is cool and wary, and every word he utters is carefully weighed before it
                  is spoken. They are battling for a great stake, and they both know it and
                  appreciate to the fullest extent the ignominy of failure; Walpole fights for power
                  and his reputation—Atterbury for his acquittal.
               At last Atterbury comes to the conclusion that his examination of his accuser is a
                  failure, and in order to hide the important end in which he has been foiled, he
                  puts a few trifling questions to him, which are of no real importance, and
                  signifies that he has finished with him: Walpole sits down, with his face as
                  immobile as iron, but the palm of his right hand is cut and scarred with the hard
                  pressure of his nails against it while under the raking fire of the Bishop's
                  inquisitorial examination, and he thanks Heaven that he has passed through the
                  ordeal safely. Atterbury's design in questioning Walpole so closely was to crush
                  the testimony of one witness and injure the reputation of another, to prove Neynoe
                  a perjured liar and Walpole a corrupt and interested enemy.
               All his brother bishops have treated Atterbury with great virulence and hatred,
                  and they have hitherto shown anything but a Christian spirit during the trial.
                  Wynne, of St. Asaph especially, has been uncompromising and violent, and he now
                  rises and animadverts on his conduct with such blind, acrimonious hostility as to
                  cause Philip's face to smile in pity at his warped judgment. Unluckily for the
                  reverend man he has accused Atterbury of some misdemeanors impossible to be
                  proved—mere hearsay in fact; and directly he has ended, before he has time to
                  settle his holy person comfortably, Lord Bathurst stands up; with a sneer on his
                  flushed face, he extends his left hand in front of him, while the other rests on
                  his swordhilt, and he exclaims in angry tones against the mode of procedure in the
                  trial; he denounces it as illegal and without a precedent. He turns to the
                  Bishop's bench, and thunders: "I can hardly account for the inveterate malice some
                  persons bear the learned and ingenious Bishop of Rochester, unless they are
                  possessed with the infatuation of the wild Indians, who fondly believe they will
                  inherit not only the spoils, but even the abilities of any great enemy they kill!"
                  The bishops color under the sarcasm, while a murmur of applause greets the
                  speaker—and Atterbury thanks his defender with an eloquent glance.
               
               Lord Cowper is speaking in a warm, spirited strain, that shows how deep is his
                  love and reverence for the accused, his hatred and disgust at his enemies; he
                  winds up by saying: "The old champions of our church used to argue very learnedly
                  that to make or to degrade bishops was not the business of the State, that there
                  is a spiritual relation between the bishop and his flock, derived from the church,
                  with which the State has no right to interfere; what the thoughts of
                     our reverend prelates are upon these points does not yet fully
                  appear. Something of their conduct intimates as if our old divines were mistaken."
                  Atterbury looks mildly towards the
                  bishops as Cowper says this, as if to ask them to stand up and vindicate
                  themselves, but none would or could meet his searching, questioning eye; they
                  occupied themselves in arranging their robes or looking another way.
               Philip, who has thus far taken no active part in the debate, now rises, coughs
                  twice or thrice, meanwhile glancing rapidly through the mass of papers crackling
                  in his hands, then drops them on the floor. He is a focus on which all eyes
                  centre; a hum of expectation buzzes through the chamber as the assemblage await
                  the opinion of the talented scapegrace on this important case. Walpole coughs,
                  Philip looks toward him, and they exchange a very significant glance, which does
                  not pass unnoticed by Atterbury and various others, particularly Cowper, who
                  wonders at the cordiality between the two.
               It is necessary to explain the reason of this seeming cordiality between two men
                  who have previously been at total variance on the question of the trial.
                  Yesterday, while Philip's head was full of wine, he had gone to Walpole, and
                  "regretted his wickedness in opposing the just punishment of the bishop," and
                  "begged his lordship to forgive him," with many sighs and groans; "if his lordship
                  would be so kind, so obliging as to take him on his side in the debate, he could
                  conscientiously promise to do his best." The young scamp seemed so earnest in his
                  behavior that Walpole believed him; he joyfully consented that Philip should aid
                  him in crushing the prelate; gave him all the arguments pro and con, and dismissed him
                  with his blessing. Philip spent the rest of the night in drinking, and now—
               Philip's speech is too long to give in detail. However, in the first place, he
                  attacks the testimony of several witnesses who have been examined, utterly
                  annihilating their credit and trustworthiness by exposing their duplicity city and
                  perjury; not a fact, a word, or an incident of the whole trial has escaped him,
                  his wonderfully retentive memory making everything subservient to his ends. In
                  particular does he dwell with withering sarcasm on the episode of the dog
                  Harlequin, which is really an important witness for the prosecution; he indulges
                  in keen ludicrous personalities, varied with thrilling flashes of forensic
                  grandeur which chill the blood, and make the heart still with its fiery eloquence.
                  Now he is calmer, and he sums up in a methodical, lawyer-like manner the evidence
                  which has been given. Master Richard Lieface he proves to be an arrant liar and a
                  perjurer, much to Walpole's dismay. He exhausts sacred and profane history for
                  parallel examples, cites all cases which bear the slightest resemblance to the
                  trial, deducing from all of them the wrongfulness of the whole proceeding from the
                  first bill passed against the accused down to the present moment. Although some of
                  his examples are far-fetched and strained, he gives them a gloss of probability,
                  and a semblance to truth which is staggering to his opponents. His voice is loud,
                  sonorous, and penetrating, impassioned and angry, cool and convincing, intense and
                  subdued, whispering and sibillating, while its every syllable pours sharp and
                  distinct into every corner of the room.
               Most of his arguments are conclusive and impregnable. As he approaches the
                  beginning of the end, he winds up facts, testimony, incidents, witnesses, bishops,
                  and lords in one great cloud, whirls it around and around with the impetuous force
                  and enthusiasm of his wonderful genius, and sends it crashing and striking amid
                  the accusers of his friend. For an instant there is a dead silence; then from
                  every lip bursts a deafening cry, long and continuous. Atterbury's lips are
                  clenched tightly, and his eyes are glistening with emotion, while Bathhurst and
                     Cowper shake hands with violent
                  energy. Meanwhile Philip is almost overwhelmed with congratulations and plaudits;
                  he is excited and very pale; he exclaims to Cowper, in a careless manner: "Egad!
                  my lord, Dolly's and a beefsteak would do me good after this last eruption."
               Astute and collected, Atterbury rises before the excitement is over, beginning the
                  vindication of his conduct. After an ingenious though sophistical explanation of
                  his behavior and his motives, he concludes in the pathetic words which strike a
                  chord of sympathy in all our hearts, even for this arrogant, unscrupulous
                  churchman: "If after all it shall still be thought by your lordships that there is
                  any seeming strength in the proofs produced against me, if by private persuasions
                  of my guilt founded on unseen, unknown motives, if for any reasons or necessity of
                  state, of which I am no competent judge, your lordships shall be induced to
                  proceed on this bill—God's will be done!—naked came I out of my mother's womb, and
                  naked shall I return; and whether He gives or takes away, blessed be the name of
                  the Lord." He can continue no longer, his eyes become full almost to overflowing,
                  while his words grow broken and indistinct.
            
            
               CHAPTER XLIV.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Oriana.—
                           As I live, Mirabel turned friar! I hope in Heaven he's not in
                              earnest.
                        
                        
                           Bisaire.—
                           In earnest, ha, ha, ha! are you in earnest?
                        
                     
                     THE INCONSTANT.
                  
               
               PHILIP has hit upon a new idea; he will turn journalist and edit a second
                  "Spectator" or "Tatler," make himself a popular man with the honest cits, enact
                  the part of a patriot to his country, and be a friend to the people. It requires
                  but a short time to put this idea into operation after its birth. "The True
                  Briton" shall be the vehicle of his thoughts and opinions. Let us to Grub Street,
                  where he is at present engaged in jotting down divers effusions of disguised
                  Jacobitisms, startling political views, discussions on the general aspect of
                  England and her rulers, whom he handles with irreverent boldness. He is perched on
                  a high stool, before a grimy, blackened desk; the room is so narrow and confined
                  that the ink darted from the quill prior to writing unavoidably lights on some
                  side of it and leaves black splashes and spots which have a vague resemblance to
                  myriads of long-legged, bloated spiders rather the worse for wear. The single
                  window is sooty and dilapidated; the straggling rays which manage to crawl through
                  the Lilliputian bull's-eye panes, fall in blurred dimness on the many blots,
                  initials, and scratches on the desk, and cast a sickly light on the opposite
                  wall.
               Philip has a sheet of paper before him on which he is scribbling with amazing
                  rapidity. His face is impassive and emotionless. If it were not for the quick
                  motion of the quill and the rustling of his ruffles, one might judge him to be in
                  a brown study. His dress is certainly out of place here; his peach-colored coat is
                  of ribbed silk, heavily laced and broidered with gold; the hilt of his rapier is
                  extravagantly decorated with bands of diamonds and rubies, while a sapphire gleams
                  and glitters in the top. He has apparently finished his task, for he throws the
                  quill down, exclaiming exultantly: "Another stinger for the ministry. I'll rouse
                  their ire before I have done with them. This must to press at once, then; from
                  John-o'-Groat's to Land's End shall they be circulated." He rubs his hands
                  together, while a smile comes to his lips. "Now that I have descended to the ranks
                  and taken arms against my order, faith! I ought to complete the farce and join some worshipful London company—the
                  Rat-catchers or the Wax-chandlers? speak in terms to suit the mobile vulgus—not that I love George or Walpole less,
                  but my country more Ah, ha! quite theatrical, but it will doubtless pass for
                  frenzied patriotism with my beloved brothers, the greasy chandlers. However,
                  whether they believe me or not when I announce my new convictions, it will be a
                  new sensation to grasp their democratic palms and call myself one of them!"
               He stuffs the MSS. in his pocket, then runs over to John Incink to have it put to
                  press as one of the articles in "The True Briton." He now steps over to Gay's
                  lodging-house, mounts the rickety, old staircase, gropes his way through the
                  close, foul hallway, and opens the door which guards the spendthrift poet from
                  duns and bailiffs. As he enters he exclaims: "Good-day, my plague of moral
                  chamberlains. I have just finished my labors, and I have dropped in to help you if
                  you need—"
               "Thanks, your grace," Gay responds with mock gravity; "but any spare ideas you may
                  possess you had better keep to yourself, for the work on which I am now engaged is
                  to make my reputation for life, or else I'll turn usurer and fleece elder sons of
                  their future patrimonies."
               Philip replies: "Ah—what is this great work? Another version of 'Three
                  Hours?'"
               Gay reddens at the remark, for it calls to mind how his play "Three Hours after
                  Marriage" had been hissed off the stage for its immorality and indecency. "No,
                  your grace, neither crooked Pope nor Jolly Arbuthnot shall have a hand in this. It
                  shall be exclusively my own production."
               Philip exclaims: "My dear man, do tell me what it is, then. You keep me on the
                  rack with your—"
               Gay interrupts: "One moment, and I will get it. You must know that it will not be
                  finished for some time—may be three or four years."
               Philip adds: "Not until your last fiasco is forgotten, eh?"
               Gay laughingly assents, meanwhile drawing a roll of stiff, dirty paper from a
                  pigeon-hole in his desk, which is dusty and rickety. Philip sits down on a pile of
                  wormeaten folios which happen to be convenient, while Gay, after a preliminary
                  clearing of his throat, begins to read the names of the dramatis personæ of his new production: "Captain Macheath—a jolly
                  dog by the way, Peachum, Lockit, Mat-o'-the-mint, Ben Budge—"
               "Hold! pardon me for interrupting you, Gay; but the ladies—I am more interested in
                  them!"
               Gay replies: "Whichever you like—Mistress Peachum; Polly, her daughter, Dolly
                  Trull, Mistress Vixen—but I'll not read them all, you would be too much
                  wearied."
               "What is it? a farce, a tragedy, a pastoral?"
               Gay answers: "If your grace will attend to me for a few minutes, I will tell you
                  all about my play. It came about in this way. Mr. Swift and I were at the Rainbow
                  some few days ago, and were discussing Tom Clincher's probable ending, when he
                  suddenly remarked: 'Gay, I think a Newgate pastoral might make a pretty sort of a
                  thing! Try your hand at it; try your hand at it, man.' His suggestion stuck in my
                  head, and egad! this is the consequence." He points to the roll: he pursues in an
                  excited manner: "However, it is not as a Newgate pastoral that I intend it to be
                  known, but rather as a fling at that most nonsensical thing, the squawking,
                  Italian opera, with which all our fashionables are smitten."
               Philip says: "Pelt them out of the country with your own airs; I am with you in
                  your hearty detestation of those soft, unnatural airs, fantasias, and conceits
                     which distinguish the Italian
                  school. I prefer our own dear English ballads to all their high-strained
                  warblings. Which is your chief character?"
               Gay answers with an air of perplexity: "Now you ask me a question I cannot yet
                  answer. Captain Macheath disputes the palm with Nimming Ned, Peachum, and
                  Polly—faith! I would like to have them all chief characters, if it were not for
                  the violation of dramatic rule!"
               "You have not given me its name yet, John, and this is the third time I have asked
                  you."
               Gay replies: "Pardon me! I had forgotten—'The Beggar's Opera.'"
               "Perfect, perfect! 'Tis both original and striking."
               Gay's cheeks color at Philip's approbation. He draws his ragged, faded
                  dressing-gown about him with a satisfied air.
               Philip exclaims abruptly: "Good-bye, John. Success attend your labors!" He leaves
                  the room, and leaves also a well-filled purse for the needy poet.
               Since pardoned Bolingbroke's return to England, it has been his constant aim to
                  have the bill of penalties formerly passed against him repealed. Unfortunately, a
                  strong party are greatly averse to the measure, among whom is Philip, who looks
                  with detestation on the double renegade, and wonders how a man could become so
                  abandoned and traitorous! The case comes on to-day in Parliament. Thither Philip
                  goes to throw his voice with the opposition. As he enters Lord Harcourt the
                  Trimmer is speaking of the returned exile with feeling and pathos, and he is
                  defending his conduct with much skill. Philip rises as he sits down, and he
                  strongly protests against the measure. He imitates Harcourt's gestures, manners,
                  and pathos so ludicrously that he keeps the house in a continued smile. This
                  finished, he does not wait for the division, but leaves, satisfied that he has
                  done his duty as a man and a patriot.
               Strolling toward the Rainbow, where he purposes to spend the rest of the day, he
                  observes Edgely Valentin on the opposite side of the street. He exclaims: "A
                  plague on the sour-faced rogue! He is worse than the Scot's dagger—always in
                  sight! If he ever insults me again, he shall certainly have his nose slit for his
                  pains!"

                           Sae my true love did lichtlie me.
                        
                     
                     WALY, WALY.
                  
               
               MARGERY is listlessly wandering in the darksome forest, carelessly stepping
                  through the damp grass and the tangled underwood; her face has a look of tired
                  weariness and broken happiness. Her movements are languid and heavy; she has lost
                  her former buoyant gayety and spirit, lost the intense interest the world once had
                  for her; and—God help her!—she sometimes thinks that the black, icy tarn may be
                  her refuge, where her trustful, loving heart will be at rest. Philip has written
                  but one letter to her since the death of her babe; it was so cruel, so harsh, that
                  although she has read it over and over until it is nearly worn to pieces, yet
                  every time she looks at it, it seems to wind a circlet of tightening steel about
                  her heart. She does not cry when she reads it; she never cries now; tears will not come to ease
                  her throbbing head. All day and all night long, day after day, week after week,
                  month after month, there has been no thought in her mind but of Philip and
                  his—cruelty?—no, his former love and tenderness; none would dare to mention his
                  name to her coupled with cruelty. "He will come back some day—he cannot always be
                  away!" This thought is the star of hope which keeps her from going mad. She often
                  lies on the velvet sofa, where she was sleeping on that day when he came back and
                  awakened her with a kiss and folded her in his arms.
               Never since that fatal day, when she carried her baby boy to London, has she known
                  peace of mind or freedom from remorse, nor ceased to reproach herself for
                  disobeying his commands. Her daily walk is through Elm avenue, the old
                  trysting-place. Here she will stay the live-long day and dwell in the memories of
                  the past; she will imagine Philip by her side, and grow less unhappy as his loving
                  words and ardent looks come back to her. See! she turns this way; a dash of
                  sunlight breaks through the interlacing branches overhead, and falls athwart her
                  face; her cheeks have fallen away, and their soft roundness is gone; they are
                  pallid, colorless, all is a wan white except her lips, which are still as red as
                  an autumn leaf, and her eyes are subdued and saddened. She says in a low murmur:
                  "I will go to Queenie. May be she has heard of him by this time." She proceeds
                  toward the gypsy camp.
               The white thorn and the honeysuckle vie with the sweet cherry blossom, while the
                  lilac breathes a fain perfume through the dim pathway: the bright peony and the
                  jonquil add their charms and delight the eye with rich tints and varied
                  colors.
               Margery has reached the camp; it is just as we left it, except that there are a
                  greater number of brown-skinned, black-eyed babes crowing and playing in the
                  furzes, and on the soft, springy moss; as her eyes fall on them, she puts her hand
                  to her side, as though to still the numb pain gathering around her heart, and her
                  lips are drawn tightly together. As she enters the hut, Queenie bends low and
                  kisses her hand, while Margery tries to smile, but it can find no resting-place on
                  her lips.
               "Have you heard aught of him, Queenie?" she asks in a low voice.
               Queenie looks pityingly at her as she replies: "Only that master—his grace is
                  well, and so busy wi' court affairs that he can scarcely call a minute his own.
                  These politics, Mistress Margery, are woeful things."
               It is an old tale; although she knows that Queenie can tell her nothing of Philip,
                  yet she finds a bitter pleasure in hearing it repeated.
               Once there had come a cavalier from London who told Margery that he knew Philip
                  well, and he told so many venomous lies about him in reference to an actress whom
                  he said her husband loved, that she had turned on him like an enraged tigress and
                  commanded him to leave her at once, or she would call for help and have him
                  whipped. Although she disbelieves the story, yet it is constantly recurring to her
                  mind and increases her unhappiness. After a long silence, Margery says: "Queenie,
                  tell me my fortune. See if you can tell me how long it be ere he returns, how long
                  I am to live, or, better still, when I can die." She smiles as she extends her
                  hand.
               Queenie takes her hand within her own; she looks steadily at it for a few minutes,
                  then says in a grave voice: "Sweet lady, I would rather bite my tongue off by the
                  roots than tell what your hand shows me." She gently releases her hand and resumes
                  her seat on the deer-skins.
               Margery takes no notice of her words, but looks out of the half-open door and notices the flying leaves
                  which are blown here and there by the shifting wind. Now she bows her head in her
                  hands, and her eyes close. Queenie goes to her, puts her arm about her waist and
                  leads her to her own couch; here she soothes her with endearing names and gentle
                  caresses: "Queenie, you are very kind—hold me tighter in your arms!"
               She replies, coaxingly: "Mistress Margery, queenie would be very glad to keep you
                  here all night, but your father would be troubled at your absence. The evening is
                  coming on, there will be no moon to-night; had not Nanar better go with you as far
                  as Rooksnest?"
               "Not yet—not yet: I am happier now than I have been for many a day; let me stay
                  here a little longer." She seems to fall asleep, while her breath comes in a
                  series of short, broken sighs, and her eyelids quiver aspen like. "Oh!" she
                  suddenly exclaims with a long gasp: "how my heart aches! it is—"
               "Is Margery here? Margery?" breaks in the General's voice in inquiring
                  accents.
               She tries to answer her father's call, but she is unable. Queenie replies: "Yes,
                  Mistress Margery is here!"
               "Pistol me, girl! you have led me a pretty chase! I was sure you had met with some
                  accident. What ails you? You look like a broken lily lying there."
               She opens her eyes, replying: "Father, forgive me! I am sorry I have given you so
                  much trouble;" attempting to rise, she falls back into queenie's arms. "Father,
                  wait, a few minutes—I am too sick—you—"
               The General is alarmed at her evident illness; he kneels down beside her, and rubs
                  her cold, damp hands. She exclaims faintly: "I am dying, father! I would I could
                  breathe my last in the room where Philip kissed me—my heart is easier now; I think
                  it is what is called broken." A shadowy smile flickers and dies on her lips. "When
                  you write to Philip, tell him I died happy; tell him not to grieve; but if he will
                  think of me sometimes when I am gone, I shall know it, and I will be with him
                  though he know it not. Cut off a long braid of my hair; then put it behind his
                  portrait in my locket! Hold me tighter, queenie dear! Kiss me, father."
               The owl hoots in the woods, the wind sighs drearily around the hut, while the
                  shades of night are fast wrapping all things in a darkling mantle. The lilacs and
                  the white thorn still dispel their perfume, but the fragrance which is strongest
                  now is the rosemary.
            
            
               CHAPTER XLVI.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "For where high honor is the prize,
                           True virtue has a right to rise:
                           Let courtly slaves low bend the knee
                           To wealth and vice in high degree:
                           Exalted worth disdains to owe
                           Its grandeur to its greatest foe."
                        
                     
                     SWIFT.
                  
               
               PHILIP'S course of life for the last three years has been immoral and profligate
                  to a high degree. His actions have been so licentious and unrestrained by fear of
                  God or man, that we shall pass them over in sorrowing silence, merely premising
                  that he has burdened his estate so heavily with debts and mortgages, that it has
                  been seized by a decree of chancery; which has vested all his property in the
                  hands of trustees who allow him three thousand pounds a year: "scarcely enough to
                  furnish him with snuff and pomatum," as he declared. Retrenchment was necessary,
                  and for that purpose he has gone abroad.
               He is in Madrid, the oasis of the Spanish desert. Prior to his arrival here, he had written three letters
                  from Vienna. One was to the Pretender, in which he expressed sentiments of the
                  "greatest devotion to his cause," and "begged that he might be permitted ere long
                  to reside at his court to watch and cherish his majesty and the Stuart interest."
                  Another was to Horace Walpole, the ambassador at the Tuileries; it was a duplicate
                  of the first, except that in place of the Stuart cause he wrote the Hanoverian
                  dynasty, a slight difference. The last was to the exiled Atterbury, with whom it
                  is treason to either speak or correspond.
               He has carefully dressed himself, in anticipation of the many conquests certain to
                  ensue before he returns from his promenade; he really does attract an unusual
                  share of attention from the stately promenaders, both men and women, who turn to
                  look at his handsome face and his fine figure. A discolored, inflamed face is
                  thrust close to his own, and a hoarse voice exclaims: "Hallo, Wharton, I expected
                  you would be in Madrid ere long."
               Philip replies blandly: "Ah! my lord, I am overjoyed to see you; how is your
                  health?"
               "Passable, but Spanish wine tells on my constitution. By Saint Jago, I get an
                  attack of blue vapors every second week." It is Lord North, the apostate traitor,
                  who turned Roman Catholic and Jacobite to please a man who has since forbidden his
                  presence at his court.
               Clinging to North's gold-laced sleeve, and balancing himself first on his toes,
                  then on his heels, is the prime minister, the Duke di Ripperda: an arrant braggart
                  and an imbecile coward; the man of whom Spain has such high blown expectations and
                  the avowed future restorer of the Stuarts; he is capricious, fickle, and a clumsy
                  liar; but for all, his unblushing impudence has secured him many partisans and
                  admirers who have not as yet seen his true character. Stanhope, the British
                  minister, is probably the only man in Spain who sees through him and weighs his
                  talents and worth correctly.
               Ripperda is of the medium height; his face is heavy and swollen with excesses and
                  debauchery; his long moustaches are waxed to sharp points; he is attired in a rich
                  dress of violet satin, slashed with black; his looped hat is cocked to one side;
                  take him altogether, he is a good specimen of a fighting, bullying, cowardly
                  Spanish Dutchman. As Philip grasps his hand after the introduction, he feels a
                  loathing for him he cannot suppress; he says to himself: "Saugh! a combination of
                  Caliban, Silenus, and Thersites."
               Ripperda is smoking a short red clay pipe tipped with gold, whose bowl is carved
                  so prettily that Philip asks him whether there are any more like it in town?
               He replies: "Ay, more! I always carry a couple for my friends. Have a pipe,
                  North?" he says, and he hands one to each. He gives Philip his tobacco pouch, from
                  which Philip fills his pipe, then passes it to North, who does the same.
               Philip, turning to Ripperda, says: "Your grace, during my stay in Vienna, I heard
                  some rumors about a reconciliation between—"
               He interrupts him with: "My innocent Duke, I know what you intend to say; this is
                  my reply: I swear by the holy Virgin that France and Spain shall never be
                  reconciled as long as I live. England's usurper shall not only have his German
                  domains wrested from him, but he shall lose the English crown he wrongfully
                  wears!"
               North growls: "I hope so."
               Turning to Philip, he resumes: "I trust your grace echoes that wish?"
               "Yes, with all my heart," he replies, wondering at Ripperda's ravings, certain
                  that he is drunk to talk about
                  important state affairs in such a loud voice while in the most frequented part of
                  the city.
               As they walk along, an open coach passes them in which sits a dame whom Philip
                  thinks he has never seen equalled. She wears the coquettish lace veil of the
                  Spanish ladies, which falls on a pair of white, plump shoulders. Philip exclaims
                  hurriedly: "Ripperda, tell me, before she passes, who is that lady?"
               "Which one?" hiccups the minister. "There are so many around that I am unable to
                  answer your question."
               Philip points her out; he replies: "Saint Jago! that is the O'Beirne, maid of
                  honor to her majesty, and a very dragon of virtue she is, as I have found to my
                  cost."
               Philip mutters: "Conceited jackanapes!" then in a louder voice: "I have seen her
                  before, somewhere! Was she ever in London?"
               Ripperda replies: "No, never to my knowledge. She was born here, and I do not
                  believe she has ever been out of Spain."
               North says: "Excuse me, Ripperda. If I am not mistaken, she was in Dublin a few
                  years ago. During Alberoni's time, he sent her there as a spy or an agent. She is
                  talented and shrewd, but she failed in her mission—a failure which has done her
                  more good than harm, for her dismissal by Alberoni was the cause of our friend's
                  interest in her."
               Ripperda adds, with a chuckling leer: "Yes, that and her good looks, with perhaps
                  a trifle of pity, for she is as poor as a Carmelite; her father was killed in our
                  army. Her mother's pension would barely keep them from starving, if I had not
                  secured her a position as maid of honor." He puffs forth a circling volume of
                  smoke which envelops the party.
               "O'Beirne—Dublin—Alberoni?" Philip, thinking over these three names, soon recalls
                  the circumstances with which they are connected. She is the same who brought him
                  Alberoni's letter, the same whom he kissed in the cathedral. "Mistress Nora, I
                  must renew that acquaintance begun so strangely and ended so abruptly!" Raising
                  his eyes at this moment, the coach again is passing. Looking intently at her, he
                  lifts his hat and bows; his heart bounds as she returns the salute with a distinct
                  nod and a sweet smile.
            
            
               CHAPTER XLVII.
               
                  
                     
                        Lyconides, what shall I do now?
                     
                     PLAUTUS.
                  
               
               THE house is Mr. Keene's, the British consul; the company in the salon consists of
                  two or three loyal English, a few Spanish hidalgos, and a sprinkling of French
                  noblemen. Conversation is carried on in subdued tones, while various couples are
                  promenading. Mr. Keene is attending to his guests, and welcoming them with the
                  well-bred cordiality for which he is distinguished. Suddenly there is a scuffling
                  noise heard on the stairs outside, which draws all attention thither. The consul
                  goes to inquire the reason of the unseasonable uproar.
               Here we must stop for a moment to inform you that Philip has received an answer
                  from the Pretender empowering him to act as ambassador to Spain, and also to
                  assist Ormond in organizing an expedition to invade England, and, above all, to
                  vindicate the separation in the Pretender's family; for James has seriously
                  offended both the Queen of Spain and the Emperor, by his treatment of his consort,
                  Clementina.
               Arriving at the head of the stairs, the nostrils of the consul are saluted with a
                  strong smell of tobacco, which is his special abhorrence. The servant announces:
                     "His Grace, the Duke of Wharton and
                  Northumberland!" A hiccoughing voice adds: "Prime minister as well, fellow!" And
                  Philip slowly staggers up stairs. Reaching the top, he exclaims: "Well, Mr. Consul
                  Keene, how are you? I shall supersede you before long for your confounded
                  impudence in being disloyal—disloyal, d'ye hear?"
               "Yes, your grace. Will you come in and sit down? You look unwell," he replies in a
                  conciliating manner, adding, however, under his breath, "Talking, tippling
                  knave."
               "Keene, I tell you that his majesty's interests have hitherto been managed by her
                  grace of Perth, and three or four other old women who meet under the portals of
                  Saint Germains. His majesty wants a Whig, and a brisk one, to put them in the
                  right train, and I am the man! You may now look upon me, Sir Philip Wharton,
                  Knight of the Garter, and Sir Robert Walpole, Knight of the Bath, running a
                  course, and, by Heaven, he shall be hard pressed! He bought my family pictures
                  when those infernal chancery men griped me; but they will not be long in his
                  possession. That account is still open. Neither he nor King George shall be six
                  months at ease as long as I have the honor to serve in the employ I am in now."
                  Puffing a globe of smoke in the consul's face, he leers insolently at him.
               Keene, reddening at his visitor's language, replies: "Your grace, though I am not
                  a duke, I am a gentleman and a true man. I will not allow such expressions to be
                  used in this house. They are an insult to my king and myself. My servant will show
                  you the door."
               Philip, steadying himself by an effort, replies: "S'blood, Keene! I'll lower
                  myself to your level for the pleasure of showing you the punta riversa, as practised by Don Sabrat and myself with the
                  three-edged blade!"
               "Thanks! I shall be at home all day to-morrow. It will give me unbounded
                  satisfaction to cross blades with you, spite of your un-English name for an
                  un-English weapon."
               Philip replies: "Adieu, Keene; I am off for Ripperda's levee. He is a man after my
                  own heart."
               "And your manners also," adds Keene, contemptuously.
               Arriving at Ripperda's, Philip is ushered in, and presented to the minister, who
                  exclaims: "Carramba, Wharton, I am glad you have called! These stilted, solemn
                  dons and impregnable donnas horrify me. However, greatness implies care and
                  trouble, you know."
               Philip answers: "I agree with you, Ripperda. We are both in the same boat. Only an
                  hour ago I went to Mr. Keene's—"
               "Insolent dog!" interpolates the minister.
               Philip resumes: "Curse me, but the fellow was so insolent that I thrashed him
                  before the whole company."
               Ripperda chuckles at this; he hates Keene with all his heart, for on one occasion,
                  when he had called out, "Keene, Keene!" the consul refused to answer him, totally
                  ignoring his presence. "You ought to have choked him, Wharton."
               "I'll pink him to-morrow."
               Ripperda, throwing up his hands, exclaims: "Your grace will certainly not fight a
                  plebeian."
               Twisting his thumb and his finger through his perfumed curls, he replies: "Yes, I
                  want to teach him a lesson."
               "By the way, O'Beirne is sitting to your left there; she is convoyed by Donna
                  Lospiratos—a rigid duenna, a very Diana."
               Philip adds, "Guarding a Venus; I intend to speak to her, though, duenna or no
                  duenna. Help me along by engaging your
                  puritanical friend until I have finished with Mistress O'Beirne."
               Ripperda sneeringly replies, "Friend! Malditos
                     perros! I have six very good friends*
                  —God, the Holy Virgin, the Emperor and Empress, and the King and Queen of
                  Spain. For enemies every man in Christendom and the Spanish nation. You see they
                  are all my servants, and never was a servant yet that would not be master if he
                  could, but they lack the talent."
               
                  
                  *Fact.
               
               Interrupting him with a half-serious, half-joking expression, Philip says,
                  "Ripperda, if you but knew it, you are like myself—not worth a Spanish groat. You
                  have no character, man!"
               "Santa Maria purissima!" cries the offended minister; "our rich grapes have their
                  usual effect on an unseasoned head."
               Philip retorts: "Not so, Ripperda; not Spanish grapes, but Dutch-Spanish
                  rhodomontades and braggadocio."
               Ripperda flushes, but does not reply, keeping his eyes toward the doors where
                  several notabilities have just made their appearance.
               Stepping toward Mistress O'Beirne, Philip pays his duties to her with much
                  cordiality. She returns his greeting with a courteous freedom and vivacity which
                  charm him. He sits down beside her, and they are quickly engaged in an interesting
                  conversation. Philip broaches the topic of her past mission to Dublin. Stopping
                  him at once, she forbids him ever mentioning the subject again under pain of her
                  displeasure. Turning to her companion, she says, "I must return to court, now; I
                  will thank your grace to personate my preux
                     chevalier!"
               He replies with an ardent look: "From this moment I am your most devoted
                  attendant."
               She glances inquiringly at him from under her drooping lashes, and, as Philip
                  thinks, leans on his arm more than is absolutely necessary. Bidding her good-bye,
                  he asks: "I can see you again before long?"
               "Your grace will not find it very difficult to see me when you wish."
               Kissing her hand, he returns to Ripperda, his heart beating with a new sensation.
                  "Ripperda, I love that girl! On my life, she is lovely! Her wit is sparkling, her
                  conversation is fresh and piquant; she is superb!"
               "Make her your duchess; then you will find her faults; now you see nothing but her
                  virtues."
               "Sage man!" replies Philip, adding, parenthetically, "She cut you once, did she
                  not, Ripperda?"
               The minister ignores the question, however, leaving Philip to speak to a friend
                  who has just entered, an emissary from Berlin.
            
            
               CHAPTER XLVIII.
               
                  
                     
                        They are preparing evidence against thee.
                     
                     THE BEGGAR'S OPERA.
                  
               
               THE consort Clementina has left James in disgust, alleging that she was treated by
                  the Earl of Inverness and his wife—an arrogant coquette—with such intolerable
                  insolence that she would not endure it any longer. She is now in the convent of
                  St. Cecilia at Rome, where the ambitious priest Alberoni is often closeted with
                  her for hours. By thus supporting his favorites at the expense of his consort,
                  James has roused the ire of the emperor at Vienna, who is justly indignant at his
                  cool treatment of a kinswoman of his house. The Queen of Spain is likewise displeased at his uncourteous conduct.
                  Thus, this true Stuart makes enemies of two powerful sovereigns at a time when
                  their friendship is of the most vital importance.
               In Spain, Ripperda has ignominiously failed. He has blustered and bragged like a
                  second Bobadil, and has given the most opposite assurances in different quarters.
                  To the British minister he has professed the greatest love toward England, and
                  palliated his warm endeavors for the Stuart cause, by vowing that he assisted
                  James merely as a blind. He has culminated his career by his double dealing with
                  the Austrian ambassador, Count Königsegg, and the Spanish court. To the former he
                  has protested that Spain would not be outdone in her exertions to help Austria,
                  while immensely exaggerating her power and resources; to the other he alleged the
                  readiness and impatience of the Austrian court as regarded affairs in France and
                  England. When both sides were undeceived, Ripperda found that, like abler men
                  before him, he had stumbled between two stools. He has been dismissed with a
                  miserable pension—a gratuitous and merited insult. Madrid is in a terrible state
                  of excitement; Ripperda's life would not be worth a pistole if he was seen in
                  public: while in France, Bourbon scarcely governs his kingdom, while Madame de
                  Prie and Paris Duvernay completely govern him. In England, the emperor's creature,
                  Mr. Palm, is bribing right and left to secure all the Hanoverian partisans
                  possible. The King of Prussia has flouted the Hanover alliance, while George
                  begins to fear lest the electorate should be endangered—an object of far more
                  interest to him than England's safety.
               Philip has been sick for the last few days, a state of body which has had its
                  effect on his not unchangeable ideas and resolves. After he had calmly reviewed
                  his conduct at Mr. Keene's house, his better feeling reigned triumphant.
                  Accordingly he had written a humble, penitential letter to him, apologizing for
                  his actions, and hoping that all would be forgotten. The following postscript he
                  added at the bottom of the paper: "If you mean to take my challenge in earnest, of
                  course I am still at your service." The consul's answer was mild and conciliating,
                  and he has waived his right with many thanks for his grace's condescension.
               He is alone in his room, sitting at his desk, intently perusing a letter sealed
                  with the arms of England. It is an order under the privy seal, commanding him, on
                  his allegiance, to return home forthwith, or he will be outlawed, and all his
                  property and valuables sequestrated.
               "Ah, ha! so he threatens me? Eh bien! I prefer his threats to his favors; that he
                  shall know. What do I want with his pitiful favor? I would rather carry a musket
                  in an odd-named Muscovite regiment, than wallow in riches by the help of that
                  tallow-headed usurper. It is very curious, though, how intimately acquainted he is
                  with my most private actions. I must have an enemy here somewhere. I'll write to
                  Jamie. An account of this offer will amuse him, while at the same time it must
                  bring me into high favor by showing my entire devotion to his cause. Egad! I may
                  be appointed prime minister yet. He is a Stuart, though—new toys are his hobbies.
                  I fear that even I might be out in the rain of royal frowns once in a while."
               Drawing a sheet of paper toward him, he proceeds to give an account of the royal
                  mandate to the Pretender, embellishing it with many little conceits and witty
                  sparkles, one or two of which, edging slightly on the immoral, are scarcely fit
                  for the eyes of a pious prince. Philip also announces to him his intention of
                  openly espousing the Roman Catholic religion. Finishing his letter, he rises and exclaims: "Pedro, Pedro! you
                  dog, come here!" Pedro enters, and the preparations for his grace's toilet begin.
                  "Who is at the palace to-day, Pedro?"
               "I know not, your grace; stories are afloat, though, that the Marquis de
                  Villadarias will be there; also the Conde de Las Torres."
               "Falstaff and Alexander—who else?—what ladies?"
               "Your grace, on that point I am still more ignorant."
               "Will Mlle. O'Beirne be there?"
               "Oh, yes, your grace, I thought you meant ladies!"
               "S'death! Pedro, never mind your thoughts; thinking is your master's
                  privilege."
               Applying a trifle of powder to Philip's chin, he replies humbly: "Yes, your
                  grace."
               "Recollect that Mlle. O'Beirne is—pah." Turning pettishly away, he pulls his lace
                  ruffles over his hands and smooths his sleeves.
               As Philip enters the royal gardens, his attention is attracted to a couple who are
                  only a few yards distant. The lady is Mlle. O'Beirne; the cavalier is Edgely
                  Valentin; she is leaning on his arm, apparently gently chiding him for some fault
                  or inattention; while his eyes are filled with an admiring, loving expression
                  which arouses an angry jealousy in Philip's bosom. He exclaims: "Again, Edgely
                  Valentin! The threads of our lives are strangely twisted! whether is it chance or
                  design? Be it either, by Heaven I'll cut them, if he pushes himself upon me!"
            
            
               CHAPTER XLIX.
               
                  
                     Anguis in herbâ latet.
                  
               
               EDGELY VALENTIN is dressed in black velvet, which sombre color is scarcely
                  relieved by the row of purple rosettes or buttons attached to the facings of his
                  coat. Philip instantly decides to accost them, expose the impostor Edgely
                  Valentin, and upbraid her—for what? for inconstancy, fickleness? As yet he has
                  scarcely spoken with her an hour at a time, and already jealousy is agitating his
                  mind. Rapidly walking up to the unconscious pair, he lifts his hat haughtily to
                  Mistress O'Beirne, at the same time bestowing upon her companion a long, insolent
                  stare, and sneeringly surveying him from head to foot. Meanwhile Valentin's
                  countenance is lowering and angry, his eyes sparkling with a look of hatred, as he
                  undergoes the scrutiny.
               "Has your grace completed your examination of my person?" handing his card to
                  Philip, who reads out "Sir Edgely Warely!"
               "You lie, sirrah! It should be Edgely Valentin, spy and traitor!" Tearing the card
                  to pieces, he throws it on the ground.
               With a quick, silent movement, Valentin draws his rapier. Mistress O'Beirne,
                  noticing his motion, quickly places herself in front of him, and grasps the sharp
                  blade in her gloved hand; exclaiming to Philip, with a steady reproachful glance:
                  "For shame, your grace!—such language and behavior in my presence! in the royal
                  precincts as well?"
               
               Stammering an indistinct apology Philip lifts his hat and strides away.
               Sheathing his rapier, while his teeth are set, and his face drawn as with pain,
                  Valentin says: "An old feud, Nora!"
               "A strange time and place to settle an old feud!" replies the offended girl.
               "It was not of my seeking," he replies, in a low, pleading voice.
               "I know it, Sir Edgely. I blame only his grace for the disagreeable rencontre. I
                  thought him more of a gallant—more truly courteous in his manners."
               "He is, generally; he doubtless desired your company more than the adjustment of a
                  quarrel."
               Her color heightens at his words. Turning to an orange tree close by her, she
                  plucks a twig, at the same time replying in a careless manner, "Flatterer! what
                  could his grace want with me?"
               "What many a better man would: win you for his wife."
               Dropping his arm, she says warningly: "Sir Edgely, you are again approaching that
                  forbidden topic! Alberoni's letter of introduction commended you as a true friend
                  to the cause, and an able counsellor. He did not specify that you were to be a
                  lover as well as an adviser."
               Hanging his head, he is silent, and his lips tremble for an instant.
               Grinding his teeth with rage, Philip invokes curses on his supposed rival. "A
                  base-born, fatherless hireling! flying at my game! 'Tis a pity I did not slit his
                  nose while he was in London, as Cowper suggested; he would have probably found
                  less favor in her eyes! As she likes—she prefers the crow to the eagle; she
                  certainly has a right to a choice. I'll to Stanhope; he can, may be, tell me more
                  than I already know about this Sir Edgely Warely—forsooth!" Leaving the garden, he
                  walks towards the minister's house.
               Arriving at his destination, he is announced by the servant, and requested to walk
                  up stairs and await the coming of the minister. Opening the first door he meets, a
                  scene greets his eyes which roots him to the floor in speechless amazement.
                  Stanhope is standing in the centre of the room, his face wearing an expression of
                  mixed annoyance, perplexity, and contempt; while, grovelling on the floor, with
                  his arms around the minister's feet, and his clothes in sad disorder, is the once
                  vain-glorious Ripperda, late prime minister. He exclaims in a guttural patois:
                  "Your kind excellency, you shall know everything, if you will only save me from
                  the cut-throats and assassins who would murder me. I will tell you all about the
                  Vienna affair, which means the entire uprooting of the Protestants and the
                  universal power—"
               Quickly clapping his hand on Ripperda's mouth, Stanhope turns, and looks sternly
                  and suspiciously at Philip, saying: "It seems your grace has a new
                  occupation—spy."
               "Mr. Stanhope, appearances are against me; but I give you the word of an English
                  gentleman, that it is an entire accident which has made me a witness of this
                  scene."
               Bowing politely, Stanhope replies: "I believe you. It is needless for me to ask
                  your silence in regard to all you have seen or heard?"
               "On my honor, it shall never be mentioned."
               Hurriedly retiring, he exclaims: "Euge! Ripperda at Stanhope's feet, blabbing
                  secrets of state! the brave Ripperda, the invincible, astute Ripperda, Spain's
                  chiefest honor, wearing out his satin breeches at English Stanhope's feet! This is
                  indeed a discovery! I'll not wait for his excellency's opinion of Valentin: the
                     greater absorbs the smaller matter."
                  Walking along absorbed in his thoughts, he brushes against a tall cavalier, with
                  military moustaches of wonderful length. Turning to apologize, he sees his friend
                  Count Königsegg, to whom he was introduced by Ripperda.
               "Well met, Count, the man above all others whom I wish to see!"
               He replies: "I am flattered, your grace."
               "Not the slightest necessity, Count, I assure you. You see I have been unable to
                  leave my room for the last week; consequently I am rather behind the rest of
                  Madrid in regard to passing events. You are always well versed in current news and
                  items. I beg you, share your stock with me!"
               "With pleasure, your grace."
               "One moment, Count, before you begin. Do you know aught about a fellow who styles
                  himself Sir Edgely Warely? He seems to ruffle it gayly at court!"
               "Nothing, except that he was—and is still, for all I know—a favorite of Alberoni,
                  who has often trusted him on errands requiring a cool head and a strong arm."
               "A good cheek, as well, by St. Jago!" adds Philip.
               "I have heard that he is to be married in a short time to one of her majesty's
                  maids—a Mlle. O'Beirne."
               Philip starts, exclaiming, "Never; she would never accept him!"
               "Why not? He is quite a fine-looking man, and he appears to possess plenty of
                  money—far more than she has, at all events."
               Philip vacantly replies, "Yes;" and he walks along in silence, musing over
                  Mistress O'Beirne's wit and beauty.
            
            
               CHAPTER L.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Vain human kind! fantastic race!
                           Thy various follies who can trace?
                        
                     
                     SWIFT.
                  
               
               "MLLE. O'BEIRNE, you say I am a stranger to you!—that you are unknown to me. Does
                  not our acquaintance date years back, in your father's birthplace—Dublin? Can you
                  repulse me when I tell you that, ever since that day in the cathedral, I have
                  never ceased to think of you, while mourning the fate which separated us?"
               Philip was kneeling at her feet, the moon shining on his upturned face as he
                  pleaded his love, and asked her to be his wife. Looking steadfastly at him, she
                  replied in an unsteady voice:—
               "Your grace, to say that I have never thought of you since that time would be
                  untrue; but my feelings toward you have never been greater than those of
                  friendship." He was about to interrupt her; but, silencing him with a motion of
                  her hand, she resumed: "You must recollect, moreover, that I am penniless! I could
                  not bring you the dowry a duke's bride should possess!"
               "Mlle, O'Beirne—Nora! I will not argue with you. If you refuse me, my death be on
                  your hands. I could not live alone when you might be my constant companion and
                  beloved wife."
               "Your grace, this is a threat which no gentleman would make—rise, I pray you!
                  To-morrow, when you are cooler—when you
                  have reflected on what you have said—"
               "You will allow me to renew my proposals, dear Nora?"
               "No! I was about to say that you will blame yourself and me also for your rash
                  conduct and unconsidered words, which—which—" Bursting into tears she covered her
                  face with her hands.
               Quickly rising, he threw his arms around her waist, despite her resistance, and
                  kissed her repeatedly while holding her hand imprisoned in his.
               "This is an outrage, sir! Release me, or I will alarm the palace!" she exclaimed
                  in quick, broken accents.
               "Be Duchess of Wharton—be my wife!"
               Steadying her voice by a strong effort, she replied: "Release me, and I will give
                  you my answer!"
               He did so, and awaited her reply in mute expectation.
               "Your grace, consider carefully all I say; consider the bold, unwomanly words that
                  I shall utter; consider how lost to all shame I am to make so bold an avowal—"
               She paused for a moment, while her breath came quick and fast; then, in the
                  verdurous, ivy-covered balcony, she told him a tale—true or false—which set his
                  blood on fire, and made everything about him whirl in an unsteady dance. She told
                  him that she had never ceased to think of him since-their interview in Dublin, and
                  that, when she had seen him on the Prado, she had felt happier than ever she had
                  been before. "But you must not ask me to be your wife until you are sure that you
                  know your own mind. I am proud and penniless; yet a king could not have me save as
                  his consort. My temper is quick, and not very easily controlled. These are bad
                  qualities in a wife; but it is better you should know all before asking me to be
                  yours for life."
               Catching her in his arms, he exclaimed; "Nora, you are a noble woman!
                  Unfortunately for your purpose, you have only riveted the chains which bind me to
                  you the faster. From this moment you are my wife—"
               "Wait! I will not consent until you have had time to reflect on your actions. Come
                  to me one month from to-night—you shall then receive my answer."
               Dashing his hand on the edge of the balcony, he exclaimed: "Nora, I will not leave
                  this spot until you consent!"
               She looked pained and embarrassed, while her hands clasped around each other.
                  Taking a ring from his pocket, he placed it on her passive finger and said: "Nora,
                  Duchess of Wharton, and, better still, Philip's love." She offered no resistance,
                  and the ring glittered bravely in the moonlight.
            
            
               CHAPTER LI.
               
                  
                     
                        True, a new mistress now I chase.
                     
                     LOVELACE.
                  
               
               WHEN Mlle. O'Beirne had accepted Philip as her future husband, she had forgotten
                  that, as a maid of honor, it was her duty to ask the permission of her royal
                  mistress ere the step was taken. She had not thought about it at the time, and
                  when she told her majesty, requesting her permission, the answer came quick and
                  angrily: "No! you are both mad! The alliance would be productive of the worst
                  consequences. The Duke of Wharton is known to be the most profligate, immoral man
                  of the age! Moreover he is such a spendthrift, all his property is sequestrated by
                  the English government for his loyalty to James. What funds he may have with him
                  will soon be expended; then how could
                  you live? You have not a pistole you can call your own."
               Nora had almost swooned at this unexpected refusal, and she had faintly wondered
                  what his grace would do or say.
               When Philip heard of her majesty's indignant refusal, he became well-nigh crazy,
                  and his after excitement and anger produced a dangerous relapse, in consequence of
                  which he was again prostrated. The court doctors who attended him pronounced him
                  in a very critical state, declaring that unless some change for the better took
                  place, he could not long survive. He would not eat, and would drink nothing but
                  brandy.
               When the queen heard of his forlorn condition and the dangerous symptoms of his
                  illness, she sent him a kindly message, hinting that if he thought his conduct and
                  morals would be more steady in future, and if he would embrace the Roman Catholic
                  faith, she might think of recalling her former decision.
               Philip received this message during the absence of the doctors. He immediately
                  sprang from his bed, forced his frightened valet to dress him, while threatening
                  him with his rapier point, rushed precipitately to the palace, forcing himself
                  through the crowd of courtiers and gentlemen in waiting, and threw himself on his
                  knees before the throne.
               Behind the royal chair stands Nora O'Beirne, frightened and thunderstruck at
                  Philip's boldness in thus forcing himself on her majesty's notice. Close beside
                  her is Lord North, eying Philip with a wondering stare, waiting for a dénouement
                  of the affair. On either side of her majesty stand the Conde de las Torres, and
                  the proud Marquis de Villadarias. Count Königsegg can be seen amid the assemblage
                  surrounding the throne.
               All eyes are turned on Philip, as he cries in a weak, unsteady voice: "Your
                  majesty, have mercy on me—on us! I cannot live without her!"
               The queen glances pityingly at him, while inclining her ear to las Torres, who
                  whispers a few words in a low voice. Nodding her head, she says to Philip:—
               "Your grace, as a daughter of the church, we cannot allow our maid to unite
                  herself with a heretic; that is an impassable bar to the union."
               Rising, Philip replies in a louder voice than before: "Your majesty, I do here
                  most solemnly and truly abjure the Protestant belief, assuring you that I am in
                  heart and soul as good a Catholic as yourself; and have been all my life,
                  privately if not openly!"
               The queen and las Torres exchange a significant smile. Turning again to Philip,
                  she resumes: "In our opinion, your projected marriage is hasty and ill-advised. We
                  greatly fear that you will—too late—repent your step." Turning to Nora, she says
                  rather imperiously: "Mlle. O'Beirne, if you truly love and respect his grace of
                  Wharton, go to him! Holy Mary bless and guard you both, is our sincerest
                  wish!"
               Grasping Nora's hand with a quick movement, Philip leads her through the opening
                  lane of wondering courtiers and smiling dames toward the anteroom, where they can
                  be alone. Passing along, he notices Edgely Valentin, at whom he glances
                  contemptuously, although a pang of jealousy strikes his heart as he observes Nora
                  turn pale, while her hand trembles a little. Valentin's face bears an expression
                  of suffering hatred as he returns Philip's look, while his eyes rest with a
                  curiously mixed expression of envy and triumph on Nora's downcast face.
               They are to be married to-night, at Philip's earnest entreaties. He intends to
                  take her with him to Rome, there to spend the honeymoon, a project to which Nora
                  has unwillingly acceded. She wished to delay the nuptials tials for at least three months; deprecating any
                  delay, however, his waywardness carried the day.
               
                  Le roi est mort, vive le roi!
               
            
            
               CHAPTER LII.
               
                  
                     Les cartes sont brouillées.
                  
               
               AS they enter the royal presence, the Pretender welcomes them very warmly, even
                  deigning to kiss Nora's cheek; a liberty which she does not resent, although
                  Philip little relishes his sovereign's freedom. Turning to Philip, James says: "A
                  running ship collects no barnacles, Wharton; but it seems you have secured a
                  glorious prize! We almost envy you your blushing bride!"
               "If it but stop at envy, your majesty, I shall be well pleased," replies Philip,
                  sullenly.
               "Out on thee for thy churlishness, man!" James laughs, with a glance at the
                  Countess of Inverness, who replies by surveying Nora with a spiteful sneer.
               The Earl of Dunbar, noticing her disdainful gesture, remarks aside: "Terribly
                  coarse and vulgar!"
               "Very!" is the low reply.
               Assuming a graver demeanor, James says to Philip: "We would speak with you in
                  private! Our friends will amuse her grace meanwhile;" motioning Philip to follow
                  him. Entering a small, shabby, ill-furnished room, James resumes, in a
                  conciliating, familiar manner: "Your grace, we have heard that you have openly
                  embraced the true faith?"
               "It is true, your majesty!"
               "What we now intend to say to you must be taken in good part—as we say it in good
                  meaning. We know of your grace's gallantries and escapades, and have sorrowed
                  anent them as being of an ungodly and immoral nature. We would desire you to curb
                  your spirit, and so conduct yourself as to merit our special approval and esteem,
                  as well as to close the mouths of those who are envious of your great parts and
                  genius. It would ill become us to have the world at large say that we looked
                  kindly on a roystering, godless gallant."
               Philip answers haughtily: "Your majesty entertains but an ill opinion of me!
                  I—"
               "Nay, nay! Wharton, you are mistaken! Our last words were meant rather as a
                  prophecy of what you might become, if you did not put a check on your wit and
                  exuberancy. It is your sprightliness and vivacity which have heretofore led you
                  into so many misadventures."
               "Forgive me, your majesty! In future, my conduct shall be based on your majesty's,
                  and it will certainly tend to cure one of my vices to have such an example to
                  follow!"
               "Nay! not such a good example, if Lockhart of Carnwarth speaks truly! He has many
                  times told us of our infirmities. Assoilzie him! as our father would have
                  said!"
               Philip replies: "A good man and true, though over brusque in his ways, under
                  favor, your majesty; I think he is as true a friend to the cause as any gentleman
                  in Rome."
               Frowning slightly, James replies: "Yes! truly he is over brusque."
               There is a silence, until James says: "By the rood! it is time for mass! Our
                  confessor may wax impatient at our long delay!"
               Leading the way, they re-enter the saloon.
               Philip, noticing that the Earl of Dunbar is whispering to Nora, walks quickly toward them, upon which they
                  begin to converse on indifferent subjects. Meanwhile my Lady Inverness looks on in
                  disdainful silence. James signifying that the audience is ended, Philip leads Nora
                  out, and they enter the coach awaiting them at the palace door.
               Philip is apparently vexed and angry. He says, rather coldly: "Your grace will
                  make all necessary arrangements to leave immediately for Paris, or Madrid, or
                  perchance London, I have not quite determined which; but Rome shall contain us no
                  longer." Settling himself in the far corner, he looks stolidly out of the
                  window.
               Nora wonders at his sullen behavior, and fears that she has offended him. She
                  replies affectionately: "Why, Philip, how abrupt you are! Of course, wherever you
                  wish to go, it is my happiness to accompany you. But why should you be so stern?
                  Have I offended you?"
               "No, Nora, you have not, but his fictitious majesty saw fit to take up all my old
                  offences, warning me, at the same time, that if my conduct did not change for the
                  better, he would prefer my absence to my presence."
               She replies quickly: "Philip, you must have misunderstood him! Let us remain here
                  a few days at any rate, and you will find how gracious he is. For my sake, dear
                  Philip, do not call him 'fictitious;' he is our true king, is he not?"
               Glancing angrily at her, he replies: "You justly consider him gracious and
                  amiable; I add a title of my own—omni-loving."
               "Yes, Philip, he has a loving heart, and in it all his true subjects have a
                  share."
               "Some have too great a share, I fear me. However, loving heart or not, amiability
                  or crabbedness, to-day will see us on our journey."
               "To where?" she asks, timidly.
               "By the time we have arrived at our stopping-place, you will know. Until
                  then—peace! I pray you!"
               Her eyes fill at his words, and a silence falls between them. She glances at him
                  with a troubled look, but his eyes are closed as if in sleep.
               "Alas! when Alberoni conjured me on my loyalty to obey Sir Edgely's counsels, I
                  knew not what they would be when I gave my blind compliance! I recollect his very
                  words; 'Mlle. O'Beirne, Wharton must be gained to our side. Sir Edgely has failed
                  from no fault of his own, and though I know well your mutual love, yet must it be
                  sacrificed for our common causes—the holy Catholic faith and the support of King
                  James, both here and abroad. Let Sir Edgely be seen with you in public where his
                  grace may observe you, his hatred and contempt of Sir Edgely is a handle by which
                  we can work. His pride will be aroused; your own wit and beauty can do the rest.
                  Once married, guide him with invisible reins, and make him true to church and
                  state;' and I have done it all; been false to him, and a liar to my husband! No!
                  not that. I did love him when he asked me to be his wife, kissed me with his fiery
                  lips, held me in his arms, and called me his 'duchess.' That frenzy has gone, and
                  now—Alberoni must commend my talent, however. He will praise me, for Philip is now
                  a Catholic, a Jacobite, and my husband—all by my exertions! I must write to his
                  eminence and inform him of Philip's anger at his majesty; it may be dangerous to
                  the cause! Edgely can take the message, poor fellow." She shudders, while the
                  coach draws up with a loud clatter, and they alight.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER LIII.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           The wondering world, where'er he moves,
                           With new delight looks up.
                        
                     
                     SWIFT.
                  
               
               IN a lofty, sombre chamber of the convent of St. Cecilia, Cardinal Alberoni and
                  the titular Queen Clementina are conversing in low tones; while Edgely Valentin is
                  standing behind the cardinal's chair, calm and motionless. Alberoni is short and
                  squat, with ponderous shoulders and a bull neck; his head is unusually large, and
                  his complexion swarthy; his jawbones are prominent; his eyes deep in their
                  sockets, yet bold and piercing; a moustache hides his upper lip, while a small,
                  peaked tuft adorns his chin. On his head is a tight skullcap; his person is
                  enveloped in a cardinal's robe. He is attentively reading a short note bearing the
                  signature: "Nora, Duchess of Wharton." Laying it down, he says: "Sir Edgely,
                  accept my thanks for this; I will attend to it, and see that his majesty pursues a
                  more conciliating policy toward his grace."
               Bowing low, Valentin replies: "Your eminence, he is a valuable acquisition to our
                  party; under favor, I think it was because his majesty showed a liking for
                  Mlle.—her grace, that he was displeased; I judge so from a previous interview with
                  her grace."
               Clementina says, with a sigh: "Surely James has enough without her, to grace his
                  reputation and divide his attentions."
               Covertly smiling, Alberoni inquires: "How does my Lord Dunbar now?"
               Valentin replies: "High in favor, your eminence, and likely to continue so, as is
                  also my Lady Inverness."
               Striking her hands on the table, the queen exclaims, with an angry look: "The
                  courtesan!"
               Valentin pursues: "She is as conceited and arrogant as ever!"
               Alberoni adds: "Two qualities tending to shame and mortification. Is North in
                  town?"
               "No, your eminence; he has gone to the trenches at Gibraltar, to offer his
                  services to las Torres."
               "Indeed! If the Condé appreciates him at his true worth, he will send him back
                  again—a blustering, ill-bred fellow, with scarce a spark of talent or energy!"
               "He is a good Catholic!" exclaims the queen.
               "Your majesty, a Catholic may do more harm to his religion as an exponent than an
                  opponent," he dryly replies, adding: "Villadarias should have taken the command at
                  the trenches; I distrust las Torres, he is too wordy—too wordy."
               The queen replies: "Yes, he should; but he is too shrewd. He thinks there is
                  little prospect of gaining honor there, and is willing enough to allow his
                  colleague to reap the crop of bombs and bullets. In his opinion, the Rock is
                  impregnable. Las Torres has declared that his majesty's flag shall wave over its
                  ramparts in a very short time?"
               Alberoni replies: "Villadarias is culpably timid in this affair. Gibraltar is
                  feebly defended; our land forces are strong, and if necessary we could safely
                  attack it on the water side! There will be a terrible slaughter; but the Rock must
                  capitulate; then the desire of my life will be gratified!" Rubbing his hands
                  together, his eyes sparkle joyously.
               Glancing at him, the queen says: "Cardinal, it is long since we have seen you so
                  happy?"
               
               "Your majesty will see me happier if the Rock capitulates!"
               "Pardon me, your eminence," interrupts Valentin in a low whisper: "Here is a
                  communication respecting Fleury," handing him a small packet, which Alberoni
                  conceals in his gown.
               Overhearing the name, the queen inquires: "Speaking of Fleury, cardinal, how does
                  he stand in your estimation?"
               "A second Mazarin, with rather more honesty and principle." Turning to Valentin,
                  he resumes: "How did Mlle. Nora relish the change in her name and quality?"
               He replies bitterly: "Too well, I judge, your eminence."
               "Too well! What mean you? Can aught be done in too willing a spirit for Holy
                  Mother Church?"
               Valentin replies confusedly: "Forgive me! I hardly knew what I said!"
               Looking fixedly at him, he replies: "My son, take heed that you have no thought
                  outside of the church, except such as I may bless and sanction."
               Counting her beads, the queen mutters her prayers with eyes downcast and
                  humble.
               Alberoni continues, "You may retire, my son."
               "Pardon me, your eminence! Before I go, I would like to intimate that if his grace
                  could be induced to serve in the trenches in some superior capacity, he would be
                  still further involved with us, less likely to return to St. James'?"
               "My son, your astuteness is commendable. True—his connection with England severed,
                  he would be with us from sheer necessity. I will have his thoughts turned in that
                  direction, if possible!"
               Touching a small bell, a young girl enters, dressed in the robes of a novice;
                  Alberoni says quickly: "My daughter!—Wharton—hint to him that honor and fame are
                  to be gained at Gibraltar—send at once—anonymous."
               Bowing low, she kisses his hand, retiring as silently as she had entered. Turning
                  to Valentin, he says: "You can mention to her grace our design, so that she may
                  work in unison with us!"
               The stone floor echoes under Valentin's feet, while the door creaks harshly as he
                  closes it after his exit. He does not leave immediately. Standing on the
                  threshold, he places his ear to the door, through which the voices of the queen
                  and Alberoni can be dimly heard.
               "Not a word that interests me! A pest on the cardinal! one would think he knew I
                  listened outside, he broaches such trifling subjects?—if he will but
                  fight against old England, it will be one step more in the right direction; one
                  step nearer to the consummation. Once I was Jacobite for James' sake, but when she
                  told me the story of her life—of the violated promise, I became Jacobite for my
                  own sake, and when for that cause I had either to lose my revenge or Nora, I chose
                  the latter, letting him have her as his wife!—a Delilah and a Samson! My king, my
                  honor, and my love have I surrendered! For twenty-seven years has the finger of
                  scorn been pointed at me; for twenty-seven years have I been gibed and taunted
                  with a bastard origin!—Furies! Never will I forget that day when he drove me from
                  him at Stair's, with the old taunt, the same sneer which has been my portion all
                  my life. Act of attainder—sequestration—ignominy. They shall be my weapons, forged
                  by deluded ministers. His nature is not like mine. He would sink under poverty and
                  disgrace; but he shall try them, he shall try them! curse him! If I can reduce him
                  to beggary and despair, I'll never lose sight of him; I'll close my hands around
                  his white neck and press the life out
                  of him. Let him die with my face close to his, my eyes looking into his, my breath
                  on his lips—then I'll tell him who—what I am; describe to him my long life of
                  wounded sensibilities that would not grow callous. Then—"
               In his blind anger he runs against the iron wicket, bringing out the portress—a
                  blear-eyed, toothless woman, who unlocks the gate, and he walks rapidly in the
                  direction of the palace. As he arrives within sight of his destination, he notices
                  a coach drawn by four black horses, being driven toward him. The next moment he
                  observes a ragged fellow toss a letter through the window, Philip's face appearing
                  at the same instant. He mutters: "Wharton! strange! The coach is loaded down with
                  trunks and bags as if he intends to leave us; I must let his eminence know of
                  this."
               Let us glance into the coach. The letter thrown in is on the floor, rumpled and
                  torn. Stooping and picking it up, Nora inquires: "May I read it, Philip?"
               "Yes, if you choose," he replies.
               Throwing it down after a hasty perusal, she exclaims: "What a field in which to
                  gather fame! The eyes of the world are turned on this coming contest!"
               He replies: "It is anonymous! A friend seldom conceals himself, an enemy almost
                  invariably!"
               "I think this is from a friend, who, being aware of your talents and
                  ambition, is desirous of pointing out the way, while fearing lest you might
                  dislike his officiousness."
               "Probably. However, friend or enemy, the suggestion suits me exactly. We will stop
                  at the next cabaret, then I will write to las Torres, offering him my services at
                  Gibraltar. We can go by sea to Barcelona, thence to the scene of action."
               Nora replies: "Would it not be better to write to his majesty that you design to
                  take arms in his service?"
               "I will do so, Nora; your advice is opportune."
               "Of course, you will await his majesty's answer?"
               "Not at all; we shall continue on our route. I am sure that he will gladly accede
                  to my proposal. Las Torres is the commandant, I believe; he will doubtless carry
                  on the siege with credit and success."
               "If you help him, he could not do otherwise."
               "I would that others could appreciate my talents as well as you, Nora," he
                  replies, thinking with regret on his cool reception at Rome.
               "Force them to appreciate you; show yourself to the world in your true colors as a
                  loyal, talented commander."
               He does not answer her. He is thinking of the daring deeds he will accomplish in
                  the trenches, of the brave show he will make in his Spanish uniform, which, he has
                  determined, shall be violet with pearl facings, and gold lace; colors harmonizing
                  well with his complexion, which he keeps clear and fresh with an unguent used by
                  Mlle. Paris Duvernay.
            
            
               CHAPTER LIV.
               
                  
                     "For who could be blind to so brilliant a star?"
                  
               
               CONDE DE LAS TORRES is commander-in-chief of the army before Gibraltar; his
                  aide-de-camp is the Duke of Wharton, who has come hither prepared to draw his
                  sword and fight against his mother country. Nora is also here, not liking to leave
                  him alone for reasons of her own. Not caring to await an answer to his letter from
                  the king, he has come at once to the camp. Fortunately nately or unfortunately, his majesty's letter has
                  preceded him, appointing him to the before-mentioned position, an office of trust
                  and danger. It is a position, moreover, in which his name is sure to be blazoned
                  abroad.
               The Marquis de Verboom and Don Lucas Spinola are part of the staff, although they
                  are both greatly opposed to the siege, while Philip and las Torres are in favor of
                  its continuance. General Gaspar Clayton is in command of the Rock, which is feebly
                  defended inside, but supported by a powerful fleet standing at anchor under the
                  precipitous walls. From the summit of the Promontory can be seen the tiny huts of
                  the Catalonian fishermen far down on the sparkling, crested beach. To the
                  occident, Barbary's fierce shores protrude their beetling crags, and barren Mons
                  Abyla rises boldly against the horizon.
               Las Torres has systematically proceeded in his hostile approaches. Besides
                  throwing up formidable trenches, he has erected many outposts, and excavated
                  numerous mines. His batteries sweep every penetrable point, also commanding, in a
                  measure, the waters of the bay. A large detachment is, at present, stationed on
                  the beach at Genoese Cove, while the trenches are filled with watchful troops.
               Philip is at headquarters with de Montemar and the rest of the staff, who have
                  decided that the new batteries are to open on the besieged at once. The decision
                  has been arrived at only after great discussion, during which Philip gave many
                  important suggestions. At his urgent solicitations his grace is given the command
                  of one of the attacking detachments.
               Orders are given to the artillerymen, the troops placed in position, guns
                  inspected, swords loosened, weak points anxiously scanned, and strong positions
                  approved. The besieged, seeing the preparations for an assault, hurriedly busy
                  themselves in strengthening their defences with sand bags and butts bound with
                  fascines.
               All are in a state of great expectancy; every man is at his gun, matchlocks
                  lighted, sponge and rammer ready. All are awaiting, yet dreading the first BOOM,
                  telling the deadly batteries have begun their work. De Montemar says to las
                  Torres: "Saint Jago! I am terribly anxious about the power and effect of our
                  guns!"
               "Montemar, you are nervous—excited. I will give the signal as soon as Spinola
                  returns from his inspection of the Land Port wall?"
               Verboom inquires: "Conde, how many balls and shells can we throw into the fortress
                  a day?"
               "Seven hundred per hour!" is the concise answer.
               Brightening at the estimate, he turns to Philip, saying, "That gives me more hope;
                  I begin to think it even probable that we may succeed."
               Philip replies in a chiding manner: "My dear marquis, before to-morrow we will
                  have Gaspar Clayton begging for a respite, sending us their surrender. As my
                  countrymen, I expect las Torres will so far favor me as to allow them to march out
                  with the honors."
               "The Virgin defend us from such a fate at all events."
               Spinola, galloping up at this moment, delivers a field glass to las Torres,
                  saying, in quick, hurried accents: "The enemy have erected a strong battery at the
                  Moorish castle, while the Jews are so helpless and cowardly, that it is impossible
                  to make them work at the trenches! A detachment should be sent at once, for the
                  enemy's vessels are decimating our troop in a terrible manner! They are entirely
                  unprotected, and are rapidly losing all courage and vigor."
               Las Torres, startled at the news, exclaims in a loud voice: "To your posts,
                  gentlemen! the attack must be made at once! Your grace, much depends upon your coolness! Spinola, be wary—not too
                  impetuous! Ribadeo, recollect we are Spaniards; the Rock must be ours. Away! in
                  two minutes I will give the signal to open the batteries! Then, sweeping them from
                  north to south—east to west, we will teach these heretics that Gibraltar can be
                  taken." Turning to Spinola, who still lingers, he cries: "Away! I will attend to
                  the trenches immediately—curse the Jews!" Calling a captain of cavalry standing a
                  few yards away, he continues: "Señor Juan, take fifty men to the trenches, throw
                  them up as quickly as possible, and stay there until you receive further
                  commands."
               Sinking on his knees behind a low parapet, las Torres prays: "Santa Maria, grant
                  us victory; we fight against heretics—" Stopping short, he exclaims: "Maldito! I
                  have neither time nor words for prayer!" walking hastily toward the officer of the
                  batteries, he exclaims: "Señor, open all your batteries—pour in shot and shell
                  unceasingly, until further orders. Inform Señor Perilas, so that in case you are
                  struck there will be no confusion or stoppage."
               "Yes, general."
               Glancing around at the disposal of his forces, las Torres' face brightens with
                  satisfaction at the commanding positions in which his troops are stationed.
               BOOM!—ah, how terrible is the long line of lurid flame! how deafening the
                  appalling echoes shaking earth and sky! Showers of shell and chain-shot, grape and
                  shrapnel whizz singing through the air, while the black smoke puffs slowly up from
                  the belching embrasures. The firing is very effective, dismounting the guns of the
                  besieged faster than they can be replaced, while the courageous defenders are torn
                  to pieces, endeavoring to repair the shattered, crumbling ramparts from which
                  whole tons of earth and masonry are constantly detached by the rapid firing. Their
                  sand-bags and butts are swept away like chaff, while their poor ordnance is almost
                  unable to reply, being old and defective.
               Philip, receiving an order to make a sortie on a strong outpost, whence the
                  besieged are harassing Spinola's troops with deadly effect, hoarsely cheers at the
                  welcome news. Hastily forming his men into line, he tells them that must be done.
                  Placing himself at their head with his sword drawn, his hat off, and face aflame
                  with joy and excitement, he boldly advances. For outstripping his men, he pauses a
                  moment, but unable to restrain his impetuosity he again rushes forward. At this
                  moment there is a fresh volley from the Rock, the bullets and shells singing about
                  him in a dangerous chorus. Still he advances, pointing with his sword to the
                  outpost. Suddenly with a thud and a hiss a shell falls at his very feet. Starting
                  back, he looks in alarm at the sputtering fuze rapidly being consumed; fascinated
                  by the sight, he is rooted to the spot. A loud report—a blinding glare, a sound of
                  missles whistling through the air, and the smoke hides him from view.
               Rushing wildly to the spot, his soldiers lift and bear out his lifeless body. His
                  face is blackened and singed, his clothes torn to fragments, while one of his legs
                  is shattered and maimed. A loud cry bursts from the men at the sight, Philip's
                  generosity and bravery having endeared him to their hearts. Carrying him swiftly
                  to headquarters, they approach las Torres, who exclaims anxiously: "Is he dead?"
                  They only point to his face. With a quivering lip the general directs them to the
                  tent. Carrying him thither, they lay him gently on the bed. A physician is
                  immediately summoned, and an order sent to the priest to attend the dying man.
               The physician, Señor Arsenicato entering, is surprised to find his patient sitting
                  erect in bed, rubbing his face in a
                  bewildered manner, meanwhile muttering curses in Spanish and English. Laying his
                  hand on his shoulder, he persuades him to lie down again. Examining his leg, after
                  cleansing off the blood and dirt, he finds the wound is not of a dangerous
                  character; the shock of the explosion had stunned him, while a piece of the shell
                  had torn open his ankle; otherwise he is uninjured. Carefully bandaging the ankle,
                  he pats him on the back, saying encouragingly: "Bueno, bueno! your grace, we will
                  soon cure you; but you must not attempt to leave your bed until we permit
                  you!"
               Philip replies: "Why, man, think you I could lie here all day, hearing the guns
                  outside, and repose idly on my back? No!"
               Arsenicato, shrugging his shoulders, looks incredulously at him. "Bueno! but first
                  take this little draught; it is harmless, and will steady your nerves."
               Pouring two or three drops of a white liquid from a small phial, he mixes them in
                  a glass of wine. Philip swallows the potion at a gulp, his eyes close almost
                  immediately, his head falls back on the pillow, and he is asleep. "Your grace is
                  secure enough now! A good sleep is his best restorer." Throwing a mosquito net
                  over him, the wily doctor returns to his other duties.
               On awakening the next morning Philip is nearly suffocated with the strong smell of
                  powder filling the tent with a blue, acrid vapor. Rapidly dressing himself, he
                  almost forgets his wound, until he attempts to draw on his shoe, the consequent
                  pain makes him wince and groan; limping outside, las Torres surveys him in
                  surprise, congratulating him, however, on his rapid recovery.
               "Where is my detachment, Conde?"
               "It is at present incorporated with Spinola's, whose troop has been frightfully
                  thinned."
               "He must return them to me now, and I hope I shall fulfil more creditably the next
                  order I am fortunate enough to receive!"
               "That would be impossible, your grace."
               "Flattery, Conde, flattery; however, it could not be helped." After a pause he
                  resumes: "I neglected to inquire, have you sent the duchess to the rear?"
               "Still further away. It is possible we shall have to raise the siege, so last
                  night I went to her grace's apartments, told her of your accident, whereat she was
                  greatly affected—and sent her to Madrid under the protection of a strong guard of
                  Valloons."
               "Thanks; it is better she should be away. Did her grace ask to see me before she
                  went?"
               "Oh, yes; she entered headquarters, but you were asleep. Not daring to violate
                  Arsenicato's orders by awakening you, she kissed you good-bye; she was greatly
                  moved at the sight of your wound."
               "When is it probable the siege will be raised, Conde?"
               "To-morrow, unless reinforcements arrive to-night, an almost impossible
                  event!"
               Philip sighs as he thinks over the misfortune preventing him from gaining honor
                  and glory by leading a forlorn hope against the stubborn fortress.
               Ordering his staff to assemble at headquarters, las Torres enters the tent, where
                  he is soon followed by Philip, De Montemar, Verboom, and others. No sooner,
                  however, is the project of raising the siege broached, than Philip glides
                  noiselessly outside, while a smile is playing on his features.
               "I am of no use there! Moreover, there is little honor in advising on a surrender,
                  so that I am better here than there! Besides, if my opinion were needed, I should
                  undoubtedly be against retreat! Moloch is more to my taste than Belial! I want
                  action—action, and, egad! I'll have action."
               
               Securing his hat on his head, he cautiously lowers himself over the parapet to the
                  ground. Drawing his rapier, he walks slowly toward the walls near one of the
                  hostile posts, meanwhile between the opposing fires, whose various missiles whirr
                  and sing above and about him. Proceeding until within talking distance of the
                  outpost, he halts, and exclaims in a loud voice: "Halloo within there, cuckoldy
                     heretics!"*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *Fact. See various histories.
               
               In answer to this polite greeting, a dozen muskets are levelled at him, while a
                  stern voice replies: "Who goes there? Advance, and give the password!"
               Philip drawls: "Demme, sir, your voice is as harsh as any peacock's. In reply to
                  your excessively rude summons, allow me to introduce myself. The Duke of Wharton
                  and Northumberland, officer in his most Catholic majesty's service."
               There is a few moments' silence after this, until the same voice replies: "If your
                  grace will promise to return immediately to camp, you will be allowed that
                  privilege in consideration of your high rank and youthfulness, otherwise I will
                  order your arrest as a spy and a traitor! Your grace is aware of the laws of war,
                  I presume?"
               Slowly drawing out his handkerchief, Philip says: "Well, I suppose I must return;
                  but one moment, my dear fellow!—oblige me by reporting this affair to Clayton, so
                  that my friends in England will know that I am alive! Au
                     revoir, mes cochons! We will batter your boasted fortress to the
                  ground to-morrow. His majesty has just sent us enough material for a dozen more
                  batteries as heavy or heavier than those we have, au
                     revoir!"
               A dead silence greets this intelligence, while the rising moon illuminates the
                  threatening barrels directed towards his breast. Retracing his steps he opens the
                  door of the tent, inquiring: "Well, gentlemen, how goes the verdict—a raising or a
                  continuance?"
               Las Torres replies gloomily: "Suspension of hostilities."
               Philip answers: "Ah! If that is the case, I will return at once to Madrid. This
                  nitrous smoke is utterly spoiling my voice; I shall be as hoarse as Walpole if I
                  stay here any longer!" So saying, he withdraws to his own quarters to make
                  preparations for leaving.
            
            
               CHAPTER LV.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "His passion still, to covet general praise,
                           His lips to forfeit it a thousand ways;
                           A constant bounty which no friend has made;
                           An angel tongue which no man can persuade;
                           A fool with more of wit than all mankind:
                           Too rash for thought, for action too refined."
                        
                     
                     POPE'S "WHARTON."
                  
               
               JAMES is reclining in his chair looking ill and tired; in front of him stands
                  Edgely Valentin, bare headed and respectful.
               "You say that las Torres has raised the siege, and retreated?"
               "Yes, your majesty."
               "Who informed you of the reckless acts of which you accuse his grace?"
               "A trustworthy witness, your majesty. 'Tis a pity he was not in England instead of
                  at the trenches."
               Frowning angrily, James replies: "That is for us to say. However, this mad fool
                  must return to England; he is doing us more harm than good with his audacity,
                  immorality, and want of respect to his king. We would almost rather deal with him as an enemy than a
                  friend; he would certainly do us less harm. 'Tis a great pity, too; he has both
                  talent and ability, but it is seldom he exerts them; in such cases, it is too
                  often to circumvent a grisette or rob a friend at piquet or ombre." After a slight
                  pause: "Where is his duchess—the lovely Nora?"
               "Her grace is with him at Madrid, your majesty."
               Looking suspiciously at him, James inquires: "How is it, sirrah, that you are
                  always so well instructed in the incomings and outgoings of his grace? For a
                  rather cool friend you appear to take a pretty deal of interest in him!"
               Edgely replies with downcast eyes: "It is for your majesty's sake that I am
                  watchful; for, as your majesty has said, he does more harm to the cause I love—the
                  king I adore—than many of our enemies."
               Mollified by his assertions, James permits him to kiss his hand, replying, with a
                  smile: "We did but jest. How likes our consort her residence in gloomy St.
                  Cecilia?"
               "Not over well, your majesty; Madame is often troubled with the vapors. She would
                  willingly return, but for her aversion to several at court."
               "Truly, truly! my Lady Inverness for one," he pettishly replies, twisting the
                  rings on his fingers.
               Ringing a bell, the signal is answered by a page, who stands on the threshold,
                  bowing low.
               "Curlle, say to my Lord Inverness that we desire an audience."
               Resting his chin on his palm, James silently muses on an apparently vexatious and
                  perplexing subject; Valentin remaining quiet and motionless. Inverness entering
                  bends and kisses the royal hand, which ceremony being completed, James says:
                  "Inverness, we need your aid in a matter nearly concerning our beloved court.
                  Doubtless you have heard ere this of his grace of Wharton's doings before
                  Gibraltar? Those actions reflect on us very severely. Having formerly looked
                  kindly on him, therefore we have resolved to send—"
               A tap at the door interrupting him, Valentin opens it, and Curlle enters with a
                  letter for James. Examining the seal, he exclaims: "By my soul, it is from the
                  madcap himself!"
               Valentin, starting forward, turns red and pale alternately.
               Inverness mutters: "Speak of the deil!—" Opening the letter James reads in low,
                  almost undistinguishable tones: "Your majesty—um—um—regret my culpable behavior in
                  leaving Rome so suddenly and disrespectfully—um—not knowing whether your majesty
                  approves my recent actions in the trenches—um—I write to crave permission to
                  return to Rome—um—um—sun myself—your majesty's favor—um—your loving, devoted—"
               Frowning impatiently he throws the letter down, exclaiming: "Inverness, bring me
                  paper and a quill! The malapert asks our approval of his conduct; he shall have
                  it, with a moral affixed, pardieu!"
               A smile of gratified malice passes like a flash over Valentin's face.
               Dipping into the inkstand with a vicious jerk, James splashes the drops about in
                  close proximity to Inverness' peach-colored hose, murmuring as he writes the
                  following reply:—
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "SIR: We blame you severely for your ill-considered conduct in taking
                              up foreign arms against our kingdom. As our court is at present full
                              to overflowing, we do advise you most strenuously not to come hither,
                              but rather return to England, condone your numerous offences, and act
                              a part more useful to us and yourself.
                           
                              JAMES REX."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
               "But that it were high presumption in me, I would gladly sign my name under your
                  majesty's."
               "We know that, Inverness. You were always our true friend and adviser." Valentin,
                  lifting his eyebrows, smiles incredulously. James continues: "This must to Wharton
                  at once, or he may forestall our refusal of his company by coming upon us
                  unawares."
               Inverness, laughing low, expresses his appreciation of the jest by divers nods and
                  chuckles.
               Sealing the letter, James hands it to Valentin, enjoining him to use the greatest
                  despatch in its delivery; he replies: "Under favor, your majesty, none could use
                  greater."
               Giving his arm to Inverness, James replies: "Ay! we know your loyalty, Sir
                  Edgely."
               Bowing low, Valentin leaves to execute his commission; while James and Inverness
                  retire to the queen's chamber, where a number of ladies and gentlemen are engaged
                  in playing ombre or conversing.
               
               In a large room at Madrid are Philip and Nora; he is alternately writing and
                  reading. Leaning back in his chair, he says: "Attention, Nora! 'To his excellency
                  Mr. Walpole'—I will give only portions of the letter, those most interesting—'Sir:
                  You will doubtless be surprised to receive a letter from me.——Since his present
                  majesty's accession to the throne, I have absolutely refused to be concerned with
                  the Pretender or any of his affairs; and during my stay here I have behaved myself
                  in a manner that Dr. Peters, Mr. Godolphin, and Mr. Mills can declare to be
                  consistent with my duty to the present king. I was forced to come here to get out
                  of Rome, where, if my true design had been known, I would have been treated a
                  little severely.——If your excellency would permit me to wait upon you for an hour,
                  I am certain you would be convinced of my repentance for my former madness.'"
                  Stopping here, he laughs long and loudly, while Nora appears perturbed and
                  displeased. "Egad, how he will stare! ah-ha! But to proceed: 'If you would become
                  an advocate with his majesty to grant me his most gracious pardon'——ahem! 'I do
                  not intend, in case of the king's allowing me to pass the evening of my days under
                  his royal protection, to see England for some years, but shall remain in France or
                  Germany, as my friends shall advise, and enjoy country sports and pastimes' (his
                  lips curve in a smile) 'till all former stories are buried in oblivion. I beg of
                  your excellency to let me receive your orders at Paris. The duchess, who is with
                  me, desires leave to wait on Mrs. Walpole, if you think proper.'"
               Nora exclaims indignantly: "Why, Philip, you seem very desirous of lowering your
                  dignity, in addressing this Mr. Walpole so servilely, begging so humbly the favor
                  of being allowed to see him. He may be an ambassador, but you are the Duke of
                  Wharton and North-umberland, and should be above truckling to any man alive!"
               "Or woman either, Nora; put a bridle on your tongue and let me alone. I have been
                  too long in this world, querida mia, not to know
                  how to talk to ambassadors, or kings either, for that matter."
               She is silent. Walking up and down the room for a few minutes, he resumes in a
                  decisive manner: "Nora, you must be ready to set out for Paris the day after
                  to-morrow. I will give the letter time enough to reach Walpole, and then for plans
                  to upset the Captain King!"
               "And assist the English whigs!" Nora adds.
               "An entire mistake. It is our mutual party which shall reap the advantages of my
                  sojourn in Paris, as you will see. James declines my company at court, therefore I must work for him in exile.
                  His letter was vastly curt and impolite! The Jesuits declare that the end
                  justifies the means; on that axiom I base my conduct."
               "Debase it sometimes, I fear, Philip."
               Unheeding her remark, Philip inquires abstractedly: "How stands our exchequer,
                  Nora?"
               "Low, much lower than you probably think."
               Shrugging his shoulders, he replies: "Low enough, no doubt! I have not received my
                  usual remittance from London."
               "That is not the chief cause of its depletion, Philip dear; it is because you
                  spend your money so foolishly, buy everything you see, give to every one who asks,
                  and squander it at the gaming table!"
               "Hoity-toity, a lecture on economy from her Grace of Wharton! Pray proceed; I am
                  all attention!"
               Half smiling at his mock attentive attitude, she turns away and looks out of the
                  window, while he surveys his person in the mirror.
            
            
               CHAPTER LVI.
               
                  
                     
                        "Saw mischief by a faction brewing."
                     
                     SWIFT.
                  
               
               ALTHOUGH an inventory of their possessions disclosed the fact that all their
                  present effects were about two hundred pounds, their clothes, and jewelry,
                  Philip's high ambition could not descend to trivial economies. Accordingly, he has
                  engaged the most fashionable and expensive rooms in all Paris, decorated them anew
                  with rich furniture, engaged a dozen or more valets, waiters, and runners, and
                  bought a superb coach. All this he has done on credit and the influence of his
                  representations. Nora, alarmed at his vast expenditures, dismally wondered whence
                  would come the money to pay the bills when they were presented. His reply was a
                  careless laugh, and an assertion that "he had such an implicit reliance in
                  Providence, he did not trouble himself at all about the future, but obeyed the
                  precepts of the Bible, in trusting in the Omniscient not to fail him in the hour
                  of need."
               Walpole's reply has been received, being now the subject of their conversation.
                  Turning to Nora with a surprised look, Philip replies in answer to her previous
                  question: "Certainly, our visit shall be in a public capacity. Why not? have you
                  any great objections, Nora?"
               "Well, you know our expenses are very great, and with no expectation of a
                  remittance for some time, it would be as well to retrench a little. We have very
                  little left to draw upon, while the bills for the coach, horses, and the furniture
                  will pour in before long."
               "Never mind, Nora, we must not meet trouble half way! Ah! there is the coach! Come
                  along!" Leading her to the door, they both enter, and roll off in the direction of
                  the ambassador's house.
               Mr. Walpole, awaiting them in the hall, courteously leads the way to the
                  drawing-room, where they seat themselves, partaking of a slight luncheon furnished
                  by their attentive host. During the repast, Philip is guilty of many loose
                  witticisms and licentious puns, often causing Nora to blush to her temples. The
                  conversation is general and unimportant, until Philip carelessly inquires:—
               "Your excellency, is Atterbury in town?"
               "He is, your grace; unfortunately, his society is debarred us. You are aware that
                  all communication with him is forbidden and felonious?"
               
               Philip nods assent, and the conversation again becomes more general. Nora is cold
                  and distant, appearing to prefer her own thoughts to Walpole's honeyed speeches
                  and flattering words. Philip, noticing this, says: "Well, we must be going; are
                  you ready, Nora?"
               She replies in a relieved manner: "Yes, your grace, and have been for some
                  time."
               This pithy rejoinder causes Walpole to frown, while a piqued expression, clouds
                  his face.
               As they are entering the coach, Philip calls out: "Oh, Walpole, I am going to dine
                  with the Bishop of Rochester now. What think you of my plan? Does he keep a good
                  table?"
               Smiling at such an odd, bold declaration, Walpole replies: "If your grace has a
                  design to pay that prelate a visit, there is no occasion to tell me of it."
               "By the way, I forgot to tell you how I enjoyed myself at Rome, also of my
                  conversion to Catholicism, two subjects in which you would have been interested;
                  however, they will be food for conversation at our next meeting; good-bye!"
                  Kissing his hand to the astonished Walpole, he slams the carriage door, and cries:
                  "To the Bishop of Rochester's house!"
               Atterbury is both pleased and startled on seeing his unexpected guests, but withal
                  pained at Philip's levity and profaneness, so ill suited to his own sober gravity
                  and advanced age. With Nora, Atterbury is well pleased, greatly admiring her
                  beauty and vivacity, which compare curiously enough with her previous sullenness
                  at Walpole's. Although delighted with their affection and devotion, the Bishop
                  gently blames them for incurring the government penalties by holding any
                  communication with him, for in this land of strangers, the aged, worn-out prelate
                  is debarred from seeing a friend or a relative, even his loved daughter dare not
                  come to him to receive his caresses or to soothe him in his sickness and
                  loneliness.
               As they are driving homewards after the interview is over, Philip says in a
                  settled manner: "Nora, I have just come to the conclusion that Paris is too
                  expensive for us, Rouen will suit us better, especially as I see no chance of a
                  remittance from home, and our creditors will not be always satisfied with smiles
                  and promises."
               Lifting her hands in dismay, Nora replies: "Leave Paris! impossible. We have made
                  every arrangement for a permanent residence here; rented the apartments, hired
                  servants and footmen, bought carriage and horses, and I know not what besides; the
                  idea is absurd." Adding, with a smile: "But of course you did not mean it, for our
                  creditors would not allow us to leave unless they were paid."
               He replies: "Nora, those people are sufficiently well paid by our patronage; you
                  appear to forget who we are."
               She rejoins: "Pardon me! not at all; but even the Duke of Wharton will find that
                  Parisian tradesmen are not well-bred enough to be satisfied with patronage instead
                  of payment. I know them too well to believe in their forbearance."
               Philip says with a frown and a pettish jerk at his ruffles: "Repique me! I care
                  little about their politeness or charity. I am not considering them at all. They
                  must look out for themselves and we will do the same. Economy is our aim at
                  present."
               She sighs at his obstinacy, and is about to answer him, when he adds: "Nora—your
                  grace, no more remonstrances, I beg! I have said Rouen is to be our future
                  home—Rouen it shall be until our circumstances guarantee a residence in Paris.
                  Your grace has become strangely whimsical and fantastical of late. Let me hope you
                  will be a trifle more rational and collected in your actions in future," looking askance at him, she
                  laughs amusedly, and settles herself in the corner with a shrug of her shoulders
                  and a mocking gesture at his stolid gravity.
            
            
               CHAPTER LVII.
               
                  
                     
                        "He marks the dawn of every virtuous aim,
                        And fans the smoking flax into a flame."
                     
                  
               
               STROLLING about Rouen accompanied by Nora, Philip observes a number of ragged,
                  filthy vagrants who attack every passer-by for alms in the most piteous manner.
                  Toward this motley crew he proceeds, leaving Nora to await his return. After
                  satisfying their clamorous demands, he exclaims in a loud voice: "Brother
                  vagabonds, I am the Duke of Wharton." A piece of information eliciting uproarious
                  applause. He continues: "I want every one of you to call at my lodgings this
                  evening at 8 o'clock, having prepared a supper for the poor of Rouen."
               Giving his address to them, he returns to Nora amid renewed applause and cheering.
                  She asks: "Philip, what is the meaning of all the clamor? I truly believe you have
                  given those wretches half of all our little stock, much more than we can afford at
                  any rate. However worthy the objects of your charity, recollect that charity
                  begins at home!"
               He rejoins with a significant laugh: "Faith, it shall begin at home, Nora!"
               At this moment Nora directs his attention to a most ludicrous sight. In the street
                  stands a gay, fashionable coach, with open door, as though its occupant had just
                  alighted; while about twenty yards away are two gentlemen men in most peculiar
                  attitudes. One is tall and thin, but quick and graceful in his movements. Holding
                  his drawn sword in front of him, he pricks his comrade behind with its sharp
                  point; meanwhile his face is a study for its gravity and immobility. The assailed,
                  who is attired in white silk stockings, peach-colored coat and small clothes, is
                  capering about as though hot mercury were dancing in his heels, as well he may;
                  with his tormentor prodding at him so viciously behind.
               Nora cannot help but laugh at the spectacle. The street being wet and muddy, every
                  step he takes he splashes his whole person with the thick ooze. Philip gives free
                  vent to his noisy merriment, finally calling out "A Wharton, a Wharton to the
                  rescue!" Turning around at this exclamation, they are both surprised to see the
                  long, sallow face of the Earl of Peterborough. This diversion giving his victim
                  time to escape, he flies down the street like one mad, while the earl advances to
                  Philip and cordially salutes him, saying: "My dear Wharton, how ever have you
                  managed to be here?"
               "By the same means as yourself, I suppose, Mordanto, but—" He laughs again. "What
                  was the meaning of your one-sided fight?"
               Peterborough replies: "Really, I scarcely know myself! Happening to look out of
                  the window, I saw yonder galliard picking his way over the stones in a vastly
                  lackadaisical manner, as though he feared for his spotless stockings; so I sprang
                  out and was teaching him a few capers with my Toledo when you interrupted me."
               "He did not seem to relish the lesson overmuch."
               "Faith, no; it did seem distasteful to him."
               Introducing the earl to Nora, Philip requests him to go along with them; but he
                  declines, excusing himself on the score of important business admitting of no delay. Philip inquires: "What business
                  can you have requiring such immediate attention, Mordanto?"
               "Quills and paper, for the construction of the memoirs which will to a certainty
                  convulse Europe to its centre."
               "Memoirs of the Duke of Wharton, for instance!"
               "Charles Mordaunt rather!" adds Nora, with a smile.
               Philip replies: "Join them; then not only Europe will be convulsed, but all the
                  world, even to that abode of Pluto—Terra del Fuego."
               "Yours alone would be sufficient," replies Peterborough as he sheaths his sword
                  with a sharp click, adding: "Good-bye!" He raises his hat and re-enters his
                  coach.
               Punctually at eight o'clock arrived the invited beggars, who were met by Philip
                  and ushered into the dining-room, where Nora awaited the arrival of the
                  "distinguished guests" who she had been led to expect were coming. The scene that
                  followed baffles description. Nora rushed from the room in angry haste, while
                  Philip laughed aloud at her discomfiture, inviting his dirty, ragged guests to
                  partake of the delicacies spread on the table. He plied them with wine until their
                  senses were inflamed and riotous. Oaths and slang, horrible tales and anecdotes,
                  the jingling of broken goblets and cracked dishes, combined to make a sickening
                  tumult; while Philip presided at the head—a worthy Mecænas of the rabble herd. The
                  only apology I can offer for Philip's freak is that "Il a
                     le diable au corps."
               On awakening, Philip finds himself under the table amid bottles, glasses, fruits,
                  preserves, and a mixture of everything that had previously been part of the
                  repast. Rising unsteadily from his recumbent position, he retires to his room in a
                  very disagreeable humor, intending to sleep off the effects of the night's
                  debauch; an intention frustrated, however, by the entry of the maid with a letter
                  for him, signed "immediate" on the cover. He opens it with a pettish air. Its
                  contents fill him with apprehension and alarm, at the same time opening his eyes
                  to the enormity of his offences against the laws of his country. The document is a
                  succinct report of proceedings in Parliament, concerning both his life and
                  property; no more nor less than a motion, strongly sustained, to outlaw him and
                  confiscate all his possessions—to place him on the same footing as the Bishop of
                  Rochester. At the bottom of the letter is written in a hurried, scrawling hand:
                  "See your errors immediately on receipt of this—sue for pardon; it is
                  your only chance."
               Bewildered by this ominous intelligence, he calls for Nora. As she enters he hands
                  the letter to her. After reading it, she says contemptuously: "Tut! the work of
                  some lying Hanoverian, who wishes to frighten you into submission to the usurper.
                  Let me tear it up." Suiting her actions to her words, she tosses the pieces into
                  the fire.
               After a short silence, Philip says: "I believe you are right, Nora; I hope so, at
                  all events."
               "Certainly, I am right! If such a measure had even been contemplated at home, you
                  would have heard of it long before it could be broached in the house. Undoubtedly,
                  it is a Whig scheme to induce you to turn renegade and help their schemes with
                  your pen and tongue."
               A tap at the door, and the maid re-enters—"Please, your grace, two gentlemen await
                  your grace in the parlor, Monsieur Thurton and M. le Baron Norfolke."
               Turning pale, he exclaims: "Que diable! what can these countrymen of mine want
                  with me?" Quickly arranging his disordered garments, he walks down stairs and
                  enters the room. "Good-morrow, gentlemen," he says pleasantly, and apologizes for
                  keeping them waiting.
               
               Returning his compliments, the elder of the two presents him a letter of
                  introduction from Sir Robert Walpole. Tearing it open he peruses it for a moment,
                  then exclaims haughtily: "Advice! Gentlemen, Mr. Walpole speaks of advice!"
               Baron Norfolke replies: "Yes, your grace, advice anent recent acts in Parliament
                  derogatory to your dignity, and prejudicial to your interests."
               Philip, starting, says: "Ah! pray tell me all about it; this is indeed news!" and
                  he draws a chair close to Norfolke, who proceeds in an apologetic, conciliating
                  manner: "Your grace must not take it ill if our words are sometimes rather coarse,
                  for the subject we are about to discuss is a delicate one, requiring plain
                  speaking and truthful words. You may or may not be aware that your enemies—nay,
                  even some of your friends—have, on account of your grace's recent actions at
                  Gibraltar and Rome, sustained a motion that you be outlawed, and a price set on
                  your head, besides the confiscation of all your property and revenues; but Mr.
                  Walpole, who has a real love for your grace, prevented the awarding of the
                  exigeant, and has sent us hither to induce you to submit yourself to the
                  government, and return home with a full pardon and forgiveness for all your acts.
                  A pardon you can obtain by merely writing a letter to his majesty or the ministry,
                  with a respectful apology for your past conduct, and a promise of more loyal
                  behavior in the future. Your grace can thus, without other trouble, re-establish
                  yourself in favor, and also have your estates, revenues, and an enormous income
                  free of debts or mortgages."
               Looking at the speaker with an expression of sarcastic hauteur, Philip rejoins:
                  "So! by merely turning traitor to his most Catholic majesty, and humbling myself
                  before all the world, I can have my own, as well as incur cur the favor of your
                  avaricious master George, eh? Listen to me, gentlemen! You are but the useful
                  tools of Mr. Walpole; otherwise you should both answer for the insult you have
                  passed upon me. Take this message back with you, and tell it as plainly as you
                  have delivered your instructions to me. I'll see George and his whole ministry in
                  perdition before I'll write a word to either, except a cartel to any man who
                  chooses to want one!"
               Mr. Thurton and the baron flinch under this rough language. The former,
                  half-rising from his chair, places his hand on his sword; wisely screening his
                  movement, however, Norfolke forces him back unobserved by Philip, replying in an
                  injured manner: "Your grace, we deeply regret your anger, and are sorry you look
                  on us with such ill-will. If you will even allow your secretary or valet to write
                  an explanation, we doubt not that all can be right again."*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *Fact.
               
               Half-rising, Philip replies: "Baron, if a pardon was presented to me, I might take
                  it; but I'll never beg for one, either personally or by proxy."
               Nora, entering at this moment, the envoys rise
                  and bow to her, Philip, turning his head at the same time, discerns the expression
                  of triumph beaming on her face, and he shifts uneasily in his seat. Looking
                  spitefully at Thurton and Norfolke she whispers: "Be firm, Philip darling. King
                  James must and shall reward you for the test you are undergoing! Let it be said
                  that you stood where others fell. Be firm!"
               He nods his head, while Norfolke continues, in a tone of mortification and
                  astonishment: "Are we to understand that your grace's decision is fixed and
                  final?—that you will not accept his majesty's most unprecedented kindness?"
               
               "My decision is final, gentlemen."
               Opening his doublet, Mr. Thurton pulls forth a sealed packet, and hands it to the
                  baron, who delivers it to Philip, saying: "Then, your grace, we have a very
                  painful duty to perform. We will wait until you have seen the contents of this
                  packet; then our sad errand will be over, and we must return to England with
                  heavier hearts than we intended!"
               Opening the crackling folds with nervous fingers, Philip eagerly peruses the
                  letter, while Nora bends over his shoulder with a pale face and glittering eyes.
                  His eyes grow dim and his head throbs as he reads:—
               
                  "YOUR GRACE: We, the trustees of your estates, are tied up from remitting you
                     any more money on account of your annuity, by the indictment lately found
                     against your grace. We do therefore most strenuously advise you to use your
                     best endeavors to have the proceedings stopped."
               
               Turning his head to Nora, he says ruefully: "A fine prospect ahead, Nora! No
                  remittances, edict of outlawry, and entire sequestration!"
               She replies, in an eager voice: "His majesty will provide for us, Philip."
               He laughs as he says: "Faith, if he does not, I shall have to take to scribbling
                  for bread, and you to teaching for butter."
               Turning to the gentlemen, who have been watching him very closely, he says,
                  pointing to the letter: "Well, this does not interest me so vastly! Have you
                  anything more to say on this disagreeable topic? If not, I must bid you
                  good-morning, gentlemen. The duchess wishes me to take her to the cathedral; she
                  is a great admirer of its peculiar architecture—the EARLY pointed. While there, we
                  also intend to see the spot where the head of Cœur de Leon lies buried."
               Dismissed with a gesture, the disappointed envoys retire from the room.
               Nora kisses Philip again and again, meanwhile praising him for his heroism and
                  loyalty. Responding to her caresses, his hand accidentally touches a locket
                  fastened to her neck. Taking hold of it, he exclaims laughingly: "Whose portrait,
                  Nora—an old beau's or your own sweet face?"
               A slight flush dyes her cheeks as she carelessly answers: "Yes, it is a former
                  lover—now my husband. I had it painted by an Italian artist while we were at Rome.
                  He painted it from memory. It is not very good; however, it suits my purpose."
               Pressing the clasp, she shows him his averred semblance. At first he casts a
                  careless glance at it; then scans it more closely, muttering: "Curse me! 'tis a
                  better portrait of Edgely Valentin than of me! Who painted it, did you say, Nora?"
                  he abruptly inquires, while looking keenly at her.
               Half turning her face, she replies: "Really, Philip, I forget his name."
               "How long did it take him to paint it?"
               "How vastly inquisitive you are, Philip! I forget the precise minute, or you
                  should know with pleasure."
               "If this was painted during the short time we resided in Rome, it should be placed
                  among the wonders of the world; it is extremely delicate and highly finished; he
                  must be a very giant in his art."
               Not vouchsafing any answer, he returns it to her, and begins to consult with
                  himself on the future, wearily wondering whether James will prove a friend in the
                  hour of need.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER LVIII.
               
                  
                     
                        "And what may be the consequences of a neglect of such opportunities? The
                           succession of the crown has but a dark prospect, another Dutch turn may
                           make the hopes of it ridiculous."
                     
                     DEFOE.
                  
               
               AFTER the occurrence described in the preceding chapter, Philip had applied to
                  James for assistance and been refused, since when he has been wandering hither and
                  thither in search of money, borrowing from all his friends, and victimizing easy,
                  credulous shopkeepers with boasts and promises.
               Nora is living at St. Germains, where a kind relative provides her with food and
                  clothing. Hither has Philip just arrived from Paris, almost broken down with
                  nervous debility and sickness, penniless and almost hopeless.
               Entering Nora's room, he embraces her affectionately, and, after inquiring the
                  state of her health, borrows what money she possesses at present, and turns his
                  attention to her several companions; a bevy of laughing, vivacious court dames,
                  who receive his attentive regards with demure gravity or easy freedom, according
                  as they are inclined. In the middle of the ensuing conversation, while merriment
                  or jocund wit pervade every word or look, Philip exclaims abruptly:
                  "Nora—mesdemoiselles—I am going to enter the convent! I have suddenly discovered
                  that life is a void, a nonentity, and—"
               Peals of laughter drown his words, while all are amused beyond measure at his
                  antithetical words. However ever, keeping a calm countenance until quiet is
                  restored, he resumes, in a steady voice:—
               "I am in earnest, as you will see. Life is only for the gay, the wealthy, the
                  happy. I am miserable, poverty-stricken, and afflicted. I feel that my years are
                  few and numbered; and it would be far better if those few years were dedicated to
                  my Maker, than to the trifles which have heretofore depraved and demoralized me."
                  Slowly rising, he leaves the room without another word, while his companions
                  wonder whether he is drunk or crazy.
               Walking down the stairs with measured step, he opens the door, and stands
                  irresolutely on the stone steps. Raising his hands he exclaims in a passionate
                  voice: "Holy Mary, look down on me! Blot out my whole life, with its schemes and
                  villanies! They are ever before my eyes, ever festering in my breast!" He pauses
                  to cast a glance about him, while his hands are tightly clenched and trembling.
                  "What a life it has been! scarce a commandment I have not broken from the first to
                  the last. Would the remnant of my years passed in prayer and meditation be a fit
                  condonation? I fear not! Mother of Christ, have pity on me!"
               Sinking on his knees with a stifled sob, he covers his face with his hands, while
                  he murmurs a broken prayer to the God he has so often offended. In a short time he
                  rises and walks toward the Convent de Notre Dame. Arriving at his destination, he
                  sounds the heavy knocker, and requests admittance. "I am Philip Wharton."
               Silently ushering him in, the brother signs him to wait, while he informs the
                  father superior of the arrival. The superior is a tall, bony man, whose pale,
                  ascetic face tells how faithfully he practises the penances and severities of one
                  of the most celebrated monkish orders.
               With lowered face and beating heart, Philip awaits his welcome. The superior
                  enunciates in clear, stern words, that
                  have no ring of kindliness or encouragement in them: "My son, what seekest
                  thou?"
               "Most holy father, I would leave the world and retire into a seclusion where I
                  could direct my thoughts, my life solely to Him."
               "It is well. Knowest thou the rules of our order?" Drawing a roll of parchment
                  from his bosom, he pushes it into his hands.
               Opening it with nervous fingers, Philip casts a glance at its contents. To a man
                  of his sybaritic temperament and luxurious disposition, the maxims and rules are
                  terrible. Returning them after a careful perusal, he says, in a humble voice:
                  "Father, I have read them, and am willing to submit to everything, if you will
                  accept me!"
               "Follow me!" replies the monk.
               Obeying the laconic order, he finally enters a small, stone cell, dimly illumined
                  by a tiny taper, which throws a yellow light on an ebony crucifix and a
                  vellum-covered missal.
               The cold, damp air strikes through his feverish frame, and he shudders in spite of
                  himself, which his companion noticing, he exclaims: "Go, Philip Wharton; you are
                  not fit for our society; the world and its fascinations hold you in their toils."
                  He does not reply, for he feels the keen, cold eyes of his leader riveted on his
                  face. The father resumes in a kindlier manner: "My son, your resolutions are as
                  water, you are a sybarite. A Spartan or a stoic alone could stand our discipline.
                  I know you, Philip Wharton; and believe a man who has seen the world and knows its
                  pleasures—you could never reconcile yourself to our lot."
               Philip answers in a desponding manner: "I fear not; my heart already fails
                  me—forgive me for trespassing on your time!"
               "My son, pursue a better course in the outside world, and God will reward you. All
                  are not capable of giving their whole being to religion and seclusion."
               Hastily retracing his steps, Philip again breathes the fresh, sweet air of the
                  open sky, slowly purpling under the rising sun.
               "S'faith, a narrow escape!" he exclaims with a half sigh.
               Suddenly an arm is thrust into his, and Peterborough's familiar voice sounds
                  cheerily on his ear: "Halloo, Wharton! propping the convent with your
                  peccadilloes?"
               "No, Mordanto; I was nearer razing it with a conversion of my precious self."
               "Ah-ha-ha!" laughs the earl. "What a superb joke! I wonder what the Delamour would
                  say to it, eh?"
               Joining in the laugh, Philip inquires: "I understood you were at Lisbon; how is it
                  that you are here?"
               "I was at Lisbon; but, hearing that Saint Germains boasts a new beauty, I have
                  come to see her. Saint Jago, the Lisbonians fall conquered at the first attack,
                  and I am tired of such easy victories, so I have visited you to discover whether
                  this new star will not be cold enough to spur me up to real exertion."
               Philip sympathizingly replies: "Poor fellow, I hope so, from the bottom of my
                  heart."
               "Jesting aside, Wharton, I have some news for you."
               "News, eh? From my trustees, probably?"
               "No—from England generally, and London in particular. You are being wofully used
                  both by type and tongue. Every broadside in the kingdom vilifies you, while all
                  desiring promotion slander you and tell marvellous lies about you and your
                  doings."
               Twirling his moustaches, he replies: "My lord, can you mention a few names of
                  either public writers, private friends, or enemies who have done these things in
                  my behalf?"
               "That can I. In particular are the 'Evening Post' and 'London Journal,' vastly minute in their
                  comments on your past and present actions, and defile you with a venom that ought
                  to be let out of them with a few rapier thrusts."
               He says with a savage curse: "If ever I beg George for pardon, it shall be for the
                  pleasure of treating these backbiters to a Mohock 'sweat' and a sound
                  drubbing."
               "Well they deserve it. When I return, I shall make it a special point to hunt out
                  these cowardly defamers, and treat them as you would yourself. A few brawls would
                  be quite a Godsend to me."
               Philip answers in a thick voice: "Thank you, dear Mordanto, I know that my honor
                  is safe in your hands. When I am a little calmer, I intend to write a short fable
                  for English ears, which will, if properly appreciated, interest them
                  exceedingly."
               The earl resumes: "I have also received news from one at court, who is well versed
                  in back-stairs intrigues, that George is continually receiving anonymous letters
                  from abroad in regard to yourself, which, while deploring your sad
                     indiscretions, convey full information of your slightest actions to him,
                  inflaming his majesty's anger against you by subtle insinuations and crafty
                  remarks."
               Philip exclaims with a start: "Sainte Vierge! it seems I am an object of greater
                  interest at home than I thought for. S'blood! what more can they do to me than
                  they have done? Mordanto, I stand here an attainted, outlawed, beggared traitor,
                  according to their laws, while you are guilty of felony for speaking to me."
               Peterborough replies: "A fico for them; you are my dearest friend, and my whole
                  wealth is at your disposal."
               Philip's face assumes an amused expression as he says: "Then, Mordanto, I'll
                  borrow a hundred Louis d'or, if you have them on hand."
               "With pleasure; let us step into this gaping goldsmith's, who is just opening his
                  shutters. I shall be overjoyed to draw you a draft for two hundred; one hundred is
                  such a beggarly sum."
               Securing the draft in his bosom, Philip says: "I have still another favor to ask
                  of you. Will you prosecute all the editors who have vilified me, or defiled my
                  name?"
               Peterborough quickly answers: "'Tis as good as done, and if they escape from
                  justice by a legal quibble, I'll trounce 'em with the flat of my sword, up and
                  down Grub Street."
               "Thank you, Mordanto; I must leave you now; her grace will be uneasy at my long
                  absence."
               "Ay, and checkmate your monkish move by turning nun."
               "Little fear," replies Philip, as he turns his steps to the palace.
               Taking the opposite direction, the earl saunters down the street, humming "Which
                  way shall I gae me," occasionally striking the shutters of the still sleeping
                  bourgeoisie. Entering Nora's room, Philip awakes her with his tread, and she
                  sleepily exclaims: "How now, sir monk! back again?"
               "Yes, Nora; I abjure Notre Dame's hair shirts, iron beds, and damp cells, for a
                  time, at all events; although I sometimes feel as if—"
               "Do let me sleep, Philip, and cease your homilies; clear water cannot run from an
                  impure source."
               "But the diamond can trace its origin to the coal bed."
               "Tres bien," she replies with a yawn, and
                  apparently falls asleep.
               Drawing his chair to the table, he begins to scribble some figures on a piece of
                  paper, meanwhile muttering: "Mordanto 200 louis, Wharton 3 livres, amount in hand
                  200 louis, 3 livres, hum!—Voiture to Paris—nothing. Supper say 5 louis; fees say 20 louis. Debts in
                  Paris say 3000 louis. Debtor and creditor scarcely balance! Now for my
                  wardrobe—Egad, I am my own valet! one black velvet suit with point lace, one
                  shabby suit of Spanish regimentals, one blue satin with black facings, slightly
                  soiled. Ah, well, sic transit gloria!"
               Impatiently throwing down his quill, his lips contract as though he is under the
                  influence of strong emotion. The sun, slowly rising above the horizon, streams in
                  through the half-drawn curtains, and gives his haggard countenance a pale, waxen
                  tinge. Gazing at the rays piercing the room in dusty lines, he murmurs: "Ay, ye
                  are a trifle like the radii of my own life, lustrous enough, but your lustre
                  dimmed by the motes and dust in which ye choose to shine. All my life I have spent
                  in pursuing a myth, and like the rest of the genus
                     homo find it out just too late. What have I been? A patriot, a
                  Christian, a husband, an obedient son, anything that is creditable? No! Catiline,
                  Caligula, Bluff Hal, Villiers—all are synonymes for Phil. Wharton, the merriest
                  undone man in Europe as they choose to call me. If Tarpeia's Rock were—but
                  hold!—ere I cross the Styx, I would vastly like to know who my dear friend is who
                  kindly forwards my words and actions to King George. I would put another sin in my
                  chapter if I could find him out or her. 'Tis more like a woman than a man.
                  Anonymous letters smack of femininity; if it was a woman, I would—"
               "What, Philip?" breaks in with a strange effect, and Nora half turns her head.
               Casting a quick apprehensive glance at her, he replies: "Let her live as the worst
                  punishment I could devise. If she were a soulless, heartless brute, I would have
                  her attended to by Pierre Canif, the Parisian bravo, who can slice as many ribbons
                  off a pretty face as there are laws in England."
               She replies, with a shudder, "How brutal! you have been drinking more brandy,
                  Philip?"
               "'Tis my only solace."
               She says in a pleading voice: "What am I, Phil?"
               "You—part of the necessary appendage of a duke's household."
               Her eyes blaze and her cheeks grow fiery red at this wanton insult, and, covering
                  her face with her hands, she buries her head in the pillow. Apparently heedless of
                  her anger, he remains absorbed in thought for a time, then says abruptly: "Nora,
                  we must return to Paris to-morrow; I will order the voiture to be ready."
               "Have you any money?" she inquires, in a dubious manner.
               "Golconda's wealth, or rather 200 louis."
               "What will the voiture cost?"
               "Nothing; it is put at my service by a friend of mine at Paris, Mlle. Delam—but
                  the name is of no consequence."
               She replies: "I know whom you mean, Mlle. Delamour—quite a creditable friend!"
               "Scarcely, Nora, but she is a lovely woman, and the manner in which she insists on
                  loaning me any amount of money is vastly charming."
            
            
               CHAPTER LIX.
               
                  
                     "Coming events cast their shadows before."
                  
               
               IN the fourth story of a miserable house in the Rue Aubry-le-Boucher, Philip and
                  Nora gloomily survey the aspect of their affairs. Outside a chilling rain is
                  falling which splashes drearily on the window-sill and filters through the broken windows and the decaying
                  framework.
               Philip is dressed in a tawdry suit of Spanish regimentals, which is worn and
                  shabby, while his hat is pushed over his eyes. He taps his foot in a manner
                  denoting a ruffled temper, while Nora sits on a rickety, three-legged stool in a
                  state of weariness and lassitude; her eyes roam around the room, and she vacantly
                  notes the prominent absence of all comforts which their new quarters can
                  boast.
               Philip has not a sou left of the money he borrowed from Peterborough. He has sold
                  his black velvet suit, and also all of Nora's dresses, except the one she is
                  wearing, and their whole wardrobe now consists of one shirt; a periwig; a Spanish
                  veil, torn at the side; a pair of red silk brodequins; and several pairs of
                  tasselled kid gloves. Everything else has gone to pay for their board and lodging.
                  Philip breaks the silence by saying: "Nora, how are we to procure the next meal?
                  My rapier furnished the last. Shall I write to his majesty?"
               "No, Philip; you would only make him angry, and—"
               "S'blood, angry? Why, woman, what have I given up for his sake? A vast revenue and
                  the finest estate in England." Angrily rising, he walks about the room with hasty
                  steps.
               "I know it, Philip; and God will reward you for your loyalty, even if King James
                  cannot. He is very poor himself, or else I would at once advise you to request a
                  loan; but the cause needs every penny we can procure."
               "Umph! am I not part of the cause?"
               "You are, darling, and one of the best parts; for that reason you will bear this
                  trial; I will, and I am but a woman."
               After this, there is a dull silence, until Philip resumes more hopefully:
                     "Vive les lettres! I'll translate Télémaque,
                  and sell it for what it will bring!"
               She answers, rather doubtfully: "You have the ability, but I fear that such work
                  will be too dry and uninteresting for you to continue at it very long."
               "A great mistake, Nora. I will begin it at once, and it shall not be laid aside
                  until it is finished. I intend to write a tragedy on Mary, Queen of Scots, also,
                  ere long; Lady Montague once wrote me an epilogue which will suit it admirably; or
                  else I'll turn poet and indite an ode to Atterbury, the most saintly sinner I have
                  ever known. Quick! quill and ink! Topple your empty trunk upside down: 'twill do
                  for a table; then find my Télémaque and MSS., they are at the bottom of my holster
                  bags, yonder in the corner!"
               
               He did finish the first book of Télémaque; then gave it up in disgust. The tragedy
                  he almost completed, while the poem on Atterbury he did actually finish. The
                  latter was published in Paris, but its impiety and scurrility damned it at its
                  outset, and it brought him in no money. He became shy and morose, refused to see
                  any of his friends, and secluded himself entirely from the world.
               Nora was too proud to write to the queen for assistance, and her relatives, though
                  poor themselves, were forced to send her money to keep Philip and herself from
                  starving.
               Says Philip, after a long silence: "Nora, I am going to put an end to this state
                  of affairs. You must write to the queen at once, and ask her for a sufficient
                  remittance to enable you to get to Madrid! Once there, you will be well cared for.
                  I shall enter Notre Dame. The conviction becomes stronger in me, every day of my
                  life, that my hours are numbered; and it is sheer selfishness in me to doom you to this miserable life. I will
                  take no remonstrances."
               With an exclamation of affright, Nora runs toward him; but her design is foiled by
                  a masked ruffian who places his hand over her mouth, while threatening her with
                  his poniard. At the same instant, Philip is grasped from behind, and thrown
                  headlong to the floor, where he is gagged and bound hand and foot ere he has
                  recovered from the bewildering effects of his fall.
               Casting a glance at the two men kneeling beside him, he then looks towards Nora,
                  who is almost swooning. The two intruders guarding Philip are poorly attired, and
                  apparently belong to the class of common bravoes which infest the purlieus of
                  Paris. Nora's assailant is, however, richly attired in a velvet suit, slashed with
                  violet satin; he, like the rest, is masked from chin to forehead. Motioning to the
                  smaller of the two, he gives Nora into his charge, and steps toward Philip.
                  Kneeling down beside him, he draws a knife from his bosom, somewhat resembling
                  those used by the vine-growers in Oporto; the blade is about four inches long, and
                  slightly hooked. Passing it carefully over his palm, he says to Philip, in an
                  evidently disguised voice: "Your grace, a handsome face like yours needs little
                  adornment; but in my humble opinion the removal of its present covering would
                  benefit it mightily; in other words, I intend to use you in the same manner as you
                  would others. In so doing, moreover, I consider myself as acting in the light of
                  an instrument of divine justice."
               Twisting his fingers in Philip's hair, he lowers the knife with a firm, quick
                  motion, when Nora, freeing herself by a violent effort, cries in an imploring
                  voice:—
               "Edgely, spare him! it is too cruel. For my sake!" Abruptly ceasing, she clasps
                  her hands in mute entreaty, while Philip looks at her with a strange light burning
                  in his eyes.
               Dropping the knife, the leader quickly rises to his feet, and motions his
                  companions to follow him. They are gone in an instant, and their cautious tread
                  echoes softly down the stairs. Picking up the knife, Nora cuts the stout cords
                  pinioning Philip's arms, and removes the gag from his aching mouth. Springing
                  erect, he pushes her aside, and darts out of the door in pursuit of his
                  assailants.
               Running to the window, Nora sees him standing on the pavement, uncertain which
                  direction to take. Holding her head with both hands, she murmurs: "I knew his
                  voice. Poor fellow! His love must indeed be great when it can tempt him to such a
                  crime!—I cannot help it—my religion, my country, Alberoni, all—all."
               Leaning her head against the mouldy wall, she thinks with a shudder of the scene
                  just enacted.
               Entering with hasty footsteps and haggard face, Philip exclaims: "Nora, who were
                  those men? I swear I heard you call their leader by name—Edward, or Egerton, or
                  one similar in sound." Grasping her white arm, he sinks his fingers deep in the
                  soft flesh as he gazes at her.
               She replies, in an unsteady voice: "Philip, on my honor, I do not know them; they
                  must be robbers who came in for booty!"
               "You lie, woman! What do robbers want in a fourth story garret? Such men do not
                  gag one, then rant about vengeance and divine justice, threatening to peel one's
                  face à la Mohock! No, there is some underhand
                  work here which I shall find out ere long; and if you are implicated in it, I'll
                  do to you as my ancestor of old did to a faithless wife—strangle you with my own
                  hands."
               
               She becomes very white, and her lips move unsteadily, but her throat is too
                  parched and dry to speak.
               He resumes in a sneering, sarcastic manner: "Your grace is inclined to be
                  melo-dramatic on this occasion—a useless proceeding, I assure you!" Receiving no
                  answer, he proceeds: "Nora, I leave with you all my manuscripts; sell them or burn
                  them, as you choose; I am going at once to St. Germains; you shall never see me
                  again in this world. I could not bear to look upon you, with my present suspicions
                  of you; I might harm you." Forcing her to look him in the face, he says, in an
                  unsteady voice: "Nora, I think you loved me once. By that past love, I entreat you
                  to tell me truly whether you know aught concerning this cowardly attack."
               Her answer is low and indistinct. "No, Philip, I do not."
               "Thank God! I could not entirely believe you guilty of complicity in such an
                  affair. Nora, sweetheart, this day we part forever in this world. Kiss me just
                  once! Its fragrance shall never be sullied by another's lips."
               Placing her arms around his neck, in a half-unconscious manner, she presses her
                  lips on his.
               "Good-bye, Nora; on to Madrid, and God bless you! will send you enough money
                  to-morrow to keep you from starving, at all events. Good-bye!"
               Speechless and motionless, she mechanically counts his steps until they die away
                  in the distance. Catching a last glimpse of him as he passes up the narrow street,
                  she exclaims, with a sob, "Holy Mary, help me in this, my hour of need! Oh! I feel
                  like a vile, guilty thing, full of bad thoughts and evil intents."
               Laying her head on the wet sill, she lets her hands dabble in the cold rain water,
                  while bitter tears run down her hot cheeks, and her breath comes in sighs and
                  sobs.
            
            
               CHAPTER LX.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "The George and Garter dangling from that bed,
                           Where tawdry yellow strove with dirty red,
                           Great Villiers lies: alas! how changed from him,
                           That life of pleasure and that soul of whim!
                           Gallant and gay, in Claverdon's proud alcove,
                           The bower of wanton Shrewsbury and love;
                           Or, just as gay, at council in a ring
                           Of mimic'd statesmen and their merry king.
                           No wit to flatter left of all his store,
                           No fool to laugh at, which he valued more.
                           Then victor of his health, of fortune, friends,
                           And fame, this lord of useless thousands ends."
                        
                     
                     POPE.
                  
               
               TRUE to his word, Philip entered Notre Dame, and remained there for three months,
                  during which time he was a very miracle of piety and devotion, until, on one
                  unfortunate morning, he was severely reprimanded by the father superior. He
                  answered him with a blow which levelled him to the floor. After this occurrence he
                  stealthily left Saint Germains, and shipped for Bilboa, where his regiment lay
                  under orders, commanded by the Marquis de Castelars. There he was attacked by
                  paralysis, which prevented him from entering on the campaign intended to settle
                  Don Carlos in Italy. Thence he set out for the mountains of Catalonia to try what
                  effect its fresh scenes and mineral springs would have on his enfeebled
                  constitution.
               Nora travelled to Madrid, where she was kindly received by the queen, who
                  appointed her to an office of trust and responsibility.
               
               To our left is a stupendous structure built in the Gothic style, which seems
                  lonely and deserted. It is the Bernardine convent, whose brethren are world famous
                  for their piety, charity, and poverty.
               Standing on a neighboring crag, Philip surveys it with a feeling of intense
                  longing for its quiet shelter and sombre stillness. His heart beats with an
                  hitherto unknown emotion, while his soul thrills with an aching, devotional
                  pathos.
               He is weak and hopeless, sick in mind and body, and is only desirous of leaving a
                  world which has no longer any attractions for him. His former friends have all
                  forsaken him; while his name is coupled at home and abroad with obloquy and
                  sneering scorn.
               See! his arms contract with a spasmodic motion, while his face becomes blanched
                  and pallid! Falling with a heavy thud on the jagged rock, he cuts his forehead in
                  a piteous manner. Heaven help him! He is writhing in the tortures of epilepsy,
                  while none come to his relief to assuage his agony or to wet his burning lips.
               For two hours he lay there, while the sun was scorching his feverish body, until
                  the inmates of the convent, discovering the poor sufferer, sent three of the
                  brethren to carry him inside. As they lay him gently down on the hard beds
                  peculiar to their order, he opens his eyes, and looks around with a sad, weary
                  smile, while a great light is glowing in them.
               The clustering monks are hooded and cowled, while the superior is addressing the
                  dying man. "Stranger, death is fast overtaking thee; art thou a believer in the
                  true faith?"
               Philip nods assent.
               "Thou shalt be shrived by one of our brethren." Turning to the nearest monk, he
                  says, in calm, measured accents: "François, I leave the stranger in thy care; thou
                  knowest thy duty."
               Motioning to the rest, the superior leads them out, François alone remaining with
                  Philip.
               Philip speaks in a slow, faltering voice: "Holy father, I am dying! I pray you,
                  shrive me quickly, I have many sins loading me down!" Closing his eyes, he
                  clenches his teeth to prevent a cry from bursting from him.
               Brother François's actions are rather peculiar. Closing the door in a noiseless
                  manner, he slides the bolt fast in its socket; then carefully secures the small
                  grated casement over the narrow window. Throwing off his cowl, he advances to the
                  side of the bed, and exclaims, in a low voice, in which triumph and malignity seem
                  struggling for supremacy: "At last! curse you, Philip Wharton!"
               Quickly rising to an upright position, Philip exclaims: "Edgely Valentin!"
               "Or Sir Edgely Warely, whichever you like. Listen to me! You have about an hour
                  more to live. That is time enough for me to tell you the story which I swore by my
                  mother's death-bed I would ring in your ears in your dying moments."
               Falling heavily back on the pillow, Philp closes his eyes to hide Valentin's
                  glittering scrutiny from his gaze.
               "In a little country village in England there once lived a pure, lovely girl, who
                  was loved and respected by all who knew her. She was still in her teens when a
                  ruffling gallant from London chanced to stop at this same village; he saw her;
                  suffice it to say that his handsome face and oily tongue were her ruin. He took
                  her to London with him, plunged her into a wild course of rioting and debauchery;
                  then threw her on the mercy of tender London to earn her bread as best she
                  could.
               
               "There was but one road open to her; she took it. A little babe was born to her;
                  this babe—a boy—she sent to her old home, with a piteous entreaty to her father to
                  forgive her and support the child. He did so willingly, and also desired her to
                  return; but she could not face him nor brook the shame of becoming the cynosure of
                  the village gossips.
               "On arriving at a proper age, this lad was sent to France as a soldier. There he
                  acquired, through industry, cunning, and perseverance—family traits—a responsible
                  position under Cardinal Alberoni; travelled over the whole of Europe on secret
                  embassies. But lest you die ere I have finished, I'll shorten my recital."
               A low groan issues from Philip's lips.
               "Finding out the secret of his mother's shame, he vowed to have revenge upon her
                  destroyer. Unfortunately he died to soon. However, he left a son to inherit his
                  greatness. This son, the bastard swore, should reap the consequences of his
                  father's acts.
               "The girl whom he had ruined survived him but a short time; then, by her bedside,
                  the bastard again swore that his religion, his country, and his love should all be
                  subservient to one great end—the ruin and early death of his son.
               "Well, he has kept his word. The destroyer's son is now an attainted, beggared,
                  dying outcast! His wife is the creature of his illegitimate brother, who for years
                  has poisoned the ears of King James and King George against him, has proved him a
                  traitor to all parties, and made all distrust and despise him.
               "Poverty and disease coming hand in hand, he travels to Catalonia, falls dying
                  near the convent, and is carried into the hall by the monks, where the bastard
                  brother is appointed to shrive him. Ah-ha!" Adding, in slow, sneering accents: "Do
                  you recognize the story?"
               "Spare me!" moans Philip.
               Drawing a locket from his bosom, Valentin tosses it towards him. Philip recognizes
                  his father, and he places it to his lips.
               Valentin says, with a laugh: "Kiss it, brother mine; my mother did so once; then
                  she would cry for hours after." His face grows harder and sterner, while his
                  fingers contract, and his breast rises ominously.
               Philip feebly extends his trembling hand to Valentin, who looks at it for an
                  instant, then smites it with his open palm with such force as to leave a deep red
                  mark on the white skin.
               "What do I want with your hand? I entered this monkery, when you came to
                  Catalonia, knowing that you would come to the springs every day; therefore I could
                  see you and observe your gradual decay, intending, when you became very sick, to
                  haul you in here by main force, and swear that you were a madman who had attempted
                  your own life. You would have been here at least three days, and if you had not
                  died within that time, I purposed to ease you of life myself. However, fate has
                  given me even a sweeter revenge than I counted upon. Can you guess what it is?" He
                  inquires, bending over his victim, until his hot breath fans his cheeks.
               Suddenly catching him by the throat, Philip half chokes him, but he is too weak
                  for such an adversary, for Valentin, placing his knee on his breast, soon
                  overpowers him.
               "So, your noble grace would choke me! I shall be more merciful, I will remain with
                  you until you die; and you shall neither receive the last rites of the church, nor
                  shall you pray; but you shall go to your Maker with a curse upon your lips."
               
               The smile of a dying man crosses Philip's face, while Valentin pursues, in clear,
                  distinct accents: "Brother, your wife did know about the attack made
                  on you in Paris. It was her paramour who headed the gang. Your grace, I am that
                  paramour!"
               Opening his glazing eyes, Philip exclaims, in a passionate voice: "Devil! leave
                  me! You have had your revenge; let me die in peace!"
               "'Twas I who sent George those kindly accounts of your loyal conduct. It was I who
                  attempted to poison your first wife's mind with tales to inflame her jealousy and
                  rouse her anger against you to assist me in my project! But it was you who killed
                  her—a remembrance which may tend to render you calmer. It was you who sent your
                  parents to their graves, heart-broken and tearful! Now die! as great a libertine,
                  liar, and villain as the earth ever held!"
               Philip begins to utter a Pater Noster, which Valentin perceiving, he lays his hand
                  on his mouth, and prevents him from speaking.
               Opening his eyes with one reproachful glance, he falls back dead!
               Replacing the locket in his bosom, Valentin exclaims, with a low chuckle, "Now for
                  Nora, Alberoni, and the Stuarts—my mistress, my tool, and my love!"
               So ends "The scorn and wonder of our age."
            
            FINIS.
