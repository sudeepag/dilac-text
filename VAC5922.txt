               THE Festivities at Dodworth Hall will be commenced by the pianist, a gentleman who
                  used to board in the same street with Gottschalk. The man who kept the
                  boarding-house remembers it distinctly. The overture will consist of a medley of
                  airs, including the touching new ballads—"Dear Sister, is there any Pie in the
                  house?" "My gentle Father, have you any Fine Cut about you?" "Mother, is the
                  Battle o'er—and is it safe for me to come home from Canada?" And (by request of
                  several families who haven't heard it) "Tramp, tramp, tramp, the Boys are
                  Marching." While the enraptured ear drinks in the sweet music (we pay our pianist
                  nine dollars a week, and "find him') the eye will be enchained by the magnificent
                  green baize covering of the panorama. This green baize cost 40 cents a yard at Mr.
                  Stewart's store. It was bought in deference to the present popularity of "The
                  Wearing of the Green." We shall keep up to the times if we spend the last dollar
                  our friends have got.
            
         
         
            INTRODUCTION.
            T. W. ROBERTSON.
            FEW tasks are more difficult or delicate than to write on the subject of the works or
               character of a departed friend. The pen falters as the familiar face looks out of the
               paper. The mind is diverted from the thought of death as the memory recalls some
               happy epigram. It seems so strange that the hand that traced the jokes should be
               cold, that the tongue that trolled out the good things should be silent—that the
               jokes and the good things should remain, and the man who made them should be gone for
               ever.
            The works of Charles Farrer Browne—who was known to the world as "Artemus Ward"—have
               run through so many editions, have met with such universal popularity, and have been
               so widely criticised, that it is needless to mention them here. So many biographies
               have been, written of the gentleman who
               wrote in the character of the 'cute Yankee Showman, that it is unnecessary that I
               should touch upon his life, belongings, or adventures. Of "Artemus Ward" I know just
               as much as the rest of the world. I prefer, therefore, to speak of Charles Farrer
               Browne, as I knew him, and, in doing so, I can promise those friends who also knew
               him and esteemed him, that as I consider no "public" man so public, that some portion
               of his work, pleasures, occupations, and habits may not be considered private I shall
               only mention how kind and noble-minded was the man of whom I write, without dragging
               forward special and particular acts in proof of my words, as if the goodness of his
               mind and character needed the certificate of facts.
            I first saw Charles Browne at a literary club; he had only been a few hours in
               London, and he seemed highly pleased and excited at finding himself in the old city
               to which his thoughts had so often wandered. Browne was an intensely sympathetic man.
               His brain and feelings were as a "lens," and he received impressions immediately. No
               man could see him without liking him at once. His manner was straightforward and
               genial, and had in it the dignity of a gentleman, tempered, as it were, by the fun of
               the humorist. When you heard him talk you wanted to make much of him, not because he
               was "Artemus Ward," but because he was himself, for no one less resembled "Artemus
               Ward" than his author and creator, Charles Farrer Browne. But a few weeks ago it was
               remarked to me that authors were a disappointing race to know, and I agreed with the
               remark, and I remember a lady once said to me that the personal appearance of poets
               seldom "came up" to their works. To this I replied that, after all, poets were but
               men, and that it was as unreasonable to expect that the late Sir Walter Scott could
               at all resemble a Gathering of the Clans as that the late Lord Macaulay should appear
               anything like the Committal of the Seven Bishops to the Tower. I told the lady that
               she was unfair to eminent men if she hoped that celebrated engineers would look like
               tubular bridges, or that Sir Edwin Landseer would remind her of a "Midsummer
                  Night's Dream." I mention this because,
               of all men in the world, my friend Charles Browne was the least like a showman of any
               man I ever encountered. I can remember the odd half-disappointed look of some of the
               visitors to the Egyptian Hall when "Artemus" stepped upon the platform. At first they
               thought that he was a gentleman who appeared to apologise for the absence of the
               showman. They had pictured to themselves a coarse old man with a damp eye and a
               puckered mouth, one eyebrow elevated an inch above the other to express shrewdness
               and knowledge of the world—a man clad in velveteen and braid, with a heavy
               watch-chain, large rings, and horny hands, the touter to a wax-work show, with a
               hoarse voice, and over familiar manner. The slim gentlemen in evening dress, polished
               manners, and gentle voice, with the tone of good breeding that hovered between
               deference and jocosity; the owner of those thin—those much too thin—white hands could
               not be the man who spelt joke with a "g." Folks who came to laugh, began to fear that
               they should remain to be instructed, until the gentlemanly disappointer began to
               speak, then they recovered their real "Artemus," Betsey Jane, wax-figgers, and all.
               Will patriotic Americans forgive me if I say that Charles Browne loved England
               dearly? He had been in London but a few days when he paid a visit to the Tower. He
               knew English history better than most Englishmen; and the Tower of London was to him
               the history of England embalmed in stone and mortar. No man had more reverence in his
               nature; and at the Tower he saw that what he had read was real. There
                  were the beef-eaters; there had been Queen Elizabeth and
               Sir Walter Raleigh, and Lady Jane Grey, and Shakspere's murdered princes, and their
               brave, cruel uncle. There was the block and the axe, and the armour and the jewels.
               "St. George for merrie England!" had been shouted in the Holy Land, and men of the
               same blood as himself had been led against the infidel by men of the same brain and
               muscle as George Washington. Robin Hood was a reality, and not a schoolboy's myth
               like Ali Baba and Valentine and Orson.
            There were two sets of feelings in Charles Browne at the Tower. He could appreciate the sublimity of history,
               but, as the "Show" part of the exhibition was described to him, the humorist, the
               wit, and the iconoclast from the other side of the Atlantic must have smiled at the
               "descriptions." The "Tower" was a "show," like his own—Artemus Ward's. A price was
               paid for admission, and the "figgers" were "orated." Real jewellery is very like sham
               jewellery after all, and the "Artemus" vein in Charles Browne's mental
               constitution—the vein of humour, whose source was a strong contempt of all things
               false, mean, shabby, pretentious, and only external—of bunkum and Barnumisation—must
               have seen a gigantic speculation realising ship loads of dollars if the Tower could
               have been taken over to the States, and exhibited from town to town—the Star and
               Stripes flying over it—with a four-horse lecture to describe the barbarity of the
               ancient British Barons and the cuss of chivalry.
            Artemus Ward's Lecture on the Mormons at the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, was a great
               success. His humour was so entirely fresh, new, and unconventional, it took his
               hearers by surprise, and charmed them. His failing health compelled him to abandon
               the lecture after about eight or ten weeks. Indeed, during that brief period he was
               once or twice compelled to dismiss his audience. I have myself seen him sink into a
               chair and nearly faint after the exertion of dressing. He exhibited the greatest
               anxiety to be at his post at the appointed time, and scrupulously exerted himself to
               the utmost to entertain his auditors. It was not because he was sick that the public
               was to be disappointed, or that their enjoyment was to be diminished. During the last
               few weeks of his lecture-giving, he steadily abstained from accepting any of the
               numerous invitations be received. Had he lived through the following London
               fashionable season, there is little doubt that the room at the Egyptian Hall would
               have been thronged nightly. Our aristocracy have a fine delicate sense of humour, and
               the success, artistic and pecuniary, of "Artemus Ward" would have rivalled that of
               the famous "Lord Dundreary." There were many stupid people who did not understand the
               "fun" of Artemus
                Ward's books. In their vernacular "they
               didn't see it." There were many stupid people who did not understand the fun of
               Artemus Ward's lecture on the Mormons. They could not see it. Highly
               respectable people—the pride of their parish, when they heard of a lecture "upon the
               Mormons"—expected to see a solemn person, full of old saws and new statistics, who
               would denounce the sin of polygamy—and bray against polygamists with four-and-twenty
               boiling-water Baptist power of denunciation. These uncomfortable Christians do not
               like humour. They dread it as a certain personage is said to dread holy water, and
               for the same reason that thieves fear policemen—it finds them out. When these good
               idiots heard Artemus offer, if they did not like the lecture in Piccadilly, to give
               them free tickets for the same lecture in California, when he next visited that
               country, they turned to each other indignantly, and said "What use are tickets for
               California to us? We are not going to California. No! we are too
               good—too respectable to go so far from home. The man is a fool!" One of these
               ornaments of the vestry complained to the door keepers, and denounced the lecture as
               an imposition—"and," said the wealthy parishioner, "as for the panorama, it's the
               worst painted thing I ever saw in all my life!"
            But the Entertainment, original, humorous, and racy though it was, was drawing to a
               close! In the fight between youth and death, death was to conquer. By medical advice
               Charles Browne went for a short time to Jersey—but the breezes of Jersey were
               powerless. He wrote to London to his nearest and dearest friends—the members of a
               literary club of which he was a member—to complain that his "loneliness weighed on
               him." He was brought back, but could not sustain the journey farther than
               Southampton. There the members of the beforementioned club travelled from London to
               see him—two at a time—that he might be less lonely—and for the unwearying solicitude
               of his friend and agent, Mr. Hingston, and to the kindly sympathy of the United
               States Consul at Southampton, Charles Browne's best and nearest friends had cause to
               be grateful. I cannot close these lines without mention of "Artemus Ward's" last joke. He had read in the newspapers that
               a wealthy American had offered to present the Prince of Wales with a splendid yacht,
               American built.
            "It seems," said the invalid "a fashion now-a-days for everybody to present the
               Prince of Wales with something. I think I shall leave him—my
               Panorama!"
            Charles Browne died beloved and regretted by all who knew him, and by many who had
               known him but a few weeks; and when he drew his last breath there passed away the
               spirit of a true gentleman.

            ARTEMUS WARD AS A LECTURER.
            PREFATORY NOTE
            EDWARD P. HINGSTON.
            IN Cleveland, Ohio, the pleasant city beside the lakes, Artemus Ward first determined
               to become a public lecturer. He and I rambled through Cleveland together after his
               return from California. He called on some old friends at the Herald
               office, then went over to the Weddel House, and afterwards strolled across to the
               offices of the Plaindealer, where, in his position as sub-editor he
               had written many of his earlier essays. Artemus inquired for Mr. Gray, the editor,
               who chanced to be absent. Looking round at the vacant desks and ink-stained
               furniture, Artemus was silent for a minute or two, and then burst into one of those
               peculiar chuckling fits of laughter in which he would occasionally indulge; not a
               loud laugh, but a shaking of the whole body
               with an impulse of merriment which set every muscle in motion. "Here"—said he—"here's
               where they called me a fool." The remembrance of their so calling him seemed to
               afford him intense amusement.
            From the office of the Cleveland Plaindealer we continued our tour of
               the town. Presently we found ourselves in front of Perry's statue, the monument
               erected to commemorate the naval engagement on Lake Erie, wherein the Americans came
               off victorious. Artemus looked up to the statue, laid his finger to the side of his
               nose, and in his quaint manner remarked, "I wonder whether they called him 'a fool'
               too, when he went to fight?"
            The remark, following close as it did upon his laughing fit in the newspaper office,
               caused me to inquire why he had been called "a fool," and who had called him so.
            "It was the opinion of my friends on the paper," he replied; "I told them that I was
               going in for lecturing. They laughed at me and called me 'a fool.' Don't you think
               they were right?"
            Then we sauntered up Euclid Street, under the shade of its avenue of trees. As we
               went along, Artemus Ward recounted to me the story of his becoming a lecturer. Our
               conversation on that agreeable evening is fresh in my remembrance. Memory still
               listens to the voice of my companion in the stroll, still sees the green trees of
               Euclid Street casting their shadows across our path, and still joins in the laugh
               with Artemus, who, having just returned from California, where he had taken 1600
               dollars at one lecture, did not think that to be evidence of his having lost his
               senses.
            The substance of that which Artemus Ward then told me, was that while writing for the
                  Cleveland Plaindealer he was accustomed, in the discharge of his
               duties as a reporter, to attend the performances of the various minstrel troupes and
               circuses which visited the neighbourhood. At one of these he would hear some story of
               his own, written a month or two previously, given by the "middle-man" of the minstrels and received with hilarity by the
               audience. At another place he would be entertained by listening to jokes of his own
               invention, coarsely retailed by the clown of the ring and shouted at by the public as
               capital waggery on the part of the performer. His own good things from the lips of
               another "came back to him with alienated majesty" as Emerson expresses it. Then the
               thought would steal over him—why should that man gain a living with my witticisms,
               and I not use them in the same way myself? why not be the utterer of my own coinage,
               the quoter of my own jests, the mouth-piece of my own merry conceits? Certainly it
               was not a very exalted ambition, to aim at the glories of a circus-clown or the
               triumphs of a minstrel with a blackened face. But, in the United States a somewhat
               different view is taken of that which is fitting and seemly for a man to do, compared
               with the estimate we form in this country. In a land where the theory of caste is not
               admitted, the relative respectability of the various profession is not quite the same
               as it with us. There the profession does not disqualify if the man himself be right,
               nor the claim to the title of gentleman depend upon the avocation followed. I know of
               one or two clowns in the ring who are educated physicians, and not thought to be any
               the less gentleman because they propound conundrums and perpetrate jests instead of
               prescribing pills and potions.
            Artemus Ward was always very self-reliant; when once he believed himself to be in the
               right it was almost impossible to persuade him to the contrary. But, at the same time
               he was cautious in the extreme, and would well consider his position before deciding
               that which was right or wrong for him to do. The idea of becoming a public man having
               taken possession of his mind, the next point to decide was in what form he should
               appear before the public. That of a humorous lecturer seemed to him to be the best.
               It was unoccupied ground. America had produced entertainers who by means of facial
               changes or eccentricities of costume had contrived to amuse their audiences, but
               there was no one who ventured to joke for an hour before a house full of people with
               no aid from scenery or dress. The experiment
               was one which Artemus resolved to try. Accordingly, he set himself to work to collect
               all his best quips and cranks, to invent what new drolleries he could, and to
               remember all the good things that he had heard or met with. These he noted down and
               strung together almost without relevancy or connection. The manuscript chanced to
               fall into the hands of the people at the office of the newspaper on which he was then
               employed, and the question was put to him of what use he was going to make of the
               strange jumble of jest which he had thus compiled. His answer was that he was about
               to turn lecturer, and that before them were the materials of his lecture. It was then
               that his friends laughed at him, and characterised him as "a fool."
            "They had some right to think so," said Artemus to me as we rambled up Euclid Street.
               "I half thought that I was one myself. I don't look like a lecturer—do I?"
            He was always fond, poor fellow, of joking on the subject of his personal appearance.
               His spare figure and tall stature, his prominent nose and his light-coloured hair
               were each made the subject of a joke at one time or another in the course of his
               lecturing career. If he laughed largely at the foibles of others, he was equally
               disposed to laugh at any shortcomings he could detect in himself. If anything at all
               in his outward form was to him a source of vanity, it was the delicate formation of
               his hands. White, soft, long, slender, and really handsome, they were more like the
               hands of a high-born lady than those of a western editor. He attended to them with
               careful pride, and never alluded to them as a subject for his jokes, until, in his
               last illness they had become unnaturally fair, translucent, and attenuated. Then it
               was that a friend calling upon him at his apartments in Piccadilly, endeavoured to
               cheer him at a time of great mental depression, and pleasantly reminded him of a ride
               they had long ago projected through the south-western states of the Union. "We must
               do that ride yet, Artemus. Short stages at first, and longer ones as we go on." Poor
               Artemus lifted up his pale, slender hands, and letting the light shine through them,
               said jocosely, "Do you think these would do
               to hold a rein with? Why, the horse would laugh at them."
            Having collected a sufficient number of quaint thoughts, whimsical fancies, bizarre
               notions, and ludicrous anecdotes, the difficulty which then, according to his own
               confession, occurred to Artemus Ward was, what should be the title of his lecture.
               The subject was no difficulty at all, for the simple reason that there was not to be
               any. The idea of instructing or informing his audience never once entered into his
               plans. His intention was merely to amuse; if possible keep the house in continuous
               laughter for an hour and-a-half, or rather an hour and twenty minutes, for that was
               the precise time, in his belief, which people could sit to listen and to laugh
               without becoming bored; and, if possible, send his audience home well pleased with
               the lecturer and with themselves, without their having any clear idea of that which
               they had been listening to, and not one jot the wiser than when they came. No one
               better understood than Artemus the wants of a miscellaneous audience who paid their
               dollar or half-dollar each to be amused. No one could gauge better than he the
               capacity of the crowd to feed on pure fun, and no one could discriminate more clearly
               than he the fitness, temper, and mental appetite of the constituents of his evening
               assemblies. The prosiness of an ordinary Mechanics' Institute lecture was to him
               simply abhorrent, the learned platitudes of a professed lecturer were to him, to use
               one of his own phrases, "worse than poison." To make people laugh was to be his
               primary endeavour. If in so making them laugh he could also cause them to see through
               a sham, be ashamed of some silly national prejudice or suspicions of the value of
               some current piece of political bunkum, so much the better. He believed in laughter
               as thoroughly wholesome, he had the firmest conviction that fun is healthy, and
               sportiveness the truest sign of sanity. Like Talleyrand, he was of opinion that,
                  "Qui vit sans folie n'est pas si sage qu'il
                  croit."
            Artemus Ward's first lecture was entitled "The Babes in the Wood." I asked him why he
               chose that title, because there was nothing
               whatever in the lecture relevant to the subject of the child-book legend. He replied,
               "It seemed to sound the best. I once thought of calling the lecture 'My Seven
               Grandmothers.' Don't you think that would have been good?" It would at any rate have
               been just as pertinent. Incongruity as an element of fun was always an idea uppermost
               in the mind of the western humorist. I am not aware that the notes of any of his
               lectures, except those of his Mormon experience, have been preserved, and I have some
               doubts if any one of his lectures, except the Mormon one, was ever fairly written
               out. "The Babes in the Wood" as a lecture was a pure and unmitigated "sell." It was
               merely joke after joke, and drollery succeeding to drollery, without any connecting
               thread whatever. It was an exhibition of fireworks, owing half its brilliancy and
               more than half its effect to the skill of the man who grouped the fireworks together
               and let them off. In the hands of any other pyrotechnist the squibs would have failed
               to light, the rockets would have refused to ascend, and the "nine-bangers" would have
               exploded but once or twice only, instead of nine times. The artist of the display
               being no more, and the fireworks themselves having gone out, it is perhaps not to be
               regretted that the cases of the squibs and the tubes of the rockets have not been
               carefully kept. Most of the good things introduced by Artemus Ward in his first
               lecture were afterwards incorporated by him in subsequent writings, or used over
               again in his later entertainment. Many of them had reference to the events of the
               day, the circumstances of the American War and the polities of the Great Rebellion.
               These of course have lost their interest with the passing away of the times which
               gave them birth. The points of many of the jokes have corroded, and the barbed head
               of many an arrow of Artemus's wit has rusted into bluntness with the decay of the bow
               from which it was propelled.
            If I remember rightly, the "Babes in the Wood" were never mentioned more than twice
               in the whole lecture. First, when the lecturer told his audience that the "Babes"
               were to constitute the subject of his discourse, and then digressed immediately to matters quite foreign to the
               story. Then again at the conclusion of the hour and twenty minutes of drollery, when
               he finished up in this way: "I now come to my subject—'The Babes in the Wood.'" Here
               he would take out his watch, look at it with affected surprise, put on an appearance
               of being greatly perplexed, and amidst roars of laughter from the people, very
               gravely continue, "But I find that I have exceeded my time, and will therefore merely
               remark that so far as I know they were very good babes—they were as good as ordinary
               babes. I really have not time to go into their history. You will find it all in the
               story-books. They died in the woods, listening to the woodpecker tapping the hollow
               beech-tree. It was a sad fate for them, and I pity them. So, I hope, do you. Good
               night!"
            Artemus gave his first lecture at Norwich in Connecticut, and travelled over a
               considerable portion of the Eastern States before he ventured to give a sample of his
               droll oratory in the Western Cities, wherein he had earned reputation as a
               journalist. Gradually his popularity became very great, and in place of letting
               himself out at so much per night to literary societies and athenæums, he constituted
               himself his own showman, engaging that indispensable adjunct to all showmen in the
               United States, an agent to go ahead, engage halls, arrange for the sale of tickets,
               and engineer the success of the show. Newspapers had carried his name to every
               village of the Union, and his writings had been largely quoted in every journal. It
               required, therefore, comparatively little advertising to announce his visit to any
               place in which he had to lecture. But it was necessary that he should have a bill or
               poster of some kind. The one he adopted was simple, quaint, striking, and well
               adapted to the purpose. It was merely one large sheet, with a black ground, and the
               letters cut out in the block, so as to print white. The reading was "ARTEMUS WARD
               WILL SPEAK A PIECE." To the American mind this was intensely funny from its childish
               absurdity. It is customary in the States for children to speak or recite "a piece" at
               school at the annual examination, and the phrase is used just in the same sense as in
               England we say "a Christmas piece." The
               professed subject of the lecture being that of a story familiar to children,
               harmonized well with the droll placard which announced its delivery. The place and
               time were notified on a slip pasted beneath. To emerge from the dull depths of lyceum
               committees and launch out as a showman-lecturer on his own responsibility was
               something both novel and bold for Artemus to do. In the majority of instances he or
               his agent met with speculators who were ready to engage him for so many lectures, and
               secure to the lecturer a certain fixed sum. But in his later transactions Artemus
               would have nothing to do with them, much preferring to undertake all the risk
               himself. The last speculator to whom he sold himself for a tour was, I believe, Mr.
               Wilder, of New York City, who realized a large profit by investing in lecturing
               stock, and who was always ready to engage a circus, a wild-beast show, or a lecturing
               celebrity.
            As a rule, Artemus Ward succeeded in pleasing every one in his audience, especially
               those who understood the character of the man and the drift of his lecture; but there
               were not wanting at any of his lectures a few obtuse-minded, slowly-perceptive,
               drowsy-headed dullards, who had not the remotest idea what the entertainer was
               talking about, nor why those around him indulged in laughter. Artemus was quick to
               detect these little spots upon the sunny face of his auditory. He would pick them
               out, address himself at times to them especially, and enjoy the bewilderment of his
               Bœotian patrons. Sometimes a stolid inhabitant of central New York, evidently of
               Dutch extraction, would regard him with an open stare expressive of a desire to enjoy
               that which was said if the point of the joke could by any possibility be indicated to
               him. At other times a demure Pennsylvania Quaker would benignly survey the poor
               lecturer with a look of benevolent pity, and, on one occasion, when my friend was
               lecturing at Peoria, an elderly lady, accompanied by her two daughters, left the room
               in the midst of the lecture, exclaiming, as she passed me at the door, "It is too bad
               of people to laugh at a poor young man who doesn't know what he is saying and ought
               to be sent to a lunatic asylum!"
            
            The newspaper reporters were invariably puzzled in attempting to give any correct
               idea of a lecture by Artemus Ward. No report could fairly convey an idea of the
               entertainment, and being fully aware of this, Artemus would instruct his agent to beg
               of the papers not to attempt giving any abstract of that which he said. The following
               is the way in which the reporter of the Golden Era, at San Francisco,
               California, endeavoured to inform the San Franciscan public of the character of "The
               Babes in the Wood" lecture. It is, as the reader will perceive, a burlesque on the
               way in which Artemus himself dealt with the topic he had chosen; while it also notes
               one or two of the salient features of my friend's style of lecturing:—
            
               
                  
                     
                        "HOW ARTEMUS WARD 'SPOKE A PIECE.'"
                        "Artemus has arrived. Artemus has spoken. Artemus has triumphed. Great is
                           Artemus!
                        "Great also is Platt's Hall. But Artemus is greater; for the hall proved
                           too small for his audience, and too circumscribed for the immensity of
                           his jokes. A man who has drank twenty bottles wine may be called 'full.'
                           A pint bottle with a quart of water in it would also be accounted full;
                           and so would an hotel be, every bed in it let three times over on the
                           same night to three different occupants, but none of these would be so
                           full as Platt's Hall was on Friday night to hear Artemus Ward 'speak a
                           piece.'
                        "The piece selected was 'The Babes in the Wood,' which reminds us that
                           Mr. Ward is a tall, slender-built, fair-complexioned, jovial-looking
                           gentleman of about twenty-seven years of age. He has a pleasant manner,
                           an agreeable style, and a clear, distinct, and powerful voice.
                        "'The Babes in the Wood' is a 'comic oration,' with a most comprehensive
                           grasp of subject. As spoken by its witty author, it elicited gusts of
                           laughter and whirlwinds of applause. Mr. Ward is no prosy lyceum
                           lecturer. His style is neither scientific, didactic, or philosophical. It
                           is simply that of a man who is brimful of mirth, wit and satire, and who
                           is compelled to let it flow forth. Maintaining a very grave countenance
                           himself, he plays upon the muscles of other people's faces as though they
                           were piano-strings and he the prince of pianists.
                        "The story of 'The Babes in the Wood' is interesting in the extreme. We
                           would say, en passant, however, that
                           Artemus Ward is a perfect steam factory of puns and a museum of American
                           humour. Humanity seems to him to be a vast mine, out of which he digs
                           tons of fun; and life a huge forest, in which he can cut down 'cords' of
                           comicality. Language with him is like the brass balls with which the
                           juggler amuses us at the circus—ever being tossed up, ever glittering, ever thrown
                           about at pleasure. We intended to report his lecture at full, but we
                           laughed till we split our lead pencil and our short-hand symbols were too
                           infused with merriment to remain steady on the paper. However, let us
                           proceed to give an idea of 'The Babes in the Wood.' In the first place it
                           is a comic oration; that is, it is spoken, is exuberant in fun,
                           felicitous in fancy, teeming with jokes, and sparkling as bright waters
                           on a sunny day. The 'Babes in the Wood' is—that is, it isn't a lecture or
                           an oratorical effort; it is something sui
                              generis; something reserved for our day and generation,
                           which it would never have done for our forefathers to have known, or they
                           would have been too mirthful to have attended to the business of
                           preparing the world for our coming; and something which will provoke so
                           much laughter in our time, that the echo of the laughs will reverberate
                           along the halls of futurity and seriously affect the nerves of future
                           generations.
                        "The 'Babes in the Wood' to describe it, is—Well, those who listened to
                           it know best. At any rate they will acknowledge with us that it was a
                           great success; and that Artemus Ward has a fortune before him in
                           California.
                        "And now to tell the story of 'The Babes in the Wood'—But we will not,
                           for the hall was not half large enough to accommodate those who came;
                           consequently Mr. Ward will tell it over again at the Metropolitan Theatre
                           next Tuesday evening. The subject will again be 'The Babes in the
                           Wood.'"
                     
                  
               
            
            Having travelled over the Union with "The Babes in the Wood" lecture, and left his
               audiences everywhere fully "in the wood" as regarded the subject announced in the
               title, Artemus Ward became desirous of going over the same ground again. There were
               not wanting dreary and timid prophets who told him that having "sold" his audiences
               once, he would not succeed in gaining large houses a second time. But the faith of
               Artemus in the unsuspecting nature of the public was very large, so with fearless
               intrepidity he conceived the happy thought of inventing a new title, but keeping to
               the same old lecture, interspersing it here and there with a few fresh jokes,
               incidental to new topics of the times. Just at this period General McClellan was
               advancing on Richmond, and the celebrated fight at Bull's Run had become matter of
               history. The forcible abolition of slavery had obtained a place among the debates of
               the day, Hinton Rowan Helper's book on "The Inevitable Crisis" had been sold at every
               bookstall, and the future of the negro had risen into the position of being the great
               point of discussion throughout the land. Artemus required a very slender thread to string his jokes upon, and what
               better one could be found than that which he chose? He advertised the title of his
               next lecture as "Sixty Minutes in Africa." I need scarcely say that he had never been
               in Africa, and in all probability had never read a book on African travel. He knew
               nothing about it, and that was the very reason he should choose Africa for his
               subject. I believe that he carried out the joke so far as to have a map made of the
               African continent, and that on a few occasions, but not on all, he had it suspended
               in the lecture-room. It was in Philadelphia and at the Musical Fund Hall in Locust
               Street that I first heard him deliver what he jocularly phrased to me as "My African
               Revelation." The hall was very thronged, the audience must have exceeded two thousand
               in number, and the evening was unusually warm. Artemus came on the rostrum with a
               roll of paper in his hands, and used it to play with throughout the lecture, just as
               recently at the Egyptian Hall, while lecturing on the Mormons, he invariably made use
               of a lady's riding-whip for the same purpose. He commenced his lecture thus, speaking
               very gravely and with long pauses between his sentences, allowing his audience to
               laugh if they pleased, but seeming to utterly disregard their laughter.
            "I have invited you to listen to a discourse upon Africa. Africa is my subject. It is
               a very large subject. It has the Atlantic Ocean on its left side, the Indian Ocean on
               its right, and more water than you could measure out at its smaller end. Africa
               produces blacks—ivory blacks—they get ivory. It also produces deserts, and that is
               the reason it is so much deserted by travellers. Africa is famed for its roses. It
               has the red rose, the white rose, and the neg-rose. Apropos of negroes, let me tell
               you a little story."
            Then he at once diverged from the subject of Africa to detail to
               his audience his amusing story of the Conversion of a negro, which
               he subsequently worked up into an article in the Savage Club Papers,
               and entitled "Converting the Nigger." Never once again in the course
               of the lecture did he refer to Africa, until the time having arrived for him to
               conclude, and the people being fairly worn out with laughter, he finished up by saying, "Africa, ladies and gentlemen,
               is my subject. You wish me to tell you something about Africa. Africa is on the
               map—it is on all the maps of Africa that I have ever seen. You may buy a good map for
               a dollar, and if you study it well, you will know more about Africa than I do. It is
               a comprehensive subject, too vast, I assume you, for me to enter upon to-night. You
               would not wish me to, I feel that—I feel it deeply, and I am very sensitive. If you
               go home and go to bed it will be better for you than to go with me to Africa."
            The joke about the "neg-rose" has since run the gauntlet of nearly all the minstrel
               bands throughout England and America. All the "bones," every "middle-man," and all
               "end-men" of the burnt-cork profession have used Artemus Ward as a mine wherein to
               dig for the ore which provokes laughter. He has been the "cause of wit in others,"
               and the bread-winner for many dozens of black-face songsters—"singists" as he used to
               term them. He was just as fond of visiting their entertainments as they were of
               appropriating his jokes; and among his best friends in New York were the brothers
               Messrs. Neil and Dan Bryant, who have made a fortune by what has been facetiously
               termed—"the burnt-cork-opera."
            It was in his "Sixty Minutes in Africa" lecture that Artemus Ward first introduced
               his celebrated satire on the negro, which he subsequently put into print. "The
               African," said he, "may be our brother. Several highly respectable gentlemen and some
               talented females tell me that he is, and for argument's sake I might be induced to
               grant it, though I don't believe it myself. But the African isn't our sister, and
               wife, and uncle. He isn't several of our brothers and first wife's relations. He
               isn't our grandfather and great grandfather, and our aunt in the country,
               Scarcely."
            It may easily be imagined how popular this joke became when it is remembered that it
               was first perpetrated at a time when the negro question was so much debated as to have become an absolute nuisance. Nothing
               else was talked of; nobody would talk of anything but the negro. The saying arose
               that all Americans had "nigger-on-the-brain." The topic had become nauseous,
               especially to the Democratic party; and Artemus always had more friends among them
               than among the Republicans. If he had any politics at all he was certainly a
               Democrat.
            War had arisen, the South was closed, and the lecturing arena considerably lessened.
               Artemus Ward determined to go to California. Before starting for that side of the
               American continent, he wished to appear in the city of New York. He engaged, through
               his friend Mr. De Walden, the large hall then known as Niblo's, in front of the
               Niblo's Garden Theatre, and now used, I believe, as the dining-room of the
               Metropolitan Hotel. At that period Pepper's Ghost chanced to be the great novelty of
               New York City, and Artemus Ward was casting about for a novel title to his old
               lecture. Whether he or Mr. De Walden selected that of "Artemus Ward's Struggle with a
               Ghost" I do not know; but I think that it was Mr. De Walden's choice. The title was
               seasonable and the lecture successful. Then came the tour to California, whither I
               proceeded in advance to warn the miners on the Yuba, the travellers on the Rio
               Sacramento, and the citizens of the Chrysopolis of the Pacific that "A. Ward" would
               be there shortly. In California the lecture was advertised under its old name of "The
               Babes in the Wood." Platt's Hall was selected for the scene of operation, and, so
               popular was the lecturer, that on the first night we took at the doors more than
               sixteen hundred dollars in gold. The crowd proved too great to take money in the
               ordinary manner, and hats were used for people to throw their dollars in. One hat
               broke through at the crown. I doubt if we ever knew to a dollar how many dollars it
               once contained.
            California was duly travelled over, and "The Babes in the Wood" listened to with
               laughter in its flourishing cities, its mining-camps among the mountains, and its
               "new placers" beside gold-bedded rivers. While journeying through that strangely-beautiful land, the serious
               question arose—What was to be done next? After California—where?
            Before leaving New York, it had been a favourite scheme of Artemus Ward not to return
               from California to the East by way of Panama, but to come home across the Plains, and
               to visit Salt Lake City by the way. The difficulty that now presented itself was,
               that winter was close upon us, and that it was no pleasant thing to cross the Sierra
               Nevada and scale the Rocky Mountains with the thermometer far below freezing point.
               Nor was poor Artemus even at that time a strong man. My advice was to return to
               Panama, visit the West India Islands, and come back to California in the spring,
               lecture again in San Francisco, and then go on to the land of the Mormons. Artemus
               doubted the feasibility of this plan, and the decision was ultimately arrived at to
               try the journey to Salt Lake. Unfortunately the winter turned out to be one of the
               severest. When we arrived at Salt Lake City, my poor friend was seized with typhoid
               fever, resulting from the fatigue we had undergone, the intense cold to which we had
               been subjected, and the excitement of being on a journey of 3,500 miles across the
               North American Continent, when the Pacific Railway had made little progress and the
               Indians were reported not to be very friendly.
            The story of the trip is told in Artemus Ward's lecture. I have added to it, at the
               special request of the publisher, a few explanatory notes, the purport of which is to
               render the reader acquainted with the characteristics of the lecturer's delivery. For
               the benefit of those who never had an opportunity of seeing Artemus Ward nor of
               hearing him lecture, I may be pardoned for attempting to describe the man,
               himself.
            In stature he was tall, in figure, slender. At any time during our acquaintance his
               height must have been disproportionate to his weight. Like his brother Cyrus, who
               died a few years before him, Charles F. Browne, our "Artemus Ward," had the premonitory signs of a short
               life strongly evident in his early manhood. There were the lank form, the long pale
               fingers, the very white pearly teeth, the thin, fine, soft hair, the undue brightness
               of the eyes, the excitable and even irritable disposition, the capricious appetite,
               and the alternately jubilant and despondent tone of mind which too frequently
               indicate that "the abhorred fury with the shears" is waiting too near at hand to
               "slit the thin-spun life." His hair was very light-coloured, and not naturally curly.
               He used to joke in his lecture about what it cost him to keep it curled; he wore a
               very large moustache without any beard or whiskers; his nose was exceedingly
               prominent, having an outline not unlike that of the late Sir Charles Napier. His
               forehead was large, with, to use the language of the phrenologists, the organs of the
               perceptive faculties far more developed than those of the imaginative powers. He had
               the manner and bearing of a naturally-born gentleman. Great was the disappointment of
               many who, having read his humorous papers descriptive of his exhibition of snakes and
               waxwork work, and who having also formed their ideas of him from the absurd pictures
               which had been attached to some editions of his works, found on meeting with him that
               there was no trace of the showman in his deportment, and little to call up to their
               mind the smart Yankee who had married "Betsy Jane." There was nothing to indicate
               that he had not lived a long time in Europe and acquired the polish which men gain by
               coming in contact with the society of European capitals. In his conversation there
               was no marked peculiarity of accent to identify him as an American, nor any of the
               braggadocio which some of his countrymen unadvisedly assume. His voice was soft,
               gentle, and clear. He could make himself audible in the largest lecture-rooms without
               effort. His style of lecturing was peculiar; so thoroughly sui generis, that I know of no one with whom to compare him, nor can
               any description very well convey an idea of that which it was like. However much he
               caused his audience to laugh, no smile appeared upon his own face. It was grave even
               to solemnity, while he was giving utterance to the most delicious absurdities. His
               assumption of indifference difference to
               that which he was saying, his happy manner of letting his best jokes fall from his
               lips as if unconscious of their being jokes at all, his thorough self-possession on
               the platform, and keen appreciation of that which suited his audience, and that which
               did not, rendered him well qualified for the task which he had undertaken—that of
               amusing the public with a humorous lecture. He understood and comprehended to a
               hair's breadth the grand secret of how not to bore. He had weighed, measured, and
               calculated to a nicety the number of laughs an audience could indulge in on one
               evening, without feeling that they were laughing just a little too much. Above all,
               he was no common man, and did not cause his audience to feel that they were laughing
               at that which they should feel ashamed of being amused with. He was intellectually up
               to the level of nine-tenths of those who listened to him, and in listening, they felt
               that it was no fool who were the cap and bells so excellently. It was amusing to
               notice how with different people his jokes produced a different effect. The
               Honourable Robert Lowe attended one evening at the Mormon Lecture, and laughed as
               hilariously as any one in the room. The next evening Mr. John Bright happened to be
               present. With the exception of one or two occasional smiles, he listened with grave
               attention.
            In placing the lecture before the public in print it is impossible by having recourse
               to any system of punctuation to indicate the pauses, jerky emphases, and odd
               inflexions of voice which characterized the delivery. The reporter of the
                  Standard newspaper describing his first lecture in London aptly
               said, "Artemus dropped his jokes faster than the meteors of last night succeeded each
               other in the sky. And there was this resemblance between the flashes of his humour
               and the flights of the meteors, that in each case one looked for jokes or meteors,
               but they always came just in the place that one least expected to find them. Half the
               enjoyment of the evening lay, to some of those present, in, listening to the hearty
               cachinnation of the people who only found out the jokes some two or three minutes
               after they were made, and who then laughed apparently at some grave statements of fact. Reduced to paper the showman's
               jokes are certainly not brilliant; almost their whole effect lies in their
                  seeming impromptu character. They are carefully led up to, of
               course, but they are uttered as if they are mere afterthoughts of which the speaker
               is hardly sure." Herein the writer in the Standard hits the most
               marked peculiarity of Artemus Ward's style of lecturing. His affectation of not
               knowing what he was uttering; his seeming fits of abstraction, and his grave
               melancholy aspect constituted the very cream of the entertainment. Occasionally he
               would amuse himself in an apparently meditative mood, by twirling his little
               riding-whip, or by gazing earnestly but with affected admiration at his panorama. At
               the Egyptian Hall his health entirely failed him, and he would occasionally have to
               use a seat during the course of the lecture. In the notes which follow I have tried,
               I know how inefficiently, to convey here and there an idea of how Artemus rendered
               his lecture amusing by gesture or action. I have also, at the request of the
               Publisher, made a few explanatory comments on the subject of our Mormon trip. In so
               doing I hope that I have not thrust myself too prominently forward nor been too
               officious in my explanations. My aim has been to add to the interest of the lecture
               with those who never heard it delivered, and to revive in the memory of those who did
               some of its notable peculiarities. The illustrations are from photographs of the
               panorama painted in America for Artemus, as the pictorial portion of his
               entertainment.
            In the lecture is the fun of the journey. For the hard facts the reader in quest of
               information is referred to a book published previously to the lecturer's appearance
               at the Egyptian Hall, the title of which is, "Artemus Ward: His Travels Among the
               Mormons." Much against the grain as it was for Artemus to be statistical, he has
               therein detailed some of the experiences of his Mormon trip, with due regard to the
               exactitude and accuracy of statement expected by information-seeking readers in a
               book of travels. He was not precisely the sort of traveller to write a paper for the
               evening meetings of the Royal Geographical
               Society, nor was he sufficiently interested in philosophical theories to speculate on
               the developments of Mormonism as illustrative of the history of religious belief. We
               were looking out of the window of the Salt Lake House one morning, when Brigham Young
               happened to pass down the opposite side of Main Street. It was cold weather, and the
               prophet was clothed in a thick cloak of some green-coloured material. I remarked to
               Artemus that Brigham had, seemingly, compounded Mormonism from portions of a dozen
               different creeds, and that in selecting green for the colour of his apparel he was
               imitating Mahomet. "Has it not struck you," I observed, "that Swedenborgianism and
               Mahometanism are oddly blended in the Mormon faith?"
            "Petticoatism and plunder," was Artemus's reply; and that comprehended his whole
               philosophy of Mormonism. As he remarked elsewhere: "Brigham Young is a man of great
               natural ability. If you ask me, How pious is he? I treat it as a conundrum, and give
               it up."
            To lecture in London, and at the Egyptian Hall, had long been a favourite idea of
               Artemus Ward. Some humorist has said that "All good Americans when they die——go to
               Paris." So do most, whether good or bad, while they are living.
            Still more strongly developed is the trans-atlantic desire to go to Rome. In the far
               west of the Missouri, in the remoter west of Colorado, and away in far north-western
               Oregon, I have heard many a tradesman express his intention to make dollars enough to
               enable him to visit Rome. In a land where all is so new, where they have had no past,
               where an old wall would be a sensation, and a tombstone of anybody's great
               grandfather the marvel of the whole region, the charms of the old world have an
               irresistible fascination. To visit the home of the Cæsars they have read of in their
               school books, and to look at architecture which they have seen pictorially, but have
               nothing like it in existence around them, is very naturally the strong wish of people
               who are nationally nomadic, and who have all
               more or less a smattering of education. Artemus Ward never expressed to me any very
               great wish to travel on the European continent, but to see London was to accomplish
               something which he had dreamed of from his boyhood. There runs from Marysville in
               California to Oroville in the same State a short and singular little railway, which,
               when we were there, was in a most unfinished condition. To Oroville we were going. We
               were too early for the train at the Marysville station, and sat down on a pile of
               timber to chat over future prospects.
            "What sort of a man was Albert Smith?" asked Artemus, "And do you think that the
               Mormons would be as good a subject for the Londoners as Mont Blane was?"
            I answered his questions. He reflected for a few moments, and then said,
            Well, old fellow, I'll tell you what I should like to do. I should like to go to
               London and give my lecture in the same place. Can it be done?"
            It was done. Not in the same room, but under the same roof and on the same floor; in
               that gloomy-looking Hall in Piccadilly, which was destined to be the ante-chamber to
               the tomb of both lecturers.
            Throughout this brief sketch I have written familiarly of the late Mr. Charles F.
               Browne as "Artemus Ward," or simply as "Artemus." I have done so advisedly, mainly
               because, during the whole course of our acquaintance, I do not remember addressing
               him as "Mr. Browne," or by his real Christian name. To me he was always
               "Artemus"—Artemus the kind, the gentle, the suave, the generous. One who was ever a
               friend in the fullest meaning of the word, and the best of companions in the amplest
               acceptance of the phrase. His merry laugh and pleasant conversation are as audible to
               me as if they were heard but yesterday; his words of kindness linger on the ear of
               memory, and his tones of genial mirth live
               in echoes which I shall listen to for evermore. Two years will soon have passed away
               since last he spoke, and— 
                  
                     "Silence now, enamoured of his voice
                     Locks its mute music in her rugged cell."

            ARTEMUS WARD'S first lecture in London was delivered at the Egyptian Hall,
               Piccadilly, on Tuesday, November 13, 1866. The room used was that which had been
               recently occupied by Mr. Arthur Sketchley. It is the lesser of the two rooms at the
               top of the staircase. Not the one in which Mr. Albert Smith formerly made his
               appearances. The attendance was very large, but the audience for the most part
               consisted of invited friends and the members of the press. The paying public having
               to wait for another opportunity, though they struggled in large numbers to obtain
               admission.
            Copies of Artemus Ward's very original programmes are given in the Appendix, together
               with the notice of the lecture which appeared in the Times two days
               after its delivery. The notice was written by Mr. John Oxenford.

            As at Artemus Ward's First Lecture in the Egyptian Hall, London, On Tuesday, November
               13, 1866.
            
               
            
            This was the appearance of the stage during the prologue of the lecture, before any
               portion of the panorama was exhibited. The lights in the room being then turned up,
               the wondrous gravity of the lecturer's face was fully visible at the time that he was
               uttering his best jokes. The picture was surrounded with a large gilt frame.

               THE LECTURE.
               ARTEMUS WARD.
               YOU are entirely welcome ladies and gentlemen to my little picture-shop.1
                  
               
               
                  
                  1"My little picture-shop."—I have already stated that the room
                     used was the lesser of the two on the first-floor of the Egyptian Hall. The
                     panorama was to the left on entering, and Artemus Ward stood at the
                     south-east corner facing the door. He had beside him a music-stand, on which
                     for the first few days he availed himself of the assistance afforded by a
                     sheet of foolscap on which all his "cues" were written out in a large hand.
                     The proscenium was covered with dark cloth, and the picture bounded by a
                     great gilt frame. On the rostrum behind the lecturer was a little door
                     giving admission to the space behind the picture where the piano was placed.
                     Through this door Artemus would disappear occasionally in the course of the
                     evening, either to instruct his pianist to play a few more bars of music, to
                     tell his assistants to roll the picture more quickly or more slowly, or to
                     give some instructions to the man who worked "the moon." The little
                     lecture-room was thronged nightly during the very few weeks of its being
                     open.
               
               I couldn't give you a very clear idea of the Mormons—and Utah—and the Plains—and
                  the Rocky Mountains—without opening a picture-shop——and therefore I open one.
               
               I don't expect to do great things here—but I have thought that if I could make
                  money enough to buy me a passage to New Zealand2
                     I should feel that I had not lived in vain.
               
                  
                  2"To New Zealand."—Artemus Ward seriously contemplated a visit
                     to Australia, after having made the tour of England. He was very much
                     interested in all Australian affairs, had a strong desire to see the lands
                     of the South, and looked forward to the long sea-voyage as one of the means
                     by which he should regain his lost health.
               
               I don't want to live in vain.——I'd rather live in Margate—or here. But I wish when
                  the Egyptians built this hall they had given it a little more ventilation.3
                  
               
               
                  
                  3"More ventilation."—The heat and closeness of the
                     densely-packed room was a cause of common complaint among the audience.
               
               If you should be dissatisfied with anything here to-night—I will admit you all
                  free in New Zealand—if you will come to me there for the orders. Any respectable
                  cannibal will tell you where I live. This shows that I have a forgiving
                  spirit.
               I really don't care for money. I only travel round to see the world and to exhibit
                  my clothes. These clothes I have on were a great success in America.4
                  
               
               
                  
                  4"These clothes, etc."—This was one of poor Artemus's jokes
                     which owed more of its success to its oddity than to its veracity. While
                     lecturing at the Egyptian Hall he wore a fashionably-cut dress coat in the
                     evening. It was what he had never done during his lecture-career in the
                     States, and he used privately to complain how uncomfortable he felt in it.
                     He assumed the most deplorable look when pointing out his costume to his
                     audience. His voice dropped into a moody reflective tone, and then suddenly
                     passed into a much higher key when he commenced to allude to "large
                     fortunes." He seemed to have shaken off the embarrassment of his fashionable
                     clothes, and to be glad to pass on to another subject. In the punctuation of
                     the succeeding paragraph of the lecture, I have endeavoured to convey an
                     idea of the long pause he made between some of his sentences.
               
               
               How often do large fortunes ruin young men! I should like to be ruined, but I can
                  get on very well as I am.
               I am not an Artist. I don't paint myself——though perhaps if I were a middle-aged
                  single lady I should——yet I have a passion for pictures.——I have had a great many
                  pictures—photographs—taken of myself. Some of them are very pretty—rather sweet to
                  look at for a short time—and as I said before I like them. I've always loved
                  pictures.
               I could draw on wood at a very tender age When a mere child I once drew a small
                  cartload of raw turnips over a wooden bridge.——The people of the village noticed
                  me. I drew their attention. They said I had a future before me. Up to that time I
                  had an idea it was behind me.
               Time passed on. It always does by the way. You may possibly have noticed that Time
                  passes on.——It is a kind of way Time has.
               I became a man. I haven't distinguished myself at all as an artist—but I have
                  always been more or less mixed up with Art. I have an uncle who takes
                  photographs—and I have a servant who——takes anything he can get his hands on.
               When I was in Rome——Rome in New York State I mean——a distinguished sculpist wanted
                  to sculp me. But I said "No." I saw through the designing man. My model once in his hands—he would have flooded the market
                  with my busts——and I couldn't stand it to see everybody going round with a bust of
                  me. Everybody would want one of course—and wherever I should go I should meet the
                  educated classes with my bust, taking it home to their families. This would be
                  more than my modesty could stand——and I should have to return to America——where my
                  creditors are.
               I like Art. I admire dramatic Art—although I failed as an actor.
               It was in my schoolboy days that I failed as an actor.5
                  ——The play was the "Ruins of Pompeii peii."——I played the Ruins. It was not
                  a very successful performance—but it was better than the "Burning Mountain." He
                  was not good. He was a bad Vesuvius.
               
                  
                  5"Failed as an actor."—Artemus made many attempts as an amateur
                     actor, but never to his own satisfaction. He was very fond of the society of
                     actors and actresses. Their weaknesses amused him as much as their talents
                     excited his admiration. One of his favourite sayings was that the world was
                     made up of "men, women, and the people on the stage."
               
               The remembrance often makes me ask—"Where are the boys of my youth?"——I assure you
                  this is not a conundrum.——Some are amongst you here——some in America——some are in
                  gaol.——
               Hence arises a most touching question—"Where are the girls of my youth?" Some are
                  married——some would like to be.
               Oh my Maria! Alas! she married another. They frequently do. I hope she is
                  happy—because I am.6
                     ——Some people are not happy. I have noticed that.
               
                  
                  6"Because I am!"—Spoken with a sigh. It was a joke which always
                     told. Artemus never failed to use it in his "Babes in the Wood" lecture, and
                     the "Sixty Minutes in Africa," as well as in the Mormon story.
               
               
               A gentleman friend of mine came to me one day with tears in his eyes. I said "Why
                  these weeps?" He said he had a mortgage on his farm—and wanted to borrow ¥200. I
                  lent him the money—and he went away. Some time after he returned with more tears.
                  He said he must leave me for ever. I ventured to remind him of the ¥200 he
                  borrowed. He was much cut up. I thought I would not be hard upon him—so told him I
                  would throw off one hundred pounds. He brightened—shook my hand—and said—"Old
                  friend—I won't allow you to outdo me in liberality——I'll throw off the other
                  hundred."
               As a manager I was always rather more successful than as an actor.
               Some years ago I engaged a celebrated Living American Skeleton for a tour through
                  Australia. He was the thinnest man I ever saw. He was a splendid skeleton. He
                  didn't weigh anything scarcely——and I said to myself—the people of Australia will
                  flock to see this tremendous curiosity. It is a long voyage—as you know—from New
                  York to Melbourne—and to my utter surprise the skeleton had no sooner got put to
                  sea than he commenced eating in the most horrible manner. He had never been on the
                  ocean before—and he said it agreed with him.——I thought so!——I never saw a man eat
                  so much in my life. Beef—mutton—pork——he swallowed them all like a shark——and
                  between meals he was often discovered behind barrels eating hard-boiled eggs. The
                  result was that when we reached Melbourne this infamous skeleton weighed 64 pounds
                  more than I did!
               I thought I was ruined——but I wasn't. I took him on to California——another very
                     long sea voyage——and when I got him to
                  San Francisco I exhibited him as a Fat Man.7
                  
               
               
                  
                  7"As a Fat Man."—The reader need scarcely be informed that this
                     narrative is about as real as "A. Ward's Snaiks," and about as much
                     matter-of-fact as his journey through the States with a wax-work show.
               
               This story hasn't anything to do with my Entertainment, I know——but one of the
                  principal features of my Entertainment is that it contains so many things that
                  don't have anything to do with it.
               My Orchestra is small——but I am sure it is very good—so far as it goes. I give my
                  pianist ten pounds a night—and his washing.8
                  
               
               
                  
                  8"My Pianist, &c." That a good pianist could be hired for a
                     small sum in England was a matter of amusement to Artemus. More especially
                     when he found a gentleman who was obliging enough to play anything he
                     desired, such as break-downs and airs which had the most absurd relation to
                     the scene they were used to illustrate. In the United States his pianist was
                     desirous of playing music of a superior order, much against the consent of
                     the lecturer.
               
               I like Music.—I can't sing. As a singist I am not a success. I am saddest when I
                  sing. So are those who hear me. They are sadder even than I am.
               The other night some silver-voiced young men came under my window and sang—"Come
                  where my love lies dreaming."——I didn't go. I didn't think it would be
                  correct.
               I found music very soothing when I lay ill with fever in Utah——and I was very
                  ill——I was fearfully wasted.——My face was hewn down to nothing—and my nose was so
                  sharp I didn't dare stick it into other people's business—for fear it would stay
                  there—and I should never get it again. And on those dismal days a Mormon lady——she
                  was married—tho' not so much so as her husband—he had fifteen other wives——she
                  used to sing a ballad commencing "Sweet bird—do not fly away!"——and I told her I
                     wouldn't.—— She played the accordion
                  divinely—accordionly I praised her.
               I met a man in Oregon who hadn't any teeth—not a tooth in his head——yet that man
                  could play on the bass drum better than any man I ever met.——He kept a hotel. They
                  have queer hotels in Oregon. I remember one where they gave me a bag of oats for a
                  pillow——I had night mares of course. In the morning the landlord said—How do you
                  feel—old hoss—hay?——I told him I felt my oats.
               
                  9
                  PERMIT me now to quietly state that altho' I am here with my cap and bells
                  I am also here with some serious descriptions of the Mormons—their manners—their
                  customs——and while the pictures I shall present to your notice are by no means
                  works of art—they are painted from photographs
                  
                     
                     9"Permit me now." Though the serious part of the lecture was
                        here entered upon, it was not delivered in a graver tone than that in which
                        he had spoken the farcicalities of the prologue. Most of the prefatory
                        matter was given with an air of earnest thought; the arms sometimes folded,
                        and the chin resting on one hand. On the occasion of his first exhibiting
                        the panorama at New York he used a fishing-rod to point out the picture
                        with; subsequently he availed himself of an old umbrella. In the Egyptian
                        Hall he used his little riding-whip.
                   tographs actually taken on the spot10
                  ——and I am sure I need not inform any person present who was ever in the
                  territory of Utah that they are as faithful as they could possibly be.11
                  
               
               
                  
                  10"Photographs." They were photographed by Savage and Ottinger,
                     of Salt Lake City, the photographers to Brigham Young.
               
               
                  
                  11
                     Curtain. The picture was concealed from view during the first
                     part of the lecture by a crimson curtain. This was drawn together or opened
                     many times in the course of the lecture, and at odd points of the picture. I
                     am not aware that Artemus himself could have explained why he caused the
                     curtain to be drawn at one place and not at another. Probably he thought it
                     to be one of his good jokes that it should shut in the picture just when
                     there was no reason for its being used.
               
               I went to Great Salt Lake City by way of California.12
                  
               
               
                  
                  12"By way of California." That is, he went by steamer from New
                     York to Aspinwall, thence across the Isthmus of Panama by railway, and then
                     from Panama to California by another steamboat. A journey which then
                     occupied about three weeks.
               
            
            
               
               THE STEAMER "ARIEL."
               
                  
                     One of the United States Mail line of Steamers from New York to
                        Aspinwall. Being a supplemental boat only, its arrangements were none of the
                        best.
                  
               
               I went to California on the steamer "Ariel."——This is the steamer "Ariel."
               
                  
               
               Oblige me by calmly gazing on the steamer "Ariel"——and when you go to California
                  be sure and go on some other steamer——because the "Ariel" isn't a very good
                  one.
               When I reached the "Ariel"—at pier No. 4—New York—I found the passengers in a
                  state of great confusion about their things—which were being thrown around by the
                  ship's porters in a manner at once damaging and idiotic.——So great was the
                  excitement—my fragile form was smashed this way—and jammed that way—till finally I was shoved into a stateroom
                  which was occupied by two middle-aged females—who said "Base man—leave us—O, leave
                  us!"——I left them——Oh—I left them!
               We reach Accapulco on the coast of Mexico in due time. Nothing of special interest
                  occurred at Accapulco——only some of the Mexican ladies are very beautiful. They
                  all have brilliant black hair——hair "black as starless night"——if I may quote from
                  the "Family Herald." It don't curl.——A Mexican lady's hair never curls——it is
                  straight as an Indian's. Some people's hair won't curl under any
                  circumstances.——My hair won't curl under two shillings.13
                  
               
               
                  
                  13"Under Two Shillings." Artemus always wore his hair straight
                     until after his severe illness in Salt Lake City. So much of it dropped off
                     during his recovery that he became dissatisfied with the long meagre
                     appearance his countenance presented when he surveyed it in the
                     looking-glass. After his lecture at the Salt Lake City Theatre he did not
                     lecture again until we had crossed the Rocky Mountains and arrived at Denver
                     City, the capital of Colorado. On the afternoon he was to lecture there I
                     met him coming out of an ironmonger's store with a small parcel in his hand.
                     "I want you, old fellow," he said, "I have been all round the City for them,
                     and I've got them at last." "Got what?" I asked. "A pair of curling-tongs. I
                     am going to have my hair curled to lecture in to-night. I mean to cross the
                     plains in curls. Come home with me and try to curl it for me. I don't want
                     to go to any idiot of a barber to be laughed at." I played the part of
                     friseur. Subsequently he became his own
                     "curlist," as he phrased it. From that day forth Artemus was a curly-haired
                     man.
               
            
            
               
               MONTGOMERY STREET, SAN FRANCISCO.
               
                  
                     The main street of the chief city of California. It is built over what
                        was a few years ago a portion of the Bay of San Francisco. In digging up a
                        part of the street, some time since, the excavators came upon the hull of an
                        old vessel full of chests of tea. The Chinaman in the foreground was pointed
                        out by the lecturer preparatory to his remarks on the Chinese
                        theatre.
                  
               
               
                  
               
               The great thoroughfare of the imperial city of the Pacific Coast
               The Chinese form a large element in the population of San Francisco—and I went to
                  the Chinese Theatre.
               
               A Chinese play often lasts two months. Commencing at the hero's birth, it is
                  cheerfully conducted from week to week till he is either killed or married.
               The night I was there a Chinese comic vocalist sang a Chinese comic song. It took
                  him six weeks to finish it—but as my time was limited I went away at the
                  expiration of 215 verses. There were 11,000 verses to this song—the chorus being
                  "Tural lural dural, ri fol day"——which was repeated twice at the end of each
                  verse——making—as you will at once see—the appalling number of 22,000 "tural lural
                  dural, ri fol days"——and the man still lives.
            
            
               
               VIRGINIA CITY, NEVADA.
               
                  
                     When Artemus Ward paid his visit here, there was a population of about
                        15,000, with three daily newspapers. Five years previously it had no
                        existence. It was the largest place between the Sierra Nevada Mountains and
                        Salt Lake City. (1863.)
                  
               
               
                  
               
               Virginia City—in the bright new State of Nevada.14
                  
               
               
                  
                  14"Virginia City." The view of Virginia City given in the
                     panorama conveyed a very poor idea of the marvellous capital of the silver
                     region of Nevada. Artemus caused the curtain to close up between his view of
                     San Francisco and that of Virginia City, as a simple means of conveying an
                     idea of the distance travelled between. To arrive at the city of silver we
                     had to travel from San Francisco to Sacramento by steamboat, thence from
                     Sacramento to Folsom by railroad, then by coach to Placerville. At
                     Placerville we commenced the ascent of the Sierra Nevada, gaining the summit
                     of Johnson's Pass about four o'clock in the morning; thence we descended;
                     skirted the shores of Lake Tahoe, and arrived at Carson City, where Artemus
                     lectured. From Carson, the next trip was across an arid plain, to the great
                     silver region. Empire City, the first place we struck, was composed of about
                     fifty wooden houses and three or four quartz mills. Leaving it behind us, we
                     passed through the Devil's Gate—a grand ravine, with precipitous mountains
                     on each side; then we came to Silver City, Gold Hill, and Virginia. The road
                     was all up-hill Virginia City itself is built on a ledge cut out of the side
                     of Mount Davidson, which rises some 9,000 feet above the sea level—the city
                     being about half way up its side. To Artemus Ward the wild character of the
                     scenery, the strange manners of the red-shirted citizens, and the odd
                     developments of life met with in that uncouth mountain-town were all replete
                     with interest. We stayed there about a week. During the time of our stay he
                     explored every part of the place, met many old friends from the Eastern
                     States, and formed many new acquaintances, with some of whom acquaintance
                     ripened into warm friendship. Among the latter was Mr. Samuel L. Clemens,
                     now well known as "Mark Twain." He was then sub-editing one of the three
                     papers published daily in Virginia—The Territorial
                        Enterprise. Artemus detected in the writings of Mark Twain the
                     indications of great humorous power, and strongly advised the writer to seek
                     a better field for his talents. Since then he has become a well-known New
                     York lecturer and author. With Mark Twain, Artemus made a descent into the
                     Gould and Curry Silver Mine at Virginia, the largest mine of the kind, I
                     believe, in the world. The account of the descent formed a long and very
                     amusing article in the next morning's Enterprise. To wander
                     about the town and note its strange developments occupied Artemus
                     incessantly. I was sitting writing letters at the hotel when he came in
                     hurriedly, and requested me to go out with him. "Come and see some joking
                     much better than mine," said he. He led me to where one of Wells, Fargo,
                     & Co.'s express waggons was being rapidly filled with silver bricks.
                     Ingots of the precious metal, each almost as large as an ordinary brick,
                     were being thrown from one man to another to load the waggon, just as bricks
                     or cheeses are transferred from hand to had by carters in England. "Good old
                     jokes those, Hingston. Good, solid 'Babes in the Wood,'" observed Artemus.
                     Yet that evening he lectured in "Maguire's Opera House," Virginia City, to
                     an audience composed chiefly of miners, and the receipts were not far short
                     of eight hundred dollars. A droll building it was to be called an "Opera
                     House," and to bear that designation in a place so outlandish. Perched up on
                     the side of a mountain—from the windows of the dressing rooms—a view could
                     be had of fifty miles of the American desert. It was an "Opera House;" yet
                     in the plain beneath it there were Indians who still led the life of
                     savages, and carried dried human scalps attached to their girdles. It was an
                     "Opera House;" yet, for many hundred miles around it, Nature wore the
                     roughest, sternest, and most barren of aspects—no tree, no grass, no shrub,
                     but the colourless and dreary sage-brush. Every piece of timber, every
                     brick, and every stone in that "Opera House" had been brought from
                     California, over those snow-capped Sierras, which, but a few
                     years before had been regarded as beyond the last outposts of civilisation.
                     Every singer who had sung, and every actor who had performed at that "Opera
                     House" had been whirled down the sides of the Nevada mountains, clinging to
                     the coach-top, and mentally vowing never again to trust the safety of his
                     neck on any such professional excursion. The drama has been very plucky "out
                     West." Thalia, Melpomene, and Euterpe become young ladies of great animal
                     spirits, and fearless daring, when they feel the fresh breezes of the
                     Pacific blowing in their faces. At Virginia City we purchased black felt
                     shirts half an inch thick and grey blankets of ample size to keep us warm
                     for the journey we were about to undertake. We invested also in revolvers to
                     defend ourselves against the Indians; a dozen cold roast fowls to eat on the
                     way; a demijohn of Bourbon whisky, and a bagful of unground coffee. This
                     last was about as useful as any of our purchases. Thus provided, we started
                     across the desert on our way to Reese River, and thence to Salt Lake City.
                     Our coach was a fearfully lumbering old vehicle of great strength,
                     constructed for jolting over rocky ledges, plunging into marshy swamps, and
                     for rolling through miles of sand. The horses were small and wiry,
                     accustomed to the country, and able to exist on anything which it is
                     possible for a horse to eat. There were four of us in the coach. The
                     "Pioneer Company's" man who drove us was full of whisky and good-humour when
                     he mounted the box, and singing in chorus, "Jordan 's a hard road to travel
                     on." we bowled down the slope of Mount Davidson towards the deserts of
                     Nevada, en route for New Pass Station.
               
               A 
                     wonderfu
                     wonderful
                   little city—right in the heart of the famous Washoe silver regions——the
                  mines of which annually produce over twenty-five millions of solid silver. This
                  silver is melted into solid bricks—of about the size of ordinary house-bricks—and carted off to San Francisco with
                  mules. The roads often swarm with these silver wagons.
               One hundred and seventy-five miles to the east of this place are the Reese River
                  Silver Mines—which are supposed to be the richest in the world.
            
            
               
               PLAINS BETWEEN VIRGINIA & SALT LAKE.
               
                  
                     Herbage on the plains of Nevada consists almost exclusively of the
                        Sage-brush (Artemisia tridentata), the most dreary-looking of shrubs. The
                        leaves are of a leaden colour, and the stems and gnarled and wiry.
                  
               
               
                  
               
               The great American Desert in winter-time——the desert which is so frightfully
                  gloomy always. No trees——no houses——no people—save the miserable beings who live
                  in wretched huts and have charge of the horses and mules of the Overland Mail
                  Company.
               
               This picture is a great work of art.——It is an oil painting—done in petroleum. It
                  is by the Old Masters. It was the last thing they did before dying. They did this
                  and then they expired.
               The most celebrated artists of London are so delighted with this picture that they
                  come to the Hall every day to gaze at it. I wish you were nearer to it—so you
                  could see it better. I wish I could take it to your residences and let you see it by daylight. Some of the greatest
                  artists in London come here every morning before daylight with lanterns to look
                  at. They say they never saw anything like it before——and they hope they never
                  shall again.
               When I first showed this picture in New York, the audience were so enthusiastic in
                  their admiration of this picture that they called for the Artist——and when he
                  appeared they threw brickbats at him.14*
                  
               
               
                  
                  14*"Threw brickbats at him." This portion of the panorama was
                     very badly painted. When the idea of having a panorama was first entertained
                     by Artemus he wished to have one of great artistic merit. Finding
                     considerable difficulty in procuring one, and also discovering that the
                     expense of a real work of art would be beyond his means, he resolved on
                     having a very bad one, or one so bad in parts that its very badness would
                     give him scope for jest. In the small towns of the Western States it passed
                     very well for a first-class picture, but what it was really worth in an
                     artistic point of view its owner was very well aware.
               
            
            
               
               
                  
               
               A bird's-eye-view of Great Salt Lake City——the strange city in the Desert about
                  which so much has been heard——the city of the people who call themselves
                     Saints.15
                  
               
               
                  
                  15"Salt Lake City." Our stay in the Mormon capital extended over
                     six weeks. So cheerless was the place in midwinter, that we should not have
                     stayed half that time had not Artemus Ward succumbed to an attack of typhoid
                     fever almost as soon as we arrived. The incessant travel by night and day,
                     the depressing effect produced by intense cold, travelling through leagues
                     of snow and fording half-frozen rivers at midnight, the excitement of
                     passing through Indian country, and some slight nervous apprehension of how
                     he would be received among the Mormons, considering that be had ridiculed
                     them in a paper published some time before, all conspired to produce the
                     illness which resulted. Fever of the typhoid form is not uncommon in Utah.
                     Probably the rarefaction of the air on a plateau 4,000 feet above the sea
                     level has something to do with its frequency. Artemus's fears relative to
                     the cordiality of his reception proved to be groundless, for during the
                     period of his being ill he was carefully tended. Brigham Young commissioned
                     Mr. Stenhouse, postmaster to the city and Elder of the Mormon Church, to
                     visit him frequently and supply him with whatever he required. One of the
                     two wives of Mr. Townsend, landlord of the Salt Lake House, the hotel where
                     we stopped was equally as kind. Whatever the feelings of the Mormons were
                     towards poor Artemus, they at least treated him with sympathetic
                     hospitality. Even Mr. Porter Rockwell, who is known as one of the "Avenging
                     Angels," or "Danite Band," and who is reported to have made away with some
                     seventeen or eighteen enemies of the "Saints," came and sat by the bedside
                     of the sufferer, detailing to him some of the little "difficulties" he had
                     experienced in effectually silencing the unbelievers of times past.
               
               I know there is much interest taken in these remarkable people—ladies and gentlemen——and
                     PART OF SALT LAKE CITY, VIEWED FROM A DISTANCE.
                     The City is laid out in squares; each house standing on an acre and a
                        quarter of ground, with a canal of clear water flowing in front. (This
                        picture joins on the one which follows it.)
                  
                  
                  
                     SALT LAKE CITY, FROM THE HEIGHTS BEHIND IT.
                     The building in the foreground is the Mormon arsenal. To the right, in the
                        mid-distance, is the River Jordan, flowing from Lake Utah to the Salt Lake.
                        The valley through which the Jordan flows is one of the most fertile on the
                        North American continent.
                  
                   I have thought it better to make the
                  purely descriptive part of my Entertainment entirely serious.——I will not—then—for
                  the next ten minutes—confine myself to my subject.
               Some seventeen years ago a small band of Mormons—headed by Brigham Young—commenced
                  in the present thrifty metropolis of Utah. The population of the territory of Utah
                  is over 100,000—chiefly Mormons——and they are increasing at the rate of from five
                  to ten thousand annually. The converts to
                  Mormonism now are almost exclusively confined to English and Germans.——Wales and
                  Cornwall have contributed largely to the population of Utah during the last few
                  years. The population of Great Salt Lake City is 20,000.——The streets are eight
                  rods wide*
                  —and are neither flagged nor paved. A stream of pure mountain spring water
                  courses through each street—and is conducted into the Gardens of the Mormons. The
                  houses are mostly of adobe—or sun-dried brick—and present a neat and comfortable
                  appearance.——They are usually a story and a half high. Now and then you see a fine
                  modern house in Salt Lake City——but no house that is dirty, shabby, and
                  dilapidated—because there are no absolutely poor people in Utah. Every Mormon has
                  a nice garden——and every Mormon has a tidy dooryard.——Neatness is a great
                  characteristic of the Mormons.
               
                  
                  *Equal to 64 feet wide.
               
               The Mormons profess to believe that they are the chosen people of God——they call
                  themselves Latter-day Saints——and they call us people of the outer world Gentiles.
                  They say that Mr. Brigham Young is a
                  prophet—the legitimate successor of Joseph Smith—who founded the Mormon religion.
                  They also say they are authorised—by special revelation from Heaven—to marry as
                  many wives as they can comfortably support.
               This wife-system they call plurality——the world calls it polygamy. That at its
                  best it is an accursed thing—I need not of course inform you——but you will bear in
                  mind that I am here as a rather cheerful reporter of what I saw in Utah——and I
                  fancy it isn't at all necessary for me to grow virtuously indignant over something
                  we all know is hideously wrong.
               You will be surprised to hear—I was amazed to see—that among the Mormon women
                  there are some few persons of education—of positive cultivation vation. As a class
                  the Mormons are not an educated people——but they are by no means the community of
                  ignoramuses so many writers have told us they were.
               The valley in which they live is splendidly favoured. They raise immense crops.
                  They have mills of all kinds. They have coal—lead—and silver mines. All they
                  eat—all they drink—all they wear they can produce themselves—and still have a
                  great abundance to sell to the gold regions of Idaho on the one hand—and the
                  silver regions of Nevada on the other.
               The President of this remarkable community——the head of the Mormon Church——is
                  Brigham Young.——He is called President Young—and Brother Brigham. He is about 54
                  years old—altho' he doesn't look to be over 45. He has sandy hair and whiskers——is
                  of medium height——and is a little inclined to corpulency. He was born in the State of Vermont. His power is
                  more absolute than that of any living sovereign——yet he uses it with such
                  consummate discretion that his people are almost madly devoted to him—and that
                  they would cheerfully die for him if they thought the sacrifice were demanded—I
                  cannot doubt.
               He is a man of enormous wealth.——One-tenth of everything sold in the territory of
                  Utah goes to the Church——and Mr. Brigham Young is the Church. It is supposed that
                  he speculates with these funds——at all events—he is one of the wealthiest men now
                  living——worth several millions—without doubt.——He is a bold—bad man——but that he
                  is also a man of extraordinary administrative ability no one can doubt who has
                  watched his astounding career for the past ten years. It is only fair for me to
                  add that he treated me with marked kindness during my sojourn in Utah.
            
            
               
               THE SALT LAKE HOUSE.
               
                  
                     The hotel in Salt Lake City at which Artemus Ward stopped during his six
                        weeks' stay, and where he was seized with illness. In the distance are the
                        Wahsatch Mountains.
                  
               
               
                  
               
               The West Side of Main Street—Salt Lake City—including a view of the Salt Lake
                  Hotel.——It is a temperance hotel.16
                   I prefer temperance hotels—altho' they sell worse liquor than
                  
                     
                     16"Temperance Hotel." At the date of our visit, there was only
                        one place in Salt Lake City where strong drink was allowed to be sold.
                        Brigham Young himself owned the property, and vended the liquor by
                        wholesale, not permitting any of it to be drunk on the premises. It was a
                        coarse, inferior kind of whisky, known in Salt Lake as "Valley Tan."
                        Throughout the city there was no drinking-bar nor billiard room, so far as I
                        am aware. But a drink on the sly could always be had at one of the
                        hard-goods stores, in the back office behind the pile of metal saucepans; or
                        at one of the dry-goods stores, in the little parlour in the rear of the
                        bales of calico. At the present time I believe that there are two or three
                        open bars in Salt Lake, Brigham Young having recognised the right of the
                        "Saints" to "liquor up" occasionally. But whatever other failings they may
                        have, intemperance cannot be laid to their charge. Among the Mormons there
                        are no paupers, no gamblers, and no drunkards.
                   any other kind of
                  hotels. But the Salt Lake Hotel sells none——nor is there a bar in all Salt Lake
                  City——but I found when I was thirsty—and I generally am—that I could get some very
                  good brandy of one of the Elders—on the sly—and I never on any account allow my
                  business to interfere with my drinking.
            
            
               MAIN STREET, SALT LAKE CITY.
               
                  
                     This picture is a continuation of the preceding one. The room in which
                        Artemus resided was that in the white part of the house, under the Veranda.
                        The hotel was kept by Mr. James Townsend, a Mormon.
                  
               
            
            
               
               THE COACH TO SALT LAKE.
               
                  
                     In the panorama, the Coach is made a much more sightly object than it
                        really was. Instead of looking like a respectable omnibus, it was a huge
                        jolting affair of cumbrous proportions, with sad arrangements for internal
                        comfort.
                  
               
               
                  
               
               There is the Overland Mail Coach.17
                  ——That is, the den on wheels in which we have been
                  
                     
                     17"Overland Mail Coach." From Virginia City to Salt Lake we
                        travelled in the coaches of the "Pioneer Stage Company." In leaving Salt
                        Lake for Denver we changed to those of the "Overland Stage Company," of
                        which the renowned Ben Holliday is proprietor, a gentleman whose name on the
                        Plains is better known than that of any other man in America.
                   crammed for the past ten days—and ten
                  nights.——Those of you who have been in Newgate18
                  —and staid there any length of time——as visitors——can realize how I
                  felt.
               
                  
                  18"Been in Newgate." The manner in which Artemus uttered this
                     joke was peculiarly characteristic of his style of lecturing. The
                     commencement of the sentence was spoken as if unpremeditated; then, when he
                     had got as far as the word "Newgate," he paused, as if wishing to call back
                     that which he had said. The applause was unfailingly uproarious. Travelling
                     through the States, he used to say, "Those of you who have been in the
                     Penitentiary." On the morning after his lecture at Pittsburg in
                     Pennsylvania, he was waited on by a tall, gaunt, dark-haired man, of sour
                     aspect and sombre demeanour, who carried in his hand a hickory walking-cane,
                     which he grasped very menacingly, as addressing Artemus he said, "I guess
                     you are the gentleman who lectured last night?" Mr. Ward replied in the
                     affirmative. "Then I've got to have satisfaction from you. I took my wife
                     and her sister to hear you lecter, and you insulted them." "Excuse me," said
                     Artemus. "I went home immediately the lecture was over, and had no
                     conversation with any lady in the hall that evening." The visitor grew more
                     angry, "Hold that, Mr. Lect'rer. You told my wife and her sister that they'd
                     been in the Penitentiary. I must have satisfaction for the insult, and I'm
                     come to get it. "Artemus was hesitating how to reply, when the hotel clerk
                     suddenly appeared upon the scene, saying, "I've a good memory for voices.
                     You are Mr. Josiah Mertin, I believe?" "I am," was the reply. "And I am the
                     late clerk of the Girard House, Philadelphia. There's a little board-bill of
                     yours owing there for ninety-two dollars and a half. You skedaddled without
                     paying. Will you oblige me by waiting till I send for an officer?" I believe
                     that Mr. Josiah Mertin did not even wait for "satisfaction."
               
               The American Overland Mail Route commences at Sacramento—California——and ends at
                  Atchison—Kansas. The distance is two thousand two hundred miles——but you go
                     part of the way by rail. The Pacific
                     Railway19
                   is now completed from Sacramento—California—to Fulsom—California——which
                  only leaves two thousand two hundred and eleven miles to go by coach. This breaks
                  the monotony——it came very near breaking my back.
               
                  
                  19"The Pacific Railway." The journey was made in the winter of
                     1863-4. By the time these notes appear in print, the Pacific Railway will be
                     almost complete from the banks of the Missouri to those of the Sacramento,
                     and travellers will soon be able to make the transit of over three thousand
                     miles from New York City to the capital of California, without leaving the
                     railway car, except to cross a ferry, or to change from one station to
                     another.
               
            
            
               
               THE MORMON THEATRE.
               
                  
                     A brief description of this building will be found in the notes appended
                        to the lecture. Artemus Ward lectured here on "The Babes in the Wood." It
                        was built by Brigham Young, and is his property.
                  
               
               
                  
               
               The Mormon Theatre.——This edifice is the exclusive property of Brigham Young. It
                  will comfortably hold 3,000 persons—and I beg you will believe me when I inform
                  you that its interior is quite as brilliant as that of any theatre in London.20
                  
               
               
                  
                  20"Brilliant as that of any theatre in London." Herein Artemus
                     slightly exaggerated. The colouring of the theatre was white and gold, but
                     it was inefficiently lighted with oil lamps. When Brigham Young himself
                     showed us round the theatre, he pointed out, as an instance of his own
                     ingenuity, that the central chandelier was formed out of the wheel of one of
                     his old coaches. The house is now, I believe, lighted with gas. Altogether
                     it is a very wondrous edifice, considering where it is built and who were
                     the builders. At the time of its erection there was no other theatre on the
                     northern part of the American plateau, no building for a similar purpose
                     anywhere for five hundred miles, north, east, south, or west. Many a theatre
                     in the provincial towns of England is not half so substantially built, nor
                     one tithe-part so well appointed. The dressing rooms, wardrobe, tailors'
                     workshop, carpenters' shop, paint room, and library, leave scarcely anything
                     to be desired in their completeness. Brigham Young's son-in-law, Mr. Hiram
                     Clawson, the manager, and Mr. John Cane, the stage manager, if they came to
                     London, might render good service at one or two of our metropolitan 
                        playouuses
                        playhouses
                     .
               
               
               The actors are all Mormon amateurs, who charge nothing for their services.
               You must know that very little money is taken at the doors of this theatre. The
                  Mormons mostly pay in grain—and all sorts of articles.
               The night I gave my little lecture there—among my receipts were corn—flour—pork—
                  cheese—chickens——on foot and in the shell.
               One family went in on a live pig——and a man attempted to pass a "yaller dog" at
                  the Box Office—but my agent repulsed him. One offered me a doll for
                  admission——another infants' clothing.——I refused to take that.——As a general rule
                  I do refuse.
               In the middle of the parquet—in a rocking chair—with his hat on—sits Brigham
                  Young. When the play drags—he either goes out or falls into a tranquil sleep.
               A portion of the dress-circle is set apart for the wives of Brigham Young. From
                  ten to twenty of them are usually present. His children fill the entire
                  gallery—and more too.
            
            
               
               
                  
                     
                  
               
               The East Side of Main Street—Salt Lake City—with a view of the Council
                  Building.——The legislature of Utah meets there. It is like all legislative bodies.
                  They meet this winter to repeal the laws which they met and made last winter——and
                  they will meet next winter to repeal the laws which they met and made this
                  winter.
               I dislike to speak about it——but it was in Utah that I made the great speech of my
                  life. I wish you could have heard it. I have a fine education. You may have
                  noticed it. I speak six different languages——London—Chatham—and Dover——Margate—Brighton—
                     MAIN STREET, SALT LAKE CITY.
                     The building to the extreme right is the House of Legislature, where the
                        representatives of the territory of Utah hold their meetings. The second
                        house on the right is the Post Office. Main Street is 132 feet in
                        breadth.
                  
                   and Hastings. My parents sold a
                  cow—and sent me to college when I was quite young. During the vacation I used to
                  teach a school of whales—and there's where I learned to spout.——I don't expect
                  applause for a little thing like that. I wish you could have heard that
                  speech—however. If Cicero——he's dead now——he has gone from us——but if Old Ciss21
                   could have heard that effort it would have given him the rinderpest. I'll
                  tell you how it was. There are stationed in Utah two regiments of U. S.
                  troops——the 21st from California—and the 37th from Nevada. The 20-onesters asked
                  me to present a stand of colours
                  
                     
                     21"Old Ciss." Here again no description can adequately inform
                        the reader of the drollery which characterized the lecturer. His reference
                        to Cicero was made in the most lugubrious manner, as if he really deplored
                        his death and valued him as a schoolfellow loved and lost.
                  
                   to the 37-sters——and I did it in a speech so
                  abounding in eloquence of a bold and brilliant character——and also some sweet
                  talk——real pretty shop-keeping talk——that I worked the enthusiasm of those
                  soldiers up to such a pitch—that they came very near shooting me on the spot.22
                  
               
               
                  
                  22"United States Troops." Our stay in Utah was rendered
                     especially pleasant by the attentions of the regiment of California Cavalry,
                     then stationed at Fort Douglas in the Wahsatch Mountains, three miles beyond
                     and overlooking the city. General Edward O'Connor, the United States
                     Military Governor of Utah, was especially attentive to the wants of poor
                     Artemus during his severe illness; and had it not been for the kind
                     attentions of Dr. Williams, the surgeon to the regiment, I doubt if the
                     invalid would have recovered. General O'Connor had then been two years
                     stationed in Utah, but during the whole of that time had refused to have any
                     personal communication with Brigham Young. The Mormon prophet would sit in
                     his private box, and the United States general occupy a seat in the
                     dress-circle of the theatre. They would look at each other frequently
                     through their opera-glasses, but that constituted their whole intimacy.

                     To the extreme left is the Lion House. (There is a lion over one of the
                        windows.) It is the harem of the prophet. Every "wife" who inhabits it has a
                        room similarly furnished. They meet in common on the veranda. Brigham Young
                        himself lives with his favourite in the large middle house. The building
                        with the tower to it on the right is the school-house, for the education of
                        the prophet's children only.
                  
               
               
                  
               
               Brigham Young's Harem.——These are the houses of Brigham Young. The first on the
                  right is the Lion House—so called because a crouching stone lion adorns the
                  central front window. The adjoining small building is Brigham Young's office—and
                  where he receives his visitors.——The large house in the centre of the
                  picture—which displays a huge bee-hive—is called the Bee House——the bee-hive is
                  supposed to be symbolical of the industry of the Mormons.——Mrs. Brigham Young the
                  first—now quite an old lady—lives here with her children. None of the other wives
                  of the prophet live here. In the rear
                  are the school houses where Brigham Young's children are educated.
               Brigham Young has two hundred wives. Just think of that! Oblige me by thinking of
                  that. That is—he has eighty actual wives, and he is spiritually married to one
                  hundred and twenty more. These spiritual marriages——as the Mormons call them——are
                  contracted with aged windows—who think it a great honour to be sealed——the Mormons
                  call it being sealed——to the Prophet.
               So we may say he has two hundred wives. He loves not wisely—but two hundred well.
                  He is dreadfully married. He's the most married man I ever saw in my life.
               I saw his mother-in-law while I was there. I can't exactly tell you how many there
                  is of her—but it's a good deal. It strikes me that one mother-in-law is about
                  enough to have in a family——unless you're very fond of excitement.
               A few days before my arrival in Utah—Brigham was married again—to a young and
                  really pretty girl23
                  ——but he says he shall stop now. He told me confidentially that he
                  shouldn't get married any more. He says that all he wants now is to live in peace
                  for the remainder of his days—and have his dying pillow soothed by the loving
                  hands of his family. Well—that's all right——that's all right—I suppose——but if
                     all his family soothe his dying pillow—he'll have to go out-doors
                     to die.

                     new theatre.
               
               By the way—Shakespeare endorses polygamy.——He speaks of the Merry Wives of
                  Windsor. How many wives did Mr. Windsor have——But we will let this pass.
            
            
               
               Some of these Mormons have terrific families. I lectured one night by invitation
                  in the Mormon village of Provost——but during the day I rashly gave a leading
                  Mormon an order admitting himself and family.——It was before I knew that he was
                  much married——and they filled the room to overflowing. It was a great success——but
                  I didn't get any money.
               
                  
               
               Heber C. Kimball's Harem.—Mr. C. Kimball is the first vice-president of the Mormon
                  church—and would—consequently—succeed to the full presidency on Brigham Young's
                  death.
               Brother Kimball is a gay and festive cuss of some seventy summers——or some'ers there
                     MR. HEBER C. KIMBALL'S HAREM.
                     The seraglio of Mr. Kimball is large. Unlike Brigham Young, he does not keep
                        his wives under one roof, but has many buildings in his garden, where he
                        assorts them according to their temper and their adaptability to dwelling
                        together in peace.
                  
                   about. He has one thousand head of
                  cattle and a hundred head of wives.24
                     He says they are awful eaters.
               
                  
                  24"A hundred head of Wives." It is an authenticated fact that,
                     in an address to his congregation in the tabernacle, Heber C. Kimball once
                     alluded to his wives by the endearing epithet of "my heifers;" and on
                     another occasion politely spoke of them as "his cows." The phraseology may
                     possibly be a slight indication of the refinement of manners prevalent in
                     Salt Lake City.
               
               Mr. Kimball had a son——a lovely young man——who was married to ten interesting
                  wives. But one day——while he was absent from home——these ten wives went out
                  walking with a handsome young man—which so enraged Mr. Kimball's son—which made
                  Mr. Kimball's son so jealous—that he shot himself with a horse pistuel.
               
               The doctor who attended him——a very scientific man——informed me that the bullet
                  entered the inner parallelogram of his diaphragmatic thorax, superinducing
                  membranous hemorrhage in the outer cuticle of his basilicon-thamaturgist. It
                  killed him. I should have thought it would.

                  25"Soft Music." Here Artemus Ward's pianist (following
                     instructions) sometimes played the dead march from "Saul." At
                     other times, the Welsh air of "Poor Mary Anne;" or any thing else replete
                     with sadness which might chance to strike his fancy. The effect was
                     irresistibly comic.
               
               I hope his sad end will be a warning to all young wives who go out walking with
                  handsome young men. Mr. Kimball's son is now no more. He sleeps beneath the
                  cypress—the myrtle—and the willow. This music is a dirge by the eminent pianist
                  for Mr. Kimball's son. He died by request.
               I regret to say that efforts were made to make a Mormon of me while I was in
                  Utah.
               It was leap-year when I was there—and seventeen young widows——the wives of a
                  deceased Mormon——offered me their hearts and hands. I called on them one day—and
                  taking their soft white hands in mine——which made eighteen hands altogether——I
                  found them in tears.
               And I said—"Why is this thus? What is the reason of this thusness?"
               
               They hove a sigh——seventeen sighs of different size.——They said—
               "Oh—soon thou wilt be gonested away!"
               I told them that when I got ready to leave a place I wentested.
               They said—"Doth not like us?"
               I said—"I doth——I doth!"
               I also said—"I hope your intentions are honourable—as I am a lone child——my
                  parents being far—far away.
               They then said—"Wilt not marry us?"
               I said—"Oh—no——it cannot was."
               Again they asked me to marry them—and again I declined. When they cried—
            
            
               
               TABERNACLE AND BOWERY.
               
                  
                     The Tabernacle is the building to the left; to the right of it, and
                        within the same enclosure, is the Bowery: a large shed with boughs of trees
                        laid over it, the sides being open. In it religious services are held during
                        the summer months.
                  
               
               "Oh—cruel man! This is too much——oh! too much!"
               I told them that it was on account of the muchness that I declined.26
                  
               
               
                  
                  26"That I declined." I remember one evening party in Salt Lake
                     City to which Artemus Ward and myself went. There were thirty-nine ladies
                     and only seven gentlemen.
               
               
                  
               
               This is the Mormon Temple.
               It is built of adobe—and will hold five thousand persons quite comfortably. A full
                  brass and string band
                  often assists the choir of this church——and the choir—I may add—is a remarkably
                  good one.
               Brigham Young seldom preaches now. The younger elders——unless on some special
                  occasion——conduct the services. I only heard Mr. Young once. He is not an educated
                  man——but speaks with considerable force and clearness. The day I was there there
                  was nothing coarse in his remarks.
            
            
               
                  
                     
                  
               
               The foundations of the Temple.
               These are the foundations of the magnificent Temple the Mormons are building. It
                  is to be
                     FOUNDATIONS OF THE NEW TEMPLE.
                     From this picture and that which succeeds may be formed some idea of how far
                        the building of the New Temple had progressed at the time of the lecturer's
                        visit. The stones were being shaped into form by masons who contributed
                        their labour gratuitously.
                  
                  
                  
                     FOUNDATIONS OF THE TEMPLE. CONTINUED.
                     The block is forty rods square, and contains ten acres. The position is
                        4,300 feet above the level of the sea in latitude 40° 45' 44" N., and
                        longitude 112° 6' 8" W. of Greenwich.
                  
                   built of hewn stone—and will cover
                  several acres of ground. They say it shall eclipse in splendour all other temples
                  in the world. They also say it shall be paved with solid gold.*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *"Solid Gold." "Where will the gold be obtained from?" is a
                     question which the visitor might reasonably be expected to ask.
                     Unquestionably the mountains of Utah contain the precious metal, though it
                     has not been the policy of Brigham Young and the chiefs of the Mormon Church
                     to disclose their knowledge of the localities in which it is to be found.
                     There is a current report in Salt Lake City that nuggets of gold have been
                     picked up within a radius of a few score of miles from the site of the new
                     temple. But the Mormons, instructed by their Church, profess ignorance on
                     the subject. The discovery of large gold mines, and permission to work them,
                     would attract to the valley of Salt Lake a class of visitors not wished for
                     by Brigham Young and his disciples. Next to the construction of the Pacific
                     Railway, nothing would be more conducive to the downfall of Mormonism than
                     Utah becoming known as an extensive gold-field.
               
               It is perhaps worthy of remark that the architect of this contemplated gorgeous
                  affair repudiated Mormonism—and is now living in London.
            
            
               
               The Temple as it is to be.
               
                  
               
               This pretty little picture is from the architect's design——and cannot therefore—I
                  suppose—be called a fancy sketch.27
                  
               
               
                  
                  27"A Fancy Sketch." Artemus had the windows of the temple in his
                     panorama cut out and filled in with transparent coloured paper, so that,
                     when lighted from behind, it had the effect of one of the little plaster
                     churches with a piece of lighted candle inside, which the Italian image-boys
                     display at times for sale in the streets. Nothing in the course of the
                     evening pleased Artemus more than to notice the satisfaction with which this
                     meretricious piece of absurdity was received by the audience.
               
               Should the Mormons continue unmolested—I think they will complete this rather
                  remarkable edifice.
               
                  
                     THE TEMPLE AS IT IS TO BE.
                     The view is copied from the original drawing by Mr. Truman O. Angell, the
                        architect. There is very little chance under present circumstances that the
                        Temple will be completed. The formation of the Pacific Railway will, in all
                        probability, cause the Mormons to seek a home elsewhere.
                  
               
            
            
               
               PART OF THE GREAT SALT LAKE.
               
                  
                     It is situated in the north-eastern corner of Utah Territory, to the
                        north-west of the valley of Salt Lake and about eighteen miles from the
                        city. Its length is nearly seventy miles; its breadth from thirty to
                        thirty-five miles. (N.B.—This is the moon in the management of which Artemus
                        Ward's "moonist" was apt to experience difficulty.)
                  
               
               Great Salt Lake.——The great salt dead sea of the desert.
               
                  
               
               I know of no greater curiosity than this inland sea of thick brine. It is eighty
                  miles wide—and one hundred and thirty miles long. Solid masses of salt are daily
                  washed ashore in immense heaps—and the Mormon in want of salt has only to go to
                  the shore of this lake and fill his cart. Only—the salt for table use has to be
                  subjected to a boiling process.28
                  
               
               
                  
                  28"The Great Salt Lake." A very general mistake prevails among
                     those not better informed that the Mormon capital is built upon the borders
                     of the Salt Lake. There are eighteen miles of distance between them. Not
                     from any part of the City proper can a view of the Lake be obtained. To get
                     a glimpse of it without journeying towards it, the traveller must ascend to
                     one of the rocky ledges in the range of mountains which back the city. So
                     saline is the water of the lake, that three pailsful of it are said to yield
                     on evaporation one pailful of salt. I never saw the experiment tried.
               
               
               These are facts—susceptible of the clearest possible proof. They tell one story
                  about this lake—however—that I have my doubts about. They say a Mormon farmer
                  drove forty head of cattle in there once—and they came out first-rate pickled
                  beef.——
               
               
               
               
               
            
            
               THE GREAT SALT LAKE.
               PRECEDING VIEW CONTINUED.
               
                  
                     This Dead Sea of the Western world is supplied with fresh water from
                        three rivers—the Bear River, the Weber, and the Jordan. The water, according
                        to Captain Burton's statement, contains six times and a half more solid
                        matter than the average solid constituents of sea water.
                  
               
            
            
               
               
                  
                     At this part of the entertainment the lights in the room were turned up,
                        and the audience allowed a very brief "interval for refreshments." Artemus
                        Ward had to recover from the fatigue of attending to the moon.
                  
               
               I sincerely hope you will excuse my absence——I am a man short—and have to work the
                  moon myself.29
                  
               
               
                  
                  29"The Moon myself." Here Artemus would leave the rostrum for a
                     few moments, and pretend to be engaged behind. The picture was painted for a
                     night-scene, and the effect intended to be produced was that of the moon
                     rising over the lake and rippling on the waters. It was produced in the
                     usual dioramic way, by making the track of the moon transparent and throwing
                     the moon on from the bull's eye of a lantern. When Artemus went behind, the
                     moon would become nervous and flickering, dancing up and down in the most
                     inartistic and undecided manner. The result was that, coupled with the
                     lecturer's oddly expressed apology, the "moon" became one of the best
                     laughed-at parts of the entertainment.
               
               I shall be most happy to pay a good salary to any respectable boy of good
                  parentage and education who is a good moonist.
            
            
               
               The Endowment House.30
                  
               
               
                  
                  30"The Endowment House." To the young ladies of Utah this
                     edifice possesses extreme interest. The Mormon ceremony of marriage is said
                     to be of the most extraordinary character; various symbolical scenes being
                     enacted, and the bride, and bridegroom invested with sacred garments which
                     they are never to part with. In all Salt Lake I could not find a person who
                     would describe to me the ceremonies of the Endowment House, nor could
                     Artemus or myself obtain admission within its mystic walls.
               
               
                  
               
               In this building the Mormon is initiated into the mysteries of the faith.
               Strange stories are told of the proceedings which are held in this building——but I
                  have no possible means of knowing how true they may be.
               
                  
                     THE ENDOWMENT HOUSE.
                     That which takes place within this building travellers may guess at but are
                        not permitted to know. It is where the Mormon marriages are celebrated. On
                        the mountain above a figure out of all proportion to the scenery is supposed
                        to represent Artemus Ward attacked by a bear in front and a pack of wolves
                        in the rear.
                  
               
            
            
               
               ENTRANCE TO ECHO CANYON.
               
                  
                     High bluffs of yellow colour and conglomerate formation, full of small
                        fossils. The buildings at the base constitute Weber's Station, where the
                        coach stops for the mules to be changed, and the passengers to obtain
                        refreshments.
                  
               
               Echo Canyon.
               
                  
               
               Salt Lake City is fifty-five miles behind us—and this is Echo Canyon—in reaching
                  which we are supposed to have crossed the summit of the Wahsatch Mountains. These
                  ochre-coloured bluffs——formed of conglomerate sandstone—and full of
                  fossils——signal the entrance to the Canyon. At its base lies Weber Station.
               Echo Canyon is about twenty-five miles long. It is really the sublimest thing
                  between the Missouri and the Sierra Nevada. The red wall to the left develops
                  further up the Canyon into pyramids—buttresses—and castles——honey combed and
                  fretted in nature's own massive magnificence of architecture.
               
               In 1856—Echo Canyon was the place selected by Brigham Young for the Mormon General
                  Wells to fortify and make impregnable against the advance of the American army—led
                  by General Albert Sidney Johnson. It was to have been the Thermopylæ of
                  Mormondom——but it wasn't. General Wells was to have done Leonidas——but he
                  didn't.
            
            
               
                  
               
               A more cheerful view of the Desert.
               The wild snow storms have left us—and we have thrown our wolf-skin overcoats
                  aside. Certain tribes of far-western Indians bury their distinguished dead by
                  placing them high in air and covering them with valuable furs——that is a very fair
                  representation of these mid-air tombs. Those
                     THE INDIANS ON THE PLAINS.
                     On the right of the picture is the scaffold erected for an Indian grave. The
                        corpse is placed on the top of it, out of the way of the wolves, though not
                        so protected but what the vultures and other birds of carrion soon render it
                        a mere skeleton.
                  
                   animals are horses——I know they
                  are—because my artist says so. I had the picture two years before I discovered the
                  fact.——The artist came to me about six months ago—and said——"It is useless to
                  disguise it from you any longer——they are horses."31
                  
               
               
                  
                  31"They are Horses." Here again Artemus called in the aid of
                     pleasant banter as the most fitting apology for the atrocious badness of the
                     painting.
               
               It was while crossing this desert that I was surrounded by a band of Ute Indians.
                  They were splendidly mounted——they were dressed in beaver-skins——and they were
                  armed with rifles—knives—and pistols.
               What could I do?——What could a poor old orphan do? I'm a brave man.——The day
                  before the Battle of Bull's Run I stood in the highway while the bullets——those
                  dreadful messengers of death——were passing all around me thickly——IN
                     WAGGONS——on their
                  way to the battle field.32
                   But there were too many of these Injuns——there were, forty of them—and
                   only one of me——and so I said—
               
                  
                  32"Their way to the battle-field." This was the great joke of
                     Artemus Ward's first lecture, "The Babes in the Wood." He never omitted it
                     in any of his lectures, nor did it lose its power to create laughter by
                     repetition. The audiences at the Egyptian Hall, London, laughed as
                     immoderately at it as did those of Irving Hall, New York, or of the Tremont
                     Temple in Boston.
               
               "Great Chief—I surrender." His name was Wocky-bocky.
               He dismounted—and approached me. I saw his tomahawk glisten in the morning
                  sunlight.  Fire was in his eye. Wocky-bocky came very close to me and
                  seized me by the hair of my head. He mingled his swarthy fingers with my golden
                     OUR ENCOUNTER WITH THE INDIANS.
                     Utah Territory contains Indians of two races—the Shoshones and the Utes. The
                        Utes are very friendly with the Mormons, who treat them with uniform
                        kindness. It is commonly believed that a secret treaty of alliance exists
                        between Brigham Young and the chiefs of the Indian tribes. (The left hand
                        portion of the illustration belongs to the preceding picture.)
                  
                   tresses——and he rubbed his dreadful
                  Thomas-hawk across my lily-white face. He said—
               "Torsha arrah darrah mishky bookshean!"
               I told him he was right.
               Wocky-bocky again rubbed his tomahawk across my face, and
                  said—"Wink-ho—loo-boo!"
               Says I—"Mr. Wocky-bocky"—says I——"Wocky—I have thought so for years—and so's all
                  our family."
               He told me I must go the tent of the Strong-Heart—and eat raw dog.33
                   It don't agree with me. I prefer simple food. I prefer pork-pie—because
                  then I know what I'm eating.
                  
                     
                     33"Raw dog." While sojourning for a day in a camp of Sioux
                        Indians we were informed that the warriors of the tribe were accustomed to
                        eat raw dog to give them courage previous to going to battle. Artemus was
                        greatly amused with the information. When, in after years, he became weak
                        and languid, and was called upon to go to lecture, it was a favourite joke
                        with him to inquire, "Hingston, have you got any raw dog?"
                   But as raw dog was all they proposed to give to
                  me—I had to eat it or starve. So at the expiration of two days I seized a tin
                  plate and went to the chief's daughter—and I said to her in a silvery voice——in a
                  kind of German-silvery voice——I said—
               "Sweet child of the forest, the pale-face wants his dog."
               There was nothing but his paws! I had paused too long! Which reminds me that time
                  passes. A way which time has.
               I was told in my youth to seize opportunity. I once tried to seize one. He was
                  rich. He had diamonds on. As I seized him—he knocked me down. Since then I have
                  learned that he who seizes opportunity sees the penitentiary.
               
                  
               
               The Rocky Mountains.
            
            
               THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS.
               
                  
                     The view may recall to those who have seen it Mr. Bierstadt's celebrated
                        picture. Unfortunately for us, when we crossed, every inch of the ground was
                        covered with snow.

                     This picture is a continuation of the preceding view. In the course of
                        the journey, Artemus Ward passed a day among an encampment of Sioux, whose
                        numbers must have exceeded three thousand.
                  
               
               
               I take it for granted you have heard of these popular mountains. In America they
                  are regarded as a great success, and we all love dearly to talk about them. It is
                  a kind of weakness with us. I never knew but one American who hadn't
                  something—sometime—to say about the Rocky Mountains——and he was a deaf and dumb
                  man, who couldn't say anything about nothing.
               But these mountains—whose summits are snow-covered and icy all the year round—are
                  too grand to make fun of. I crossed them in the winter of '64—in a rough sleigh
                  drawn by four mules.
               This sparkling waterfall is the Laughing-Water alluded to by Mr. Longfellow in his
                  Indian poem—"Higher-Water." The water is higher up there.
            
            
               
               
                  
               
               The plains of Colorado.
               These are the dreary plains over which we rode for so many weary days. An
                  affecting incident occurred on these plains some time since, which I am sure you
                  will pardon me for introducing here.
               On a beautiful June morning—some sixteen years ago——
               (Music very loud till the scene is off.)
               
               
               
               
               
               
                  
                     THE PLAINS OF COLORADO.
                     This view and the one which follows it convey a faint idea of the barrenness
                        and desolation of a portion of the journey.
                  
               
               
               
                  
                     CROSSING THE PLAINS. AN EMIGRANT CARAVAN.
                     Nearly all the inhabitants of Salt Lake City have had to travel thither in
                        emigrant trains, undergoing countless hardships on the way. The skeletons of
                        animals and the remains of broken-down vehicles serve to mark out the
                        track.
                  
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               ——and she fainted on Reginald's breast!34
                  
               
               
                  
                  34"On Reginald's breast." At this part of the lecture Artemus
                     pretended to tell a story—the piano playing loudly all the time. He
                     continued his narration in excited dumb-show—his lips moving as though he
                     were speaking. For some minutes the audience indulged in unrestrained
                     laughter.
               
            
            
               
               The Prairie on Fire.
               
                  
               
               A prairie on fire is one of the wildest and grandest sights that can possibly be
                  imagined.
               These fires occur—of course—in the summer—when the grass is dry as tinder——and the
                  flames rush and roar over the prairie in a manner frightful to behold. They
                  usually burn better than mine is burning to-night. I try to make my prairie burn
                  regularly—and not disappoint the public——but it is not as high-principled as I
                     am.35
                  
               
               
                  
                  35"As high-principled as I am." The scene was a transparent
                     one—the light from behind so managed as to give the effect of the prairie on
                     fire. Artemus enjoyed the joke of letting the fire go out occasionally, and
                     then allowing it to relight itself.
               
               
                  
                     THE PRAIRIE ON FIRE.
                     Artemus Ward had an opportunity of seeing part of a Prairie on Fire, just as
                        he entered the State of Kansas. The grandeur of the scene made a very deep
                        impression upon him. He frequently alluded to it in conversation.
                  
               
               
            
            
               THE PRAIRIE ON FIRE.
               CONTINUED.
               
                  
                     The effect of the Prairie being on Fire was illustrated in the panorama
                        by means of a revolving cloth behind; a portion of the picture being
                        transparent.
                  
               
            
            
               
               BRIGHAM YOUNG AT HOME.
               
                  
                     This is, of course, a mere fancy sketch. It was roughly designed by
                        Artemus Ward himself. According to his own statement, made in a very playful
                        manner, it represents that which he saw on an afternoon passed with the
                        prophet at the palace.
                  
               
               Brigham Young at home.
               
                  
               
               The last picture I have to show you represents Mr. Brigham Young in the bosom of
                  his family. His family is large—and the olive branches around his table are in a
                  very tangled condition. He is more a father than any man I know. When at home——as
                  you here see him——he ought to be very happy with sixty wives to minister to his comforts—and twice sixty
                  children to soothe his distracted mind. Ah! my friends——what is home without a
                  family?
               What will become of Mormonism? We all know and admit it to be a hideous wrong——a
                  great immoral stain upon the 'scutcheon of the United States. My belief is that
                  its existence is dependent upon the life of Brigham Young. His administrative
                  ability holds the system together——his power of will maintains it as the faith of
                  a community. When he dies—Mormonism will die too. The men who are around him have
                  neither his talent nor his energy. By means of his strength it is held together.
                  When he falls—Mormonism will also fall to pieces.
               
                  36
                   That lion—you perceive—has a tail. It is a long one already. Like mine—it
                  is to be continued in our next.37
                  
               
               
                  
                  36"That Lion has a tail." The lion on a pedestal, as painted in
                     the panorama—its tail outstretched like that of the leonine adornment to
                     Northumberland House, was a pure piece of frolic on the part of the
                     entertainer. Brigham Young certainly adopts the lion as a Mormon emblem. A
                     beehive and a lion, suggestive of industry and strength, are the symbols of
                     the Mormons in Salt Lake City.
               
               
                  
                  37"To be continued in our next." To re-visit Utah, and to do
                     another and a better lecture about it was a favourite idea of Artemus Ward.
                     Another fancy that he had was to visit the stranger countries of the Eastern
                     world and find in some of them matter for a humorous lecture. While ill in
                     Utah, he read Mr. Layard's book on Nineveh, left behind at the hotel by a
                     traveller passing through Salt Lake. Mr. Layard's reference to the Yezedi,
                     or "Devil worshippers," took powerful hold on the imagination of the reader.
                     During our trip home across the plains he would often, sometimes in jest and
                     sometimes in earnest, chat about a trip to Asia to see the "Devil
                     worshippers." Naturally his inclinations were nomadic, and had a longer life
                     been granted to him I believe that he would have seen more of the surface of
                     this globe than even the generality of his countrymen see, much as they are
                     accustomed to travel. Within about the same distance from Portland in
                     England that his own birth-place is from Portland in Maine, his travels came
                     to an end. He died at Southampton. His great wish was for strength to return
                     to his home, that he might die with the face of his own mother bending over
                     him, and in the cottage where he was born.

                  The curtain fell for the last time on Wednesday, the 23rd of January, 1867.
                     Artemus Ward had to break off the lecture abruptly. He never lectured
                     again.
               
            
         
         
            
            APPENDIX.
            
            
               "THE TIMES" NOTICE.
               "EGYPTIAN HALL.—Before a large audience, comprising an extraordinary number of
                  literary celebrities, Mr. Artemus Ward, the noted American humorist, made his
                  first appearance as a public lecturer on Tuesday evening, the place selected for
                  the display of his quaint oratory being the room long tenanted by Mr. Arthur
                  Sketchley. His first entrance on the platform was the signal for loud and
                  continuous laughter and applause, denoting a degree of expectation which a nervous
                  man might have feared to encounter. However, his first sentences, and the way in
                  which they were received, amply sufficed to prove that his success was certain.
                  The dialect of Artemus bears a less evident mark of the Western World than that of
                  many American actors, who would fain merge their own peculiarities in the
                  delineation of English character; but his jokes are of that true Transatlantic
                  type, to which no nation beyond the limits of the States can offer any parallel.
                  These jokes he lets fall with an air of profound unconsciousness—we may almost say
                  melancholy—which is irresistibly droll, aided as it is by the effect of a figure
                  singularly gaunt and lean and a face to match. And he has found an audience by
                  whom his caustic humour is thoroughly appreciated. Not one of the odd pleasantries
                  slipped out with such imperturbable gravity misses its mark, and scarcely a minute
                  elapses at the end of which the sedate Artemus is not forced to pause till the
                  roar of mirth has subsided. There is certainly this foundation for an entente cordiale between the two countries calling
                  themselves Anglo Saxon, that the Englishman, puzzled by Yankee politics,
                  thoroughly relishes Yankee jokes, though they are not in the least like his own.
                  When two persons laugh together, they cannot hate each other much so long as the
                  laugh continues."
            
            
               
               NOTICE.
               The subject of Artemus Ward's lecture is a visit to the Mormons, copiously
                  illustrated by a series of moving pictures, not much to be commended as works of
                  art, but for the most part well enough executed to give (fidelity granted) a
                  notion of life as it is among the remarkable inhabitants of Utah. Nor let the
                  connoisseur, who detects the shortcomings of some of these pictures, fancy that he
                  has discovered a flaw in the armour of the doughty Artemus. That astute gentleman
                  knows their worth as well as anybody else, and while he ostensibly extols them, as
                  a showman is bound to do, he every now and then holds them up to ridicule in a
                  vein of the deepest irony. In one case a palpable error of perspective, by which a
                  man is made equal in size to a mountain, has been purposely committed, and the
                  shouts of laughter that arise as soon as the ridiculous picture appears is
                  tremendous. But there is no mirth in the face of Artemus; he seems even deaf to
                  the roar; and when he proceeds to the explanation of the landscape, he touches on
                  the ridiculous point in a slurring way that provokes a new explosion.
               The particulars of the lecture we need not describe. Many accounts of the Mormons,
                  more or less credible, and all authenticated, have been given by serious
                  historians, and Mr. W. H. Dixon, who has just returned from Utah to London, is
                  said to have brought with him new stores of solid information. But to most of us
                  Mormonism is still a mystery, and under those circumstances a lecturer who has
                  professedly visited a country for the sake more of picking up fun than of sifting
                  facts, and whose chief object it must be to make his narrative amusing, can
                  scarcely be accepted as an authority. We will, therefore, content ourselves with
                  stating that the lecture is entertaining to such a degree that to those who seek
                  amusement its brevity is its only fault; that it is utterly free from offence,
                  though the opportunities for offence given by the subject of Mormonism are
                  obviously numerous; and that it is interspersed, not only with irresistible jokes,
                  but with shrewd remarks, proving that Artemus Ward is a man of reflection, as well
                  as a consummate humorist."
            
            
               EGYPTIAN HALL, PICCADILLY.
               Every Night (except Saturday) at 8.
               SATURDAY MORNINGS AT 3.
               Artemus Ward AMONG THE MORMONS.
               During the Vacation the Hall has been carefully Swept out, and a new Door-Knob has
                  been added to the Door.
               MR. ARTEMUS WARD will call on the Citizens of London, at their residences, and
                  explain any jokes in his narrative which they may not understand.
               A person of long-established integrity will take excellent care of Bonnets,
                  Cloaks, etc., during the Entertainment; the Audience better leave their money,
                  however, with Mr. WARD; he will return it to them in a day or two, or invest it
                  for them in America as they may think best.
               
               Nobody must say that he likes the Lecture unless he wishes to be thought
                  eccentric; and nobody must say that he doesn't like it unless he really
                     is eccentric. (This requires thinking over, but it will amply
                  repay perusal.)
               The Panorama used to Illustrate Mr. WARD'S Narrative is rather worse than
                  Panoramas usually are.
               Mr. WARD will not be responsible for any debts of his own contracting.
            
            
               PROGRAMME.
               
                  I. APPEARANCE OF ARTEMUS WARD, Who will be greeted with applause. The
                     Stall-keeper is particularly 
                        requestd
                        requested
                      to attend to this. When quiet has been restored, the Lecturer will
                     present a rather frisky prologue, of about ten minutes in length, and of nearly
                     the same width. It perhaps isn't necessary to speak of the depth.
                  II. THE PICTURES COMMENCE HERE, the first one being a view of the California
                     Steamship. Large crowd of citizens on the wharf, who appear to be entirely
                     willing that ARTEMUS WARD shall go. "Bless you, Sir!" they say. "Don't hurry
                     about coming back. Stay away for years, if you want to!" It was very touching.
                     Disgraceful treatment of the passengers, who are obliged to go forward to smoke
                     pipes, while the steamer herself is allowed 2 Smoke Pipes amid-ships. At
                     Panama. A glance at Mexico.
                  III. The Land of Gold. Montgomery Street, San Francisco. The Gold Bricks.
                     Street Scenes. "The Orphan Cabman, or the Mule Driver's Step-Father." The
                     Chinese Theatre. Sixteen square-yards of a Chinese Comic Song.
                  IV. The Land of Silver. Virginia City, the wild young metropolis of the new
                     Silver State. Fortunes are made there in a day. There are instances on record
                     of young men going to this place without a shilling—poor and friendless—yet by
                     energy, intelligence, and a careful disregard to business, they have been
                     enabled to leave there, owing hundreds of pounds.
                  V. The Great Desert at Night. A dreary waste of Sand. The sand isn't worth
                     saving, however. Indians occupy yonder mountains. Little Injuns seen in the
                     distance trundling their war-hoops.
                  VI. A Bird's-eye View of Great Salt Lake City. With some entirely
                     descriptive talk.
                  VII. Main Street, East Side. The Salt Lake Hotel, which is conducted on
                     Temperance principles. The Landlord sells nothing stronger than salt
                     butter.
                  VIII. The Mormon Theatre. The Lady of Lyons was produced here a short time
                     since, but failed to satisfy a Mormon audience, on account of there being only
                     one Pauline in it. The play was revised at once. It was presented the next
                     night, with fifteen Paulines in the cast, and was a perfect success. All these
                     statements may be regarded as strictly true. Mr. WARD would not deceive an
                     infant.
                  
                  IX. Main Street, West Side. This being a view of Main Street, West Side, it
                     is naturally a view of the West Side of Main Street.
                  X. Brigham Young's Harem. Mr. Young is an indulgent father, and a numerous
                     husband. For further particulars call on Mr. WARD, at Egyptian Hall, any
                     Evening this Week. This paragraph is intended to blend business with
                     amusement.
                  XI. Heber C. Kimball's Harem. We have only to repeat here the pleasant
                     remarks above in regard to Brigham.
                  INTERMISSION OF FIVE MINUTES.
                  XII. The Tabernacle.
                  XIII. The Temple as it is.
                  XIV. The Temple as it is to be.
                  XV. The Great Salt Lake.
                  XVI. The Endowment House. The Mormon is initiated into the mysteries of his
                     faith here. The Mormon's religion is singular and his wives are plural.
                  XVII. Echo Canyon.
                  XVIII. The Desert, again. A more cheerful view. The Plains of Colorado. The
                     Colorado Mountains "might have been seen" in the distance, if the Artist had
                     painted 'em. But he is prejudiced against mountains, because his uncle once got
                     lost on one.
                  XIX. Brigham Young and his wives. The pretty girls of Utah mostly marry
                     Young.
                  XX. The Rocky Mountains.
                  XXI. The Plains of Nebraska.
                  XXII. The Prairie on Fire.
               
            
            
               
               RECOMMENDATIONS.
               
                  
                     TOTNES, Oct. 20th, 1866.
                     Mr. ARTEMUS WARD,
                  
                  My dear Sir,—My wife was dangerously unwell for over sixteen years. She was so
                     weak that she could not lift a teaspoon to her mouth. But in a fortunate moment
                     she commenced reading one of your lectures. She got better at once. She gained
                     strength so rapidly that she lifted the cottage piano quite a distance from the
                     floor, and then tipped it over on to her mother-in-law, with whom she had had
                     some little trouble. We like your lectures very much. Please send me a barrel
                     of them. If you should require any more recommendations, you can get any number
                     of them in this place, at two shillings each, the price I charge for this one,
                     and I trust you may be ever happy.
                  
                     I am, Sir,
                     Yours truly, and so is my wife.
                     R. SPRINGERS.
                  
               
               
                  An American correspondent of a distinguished journal in Yorkshire thus speaks
                     of Mr. WARD'S power as an Orator:—
                  "It was a grand scene, Mr. ARTEMUS WARD standing on the platform, talking; many
                     of the audience sleeping tranquilly in their seats; others, leaving the room
                     and not returning; others crying like a child at some of the jokes—all, all
                     formed a most impressive scene, and showed the powers of this remarkable
                     orator. And when he announced that he should never lecture in that town again,
                     the applause was absolutely deafening."
               
               
                  Doors open at Half-past Seven, commence at Eight.
                  Conclude at Half-past Nine.
                  EVERY EVENING EXCEPT SATURDAY.
                  SATURDAY AFTERNOONS at 3 p.m.
               
            
            
               ARTEMUS WARD, his Programme.
               Dodworth Hall, 806, Broadway.
               OPEN EVERY EVENING.

                  16.—The House of Mystery.

                  18.—Mid-Air Sepulture.
                  19.—A Nice Family Party at Brigham Young's.
               
               
               It requires a large number of Artists to produce this Entertainment. The casual
                  observer can form no idea of the quantity of unfettered genius that is soaring,
                  like a healthy Eagle, round this Hall in connection with this Entertainment. In
                  fact, the following gifted persons compose the
               
                  Official Bureau.
                  Secretary of the Exterior: Mr. E. P. Hingston.
                  Secretary of the Treasury: Herr Max Field, (Pupil of Signor Thomaso
                     Jacksoni.)
                  Mechanical Director and Professor of Carpentry: Signor G. Wilsoni.
                  Crankist: Mons. Aleck.
                  Assistant Crankist: Boy (orphan).

                  Hired Man: John.
                  Fighting Editor: Chevalier McArone.

                  Gas Man: Artemus Ward.
               
               This Entertainment will open with music. The Soldiers' Chorus from "Faust." First
                  time in this city.
               Next comes a jocund and discursive preamble, calculated to show what a good
                  education the Lecturer has.
               View the first is a sea-view.—Ariel navigation.—Normal school of whales in the
                  distance.—Isthmus of Panama.—Interesting interview with Old Panama himself, who
                  makes all the hats. Old Pan. is a likely sort of man.
               San Francisco.—City with a vigilant government.—Miners allowed to vote. Old
                  inhabitants so rich that they have legs with golden calves to them.
               Town in the Silver region.—Good quarters to be found there.—Playful population,
                  fond of high-low-jack and homicide.—Silver lying around loose.—Thefts of it termed
                  silver-guilt.
               The plains in Winter.—A wild Moor, like Othello.—Mountains in the distance forty
                  thousand miles above the level of the highest sea (Musiani's chest C included).—If
                  you don't believe this you can go there and measure them for
                  yourself.
               Mormodom, sometimes called the City of the Plain, but wrongly; the women are quite
                  pretty.—View of Old Poly Gamy's house, &c.
               The Salt Lake Hotel.—Stage just come in from its overland route and retreat from
                  the Indians.—Temperance house.—No bar nearer than Salt Lake sand-bars.—Miners in
                  shirts like Artemus Ward his Programme—they are read and will wash.
               Mormon Theatre, where Artemus Ward lectured.—Mormons like theatricals, and had
                  rather go to the Play-house than to the Work-house, any time.—Private boxes
                  reserved for the ears of Brother Brigham's wives.
               Intermission of Five Minutes.
               Territorial State-House.—Seat of the Legislature.—About as fair a collection as
                  that at Albany—and "we can't say no fairer than that."
               Residence of Brigham Young and his wives.—Two hundred souls with but a single
                  thought, Two hundred hearts that beat as one.
               
               Seraglio of Heber C. Kimball.—Home of the Queens of Heber.—No relatives of the
                  Queen of Sheba.—They are a nice gang of darlings.
               Mormon Tabernacle, where the men espouse Mormonism and the women espouse Brother
                  Brigham and his Elders as spiritual Physicians, convicted of bad doct'rin.
               Foundations of the Temple.—Beginning of a healthy little job.—Temple to enclose
                  all out-doors, and be paved with gold at a premium.
               The Temple when finished.—Mormon idea of a meeting-house.—N.B. It will be bigger,
                  probably, than Dodworth Hall.—One of the figures in the foreground is intended for
                  Heber C. Kimball.—You can see, by the expression of his back, that he is thinking
                  what a great man Joseph Smith was.
               The Great Salt Lake.—Water actually thick with salt—too saline to sail
                  in.—Mariners rocked on the bosom of this deep with rock salt.—The water isn't very
                  good to drink.
               House where Mormons are initiated.—Very secret and mysterious ceremonies.—Anybody
