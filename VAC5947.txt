               Chapter I.
               The Little Wanderer.
               IT was a cold, raw, cheerless night, in the month of December, 18â€”. The northeast
                  wind was howling fiercely through the streets, and the few scattering flakes of
                  snow which came down gave warning of the approach of a severe storm.
               Pedestrians were hurrying homewards with their faces muffled up as they breasted
                  the wintry blast, and the streets wore an aspect of desolation and solitude
                  unusual at that time of night, for the clock had just sounded the hour of
                  eight.
               A carriage stopped at the door of a large and elegant mansion in Twenty-third
                  street, from which a gentleman alighted, and in a moment after lifted out gently a
                  child of some eight or ten summers.
               
               He carried her, carefully wrapped up so as to protect her from the storm, to the
                  door, which had been opened by the servant in attendance, who had heard the
                  carriage stop; and as he placed her down he imprinted a kiss upon her forehead,
                  saying gaily, "Now, Clara, darling, I shall be here at eleven; that is quite late
                  enough for small young ladies to be out, and you must not keep the coachman
                  waiting when he comes; you know I don't like to keep James unnecessarily in the
                  storm."
               "Oh, I'll be ready, Uncle Charles," replied the child, as she bounded up stairs,
                  eager to join the gay and happy throng which she knew was assembled within, and
                  whose voices saluted her impatient ear while her companion was addressing her.
               Mr. Barton paused an instant on the steps as the door was closed upon him, and the
                  sounds of music and gay laughter reached him from within.
               Glancing upwards, he noticed that the snow was falling faster, and that the ground
                  was already white; then addressing the coachman, he said, "James, this will be a
                  very stormy night, and I think I would not take the horses out again. You can put
                  them up, and tell Mr. Hanson to send a coach for me at a quarter before eleven.
                  Why, what is this?" he said, half aloud, as he was descending the steps, for at
                  that moment his eye caught sight of a little figure standing up close to the
                  railing of the area, and holding on with both hands, as she stood on tiptoe, in
                  the effort to catch a glimpse of the scene within, for one of the curtains was
                  drawn up just far enough to allow any one on the outside to obtain a view of the
                  fairy forms flitting to and fro in the parlors, and now and then of a smiling face
                  of some happy child who came to the window to peep out into the storm.
               "What is this?" he repeated, approaching the child, who stood mute, and apparently
                  wrapt in her own thoughts; "what are you doing here at such a time and in such
                  weather? Why don't you go home? There, child, take that," and he tendered a half
                  dollar to the little girl, who had not moved from her position even when addressed
                  by him, for she had been so engrossed in watching the gay and happy children
                  within, she had not noticed him.
               Mr. Barton laid his hand gently on her shoulder, and then she turned her gaze full
                  upon him, and as the light from the parlor windows streamed upon her face he saw
                  that it was suffused with tears.
               "Poor thing," he said half aloud, and glancing down, he perceived that her dress
                  was sadly unsuited to the weather, and
                  that her feet were but scantily covered by a pair of tattered shoes.
               "Why don't you go home, my child?" said the kind-hearted gentleman, in gentle,
                  soothing tones; and again tendering the half dollar, he added, "Take this. Are you
                  not cold?"
               "Very cold," she said with chattering teeth, and as she spoke, she raised her
                  tattered frock and wiped away the tears which were streaming from her eyes.
               "Go home, like a good child, and don't stay here in such weather. See, it is
                  snowing now, and it will be a dreadful night. Where do you live?"
               "Oh, a great way from here," she replied, looking up in his face, and as she spoke
                  she shifted her feet uneasily, as if suffering from the cold, standing alternately
                  upon either foot.
               "How old are you? Pshaw, what nonsense to be talking to the child in such a
                  manner. Here, get in; come with me and I will give you some warm clothes at least.
                  Come, my child," and with gentle force he drew her from the railing which her
                  little half frozen fingers still mechanically clutched, and lifting her slender
                  form he bore her to the carriage, and drawing the door to with a loud slam, he
                  bade the coachman drive home.
               "Why were you crying, my child?" asked Mr. Barton, as the coach was driven rapidly
                  off.
               "Oh, sir, it made me feel so sad and so unhappy when I heard you call your little
                  girl darling. I could not help wishing I had some one to call me
                  darling;" and again her tears broke forth, and burying her face in her thin,
                  chilled hands, she wept bitterly, the hot tears forcing themselves through her
                  clasped fingers.
               Mr. Barton could offer no consolation to the houseless, homeless, friendless
                  child. Hers was a grief of the heart which words could not assuage, and throwing
                  himself back in his seat he bent his gaze upon his shivering, weeping companion,
                  and gave way to the thoughts which such a scene and such an incident would be
                  likely to call up in the heart of a feeling man.
               "Here we are," he said, aroused from his reverie by the stopping of the carriage
                  in front of his residence. "You are cold and hungry, I dare say."
               "Very, sir," she said, wiping her eyes, and vainly endeavoring to draw her scanty
                  garment closer around her shivering person, as if to gather warmth.
               Mr. Barton alighted, and as the child in obedience to his request followed him, he
                  took her gently in his arms and bore her
                  to the door, which was promptly opened in obedience to his summons.
               "Maria," he said to the servant who had let him in, "where is Mrs. Edson?"
               "Up in her own room, sir."
               "Tell her to come into the parlor." And as Maria cast a glance which had something
                  of a sneer in it upon the little form which Mr. Barton still bore in his arms, he
                  repeated the order in a more imperative tone, and she started to obey the mandate
                  with a contemptuous toss of the head, for had she not a warm, comfortable home,
                  and had she not a right to despise the poor and suffering?
               Bearing his still half inanimate burden, Mr. Barton entered the elegantly
                  furnished parlor, and pushing a large, soft cushioned arm-chair towards the
                  cheerful fire, he placed his new-found charge tenderly within it, and now for the
                  first time scanned carefully her face. She could not have been more than six or
                  eight years of age, but her wan, hollow face, the sad seal left by want and
                  suffering, caused her to look much older. Her eyes were large, and of a deep blue,
                  fringed by lids of uncommon length, and their expression was one of tenderness and
                  firmness most strangely combined.
               Her hair, which was of a deep, rich brown, curled naturallyâ€”so naturally, indeed,
                  it would have puzzled the most accomplished friseur to keep it straight, though it
                  was now tangled and matted, and hung about her face and neck in disordered
                  masses.
               Her head was uncovered, and her dress, of the poorest materials, was not only
                  scanty in quantity, but sadly torn and defaced. She was, as she lay there before
                  the cheerful fire, a fit subject indeed for the charity which had prompted Mr.
                  Barton to relieve her want and suffering.
               The genial warmth of the fire soon had its effect upon the chilled and benumbed
                  child, and even while Mr. Barton sat gazing upon her with looks of compassion and
                  with moistened eyes, her head sank heavily on one side, and yielding to the
                  weariness against which it was evident she could no longer bear up, she sank into
                  a profound sleep.
               "What is it, Charles?" said Mrs. Edson, entering the room unperceived, for Mr.
                  Barton was so engrossed in his own thoughts and in watching his new-found charge,
                  he had not noticed her presence until she laid her hand upon his shoulder.
               As he started under her touch and arose, his eyes turned to the chair in front of
                  the fire, and then first perceiving the unconscious occupant, she approached proached, and bending over her, gazed
                  long and silently upon the thin, attenuated face of the sleeper, and turning to
                  her brother, for such was the relation in which Mr. Barton stood to her, she
                  stretched out her hand to him, and as the tears gathered in her eyes she said in a
                  gentle voice, as if fearful of awakening the child, "She is a frail, delicate
                  little thing, to be out in such weather and in such garments. You did right,
                  Charles. You always do," she added with energy, gazing with looks of deep
                  affection in the face of her much-loved brother.
               "Where did you find her, Charles?" queried Mrs. Edson, as she crossed the room and
                  rang the bell to summon a servant.
               Mr. Barton commenced to narrate the accidental meeting at the house where he had
                  just left Clara, and was interrupted by the entrance of Maria, to whom Mrs. Edson
                  gave orders to prepare the bath, and to lay out some of Clara's clothing.
               "Now, go on, Charles," she said, turning to her brother, and Mr. Barton pursued
                  his narrative.
               "Poor little suffered. What can be done for her?"
               "Oh, we'll think of that to-morrow, Bessy. Tonight let her have rest and
                  foodâ€”to-morrow I will try and find out more about her. She looks like an
                  uncommonly interesting child, and I think her instincts are above her position.
                  She spoke as if nature had planted her in her appropriate sphere, and some
                  untoward accident or chance had transplanted her to a foreign soil. She has the
                  loveliest blue eyes you ever gazed upon, and she speaks so gently, but
                  uncomplainingly."
               "The bath is ready, ma'am," said the servant, entering, and interrupting the
                  conversation. "Shan't I get some supper, too?"
               "Yes, Maria; tell the cook to warm something nice and make a cup of tea." Let her
                  sleep a little longer," she said, turning to her brother. "I will go and see that
                  everything is ready, and when I come back it will be time enough to waken
                  her."
               Mrs. Edson left the room to perform her good offices, and Mr. Barton, throwing
                  himself upon a sofa, lay gazing upon the sleeping child, wondering in his own mind
                  what this adventure might bring forth.
               His thoughts were interrupted by a movement of the child. Her eyes were half
                  unclosed, and she lay looking steadily, but evidently more than half
                  unconsciously, into the fire, as if lost in a dream. Suddenly she started to an
                  upright position, and rubbing her eyes as
                  if to assure herself that she was not asleep, she gazed about with an air of
                  bewildered surprise.
               For an instant this continued, and it seemed as if she was striving to recall
                  something to her wandering mind, when her eye caught sight of Mr. Barton, who was
                  still reclining on the sofa, and who was watching her looks and movements with
                  eager interest.
               At sight of him an expression of joy, gratitude, and happiness crossed her face,
                  and springing forward she sank on her knee by his side, and grasping his hand,
                  which hung listlessly down, she covered it with kisses, while the tears rained
                  down her pale face.
               "Get up, child; get up," said the kind-hearted man, as he sprang up himself and
                  hastily dashed away a tear which had gathered upon his lids. "Get up, my
                  child."
               "Oh, you are so good, and so kind, and so"â€”â€”
               What she would have said was broken off by the opening of the door, and the
                  entrance of Mrs. Edson, who, approaching, took the unresisting hand of the little
                  stranger in one of her own, and placing the other on her head, gazed earnestly in
                  her face for an instant, peering into her deep blue eyes as if she would search
                  her very soul.
               But the child bore the look unflinchingly, looking upwards with such an air of
                  gratitude and meekness as could proceed only from truth and sincerity, and Mrs.
                  Edson, drawing a long breath, said, as if satisfied in her own mind, "I think you
                  will be a good girl."
               "I know I will try to be," replied the child, and brother and sister exchanged
                  glances as she spoke.
               "You are cold and hungry, I am sure," said Mrs. Edson.
               "I was very cold, but I ain't now; and I'm so used to being hungry, I don't mind
                  it so much as I once did."
               "What is your name," inquired Mr. Barton.
               "Dora Layton they call me, but it ain't my name, I know."
               "Indeed; and how do you know that?"
               "Because Mrs. Layton said it wasn't."
               "Well, never mind that now. Come with me, Dora, and I will give you some warm
                  clothes; we'll hear more about you by and by"â€”and taking her unresisting hand,
                  Mrs. Edson led the child from the room, leaving Mr. Barton alone.
               He took up a book, but he could not read, for the large blue eyes and pale face of
                  the little stranger haunted him; and
                  throwing it down, he paced the floor with hurried and uneven steps, inwardly
                  wondering what consequences might result from his evening's adventure.
            
            
               Chapter II.
               The Philanthropist.
               HOW long Mr. Barton had remained alone he knew not, but he was aroused from the
                  reverie into which he had fallen, by the entrance of the servant, who had been
                  directed to summon him to the basement.
               On descending, he found a table nicely spread, and seated before it was Dora; but
                  the tempting viands before her had been untouched, while she sat there weeping and
                  sobbing as if her very heart would break, but utterly unable to utter one
                  word.
               "I can't imagine what is the matter with this child," said Mrs. Edson half
                  soothingly, turning to her brother as he entered the room. "She has not tasted a
                  mouthful, and I can't induce her to touch anything, though I am sure, to judge
                  from her looks, she must be half famished.
               Mr. Barton turned to his young protÃ©gÃ©e, if indeed deed she might already be thus designated, and he
                  at once, with the instinct of a sensitive nature, comprehended the truth. Her
                  heart was too full for words, and even the pangs of hunger had been conquered by
                  the feelings of gratitude which oppressed her. In truth he had judged rightly. Her
                  little heart was overflowing with feelings implanted there by nature, but which
                  until now had never been called into action.
               The novelty of her present positionâ€”the change from the sadness and sorrow of the
                  few hours pastâ€”the poverty and misery which had been her lotâ€”the comfort and
                  happiness which surrounded her nowâ€”the dreary past and the cheerful present were
                  in her mind and thoughts; and young as she was, the dreary, desolate future was
                  there, too, before her.
               These were the feelings which, child though she was, arose in her heart, and
                  deprived her of all power over herself.
               "Come, my darling," said Mr. Barton, tenderly approaching her, and imprinting a
                  kiss upon her forehead, "don't cry so; try and eatâ€”I know you need it. Do, my
                  little darling; you will be sick if you do not eat."
               The change that came over the child's face at the utterance of these words by Mr.
                  Barton was so sudden and so great as to be almost miraculous. At the sound of the
                  word "darling" the tears actually seemed to force themselves back; and when on his
                  repeating the word she felt the kiss of sympathy, perhaps of affection, on her
                  brow, nature re-asserted her sway, and springing from her seat she fairly threw
                  herself around Mr. Barton's neck, and sobbed, "Oh, call me that again; call me
                  darling once more," and reclining her head upon his willing shoulder she lay so
                  quiet, so breathless, Mr. Barton actually turned to see if she had not
                  fainted.
               But as he looked into her face, there was such an expression of serene happiness,
                  of trust and hope, he could not repress the tears which forced themselves to his
                  eyes, and clasping her to his heart with the warmth of an earnest nature, he said,
                  scarce knowing how or why he did so, "My darling."
               Sliding from his arms, which had so closely clasped her, she stood by his side for
                  an instant, and looking up in his face with the ingenuous expression of youthful
                  trust and love, she said, with an earnestness far beyond her years, "Oh, am I your
                  darling? May I love you, and will you love me? Oh, I will be so good if you
                  will."
               
               Mr. Barton looked at his sister, but she stood pale and mute; her lips were fairly
                  quivering with emotion, and a tremor ran through her frame. And who could blame
                  her, for had not she a darling too?
               She could not speakâ€”she dared not trust herself to make the effort; but forcing a
                  smile, which her brother rightly interpreted, he seized Dora in his arms, and
                  fairly forcing her into her chair by the table, he bade her eat.
               Hastily wiping her eyes, she looked upon her benefactors with a gleam of intense
                  affection and gratitude, and strove to comply with their kind wishes.
               But she could not eatâ€”and pushing the plate from her, she leaned her head upon the
                  table, and gave way to another burst of tears.
               "Oh, I am too happy to eat, Sir. I cannot now; please, don't make me, for I know
                  it would choke me. Please, ma'am, don't ask me any more," she said, appealingly,
                  to Mrs. Edson.
               "Well, Dora, you need not try," said Mrs. Edson, rightly divining the cause. "By
                  and by, perhaps, you will feel better. Come, stand up and let my brother see you;"
                  and Dora, obedient to the mandate, left her seat and stood before her benefactors.
                  The bath had cleansed her from the dirt which had accumulated perhaps for weeks,
                  and she was clad from head to foot in clothes belonging to Clara.
               Mr. Barton gazed at her for a full minute without a word; he scanned her from head
                  to foot, and at length his eyes were again rivetted on her large lustrous orbs,
                  now beaming with animation. True, her cheeks were pale and wan, but they were
                  nearly shaded by the masses of rich auburn hair which floated in uncontrolled
                  confusion about her head and neck.
               Her form was very slender, but it had evidently been attenuated by want and
                  suffering; yet with all, and through all, there was an air about her, an
                  appearance of instinctive nobleness, which might have attracted a less acute
                  observer than Mr. Barton. He was evidently pleased with the result of his
                  observations, for he turned from Dora to his sister, and thanked her with a smile
                  which she well knew how to interpret.
               "Come, Dora," he said, drawing a chair close to the table, and motioning her again
                  to her own seat, while Mrs. Edson seated herself opposite the little stranger,
                  "tell us something about yourself. You say your name is not Layton. What is
                  it?"
               "I don't know, Sir. I only know that Mrs.
                  Layton has told me I was not her child; and," she added with a shudder, "I am glad
                  I am not."
               "Indeed; and why?" queried Mr. Barton, turning to his sister with a look which
                  seemed to ask, "Do you not think she is an extraordinary child?"
               "Because she is a bad, wicked woman," replied Dora promptly. "She beats me and
                  gets tipsy, and sometimes she leaves me alone for days together."
               "And where do you live?"
               "Over in Cross street. But she ain't there now, I know."
               "What do you mean? Where is she?"
               "I don't know, indeed, where she is, but I am sure she is not at home. She hasn't
                  been home these four days."
               "And what have you been doing while she was away?"
               "Oh, what I have often done before. I have been begging from door to door."
               "And where have you slept?"
               "I always went home at night; but to-night when I went there, the people in the
                  house wouldn't let me go in. They said I had no business there as I didn't belong
                  to anybody, and that Mrs. Layton wouldn't ever come back."
               "Well, you shan't go there to-night, that's very certain," said Mr. Barton with
                  decided emphasis. "I will go down to-morrow and see if I can learn anything about
                  her."
               Mr. Barton and his sister continued their questions to Dora, until, in the
                  excitement of the conversation, she forgot her past troubles, and before she was
                  aware of it, she had fallen upon the food set before her with a voracity which
                  brought looks of pleasure to the generous couple, who sat watching her with
                  glances of unalloyed pleasure, for they felt that she was a brand which Providence
                  had enabled them to snatch from the burning.
               Little, indeed, could she tell of herselfâ€”of the past, or of her position. She
                  could only say that she had been brought up in poverty, associated with vice and
                  crime, and been brought into hourly contact with infamy and debauchery. But
                  through all, it was evident that the instincts of a pure and gentle nature had
                  carried her uncontaminated, and her own heart had taught her to distinguish the
                  evil from the good.
               It was this instinct of a true and noble heart which had filled her with such
                  gratitude to him who had rescued her from present suffering, and it was this
                  instinct which had caused the young heart
                  to beat with a new, but exquisite feeling, when her generous benefactor had
                  uttered that simple word which opened the very well-spring of her nature, and the
                  true emotions of her pure and gentle mind for the first time found free vent.
               No wonder she could not eatâ€”no wonder she could only weep from very excess of
                  joy.
               "Well, Dora, we will take good care of you to-night, and to-morrow we will see
                  what we can do for you," repeated Mr. Barton in kindly tones, while Dora was
                  engaged in devouring the first substantial meal she had probably ever eaten.
               "Again the tears started to Dora's eyes; but hastily repressing them, she finished
                  her meal, and rising from her chair, she approached Mr. Barton, and taking his
                  hand in both her own, pressed it to her heart, and said, as she looked into his
                  face with eyes which fairly danced with happiness, "I am very happy and very
                  grateful, sir."
               "I know you will be a good girl," said Mrs. Edson, with an emphasis much stronger
                  than that with which she had before said, "I think you will."
               "Thank you, ma'am; I will be as good as I know how," said Dora; "and may I be your
                  darling, too?"
               "Yes," said Mrs. Edson, bursting into tears, for the thoughts of her absent one
                  were crowding upon her heart. "You shall be, for I know you will be;" and for the
                  first time in her memory Dora was clasped to the warm and loving heart of woman;
                  and during the short moment in which her little head reposed upon that gentle
                  bosom, a new world seemed to open before herâ€”a new existence had dawned.
               "Now, Dora, Maria will take you to a nice warm bed. Go to sleep, and in the
                  morning we will see more about you;" and gently imprinting a kiss upon the pale
                  forehead of the child, she released her from the embrace in which she had been
                  clasped, and left the room to give directions to Maria as to the comfort of the
                  stranger thus singularly thrown upon their charity and benevolence.
               "Am I your darling?" she said, approaching Mr. Barton, who had stood
                  watching the movements of his sister with emotions of pleasure, and seizing his
                  hand, she gazed into his face with an expression of such mute entreaty he could
                  not, if he would, have resisted the impulse which led him to clasp her to his
                  heart, and imprinting a fervent kiss upon her brow, to exclaim, "Yes, you are my
                  darling; for I feel that God has given you to me."
               
               "Come, Clara, I want to show you something," said Mr. Barton to his niece, as she divested
                  herself of her outer garments on her return from the party. "But first I want to
                  tell you something." And he narrated to the loving, wondering child how, when he
                  had left her at the party, he had found wandering in the streets a little ragged,
                  shivering girl, who was watching the windows of the parlor, whence the sounds of
                  music, gaiety, and children's happy voices reached her lonely heart.
               "And why didn't you bring her home and give her some of my nice clothes? I am sure
                  I should have been glad if you had."
               "Poor little thing," said Uncle Charles, apparently not noticing her remark, "she
                  was so cold and shivering, and she seemed to be looking so wistfully into the
                  windows where you were. No doubt she was hungry as well as cold."
               "Why didn't you bring her home, I say, Uncle Charles?" exclaimed Clara, with an
                  expression in which tears and smiles struggled for the mastery "I say, why didn't
                  you bring her home? I am sure I would, if I had seen her."
               "And she looked so pale, and so desolate, and so unhappy, and she said she had no
                  home nor friends, and was cold and hungry."
               "Why didn't you bring her home, Uncle Charles les?" repeated Clara, the tears
                  gathering in her soft eyes. "Oh, why didn't you? Poor little thing, and to think
                  of her standing there in the cold and snow while we were so warm, and comfortable,
                  and happy inside."
               "Come with me, Clara," and Mr. Barton led his niece, whose eyes were half blinded
                  with the tears drawn forth by his brief narrative, to which her gentle heart and
                  vivid imagination had lent a terrible reality, to an upper chamber, where, nestled
                  in the downy bed, with nothing visible but her auburn curls and her pale wan face,
                  lay Dora, buried in the blissful unconsciousness of sleep.
               "Oh, you are so good, Uncle Charles," said Clara, comprehending the whole at a
                  glance; and as she threw herself sobbing into his open arms, he kissed her
                  fervently, and exclaimed, "And you are my own darling, too."
               Sliding from his arms, Clara softly approached the couch of the sleeper, and
                  drawing the clothes gently down, gazed long and earnestly in the face of the
                  unconscious stranger; and as if satisfied with the scrutiny, turned to her Uncle
                  and said in low tones, "I think I shall love her, Uncle Charles."
            
            
               
               Chapter III.
               Brother and Sister.
               "DEATH FROM INTEMPERANCE AND EXPOSURE.â€”An inquest was held yesterday upon the body
                  of Mary Layton, a dissipated Irishwoman who was brought to the Tombs the day
                  previous in a state of the grossest intoxication, and who was found dead in the
                  cell on the following morning. The deceased had lived in a state of destitution in
                  Cross street, and was well known in that neighborhood as a very intemperate woman.
                  Verdict accordingly."
               Such was the announcement which Mr. Barton read on the morning following his
                  introduction to the reader, while waiting in the basement for his sister and his
                  breakfast.
               He laid the paper down, with something like a sigh, and leaning his head upon his
                  hands, gave way to his thoughts. This was undoubtedly Dora's protector, if indeed
                  she could be called a protector, who had brought her up in ignorance, and in
                  hourly contact with sin and infamy in its worst and most debasing forms.
               But perhaps she had done the best she could, and had shared with her the best she
                  had, and had suffered, if not encouraged, her to learn all that she knew. But she
                  was dead, and Dora was, in the most terrible sense of the word, alone!
               What was he to do with her?â€”he, a bachelor, with no prospect or thought of
                  changing his position. How could he ask Mrs. Edson to receive her into the house,
                  to give a home to a houseless wanderer, of whom nothing was known, save that she
                  was homeless and friendless? True, it was his house, for Mrs. Edson was a widow,
                  left in impoverished circumstances by a dissipated husband, and he had given her a
                  home, as he loved her truly and devotedly, and, to all outward appearance, she
                  returned his affection with all the energy of a sister's love, strengthened by the
                  most boundless gratitude; for she had lived long enough to know that every brother
                  does not recognise the claim which a sister has upon his kindness, love and
                  protection.
               But, even under these circumstances, how could he venture to bring such a
                  companion for Clara? How could he ask her
                  to permit it, and did he wish it himself? He asked himself this question several
                  times, and each time it was answered by a glance of the deep blue eyes and the
                  pale, thin face which looked so imploringly upon him.
               He had not yet answered the question to his own satisfaction, when Mrs. Edson
                  entered the apartment, and, after the usual greetings of the morning, he handed
                  the paper to her, and pointed to the paragraph which heads this chapter.
               "I am glad of it," she said, "for the poor child's sake. It is evident that the
                  woman was as unfit to live as she was to die, but I feel that it is all for the
                  best. Now we won't have any difficulty about Dora."
               "We," mentally echoed her brother, and he looked at his sister with affection
                  beaming in his eyes.
               "I don't exactly understand you," he said, equivocating.
               "Yes you do, perfectly, Charles. You know as well as I do, that nothing would
                  induce you to part with that child now, and I don't think I should let her go
                  willingly. Rely upon it, brother, there has been something more than chance or
                  accident in your finding her as you did. She don't look as if she was intended to
                  go through the thorns and briars which beset the path of poverty in our city. One
                  glance in those large, deep blue eyes, shows a soul far above the bitter, squalid,
                  poverty-stricken wretch of last nightâ€”for my part, I think it would be a rebellion
                  against the decrees of Providence to part with herâ€”at all events, not until you
                  have tried her. I don't think I am deceived," and Mrs. Edson spoke as if she did
                  not wish, nor mean to be deceived.
               "What shall we do with her?" said Mr. Barton, fidgetting upon his chair, and
                  tapping restlessly upon the tableâ€”"What shall we do with her? What will"â€”â€”and he
                  colored as he left his sentence unfinished.
               "What will Mrs. Grundy say?" replied his sister with a meaning smile. "That's what
                  you were going to ask; but surely, Charles, you need not fear even Mrs. Grundy's
                  tongueâ€”you, honored, respected, and esteemed throughout the cityâ€”you, known as one
                  whose purse is as open to the call of charity as his heart, and whose heart is
                  never closed against an appeal from such a sourceâ€”what will the world say? Let
                  them say what they will, Charles."
               "But sister"â€”â€”
               
               "No buts, brother. If you won't, by your leaveâ€”for your know,
                  Charles, I live on your kindnessâ€”I will. May I?"
               "No, Bessyâ€”she belongs to me; you have one now."
               "Yes, but I think we can manage to provide for another," and she emphasised the we
                  very energetically.
               "You shall"â€”â€”
               "Oh, mother!" exclaimed Clara, bounding into the room with a face radiant with
                  happiness, and interrupting the sentence which her mother had just commenced,
                  "What a darling little girl that is upstairs."
               "Why, my child, have you awakened her already?"
               "Oh, no, mother; I just peeped in to see if she was asleep, and she was laying
                  there with her hands clasped over her eyes, and crying as if her heart was
                  breaking; so I went in, and we've had a real nice talkâ€”and oh! mother, oh! Uncle
                  Charles, she is such a nice girl, and I do like her so much."
               "You do; eh, pussy," said her uncle, patting her cheek, for she was already in her
                  accustomed seat on his knee. "But you know she must go away by and by. I am
                  thinking of taking her to the Juvenile Asylum."
               "What for, Uncle? I am sure you would love her if you could only hear her talk as
                  I did just now. Oh, Uncle, when she put her little thin arms around my neck and
                  cried so, I wanted to tell her how much I loved her."
               "And why did you not?" he queried.
               "Well, I will now, I promise you," she said, and flying out of the room before
                  they could check her, in an instant she was up stairs, by the bedside of the
                  weeping, but happy Dora; and with arms around each others necks they mingled their
                  tears, while Clara, in the fulness of her childish heart, poured out expressions
                  of the new-born love she cherished for the friendless little stranger.
               "Come, little folks, out of that," exclaimed Mr. Barton, who had silently opened
                  the door, and was peering in upon this singular scene. "Come, we are waiting for
                  you down stairs. Dora, darling," he continued, approaching the bed, "how do you
                  find yourself now? Had a nice nap, eh?" and he looked into her face, now flushed
                  with excitement, and her large eyes, which were beaming with exquisite
                  happiness.
               "Oh, I am so happy, sir," she said, stretching out her clasped hands towards her benefactor, which he
                  seized, and pressed warmly.
               Come, up with you. Clara, you can help her to fix herself. Hurry, for I must be
                  off, and I want to see how she looks before I go down town."
               But this scene has been already prolonged too much.
               It was in this wise Dora Layton became Dora Barton, for that gentleman, very soon
                  after his first meeting with the homeless stranger, had become so warmly attached
                  to her, he had given her not only a home, but his name, having regularly adopted
                  her as his own, though without consummating his kindness by any legal form.
               And Mrs. Grundy had her say for a time, and many were the hints and innuendoes
                  thrown out by the gossips, who had nothing to do but to manage the affairs of
                  their neighbors and acquaintances.
               But he lived down all; and when it was discovered that the rich Mr. Barton had
                  actually adopted the friendless orphan, their conduct underwent an entire change;
                  and she who had been the subject of their scornful remarks, soon became the object
                  of their fulsome adulation. And there we will leave her for a time, and ask the
                  reader to go back a few years.
            
            
               Chapter IV.
               Going Back a Few Years.
               DR. THORNTON, a practitioner whose diploma as a physician had not yet attained a
                  color by which to mark its age, was seated in the basement of the boarding-house
                  in Houston street, which formed at once his sleeping room and office.
               With his heels elevated at the angle of a thorough-bred American, and with a segar
                  in his mouth, from which he drew long and lazy whiffs, he was engrossed in the
                  perusal of a volume of medical jurisprudence then recently published.
               The only movements he made were to shift his legs occasionally as they crossed,
                  and to knock off with his little finger the ashes which gathered on the end of his
                  Havana.
               A rap at the door elicited from him a short "come in," and without changing his
                  posture, he turned his face so as to catch a glimpse of the visitor without the
                  necessity of other motion.
               
               "Doctor, won't you come around to mother's," said the intruder, a ragged, little
                  boy who had seen some twelve or fourteen summers, and as he spoke he doffed his
                  cap, which was saturated with the rain, for it was pouring down in torrents.
                  "There's a woman there very sick, and mother says if you don't come right away
                  she's afraid she'll die."
               "What's the matter, do you know?" queried the doctor, as he let himself down from
                  his recumbent position, and stood before the fire in such close proximity as would
                  have endangered the tails of his coat if they had not been widely drawn apart, so
                  as to give to his person the unobstructed benefit of the heat. "What's the matter,
                  I say?"
               "I dun'no."
               "Is she young or old?"
               "Oh, there's two on em, but I dun'no which on 'em is the sick one. I know, mother
                  said you'd better come at once."
               "Well, I'll be there directly," and as he spoke the doctor dropped his coat tails,
                  threw his segar into the fire, and with ill-concealed reluctance commenced his
                  preparations for facing the storm.
               His overcoat was buttoned up with deliberation, as if to prolong the comfort of
                  his own cheerful fire as long as possible; the slouched hat was put on and taken
                  off half a dozen times; and at length with one mighty effort, he seized an
                  umbrella which stood in the corner, and dashed out into the street.
               "Mother's" was not far off, as he well knew, for the little messenger, who was an
                  errand boy, and the son of the woman who performed occasionally the general
                  housework of the family who occupied the house in which he was now a boarder, had
                  been there so frequently as to be quite well known to the doctor.
               A hurried walk of a few minutes brought him to the house, an old-fashioned two
                  story and attic dwelling in Greene street, not many blocks from Dr. Thornton's
                  domicile.
               His hurried ring at the door was answered by the occupant in person, a thin,
                  vinegar-faced woman, with a voice which once heard could never be mistaken or
                  forgotten.
               "Oh! doctor, it's you, is it? Come in," she said, in a hoarse whisper, pointing
                  significantly to the head of the stairs, as if to caution him against a too free
                  use of his tongue; and having ushered him into the parlor, she closed the door,
                  and before he had time to ask any questions, said in a very mysterious tone:
               
               "They're very nice people, doctorâ€”I'm sure they are; they only came into the house
                  a few days ago, and took the whole second story without asking any questions, and,
                  doctor, they've got money, too," and she said this by way of consolation to the
                  doctor, who had paid many calls at the house to herself, and some of its inmates,
                  without the most remote hope or prospect of ever receiving any compensation. "They
                  paid me a month in advance, and they pay for everything they get."
               "And, what is the matter?" queried the doctor, as if he had not heard what his
                  interesting friend had said concerning the probable wealth of his patient. "It is
                  an awful night to be out in."
               "Yes, I know it is, but," and bending her mouth close to the doctor's ear, for she
                  overtopped him by nearly a head, she whispered a few words.
               "Oh! Well, you had better let them know that I am here."
               "Certain, doctorâ€”certain. I'm real glad, for your sake, they've got money, doctor,
                  for you know"â€”â€”
               "Never mind the money now, Mrs. Buffumâ€”some other time will do for that. Please
                  inform them that I am here, and ask if I shall come up."
               "Certain, doctor, certain," and screwing her face into what was meant for a
                  pleasant smile, Mrs. Buffum stole out of the room as if she was treading on
                  eggs.
               Doctor Thornton had barely time to throw off his wet overcoat and to divest
                  himself of his overshoes and shawl, before Mrs. Buffum reappeared, and with a look
                  meant to be very gracious, beckoned him to go up stairs.
               "Front room, doctorâ€”that's their parlor. You'll find the old lady thereâ€”a real
                  lady, too, I know, doctor," and she stood at the foot of the stairs, following the
                  receding form of the doctor with her eyes, until he disappeared at the turn of the
                  landing.
               A gentle tap at the door of the room designated, brought the occupant to answer
                  his summons, and, as he entered with a bow, the door was closed gently behind him,
                  and locked.
               Doctor Thornton found himself face to face with a lady of advanced years, but of
                  the most commanding and imposing mien and manner. Every look and motion bespoke
                  the lady; and, as she motioned him to a seat, and drew a chair close to his side,
                  he heard the faint moans of a female in distress proceeding from the adjoining
                  room.
               He started involuntarily from his seat, and, without out knowing what prompted him, except, perhaps, his
                  professional instinct, which led him to respond instantly to the summons of
                  distress, he arose as if to proceed to the relief of the sufferer, but his
                  companion gently laid her hand upon his arm, and bowed him again to his seat.
               "My daughter and myself, doctor, were on the road to the West to meet her husband,
                  who has been sick there for some time, when she was seized with her present
                  illness. She is very young for her situation, doctor, but she was married against,
                  and without my consent, and many years before I thought she ought to have taken
                  such a step. But she is my daughter, my only child, and I have forgiven her. We
                  are very anxious to be on the road for the West, and your exertions in our behalf
                  shall not go unrequited. Although you find us in this house, and in these
                  circumstances, I am abundantly able to"â€”â€”
               "Madam, I never ask any questions when I am sent for," said Dr. Thornton,
                  interrupting her with a bow. "May I see my patient at once, for her moans sound
                  very painfully on my ear."
               "Certainly, doctor," and she ushered the physician into the back-room where her
                  daughter lay; but the doctor noticed, as she approached the door, that an
                  expression of pain, amounting almost to anguish, crossed her features. It was,
                  however, quickly subdued, and gave place to one of the most terrible and chilling
                  sternness.
               
               "A fine girl, madam," said the doctor, as he placed the new-born infant in the
                  ready arms of the elderly lady, who took it with an expression in which rage,
                  hate, and mortification were most strangely blended. But, as she turned and caught
                  sight of her suffering daughter, who lay there pale and inanimate as marble, her
                  features softened, and something like a glance of compassion was bestowed upon
                  her, but there was no affection in that look.
               It was broad daylight when Dr. Thornton started on his return homewards, and so
                  engrossed was he in his own thoughts, he did not even notice the pelting of the
                  storm which had continued throughout the night in unabated fury. In truth, the
                  vision of suffering loveliness which he had just left, haunted him continually.
                  Those large, liquid blue eyes, which looked so imploringly on him, and which, when
                  turned to her mother, wore such a strange expression of fear, were ever before
                  him; and, by the time he reached his office, he had fully concluded cluded that he had never seen any one half so
                  lovely as his patient, certainly no one in whom he had taken so deep an
                  interest.
               Daily his visits were continued, and daily his patient continued to improve. By
                  her, he was ever received with an expression of the most undisguised pleasure, and
                  by the mother, with the same air of frigid coldness which had from the first
                  interview marked her intercourse with him.
               Of his patient and her mother he knew absolutely nothing, for he had not felt at
                  liberty to ask any questions, and indeed, had he been so inclined, he would have
                  learned nothing, for the elderly lady never allowed him the opportunity of being
                  alone with his patient a single instant, and he would as soon have attempted to
                  draw warmth from an iceberg, as to question her.
               He knew only that Mrs. Rushmore was the name of the mother, and that the
                  daughter's name was Ellen.
               One morning, in the fifth week of his professional visitations, he called as
                  usual, and was met by Mrs. Buffum, who, in a manner which was unwontedly
                  mysterious, even for her, beckoned him into the parlor, and closing the door,
                  without any preface astounded him by saying:
               "No need, doctorâ€”they've gone."
               "Gone!" echoed Dr. Thornton, with an air of bewilderment and ill-concealed
                  chagrin. "Gone! Surely you are not in earnest?"
               "Went off yesterday afternoon, gave me fifty dollars for my trouble, and left this
                  for you;" and she handed a letter to the doctor, which he took mechanically,
                  scarce knowing what he was doing, for his thoughts were wandering after his
                  beautiful patient; and her large, deep, lustrous eyes seemed to beam upon him
                  thenâ€”even in that moment of distress; for he was really pained and distressed at
                  this sudden rupture of an intercourse which had brought him so much pleasure; for,
                  poor fellow! he had actually basked in the light of those eyes so long, the idea
                  of living without that light was almost insupportable.
               He had supposed at first that Mrs. Rushmore's statement as to her daughter and her
                  husband was correct; but from the fact that the husband's name was never
                  mentioned, and that the daughter was called only Ellen, he suspected that there
                  was some mystery attached to their present position, and though his profession, as
                  well as his sense of honor, forbade him making any attempt to penetrate their
                  secret, he had often wished in his heart that he might know something more of his fair patient and
                  her history.
               By giving way to these thoughts, he had finally become convinced that there was
                  some mystery which enshrouded them; and before he was aware of it, his feelings
                  had become intensely interested in his patient.
               It was the sudden and unexpected breaking off of an intercourse for which he had
                  been accustomed to look daily with anticipations of delight, which had so unmanned
                  him now; and the assertion that he was astounded, was fully borne out by the
                  feelings which oppressed him when Mrs. Buffum communicated the intelligence of
                  their sudden departure.
               "And the child?"â€”â€”
               "Oh, madam has put that out to nurse until they come back from the West. She told
                  me she should see me when they returned, and would engage me to look after it
                  until she took it away."
               "Do you know where she put it?"
               "Haven't the furthest idee in the world. She never troubled me with any questions,
                  and I'm sure I never troubled her. Come, doctor, see what's in your letter," she
                  said, seeing that the doctor was fumbling it over and over, quite unconscious of
                  what he was doing.
               It was very brief:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "That your kind attention and considerate conduct, professionally and
                              as a gentleman, are appreciated, may be best attested by the
                              enclosure, which please receive from
                           
                              "A GRATEFUL MOTHER."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               The enclosure was a bill for five hundred dollars, and large as it wasâ€”nay, needed
                  as it wasâ€”Doctor Thornton would gladly have foregone the possession of it for one
                  more glance at those eyesâ€”for one more smile of welcome from that lovely face.
               But she was gone; and thrusting the bill and letter loosely in his pocket, he took
                  a very abrupt leave of Mrs. Buffum, without giving her time to ask any questionsâ€”a
                  practice to which she was exceedingly addicted, when she felt that she had a
                  proper subject, and such she had ever considered the doctor to be.
            
            
               
               Chapter V.
               Twelve Years After.
               TWELVE years pass rapidly in the cycle of one's life, and when that life is one of
                  monotonous sameness, they are scarcely noticed.
               They have, however, wrought great changes in the character, habits, and feelings
                  of those who have thus far been brought to the reader's notice.
               Mr. Barton, of whose early life it is unnecessary to speak, but who, for reasons
                  best known to himself, had resolved never to enter the bonds of matrimony,
                  remained a bachelor, though he had hard work indeed to escape the many nets spread
                  for him by those who were acquainted with his wealth and social position.
               His business had grown and prospered, until he was, as many are with less
                  propriety, ranked among the merchant princes of the city. He had left the
                  residence into which Dora was first introduced, and now occupied an elegant
                  mansion on one of the Avenues, which nature and art, as well as fashion, combined
                  to render the most appropriate for those who by luck, chance, or energy had won
                  the right to become its denizens.
               Mrs. Edson, who was truly attached to him, so far as one so worldly minded as she
                  was could be attached to any one, was at the head of his establishment, which was
                  conducted on a scale commensurate with his means and standing; and her connection
                  with her wealthy brother gave her an Ã©clat and
                  position, for which she thought she was grateful, but which she did not fully
                  appreciate.
               As her brother had grown in wealth and distinction, her ideas of her own greatness
                  had proportionally increased; and knowing that she and Clara were his only
                  relatives, she cherished secretly the possibility of deriving advantages from that
                  connection, which she would not have had him know on any consideration.
               As for Dora, of whom a few words hereafter, she had grown jealous of herâ€”jealous
                  of the love which her brother evidently bore to her, and jealous of the
                  attractions which so often put those of her own daughter in the shade.
               She was, however, too politic to exhibit any outward ward manifestations of her feelings, and in the
                  presence of her brother or of friends, treated Dora with an affability and seeming
                  tenderness which to the pure-hearted, guileless, and unsophisticated girl,
                  appeared to be the emanations of natural affection, and which, as it deceived
                  every body, answered her purpose as fully as though the simulated feelings had
                  been sincere.
               Clara, whose delight at the first meeting with Dora may be fresh in the reader's
                  recollection, had grown into a tall and stately girl. Gifted naturally with a
                  large share of pride, the feelings which an impulse of childish tenderness had led
                  her to express for Dora wore off as she grew up, and learned from her mother the
                  full extent of her own expectations and of Dora's dependency.
               These feelings grew with her growth and strengthened with her strength; and though
                  she, like her mother, outwardly treated Dora with an appearance of affection which
                  seemed to spring from the heart, she was in secret as much opposed to her and to
                  her position in the family as was Mrs. Edson.
               Taking her cue from her mother, she managed whenever opportunity afforded to speak
                  of Dora as a charity girlâ€”a foundlingâ€”a nobody's child, whom her dear uncle had
                  picked up in the streets; and these remarks and innuendoes had of course their
                  effect, as Dora perceived but too sensibly, by the altered manner and conduct of
                  her school companions towards her, and which in the guilelessness of her heart she
                  attributed to some personal defects of her own.
               And yet they lived in comparative harmony, for Dora, ever keenly sensitive to her
                  true position, and blessed with a gentle, yielding disposition, strove by every
                  means to win the affection, not only of Mr. Barton, her kind benefactor, but of
                  those who were so near and dear to him.
               As for Mr. Barton, he loved her with a depth and intensity of affection of which
                  few, who met him only as the business man, and who knew not how to penetrate the
                  depths of his heart, deemed him capable. On one occasion he had heard of the
                  unkind remarks made by his niece concerning his beloved protÃ©gÃ©e, and as he knew
                  her worth and prized her virtues, he spoke of them with a sternness which proved
                  how deep was his affection for Dora, and how quickly he would resent any aspersion
                  cast on her.
               He forbade a repetition of them in terms which proved that Dora had the first
                  place in his heart, and which showed
                  Clara and her mother that it would be the worse for them if they continued such a
                  course towards her.
               And thus they had grown up. Mrs. Edson fully alive to her own position of utter
                  dependence on her brother, and sensible that her own and Clara's high social
                  position was due to his wealth, looked forward with apprehension to the time when
                  his wealth might be apportioned; and this caused her to look upon Dora with a
                  feeling almost of hatred, for she felt that his overweening affection for her
                  might induce him to make her his heiress, to the exclusion of herself and Clara,
                  and the consequent diminution of her importance in the eyes of the world.
               Poor Dora, who had never given a thought to such things, was at times most unhappy
                  by reason of this change in their feelings towards her; but conscious of no wrong,
                  she pursued her course steadily, striving to prove her love and gratitude to her
                  benefactor, and to win the affection of his relatives.
               She was gentle, amiableâ€”studiously attentive to every wishâ€”obedient in all
                  thingsâ€”and had such winning ways, it was next to impossible not to love her.
               And she had grown into most lovely womanhood, for nature had endowed her with a
                  very large share of personal charms.
               She was the centre of attraction wherever she went, often to the chagrin and
                  mortification of Clara, who felt keenly the superiority, as well of personal
                  charms as of mental qualities, of her adopted cousinâ€”and many were the harsh words
                  and thoughts vented upon the innocent cause of her annoyance.
               Dora bore her reproaches with characteristic meekness; and as it generally
                  occurred that Clara's better sense triumphed in the end, the coolnesses occasioned
                  by these transient clouds soon passed away, and harmony was to all appearances
                  fully restored.
               Such, however, was not the case, for Clara had really a vindictive temper; and
                  from at first thinking of Dora as an intruder, she at length grew into the
                  conviction that she was so, and it required all her tact to keep her uncle from a
                  discovery of her real sentiments.
               Outwardly, and in the presence of friends, she was all affection, and bestowed on
                  her endearing epithets with as much earnestness as though they sprang from the
                  heart. Dora, however, was not so easily
                  blinded. She could not help feeling how matters would end, and strove by every
                  means in her power to win back the fading affection of one whom she really loved;
                  and as she saw each effort grow less and less successful, her heart ached, as she
                  thought of the possible consequences which such a state of things must eventually
                  entail upon her.
               As for Mr. Barton, he was actually wrapped up in Dora. He loved her with an
                  intensity of affection which often compelled him to look into his own heart, and
                  examine his true feelings; but he found nothing there except the love which a
                  parent might bear for a darling child. There was so much disparity in their years.
                  He was nearly fortyâ€”she not yet out of her teens; and though he looked as though
                  he might have subtracted half a dozen years from the truth, and Dora's appearance
                  and manners might have justified the belief that she could add half as many to her
                  own, he felt that the distance between them was too great, and fancied that it was
                  impossible for him to entertain any sentiments for Dora save those of a father.
                  Such was the posture of affairs at the time our story recommences.
               Clara's twentieth birthday was approaching, and Mr. Barton, who loved her much
                  more than she really deserved, and with an earnestness of affection which she
                  would not have gained had he known all of her character, determined to celebrate
                  it by a party, and accordingly he gave Mrs. Edson carte
                     blanche as to the arrangements.
               Clara was in the most exuberant spirits at the idea, and could scarcely think or
                  speak of anything elseâ€”while Dora, on the contrary, looked forward to it with any
                  but pleasurable anticipations, for she feared some collision with Clara, whose
                  jealousy of her charms and attractions had been too often 
                     and and
                     and
                   too palpably shown to be mistaken.
               The eventful evening, however, arrived, and amid the bustle and excitement
                  attendant upon the occasion, Dora half forgot her fears, and it was not until she
                  went to her apartment to dress for the evening that her apprehensions again
                  returned.
               She chose her simplest attire, and dispensed with everything like ornament, save a
                  simple bunch of white flowers in her glossy hair; and it was with a quiet smile of
                  anticipated triumph that Clara heard her determination to appear in such attire,
                  though she could not help feeling that with all her simplicity and modesty of
                  dress, Dora was still a most dangerous rival.
               Mr. Barton, as they passed before him for inspection tion, as he termed it, before the guests commenced
                  to arrive, thought he had never seen Dora look so bewitchingly beautiful; and,
                  with something very like a sigh, he turned to his magnificently attired niece,
                  who, rustling in silk and dazzling with jewels, looked queenly indeed; but the
                  proud curl of her lip, and the haughty flashing of her brilliant eyes, caused him
                  to turn again with admiring gaze to his own loved Dora, and imprinting a kiss upon
                  her marble forehead, he turned and left the room without a word of comment.
               "Uncle don't feel in a very good humor to-night, I'm afraid," said Clara, as she
                  walked to and fro in front of the pier glass, smoothing her rustling dress, and
                  arranging a stray hair here and there across her temples.
               "I am sure I never saw him out of humor in my life," said Dora, whose gaze was
                  still fixed on the door which had just hidden him from her sight.
               "Oh, fudge! You make him believe he is perfect, Dora. You can't make me think so,
                  with all your art. I see through your manÅ“uvres."
               "Art, Clara!" said Dora, crimsoning to the temples. "Artâ€”my manÅ“uvres?"
               "Yes, art, Miss. Dora Barton," and Clara turned upon her with a haughty glance,
                  and a very perceptible tible sneer, as she uttered the name of Barton. "Art, and
                  nothing but art. You know as well as I do, that he is sometimes as cross and
                  crabbed as any he you ever saw, but you dare not say so. Now, I'm not afraid to
                  speak what I think, and I don't think him perfection by a long, very long
                  distance; and you don't either; but you have not the courage to say your soul is
                  your own."
               "Nor did I ever think him perfect, but I do know him to be noble, kind, generous
                  and most affectionate," replied Dora, with warmth.
               "Oh, yes," hastily interrupted Clara; "of course you are bound to say so, if you
                  don't think so; but our positions are so very different," she said this with a
                  scornful expression which brought the blood again to Dora's face, "there is some
                  allowance to be made for you."
               "You are unjust and unkind, Clara," said Dora, gently but firmly, "and I will not
                  listen to you. I know my own heart, and I know that it is filled with boundless
                  gratitude and the warmest affection for Mr. Barton."
               "Oh, I don't doubt it at all, at all," Clara replied, with another scornful laugh.
                  "I shouldn't wonder if you loved him well enough to make a husband of him."
               
               "Clara, your language is shameful and insulting, and if I did not respect myself
                  too much, I would repeat it to Mr. Barton, for I am confident he would put a stop
                  to it. I am sure I have never done anything to deserve such treatment at your
                  hands."
               "Yes you have, a thousand things," said Clara, now fairly aroused so far as to
                  forget her discretion. "Yes you have, a thousand things!" she repeated, with
                  energy, stamping her foot, and facing Dora, with clenched hands and flashing eyes.
                  "You have won his love from me, and you know very well if it hadn't been for you
                  and your arts, I should always have been his favorite, and inherited his fortune;
                  for everybody knows he will never marry."
               "God forgive you, Clara, as I do," said Dora, as tears came to her eyes, forced
                  there by the injustice and unkindness of these remarks. "I would not, Heaven
                  knows, deprive you of one farthing of your inheritance, or of one particle of your
                  uncle's love. I do love him most devotedly, and why should I not; for do I not,
                  under God, owe everything of earthly happiness to him? Oh, Clara, I wish you could
                  read my heart, you would see how very, very little it holds of the feelings which
                  you attribute to me! I am grateful to him beyond my power of words to express;
                  what my words cannot express, my actions must. Do not, dear Clara, do not so
                  misjudge me. I never expectâ€”I never wish one dollar of Mr. Barton's fortune. God
                  spare him long to enjoy it, and keep him conscious of my deep gratitude and
                  fervent devotion to him."
               Clara looked doubtingly at the tearful speaker for an instant, and then, as if
                  ashamed, or afraid of her own rashness, she approached her, and taking her hand,
                  said with an air of supplication:
               "I beg your pardon, Dora. I was wrongâ€”I was rash to speak so, butâ€”but"â€”â€”
               "But what?" said Dora, retaining her hand, and clasping her taper waist with the
                  other. "But what, dear Clara?"
               "You are so very, very beautiful, and"â€”â€”
               "And, is that all, Clara?" said Dora, her eye glistening with pleasure, as she
                  gazed upon the beautiful and glowing face of the speaker. "Is that all? Surely
                  that is not my fault; but, really, if I thought you sincere, I could almost wish
                  to have an attack of the small-pox to put you out of your misery, and cure your
                  insane jealousy."
               "Come, forgive me, Doraâ€”I will never speak so again," said Clara, earnestly, for
                  she remembered the bitter reproof she had received on a former occasion from Mr. Barton, for speaking unkindly of
                  Dora.
               "Of course, I forgive youâ€”how could I be offended at you? You have pained me,
                  Clara; not offended me."
               "Come, come girls, what are you doing here?" exclaimed the hearty voice of Mr.
                  Barton, as he opened the door and saw them still there, when they should have been
                  in the parlors assisting Mrs. Edson. And, with a gentle pressure of the hand, and
                  a glance into each other's eyes which spoke reconciliation and renewed friendship,
                  they followed him out of the room.
               But he had heard every word spoken; and, as they left the room, he followed them
                  with his eyes until the door closed upon them, and, with a deep sigh, he murmured
                  gently: "Dear, good, affectionate girl, how I do love her!"
            
            
               Chapter VI.
               The Party and its Events.
               SOON after the conversation detailed in the last chapter, the guests began to
                  arrive, and the cousins became separated, each having abundance to do to receive
                  and entertain the coming friends.
               Mr. Barton moved about, with a smile and pleasant word for every one, but
                  unconsciously his eyes wandered often in search of Dora; and as he saw her moving
                  gracefully about, her face beaming with animation and wreathed in smiles, he
                  thought he had never seen any one half so lovely or so fascinating.
               While engaged in one of these reveries, and gazing upon the fair form of Dora, as
                  she flitted about like a fairy, his arm was gently touched, and turning, he was
                  accosted by one of his old friends, Mr. Chapman, a merchant in the lower part of
                  the city, who was accompanied by a lady,
                  and whom he introduced as Mrs. Ardenâ€”so, at least, Mr. Barton understood the
                  name.
               "My wife was not very well to-night, and as it was too late to send a regret, she
                  begged our friend, who is on a visit at our house, from the West, to accompany me
                  in her stead," said Mr. Chapman, in apologetic terms.
               "Mrs. Chapman has sent a most lovely substitute," replied Mr. Barton, with a low
                  bow; and he gazed with looks of undisguised admiration upon one of the most
                  magnificent and queenly women he had ever beheld.
               Tall, with a form which Cleopatra might have enviedâ€”features regular as if
                  chiselled by the skill of a Praxitelesâ€”a face beaming with animation and
                  intelligence, she was, in truth, worthy of the admiration which she everywhere
                  commanded, and which no one had ever yielded more promptly or more cheerfully than
                  did Mr. Barton.
               "Mrs. Arden, I am a bachelor, and alone; Mr. Chapman is a married gentleman, and
                  has no business to gallant ladies about, especially when his wife is absent. Honor
                  me;" and he extended his arm, which, with a graceful bow of thanks, was taken by
                  the queenly beauty; and as they moved off together, a quiet, meaning smile crossed
                  the features of Mr. Chapman.
               Mr. Barton never felt more proud in his life than when, with this lovely woman on
                  his arm, he promenaded his magnificent saloon, and introduced her successively to
                  his friends.
               He found her as intelligent and intellectual as she was beautiful, and before he
                  was aware of it, he was completely fascinated.
               As she had no other friend in the room except Mr. Chapman, to whom Mr. Barton
                  resolutely refused to surrender his charge, on the plea that he was alone, they
                  continued together, attracting the attention of allâ€”Mrs. Arden by her surpassing
                  beauty, and Mr. Barton by the assiduous attention which he paid to her.
               The hours passed, and the time for supper was near at hand, when Mr. Barton, who
                  still clung to his new-found friend, perceived at a distance a gentleman for whom
                  he cherished a very warm regard, and who had evidently just arrived, as he had not
                  seen him before.
               "Allow me, madam, to leave you for one moment," he said, conducting Mrs. Arden to
                  a vacant seat on a fauteuil close at hand. "I see a friend to whom I am most
                  anxious to present you;" and he hastened
                  off as fast as the crowded state of the room would permit, and grasped the hand of
                  his old and cherished friend Dr. Thornton, whom he had just discovered.
               "Late as usual, doctorâ€”always late," he said, warmly shaking the extended hand of
                  his friend.
               "My time is not always my own, you know, Barton; but I have been here some time.
                  By the way, who was that Juno you were walking with? I never saw any thing so
                  lovely, nor any one so devoted as you were."
               "Pshaw!" said Mr. Barton, with a forced smile, though he felt the color starting
                  to his face. "She is a lady from the West. Chapman's wife is sick, and she came
                  with him; she is on a visit at their house. She is a splendid woman. Come, I want
                  to introduce you;" and linking arms, they moved to the seat where Mrs. Arden had
                  been left.
               The introduction was effected, and as Mr. Barton pronounced the name of his
                  friend, Mrs. Arden gazed at him with a singular expression of countenance, as if
                  striving to recall something connected with him, while a faint blush mantled her
                  cheek.
               "You have been remarkably successful this evening, Mrs. Arden," said the doctor,
                  taking a seat just vacated by her side.
               "I do not understand in what particular you mean," she said, turning upon him with
                  an inquiring look, "though I must confess I have passed a remarkably pleasant
                  evening."
               "Not by the universal admiration you command, madam, for in that you always
                  succeed," and she bowed to the compliment, "but in chaining my good friend so
                  long. Why, Mrs. Arden," and he looked mischievously at Mr. Barton, whose mantling
                  color told that he expected some of the doctor's home thrusts, "I have been in
                  company with him before, and have seen him gallanting every lady in the room, and
                  he had something pretty to say to every one; but here he has been the whole
                  evening, I am toldâ€”â€”"
               "There, that will do, doctor," said Mr. Barton, actually blushing; "Mrs. Arden
                  knows that, and I am sure if any one is entitled to being called successful it is
                  myself, in being permitted to detain her so long from other and more pleasant
                  society. Allow me to commend her to your attentions for a short time;" and he
                  whispered, as Mrs. Arden turned her head for an instant to speak to Mr. Chapman,
                  who had at that moment approached, "I hope you will come off as well as you think
                  you will."
               Doctor Thornton was an educated gentlemanâ€” polished in his mannersâ€”refinedâ€”gifted with rare conversational powersâ€”and he
                  had travelled much. It was, therefore, not difficult for him to be interesting,
                  especially to one who, like himself, had travelled, and was refined, polished and
                  educated.
               They were soon engaged in animated conversation, heedless of all about them, and
                  neither of them manifested any particular pleasure when the march played by the
                  band gave the announcement for supper, and interrupted their conversation. Mr.
                  Barton was on hand to escort Mrs. Arden, and Doctor Thornton yielded her to him
                  with a grimace and shrug of the shoulder which caused a hearty laugh to both.
               Dora and Clara had not passed unnoticed. Each had their little coterie of
                  admirers, and for once there was no conflict between the cousins, for Clara did
                  not see among Dora's admirers any whom she coveted, and she had in her own train
                  some whom she thought Dora would gladly have chosen.
               But in this she was mistaken, for Dora saw but one face in the room throughout the
                  evening, and heard but one voice, and that belonged to Doctor Thornton's nephew, a
                  young and promising lawyer, with whom she had long been acquainted, and between
                  whom and herself there had grown up, without the aid of words, a sort of tacit
                  understanding how much each thought of the other.
               Mr. Randolph was an orphanâ€”the only child of Dr. Thornton's sister, who had been
                  adopted by him, and who had been educated under his especial direction. The world
                  looked upon him as Doctor Thornton's heir; and as the doctor was acknowledged to
                  be wealthy, and possessed a social position which commanded an entrÃ©e into the
                  first society, his nephew received all the benefit of these advantages, and
                  profited by them, though they failed to cause any relaxation of effort in the
                  pursuit of his profession. From his earliest acquaintance with Dora he had
                  conceived a love for her which he intended to make known when he had placed
                  himself in a position, by means of his profession, to justify such a step; and
                  Dora, on her part, was not insensible to the attentions of the handsome, noble,
                  and generous-hearted young man. In fact, there was a mutual understanding that
                  they loved each other.
               Doctor Thornton and Mr. Barton saw with pleasure the progress of this episode
                  between the young people; and though the latter often sighed as he gazed upon his
                  lovely protÃ©gÃ©e, and perhaps wished he was younger, yet he had made up his mind fully, that in proper time they
                  would find out each other's sentiments, and a happy union would follow.
               Dora and Mr. Randolph had both observed the beautiful Mrs. Arden, and had equally
                  noticed the devoted attention paid to her by Mr. Barton and the doctor.
               "I am afraid Mr. Barton has found his match," said Dora, half laughing, as she
                  watched their progress through the room.
               "And I am sure my uncle has found his," replied her companion. "Come, Miss Dora,
                  who shall have her?"
               "Who shall get her, you mean," she replied archly. "Just look. Do you think she is
                  not more likely to make her choice than either of them. It does not depend upon
                  them, mark my words. If either of them get her it will be from her choosing."
               "I wish, Dora," he continued, bending down, "you would make your choice, and let
                  me know when you have decided," and he fixed upon her a look whose meaning she
                  could not misconstrue, and which brought the blood to her face and brow.
               She made no reply, but returned his look with one so full of meaning, his heart
                  fairly bounded with joy, and with a gentle yet mutual pressure of the locked arms,
                  they moved towards the spot where Mrs. Arden and Dr. Thornton were deeply
                  engrossed in conversation.
               "Allow me, Mrs. Arden," said the doctor, rising as they approached him. "This is
                  Miss Dora, our host's adopted daughter, and this is my nephew, Mr."â€”â€”
               "Sit down here, Dora," said Mrs. Arden, not waiting to hear the doctor finish his
                  sentence, and rising, she seated Dora by her side. "Now, doctor," she said, with
                  one of her most winning smiles, "I beg your pardon for interrupting you, but I was
                  afraid this young lady would run away. I wanted to secure her to myself, and was
                  so rude as to interrupt you.
               "I don't think there is much danger of her running away, though there might be
                  danger in staying."
               "Not for her, surely," said Mrs. Arden, opening her eyes with well feigned
                  astonishment.
               "Not for her, madam," said the doctor, bowing very low, and looking at the speaker
                  with an earnestness of admiration which drew a blush to her face in very spite of
                  herself.
            
            
               
               Chapter VII.
               First Impressions.
               "LET me finish the sentence," said Mr. Randolph, approaching and gently pushing
                  the doctor aside. "Pray, do you not discover a strong family resemblance between
                  us?"
               "Very decided, I think," was the reply, as she scanned the features of the
                  pair.
               "Well, madam," he said, with a wicked smile at the doctor, who stood wondering
                  what was coming nextâ€”"this is his invariable custom: when he desires to make an
                  impression, he always manages to keep me away, for he knows that he would not
                  stand half so good a chance if the lady should know that she had a son as old as I
                  am."
               "Why, you graceless vagabond," said the doctor, with ill-concealed vexationâ€”"how
                  dare you?â€”Miss Dora, I appeal to you!" but Dora, who caught the point of the
                  mischievous joke, was ready to burst with laughter, and the explosion was only
                  prevented by the application of her handkerchief to her mouth.
               Mrs. Arden caught at the hint with a woman's promptness, and heightened the
                  doctor's confusion by saying, as she looked at him with earnestness: "Why, doctor,
                  you really don't look old enough to have a son like that," and she looked
                  mischievously at Mr. Randolph, who appeared to enjoy his own triumph and his
                  uncle's discomfiture amazingly.
               "Arthur, you scamp!" said the doctor, now recovering his good nature, "this is not
                  the first time you have played me this trick."
               "Why, I am sure, doctor, there is no cause for offence. I really think he is a
                  very fine-looking young gentleman, and you ought to be proud of him," said Mrs.
                  Arden, quite seriously.
               "Yes, madam," said Arthur, bowing with well affected meekness, "but think of
                  the"â€”â€”
               "Dora, if you don't stop that fellow," said the doctor, turning to
                  the laughing girl, "I shall tell tales."
               "No, you won't, sir," said Mrs. Arden, who had already read the tale in the
                  crimson cheeks of the abashed girl. "There, go along, and settle the question of
                  paternity between you. I want to see a
                  little more of this young lady, than I am likely to do if you remain here. I can
                  spare you a little while, doctor," and she looked so archly at him, he fairly
                  blushed; and, after a vain attempt to stammer out something, retreated, followed
                  by his mischievous and laughing nephew.
               "Dora," said Mrs. Arden, gazing earnestly in the face of the lovely girl, "I am
                  sure I shall love you."
               "And, I am sure no one can help loving you," said Dora, returning her gaze.
               "Come, come, my child, no foolish compliments between us. I read too much good
                  sense in that frank, open countenance to think you mean mere flattery; and I am
                  too old to bear with it, though I am compelled to hear enough of it. How old are
                  you, Dora?"
               "Nineteen and upwards," replied Dora, with a slight blush, for, not knowing her
                  age, Mr. Barton had fixed it himself, and had set apart a birthday for her.
               "You are very beautiful."
               "Not half so beautiful as my Cousin Clara. Let me go and bring her to you," and
                  she half arose to accomplish her proposal.
               "Noâ€”sit down, unless you are already weary of meâ€”I want to talk to you. I want to
                  love you, and I want you to love me. Don't you know that we sometimes see persons
                  who make an impression at first sight which lasts forever? I tell you, my child,
                  it seems to me as if I love you already. Why, I cannot say, but I love you without
                  knowing it," and she gazed long and earnestly upon the beautiful and blushing
                  girl, who knew not what to make of this strange address.
               But Dora gazed into the speaker's glowing countenance, and read such truth and
                  sincerity in her beaming eyes, she could not doubt; and, placing her hand in that
                  of the enthusiastic lady, she said:
               "I really believe I love you, too."
               "Oh, you willâ€”I know you willâ€”I felt it when you first approached me. Now, tell
                  me"â€”â€”but her sentence was interrupted by the advance of Mr. Barton, who
                  approached, and seeing Dora seated by Mrs. Arden, said:
               "I am ashamed, Mrs. Arden, to think that I have not sooner brought Dora to your
                  notice. She is my adopted child, my heart's darling."
               "I can well believe that, Mr. Barton," said Mrs. Arden, looking fondly at the
                  beautiful girl. "If she is half so good as she is beautiful, you may well be proud
                  of her."
               
               "She is twice as goodâ€”but really, I quite forgot my niece. Upon my word, Mrs.
                  Arden, I shall have to hold you responsible for a great many sins of omission and
                  commission to-night."
               "Well, if you think I deserve to bear the burden of your offences, I must submit,
                  of course. But, Dora here, I am sure, will willingly bear a portion of my very
                  heavy load."
               "Indeed, and indeed I will," she said, with more earnestness than the remark
                  called for; but in that very earnestness the practised eye of Mrs. Arden read the
                  deep and abiding love and gratitude which prompted the words; and she honored her
                  for their utterance.
               "I would that I had one as ready to share my burdens," sighed Mrs. Arden, while
                  something like an expression of pain crossed her fine features, and Mr. Barton
                  thought she had never looked so lovely as when that slight shade of sadness
                  crossed her face.
               "How long since you adopted her, Mr. Barton?" queried Mrs. Arden, still holding
                  Dora's unresisting hand.
               "Dora, dear," said Mr. Barton, apparently not heeding the question, "there is
                  Clara crossing the room; go call herâ€”I want to introduce her to Mrs. Arden. It is
                  my niece," he said, turning to Mrs. Arden as Dora rose to obey him; and Mrs.
                  Arden, 
                     seing
                     seeing
                   the ruse to prevent any further
                  questions on that point, discreetly and politely forebore; but she followed her
                  retreating form until it was lost in the giddy throng which filled the parlors,
                  and turning to Mr. Barton with a half sigh, changed the conversation into some
                  commonplace channel.
               Clara was very soon brought up and introduced to Mrs. Arden, who was not long in
                  reading her character; and she saw with pain the ill-concealed jealousy and
                  selfishness which animated her.
               Clara strove to please and shine, and failed before the practised experience of
                  Mrs. Arden; while Dora's gentleness, simplicity, and utter absence of all thought
                  of self, won her warmest regard and affection.
               "How widely different," she thought; "and how strange that my heart should have so
                  leaped to this dear child;" and involuntarily she turned and met the gaze of Dora
                  fixed upon her with an intensity of expression for which neither could
                  account.
               "You love me, Dora?" said Mrs. Arden, in tones so low they reached no ears but
                  those for which they were intended.
               "I really believe I do," was the reply, in the same tones; and a pressure of the hand attested the
                  newborn sympathy so strangely felt between them.
               "Oh, I thought you could not stay away long, Mr. Thornton," said Mrs. Arden, as
                  young Randolph approached, his face actually beaming with happiness at the sight
                  of Dora.
               "No, no, Mrs. Arden, I did very wrong; and I am afraid I have offended my best and
                  dearest friend. Randolph, madamâ€”Arthur Randolphâ€”at your service. Thornton was only
                  borrowed for the moment."
               "Not entirely at my service, if I am any judge of humanity," she said, with an
                  arch look, and with a glance at Dora, whose blushes told the pleasure she enjoyed
                  in his presence. "But come, I saw through your joke at first, and as I like a joke
                  as well as any body, I thought I would humor it. So bring your uncle here; I will
                  make your peace, never fear."
               "I do not fear, if you undertake it," said Arthur, bowing.
               "Why, you are as bad as he is," she said, laughing.
               "That is half an admission, Mrs. Arden, and I can infer the rest," he said, with a
                  look as arch as her own; and feeling that they were now quits, he left her to
                  bring the not unwilling uncle to the shrine before which he had so readily and so
                  devoutly worshipped all the evening.
            
            
               Chapter VIII.
               Renewing an Acquaintance.
               ON the day following that of the party, Dr. Thornton was noticed to be
                  particularly restless and uneasy. The morning hours devoted to the calls of office
                  patients hung like lead on his hands, and he was glad of the relief which the ride
                  in his carriage afforded him, for it enabled him to think; and he gave full sway
                  to his thoughts, to judge from the frequent fits of abstraction of which he was
                  accused during the day.
               Fortunately for his reputation, he committed no grievous professional error, and
                  as he pleaded late hours on the previous night, and a headache as his morning's
                  penalty, he was readily excused any mistakes which he might have committed.
               He hurried through his list of calls with as much speed as was consistent with
                  common courtesy; and as his obedient coachman (for he had arrived at the dignity of a coach and driver) stopped in
                  front of Mr. Chapman's house, he was obliged to acknowledge to himself that he
                  experienced a sensation about the heart to which for many years he had been a
                  stranger.
               "Is Mrs. Arden within?" was his inquiry of the servant who answered his
                  summons.
               An affirmative answer being given, he directed the driver to return home, saying
                  that he would make the remainder of his calls on foot.
               He was ushered into the parlor, which was darkened by the drawing of the curtains;
                  and he inwardly blessed the chance which thus enabled him to conceal the
                  excitement under which he was laboring.
               He was left to himself for a few moments, for which he found renewed cause of
                  thankfulness, as it allowed him to regain his composureâ€”a quality which he seemed
                  to have been gradually losing as he neared the house, and which entirely deserted
                  him when informed that Mrs. Arden was at home, and would receive him.
               He passed the intervalâ€”and it seemed an age to himâ€”in pacing the parlor; and he
                  must have been deeply buried in thought indeed, for he did not notice the opening
                  of the door, or hear the rustling of silk as she entered, but was aroused by a
                  gentle touch on the arm, and turning, he stood face to face with Mrs. Arden.
               For an instant his self-possession left him, and he stood mute and trembling
                  before her. Yes, actually trembling, for the strong man was under the influence of
                  a spell which none have ever yet successfully resisted.
               The darkness of the apartment prevented Mrs. Arden from noticing his excessive
                  agitation, or the deep flush which mantled his cheek; and accosting him gaily with
                  some trifling taunt as to his want of gallantry in allowing her to enter the room
                  unnoticed, she invited him to a seat by her side on the sofa.
               In a few moments Dr. Thornton was himself once more, and again he showed himself
                  the refined, polished, and educated gentleman.
               "Really, Mrs. Arden," he said, after a few common-place salutations had passed, "I
                  hardly know how to excuse myself for so unseasonable a call, except, indeed, I
                  place it on professional grounds."
               "I really do not see, doctor, how you can do that. You surely had no cause to fear
                  for my health on the ground of any excesses committed last night.
               "Indeed, madam, you have hit the very cause It was your very excesses which alarmed me; and I felt it my duty as your
                  friend," and he bowed, "and as a friend of Mr. Barton's, to see that no one
                  suffered from his hospitality."
               "Really, I cannot conceive wherein I was guilty of any excess, doctor."
               "Yes, madam," he replied, gravely, "you excited an excess of admiration, which
                  is"â€”â€”
               "My proper merit, I suppose you meant to say, doctor," she interrupted. "But
                  don't; don't lower yourself by flattering me, nor me by thinking that I would
                  receive it."
               "Madam, you wrong us both. I was never more serious in my life; and to prove it,
                  will you allow me to relate a little episode which occurred to me when I first
                  commenced practice."
               "I will listen with pleasure to anything that concerns you, doctor," said Mrs.
                  Arden with earnestness, for her ready tact had showed her that he was very
                  earnest.
               "I was called many years agoâ€”let me see," he said musingly, "it was nineteen years
                  ago on the 27th of December"â€”â€”
               "You are precise as to dates, doctor," said Mrs. Arden, with something like
                  inquiry in her tone.
               "It will best prove my earnestness, madam. I was called," he continued, "to visit
                  a lady, residing then inâ€”no matter what streetâ€”and I attended her daily for nearly
                  five weeks. I saw that she was young, very, very beautiful, and, as I fancied,
                  very unhappy. She was attended by her mother, who never suffered me to be alone
                  with my patient for a single instant; but unconsciously I imbibed an interest for
                  her, which grew and strengthened daily. On one occasion, when I entered her room,
                  her mother had just been combing my patient's hair, and a quantity of it lay on
                  the table near which I was seated. I managed unperceived to secrete it, and have
                  that hair now. My patient left me suddenlyâ€”mysteriously; and although her mother
                  left for me a fee which at that period of my professional existence seemed
                  fabulous, I would gladly have dispensed with it for one more glance from those
                  clear, deep blue eyes, which had entered my very heart, and left an impress there
                  which nineteen years have failed to efface. You believe I can be earnest,
                  madam."
               "Go on, doctor," was all the reply she vouchsafed, and Doctor Thornton noticed
                  that her voice was husky, and its tones tremulous.
               "Madam, I caused that hair to be carefully cleaned and braided. I had it set in a
                  locket. I have worn that locket next to
                  my heart for nineteen years, and now I restore it to its rightful owner;" and
                  suiting the action to the word, he took from beneath his vest a well-worn locket,
                  and drawing the ribbon to which it was attached, from his neck, placed it in the
                  hand of his auditor, as it lay outstretched upon the sofa.
               The touch seemed to electrify her, for she sprang up as if startled by a galvanic
                  shock, and clasping the locket, paced the room in an agony of excitement,
                  exclaiming, "My God! my God! what does this mean?"
               "Simply this, Mrs. Arden: that I recognised you last evening the moment my eyes
                  fell upon your countenance, but I saw you failed to recall me."
               "Time has wrought great changes, doctor," she said, extending her hand, and
                  suffering him to lead her again to her seat."
               "Not in my feelings, Mrs. Arden, though He has left some rough marks upon my face.
                  You know me now."
               "Know you," she said with energy; "know you! aye, and bless God that I have been
                  spared to say to you in person how deep, how fervent, how abiding was, and is, my
                  gratitude to you for your kindness, your attention, and your consoling sympathy in
                  those most trying hours. Oh, Doctor Thornton, if you knew all I have suffered, all
                  I have endured. And not the least of my suffering has been caused by the
                  reflection that I did not even know your name, that I might at least have
                  remembered it in my prayers."
               "Not know my name, Mrs. Arden!"
               "Not as Doctor Thornton. My mother simply called you doctor; and, as you well
                  know, the opportunity was never afforded me to ask you a single question unheard
                  by her."
               "Ellen," said Dr. Thornton, in grave, but gentle accents, "may I retain that
                  locket?"
               "Take it, Doctor Thornton; and in receiving it from me take the most unwomanly
                  assurance that you have never been forgotten;" and as she extended the hand which
                  held the locket, he seized it, and pressing it respectfully to his lips, withdrew
                  the charm which had been his companion through so many years, and replaced it in
                  his bosom.
               "You will spare me now further conversation on this subject. I have much, very
                  much to tell youâ€”much to ask you. See me to-morrow."
               "Your words are law to me, Mrs. Arden," said the doctor respectfully; and rising,
                  he took her unresisting hand, and again
                  pressing it respectfully to his lips, was about to take his departure when, with
                  an evident effort, she said,
               "Doctor, I cannot permit you to leave me until I thank you for the considerate
                  kindness you have displayed in delaying your discovery until now. It shall not, it
                  cannot be forgotten."
               "I am more than rewarded, madam," he said, with deep earnestness, "by the
                  acknowledgment that I have been remembered during the many years of cheerless
                  solitude which have passed over me;" and renewing his promise to call on the
                  morrow, he took his departure.
            
            
               Chapter IX.
               The Philanthropist's End.
               WHEN Doctor Thornton reached his office on his return from his call upon Mrs.
                  Arden, he was surprised to find Mr. Barton seated there waiting for him, and with
                  such evident anxiety and impatience depicted on his countenance, the worthy doctor
                  could not forbear an expression of surprise.
               "In truth, my dear friend," he said, in answer to the doctor's question as to the
                  cause of his seeming anxiety, "I fear there is full cause for my appearance. Feel
                  my pulse," and he stretched out his hand, which the doctor took, and before he had
                  held it many seconds, his own countenance underwent a change almost as great as
                  that which had come over Mr. Barton.
               "I thought so, doctor," said Mr. Barton, with a very faint attempt at a smile;
                  "and now I know it."
               "Thought what," was the hasty reply of the doctor, dropping his friend's hand, and forcing his features into the most
                  professional state of composure.
               "You need not attempt to deceive meâ€”I have feared it for some time. Last night I
                     felt that it was true. Here," and he hastily unbuttoned his vest,
                  "place your ear there. You can't frighten me nowâ€”I am prepared for anything. But
                  one favor I ask, as an old and tried friend. Tell me the whole honest truth. You
                  will?"
               "On my honor I will," said the doctor, glad to conceal his face from his friend,
                  as he stooped and placed his practised ear over the region of the heart.
               A very few moments sufficed to convince him that Mr. Barton's worst fears were but
                  terrible realities, and the sadness which covered his own features as he arose and
                  faced Mr. Barton revealed the melancholy truth. He was afflicted with disease of
                  the heart, of the worst and most desperate character, such as to crush all hope
                  and defy all human skill.
               His life hung upon a thread, and that might be snapped at any moment.
               "How long have you felt this coming on?"
               "Over a year," was the calm reply, as Mr. Barton buttoned up his vest, and
                  smoothed the rumpled bosom of his shirt.
               "And why, in heaven's name, did you not let me know it before?"
               "I fancied it might have been some temporary trouble caused by the excitement of
                  business, added to my passionate fondness for coffee, in which you know I indulged
                  to excess. But is there immediate danger?"
               "None immediate, unless provoked by some high excitement. You must," continued the
                  doctor emphatically, "mind I say must, avoid everything that can
                  excite or stimulate."
               "I know it. It was the excitement of last night which brought me to the full
                  consciousness of my real situation and condition. You may have missed me from the
                  parlor for some time after supper?" said Mr. Barton inquiringly.
               "I did so, but presumed that you were engaged in discharging your duties as host,
                  and therefore took no special notice of your absence."
               "I went to my room to procure a pocket handkerchief, as one of the ladies had wet
                  mine with wine, and I ran up the stairs so rapidly, that when I reached my
                  apartment, I fell forward, staggering into a chair. I must have fainted, for I
                  have no recollection how long I remained there. I only know that when I awoke to
                  consciousness, I felt a dreadful pain in
                  the region of the heart, and every breath cost me an effort. I suppose there is no
                  use in taking medicine," he added, as he closed his brief narrative with a deep
                  sigh.
               "I will give you an anodyne. The best medicine is to avoid excitement of every
                  kind, and that, under every and any circumstance, you must do."
               "I was building such castles last night, doctor," said Mr. Barton, and a sad smile
                  crossed his face as he spoke, "when I first saw that beautiful widow, Mrs.
                  Ardenâ€”and by the way, old friend, unless I am very much mistaken, I should have
                  had a rival in you. That would have been funny, indeed; would it not, at our
                  ages?"
               Doctor Thornton looked at his friend for a moment in silence, as if framing his
                  reply; but whatever it might have been, was interrupted by Mr. Barton, who said,
                  with an expression of sadness really painful to his friend,
               "Its no matter now, my dear friend; I have something more serious to attend to
                  than love or marriage. I resign the field to you. Win her, if you can; and God
                  give you long life and happiness," and tears actually sprang to his eyes as he
                  spoke.
               Doctor Thornton by a great effort forced back the tears from his own eyes, and
                  said, "I wish you would not talk in that ridiculous strain. It will only throw you
                  into a state of excitement, and what the consequence might be, heaven could only
                  tell; besides, it is entirely uncalled for. If you will only take proper care of
                  yourself you may have years of life and happiness before you."
               "I am perfectly calm, my friend; and to prove it, I came especially to talk with
                  you on the most serious matters. Situated as I now am, I feel that I should be
                  guilty of a great wrong if I omitted to make my will. The first thing I did this
                  morning, as I went down town, was to call on Mr. Lander, and give him instructions
                  as to the disposal of my property. I have put upon you the trouble of the sole
                  executorship, and the guardianship of Dora until she is marriedâ€”and if I judge
                  rightly, that won't be long delayed. What do you think, eh?"
               "I think they love each other very devotedly," was the reply, for both evidently
                  felt that Arthur Randolph was the selected husband of Dora.
               "Has he ever spoken to you about it?"
               "Often, Barton; often. His whole being is engrossed by her; and he pursues his
                  profession with a perseverance which must ensure success, for he is resolved not to ask for her until he is in a
                  position to support her without any aid from me."
               "God bless her; she is a darling," said Mr. Barton, the tears again coming to his
                  eyes as the thought of leaving for ever one who had so wound herself about his
                  heart, crossed him.
               "Amen to that; and God will bless her, for if there ever was a noble-hearted,
                  pure-minded, and devoted girl on earth, Dora is the one. I have offered to settle
                  on Arthur enough to make him independent, but he has absolutely refused it, and
                  says it would deprive him of half his energy. He thinks he would enjoy a
                  competence earned fairly and honorably far more than he would wealth given or
                  inherited; and I won't do anything to discourage that idea. His success I consider
                  certain."
               "I have divided my property equally into two partsâ€”half to Clara and Dora each;
                  with an annuity sufficient for my sister's comfortable support. I have great fear
                  for Clara, however; she is a rash, head-strong, impulsive girl, and unless I am
                  much mistaken, has lately taken a great dislike to Doraâ€”Heaven only knows why.
                  Some time ago I was very much incensed against Clara on account of some things
                  which I had noticed, and many which I had heard, and I made a different
                  disposition of my property. But the instructions I have given to Lander will
                  convey to you my present intentions. You will always be kind to Dora?" he queried,
                  an expression of deep sadness crossing his face.
               "My dear friend," said Dr. Thornton, rallying his spirits, "you talk like a dying
                  man. Why, really, one would think you were bent upon suicide, or had made up your
                  mind that you could not live another day. Now, please to act like a rational
                  being. In the first place, I love Dora almost as well as you do, and if you had
                  not left her one cent, I should have felt a pride in seeing that she should never
                  want. Arthur loves her beyond every thing on earth, and there is another who
                  thinks her near perfection."
               "Indeed!" said Mr. Barton; "and who may that be? I did not know that her worth had
                  been so truly appreciated."
               "Mrs. Arden; she thinks she is the loveliest creature, mentally and physically,
                  she ever saw, and almost fell in love with her last night. She will always be
                  Dora's friend."
               "And if you should win the widow, doctor, she will have two friends. You will be
                  kind to her for my sake, won't you, my friend?" he repeated sorrowfully, as he
                  thought again of leaving her.
               "For yours and for her own, for I love her as well as though she were my own. Have no fear on that
                  score. But come, don't talk so sadly now; stay and dine with me, and let us have a
                  talk over old timesâ€”it will cheer you up."
               "I cannot very well now; I have some private papers to arrange to-day at home. Do
                  you come around and spend the evening, if you can, with us; you are always
                  welcome."
               "I will try, Barton; but I won't even make the attempt, unless you promise to
                  forego all excitement, to avoid business, and to keep as calm and cool as
                  possible. Here," and he hastily penned a prescription, "take that as directedâ€”it
                  will soothe you; and if I should not be able to come to you this evening, do you
                  come here as you go down town in the morning;" and Mr. Barton took his departure,
                  leaving the doctor in a most unhappy frame of mind.
               On reaching home, Mr. Barton found the family assembled, each of whom noticed his
                  unusual pallor, but neither spoke of it; and the conversation, which his entrance
                  had interrupted, was recommenced.
               They had been discussing the merits and demerits of their guests of the previous
                  evening.
               Clara was, as usual, bold, prompt, and reckless in her assertions. This one was a
                  dowdyâ€”the other was a fright; one was dressed to deathâ€”another not fit to be seen
                  in decent company; and as for the gentlemen, there was but one in the whole room
                  worth notice.
               Mr. Barton sat still, and smiled as he listened to her comments, or rather
                  criticisms, for she had seen no one to commend; and when she paused an instant for
                  want of breath, he ventured to ask if she had noticed Mrs. Arden, to whom she had
                  been introduced.
               "What, that tall, coarse-looking, over-dressed woman, painted to hide her
                  wrinkles, and with false hairâ€”the one with whom you appeared to be so much taken,
                  Uncle Charles?"
               Mr. Barton made no reply, but looking at the speaker an instant with a sternness
                  which made her fairly quail, he arose and left the room abruptly, evidently highly
                  displeased.
               "You have offended your uncle," said her mother, who saw that he was really hurt
                  at the bold and reckless expressions her daughter had used.
               "Who cares? He had no business to ask my opinion, if he didn't want me to say what
                  I really thought. Any one could tell at half a glance what he thought
                  of her.
               "I really cannot conceive how you could think so of such a lovely woman," Dora
                  remarked. "To my taste, she was incomparably the finest looking lady in the room, and certainly the most
                  attractive."
               "Not even excepting Miss Simplicity?" added Clara, sneeringly.
               "Not even with that exception," responded Dora, mildly, but coloring deeply at the
                  covert insinuation.
               "Yes, I saw you paying your court, because Uncle Charles was so attentive to her.
                  It was very well done, Miss Artful, and I dare say was properly appreciated."
               "I am not artful, Clara, if I am simple," said Dora, energetically; "and I only
                  say what I mean."
               "You are artful, and don't say what you mean," was the
                  reply, delivered in a tone of voice unnecessarily high. "You saw that Uncle
                  Charles was very attentive to her, and so you, too, must push yourself in, and
                  toady to her. It's just on a piece with"â€”â€”
               "Clara!" said her mother in a deprecating tone, for she dreaded the outburst of
                  passion on the part of her daughter which she foresaw was coming.
               "I won't hush, motherâ€”I will speak. I won't allow any charity girl to reprove meâ€”a
                  nobodyâ€”a nobody's child!" and she was so enraged, she actually lost the power of
                  speech for the moment.
               "God forgive you!" said Dora, meekly. "What have I done, that you should so abuse
                  and reproach me?"
               "What have you done! Haven't you tried, by every art, to win my uncle's love from
                  me; as if I did not know it was for his money? Haven't you always put yourself
                  forward, with your mock simplicity, whenever any gentleman was attentive to me?
                  Haven't you done and said everything you could to worm your way into Uncle
                  Charles's affections, and to turn him against me?" Clara said, or rather screamed,
                  for she was so carried away by her passion that she was almost unconscious of what
                  she said or did.
               "As I hope for mercy, never!" exclaimed the aggrieved and insulted Dora. "I love
                  himâ€”oh! how deeply and truly, he cannot know; for did he not rescue me from a life
                  of poverty and sorrow? Has he not been a father, brother, friendâ€”everything on
                  earth to me? And if I have striven to prove my deep and boundless gratitude to
                  him, it has been because my heart and my sense of duty prompted me; and if I have
                  endeavored to win his love, it was because I knew how earnestly I longed to
                  deserve it. God forgive you for your deep injustice! and I pray that my dear kind
                  friend and father may read my heart
                  more truly than you have done, if you really believe what you have said."
               "Believe it!â€”I know it!" exclaimed Clara, now enraged beyond all bounds; and, not
                  knowing what she was saying or doing, she continued, in spite of her mother's
                  entreaties and commands, to pour out a torrent of abuse and invective against the
                  trembling, grief-stricken Dora, who could only listen and weep in sorrowful
                  silence.
               How long Clara would have continued, or what she might have said, must remain
                  unknown; but her tirade was brought to a sudden close by the appearance of Mr.
                  Barton, who for some minutes past had been an unseen auditor of her remarks.
               "Silence!" he exclaimed, in a voice of thunder, as he threw open the partially
                  closed door, which, while it concealed him, had enabled him to overhear every word
                  uttered.
               It was the last word he ever spoke on earth. A sudden pallor overspread his
                  countenanceâ€”he threw up his arms, as if catching for supportâ€”and with a wild cry,
                  which resounded through the house, sank back on the floor; but before he reached
                  it he was dead!
               
            
            
               Chapter X.
               The Chamber of Death.
               A SHRIEK of horror rang through the room, and each of the inmates sprang forward
                  to assist the fallen man. Mrs. Edson and Dora raised him gently and placed him on
                  a sofa, while Clara stood still, wringing her hands and screaming at the top of
                  her voice, without, however, knowing why, except perhaps that she was completely
                  horror-struck at the event.
               The screams and outcries of the affrighted ladies brought the servants to the
                  apartment, and one of them was immediately dispatched for the nearest physician,
                  while Mrs. Edson directed others to procure such restoratives as she had in the
                  house.
               Doctor Edsall, a near resident, was promptly at hand, but a glance and a brief
                  examination sufficed to show him that Mr. Barton had passed beyond mortal help, and, with a few words of sympathy and
                  condolence, he took his leave.
               Mrs. Edson was completely prostrated by the suddenness of the awful shock, and was
                  soon afterwards carried in a swooning state to her room, whither she was followed
                  by her now subdued and awe-stricken daughter, while Dora was left alone with the
                  remains of her kind friend and benefactorâ€”her almost parentâ€”whom she had so truly
                  and devotedly loved.
               Young as she was, she realized to the full the extent and weight of the terrible
                  blow which had fallen upon her; and, approaching the pallid corpse, as it lay on
                  the sofa, where, with the aid of Mrs. Edson, it had been placed, she threw herself
                  on her knees beside it, and clasping the clay-cold hand, which could now no longer
                  return the pressure of her own, kissed it again and again, and pressed it to her
                  heart, as though she would have given her own vitality to have brought its owner
                  again to consciousness.
               "One word onlyâ€”one single word, my only friend on earth! Oh, have you left me
                  without one word? You know I loved youâ€”oh, how truly!â€”how devotedly I loved you,
                  my more than father! Do speak one word to me!"
               But she spoke in vain, for the spirit of the noble, true-hearted, affectionate man
                  had passed to another and a brighter world, and Dora was forced to the terrible
                  consciousness that for him there was no hope on earth. And, oh! how saddening was
                  the conviction forced upon her now of her own dreary solitude!
               He had been her only earthly friendâ€”her benefactor, her father! He it was who had
                  rescued her from a life of suffering, sorrow, and poverty! He it was who had cared
                  for and cherished her as a daughter! He it was to whom she had learned to cling
                  with all the purity and fervor of a daughter's love; and he had loved her, she
                  knewâ€”nay, she felt in her inmost heart as though she had been, indeed, his own
                  child. Oh! how could she part from him forever?
               But he was gone now, and she should never more see him on earth. She could no more
                  hear the glad welcome with which he greeted her upon each return from the business
                  of the dayâ€”no more receive his warm caressâ€”no more hear that voice, which was ever
                  addressed to her in tones of love and kindness! She was aloneâ€”alone in the most
                  dreary sense of that terrible wordâ€”for her heart could not resist the forebodings
                  of the unhappy consequences which might
                  be entailed on her by reason of the sentiments with which she had but too good
                  cause to feel that Clara had long regarded her; and what might be Clara's
                  influence upon her mother, she dared not attempt to anticipate.
               How long she had remained with the corpse she knew not, but she was aroused by the
                  gentle touch of a hand upon her shoulders, and, turning, she beheld the sad face
                  of Doctor Thornton gazing tenderly and sorrowfully upon her.
               With a faint exclamation of surprise, she sprang from her kneeling posture, and
                  throwing herself into his extended arms, gave way to a passionate burst of grief;
                  the hot tears falling like rain upon his shoulder.
               "Come, my child," he said, soothingly, "compose yourself. It is a sad and awful
                  calamity, but you cannot alter it by grieving," he added, straining her to his
                  heart.
               "I know it, doctor, I know it," she sobbed, essaying to check the tears which
                  would fill her eyes, and speaking in a voice half choked by emotion. "I know it,
                  doctor; but he was so goodâ€”so kind, and loved me so dearly, and God knows how
                  truly I loved him! He was my only true friend on earth. Oh! what shall I do? Alone
                  on earth," she added, with a sorrowful voice, raising her eyes to Heavenâ€”"alone,
                  alone!"
               "Say not so, my dear Dora. He was my dearest friend, and, while I live, the one
                  whom he lovedâ€”whom I know he lovedâ€”shall never say or feel that she
                  is alone. Dora, my dear child, you are not alone."
               "Oh, I know and deeply appreciate your kindness, doctor. I did not mean that,
                  but," and approaching the body as it lay extended stark and stiff upon the sofa,
                  she kissed the cold, clammy forehead again and again, "he was my own dear father,
                  and who could ever fill his place to me? Who will ever love me as he did?"
               "Dora, dear," said the doctor, with an effort to restrain his own tears, "you must
                  be composed, and answer me one or two questions. How long had Mr. Barton been home
                  before this terrible visitation?" he asked, in very earnest tones.
               "Not much over an hour," she replied, wiping her streaming eyes.
               "Was there any especial occurrence that you know of to annoy or worry him? Had
                  anything occurred to excite him?"
               Dora looked at him through her still moistened eyes, and shaking her head
                  sorrowfully, replied:
               
               "I would rather not say now, if you will excuse me. Please not ask me,
                  doctor."
               "And, why not, Dora? You do not fully understand how necessary and important it
                  may be for me to know. He was at my office not many hours ago, and his very last
                  words were of you; his last request was, that in case of any accident to him, I
                  should take his place with you."
               "Dear, dear father! Oh, why did you leave me?" she exclaimed, on hearing this
                  renewed evidence of affection for her, and again she glued her lips to the cold
                  forehead of him who had never before received her caresses without a return.
               "There was a cause, doctor," she said, striving to keep down the tears which would
                  come in spite of all her efforts, "there was a cause, doctor, and I will mention
                  it for the dear sake of him who cannot hear me now. He died in the effort to
                  protect me. Clara was heaping upon me the most unjust and offensive epithets, and
                  accusing me of endeavoring to supplant her in his affections; but he had, unknown
                  to us, overheard all of her remarks. He entered the room suddenly, and merely
                  exclaimed: 'Silence!' when he fell back and expired," and her tears and sobs broke
                  out afresh as she recited thus briefly the cause of the terrible calamity which
                  had deprived her of her best friend.
               "So, soâ€”I can easily imagine what is to come," he muttered. "Now, Dora, another
                  questionâ€”has Mr. Landerâ€”you know himâ€”been, or sent here since your father's return
                  to-day?"
               "He has not been here, I am sure. Whether he has sent or not, I cannot
                  answer."
               "Then, I must see if he has it about him," said the doctor, half aloud. "Pardon
                  me, Dora," he said, turning to her, "I am acting for you now," and he proceeded to
                  feel the pockets of his inanimate friend, but turned away with a sorrowful look of
                  disappointment.
               "Too lateâ€”too lateâ€”God help her, for I am afraid they won't," he muttered. "Come,
                  Dora, you must retire now," he said, raising her with gentle violence. "As soon as
                  I learned of this terrible dispensation, I sent for the coroner, as it is
                  necessary that he should view the body. I expect him here every moment; and, as I
                  do not wish him to know of the immediate excitement which caused his death, you
                  had better not be present. My testimony will be abundant, for it was only this
                  morning he called on me, and I discovered the dreadful malady which afflicted him, and which was the cause
                  of his sudden death. Come, my dear," and he strove with gentle violence to remove
                  her from the room; but with the most frantic exclamations of grief she threw
                  herself on her knees beside the body, and clasping its neck, pressed the cold and
                  senseless face to her beating, aching heart.
               Doctor Thornton suffered her to exhaust herself; then gently disengaging her arms,
                  he rang the bell, and gave her in charge of the servant who responded to his
                  summons.
               The coroner cameâ€”the view was hadâ€”and as Dr. Thornton had asserted, his evidence
                  was deemed sufficient for the granting of the proper certificate, which done, that
                  functionary took his leave with many and sincere expressions of regret at the
                  sudden death of one so widely and so favorably known in the community.
               "You will confer a very great favor on me, Mr. Coroner," said Dr. Thornton to that
                  official as they stood at the front door, "if you will send word to Mr. Lander (I
                  presume you know him) of this melancholy occurrence, and say I wish very much to
                  see him at my residence this evening on urgent business."
               "With pleasure, doctor. He has left a will, I suppose?" queried the official, but
                  more as a casual than a personal question.
               "That is the very thing I want to know. It was only this very day he told me he
                  had given instructions to have his will drawn up, and he even mentioned all the
                  contents to me, as I had been named sole executor."
               "I hope, for the sake of all concerned, he had executed it before this terrible
                  visitation. It may cause trouble if he has not."
               "And I hope so, for the sake of one," the doctor muttered to
                  himself.
               But there is no need to dilate upon this melancholy occurrence, nor to speak of
                  the grief of the afflicted family.
               Mrs. Edson on the occasion seemed to be, and really was, bowed down with grief and
                  awe; and Clara gave vent to the most hysterical sobs and tears; while Dora, with a
                  countenance pale as marble, and features rigid as those of the beloved one whose
                  remains she was so soon to follow to their last resting place, presented the very
                  picture of despair.
               The funeral was very largely attended, for Mr. Barton was widely known and
                  universally honored, and his sudden death, in the very prime of life, had cast a gloom over a wide circle with
                  whom he had been for years brought into daily contact, and who had learned to love
                  him for his worth, and honor him for his virtues.
               The last sad offices were mournfully performed. The last words were spoken, and in
                  silence, broken only by the sobs and sighs of mourning friends, the remains of
                  Charles Barton were consigned to their final resting-place.
               The mourners moved sadly away; while the family, accompanied by Dr. Thornton,
                  returned to their gloomy home.
            
            
               Chapter XI.
               A Change Occurs.
               IT was the third day after the funeral. Mrs. Edson, dressed in the deepest of
                  mourning, and wearing an expression of grief, was pacing slowly and thoughtfully
                  to and fro in the magnificent parlors, which had so lately been the scene of so
                  much gaiety and mirth.
               She was evidently awaiting or expecting the arrival of some visitor, for at every
                  turn she would pause and listen for an instant, then, resuming her measured walk,
                  give way again to thought.
               At length the door bell was rung, and throwing herself on the sofa, she awaited
                  with ill concealed impatience the coming of the visitor, for she knew that it
                  could be none other than the one she had expected, as she had appointed that hour
                  for his call.
               As the door of the parlor was opened she arose, and moved forward to salute the
                  visitor.
               
               "Madam, I salute you," was uttered in stentorian tones by a large, portly man, who
                  advanced and took her outstretched hand. "Believe me, Mrs. Edson," he continued,
                  as he led her to the sofa, and seated himself by her side, "I sympathize with you
                  most truly in this afflicting dispensation."
               A word as to the new comer.
               It was Mr. Harding, a member of the New York barâ€”noted for his portly carriageâ€”his
                  stentorian voiceâ€”his unblushing impudenceâ€”and his brazen effronteryâ€”each of which
                  he used without stint to conceal his ignorance and lack of education.
               He was pompous in his mannersâ€”slow and studied in his wordsâ€”shrewd and cunning in
                  every movement which he made in behalf of a client, and as he was perfectly
                  reckless as to the use of any means by which his ends, or those of his clients,
                  might be attained, he was thoroughly despised.
               He had made the acquaintance of Mrs. Edson some two or three years previous to the
                  occasion on which he is now just introduced to the reader, and had paid her most
                  assiduous court, hoping through her influence to obtain the favor and business of
                  Mr. Barton. Indeed it was surmised by many that he even aspired to claim Mrs.
                  Edson as his own; but if such was his purpose, he had never avowed it to her, and
                  she was forced to hear occasional innuendoes which she could not repel, as his
                  conduct as well as her own gave a color to them, but which she could not dare to
                  say had any foundation in reality, nor could she assert that there was no cause
                  for them.
               On her part, however, the admission must be made that she was completely
                  fascinated, and would gladly have listened to his proposals, had he made any, for
                  he was a widower without any childrenâ€”and those who saw how far her feelings were
                  engrossed (for she could not conceal them from even the most casual observer)
                  wondered how a woman in her position and with her prospects, could fancy such an
                  uncouth, unpolished man, though to her eyes he was the very personation and
                  perfection of nobleness.
               Such, in brief, was the visitor she had just receivedâ€”such their relative
                  positions.
               "It was a terrible blow, Mr. Hardingâ€”so awfully suddenâ€”so entirely unexpected,
                  replied Mrs. Edson, hiding her face in her black-bordered handkerchief.
               "And how does your darling Clara take it?" he inquired, in tones somewhat
                  moderated, and which he intended should
                  convey the most affectionate expression of sympathy with the suffering girl.
               "Poor thing!" sighed the afflicted mother, "she is nearly crazed with grief. You
                  know she was so passionately devoted to her uncle."
               "And Miss Doraâ€”of course she feels her loss?" and he laid a deep emphasis on the
                  "her."
               "Oh, of course. You know how peculiarly she was situated towards my dear brother;
                  and it is very natural she should grieveâ€”the change which it must make in her
                  circumstances is so very great."
               Mr. Harding elevated his eyebrows very slightly at these words; but he made no
                  direct reply, contenting himself with bowing an assent to her remarks, and
                  awaiting the further information which his shrewdness told him these words
                  implied.
               "I have taken the liberty of sending for you on professional business, Mr.
                  Harding," she said, looking as intently at him as he would allow, for his face was
                  partially turned from her; and he was revolving in his mind the possible meaning
                  of the words she had just uttered respecting Dora.
               "You honor me very much, my dear Mrs. Edson," he replied, with well affected
                  warmth; "and I assure you I appreciate the kindness which has prompted you to
                  consult me under such trying circumstances cumstances as those which now surround
                  you. My services, personal and professional, are entirely at your command, as you
                  know I have ever been;" and he bowed with an air which was meant for very courtly
                  grace, but which any casual observer would have construed into the words "I am
                  ready to serve you if it suits me."
               "I felt assured of that, Mr. Harding, or I should not have ventured to consult you
                  in the trying position in which I am now placed. You may not probably be aware
                  that my dear brother died without having made any will?"
               "And you are, if I am not mistaken, his only surviving relative?" he asked, in a
                  very hurried manner, a new light evidently breaking upon him, and visions of
                  future aggrandizement dancing rapidly before his bewildered vision.
               "Except my daughter Clara and myself, he has no relatives on earth."
               "Then of course, madam, you are his legal heir, and sole inheritor of his fortune.
                  It was quite large, I believe?" he queried, endeavoring to conceal his anxiety on
                  this particular point.
               "On that point I am uninformed; and it was for the purpose of instituting the
                  inquiries which may be necessary to
                  establish my lawful rights, that I have sought your valuable aid."
               "You could not have found one who would serve you with more devotion, I assure
                  you, madam. You are sure he left no will?" he queried again, as if doubting what
                  he had heard, yet evidently revolving something in his mind.
               "On the very day of his sudden and awful death, he had given directions to Mr.
                  Lander to draw up a will, which I have seen; but unfortunately he did not survive
                  to execute it. It was sent home in the evening, while he was lying in the house a
                  corpse."
               "Umâ€”ah!â€”not executed;" and he leaned his head upon one hand, stroking his massive
                  chin with the other. "Perhaps you have that paper now?" he continued, in a tone of
                  inquiry.
               "No, I returned it to the clerk who brought it; but I remember the contents
                  perfectly, although in my then excited state I only glanced at it very casually.
                  He gave an annuity of a thousand dollars to myself, and the rest of the property,
                  with one or two trifling exceptions, was equally divided between Clara and Dora.
                  You know, I presume, that in early life he had adopted Dora as his daughter?"
               "Were the necessary legal steps taken to render that adoption binding on him or
                  her?" he queried, with an air of deep interest.
               "No, I am sure there were none. I ought not to say sure, but none that I ever
                  heard of. He took a great fancy to her, and used to tell every one who came that
                  he had adopted her as his daughter; and gradually people came to look upon her as
                  such, and she was treated accordingly. I know that it was by his choice she
                  assumed his name."
               "She has, then, no legal right to the name of Dora Barton?"
               "None whatever, Mr. Harding, as far as I know."
               "What, then, do you propose to do? What do you desire that I should do?"
               "Act in everything for me. Ascertain where and in what my dear brother's property
                  consistsâ€”what amount he has left; and then advise me as to the proper course to be
                  pursued. If there be no will, I shall feel bound in honor to carry out what I have
                  reason to believe were the intentions of my dear kind brother, and that at any
                  sacrifice."
               "You mean me, then, Mrs. Edson, to represent your interests? Is such your
                  intention, and, if so, will you hold yourself bound by my opinions?"
               "Entirely," was the reply, delivered with great emphasis.
               
               "And I will discharge that high and honorable responsibility with zeal, fidelity,
                  and devotion," he said, with a pompous wave of his hand. "But, as to this
                  unexecuted will"â€”â€”
               "What would you advise?"
               "What is your purpose, my dear madam?" and he looked her steadily in the eye.
               "Of course, you know how devotedly my poor, dear brother was attached to Dora, and
                  very naturally I shall feel bound to carry out his wishes with regard to her."
               "You have a daughter, Mrs. Edson?" and he spoke very earnestly, and with another
                  pompous wave of his hand, as if to impress that conviction upon her more
                  deeply.
               "A dear, affectionate child, worthy my heart's warmest love," was the mother's
                  earnest response.
               "A young, beautiful, and accomplished girl"â€”
               "She is so called by many who would flatter her mother."
               "It is no flattery, madam. She is all and more than any mere compliment could
                  convey. Knowing what I do, feeling as I do for you and yours," and here he grew so
                  earnest he seized her hand, and pressing it warmly between both his own, "you ask
                  my advice as to your course"â€”â€”
               "I do not exactly comprehend you," she replied, withdrawing her hand, but so
                  gently as to show she did not intend to give offence. "I must confess I do not see
                  the drift of your remarks."
               "You want me to aid you in doing an act of the grossest injustice to one of the
                  most lovely and amiable of her sex? You ask me to aid you in giving effect to
                  wishes unexpressed, and to carry out intentions which were never consummated? How
                  do you know, madam, that your brother ever intended to sign that will?"
               "Of course, I can only infer it from the fact of his having directed it to be
                  drawn and sent home. At least I so presume, as I know that it was sent here by Mr.
                  Lander, his lawyer."
               "You have no right, Mrs. Edson, to draw inferences, when they bring such
                  disastrous consequences to you and yours. You have no right to act in such an
                  important matter as this, on mere inferences. Pray, my dear madam, can you tell me
                  what possible claims Miss Doraâ€”that's her name, I believe," and he spoke with a
                  half-concealed sneer, "has to one-half of your brother's fortune?"
               "No legal claim, I am perfectly aware; but I know that he was very fond of her.
                  Everybody knew that."
               
               "You have told me before of the manner in which she became an inmate of your
                  familyâ€”but you have never told me who she was."
               "I do not know, and, for the best of reasons, she did not even know herself. She
                  went by the name of the woman who brought her up, or rather who suffered her to
                  beg in the streetsâ€”Laytonâ€”until my poor dear brother adopted her and gave her his
                  name."
               "She knows nothing of her father or mother?" he said, inquiringly.
               "She has not the most remote recollection of either."
               "Then she was, undoubtedly, some foundlingâ€”some nobody's child. Really, my dear
                  Mrs. Edson, I am surprised that a lady of your rare good sense should have felt
                  the need of counsel in such a case;" and he spoke so earnestly, so warmly, and
                  with such evident earnestness, the lady could not but feel that he was sincerely
                  her friend. "One or two questions," he continued, acknowledging her nod of assent
                  to his remarks by a very low bow; "they are necessary to elucidate my point."
               "Certainly, Mr. Harding," replied Mrs. Edson, deferentially.
               "Mr. Barton picked this waif, this nobody's daughter, up in the street? If my
                  memory serves me, that was the manner in which she was introduced into your
                  family?"
               "He did. I remember the occurrence as distinctly as if it had taken place only
                  yesterday."
               "He brought her to his house?"
               Mrs. Edson nodded assent.
               "He has clothed, fed, and educated her from that time forward?"
               Another nod from the lady.
               "He has done for her all that a parent could have done for an only daughter?"
               "She has had every advantage which money could procure, or affection lavish on
                  her."
               "And now, then, madam," he asked, with as much sternness as though he had some
                  poor witness under cross-examination, "can you tell me of anything more which you
                  think he ought to have done?"
               "Nothing that I can think of," was the reply very meekly delivered, for she began
                  to feel the weight of his deep arguments, and a sentiment approaching to awe was
                  creeping over her, as she listened to his outburst of virtuous indignation at the
                  thought of possible injustice being done to herself and Clara for the sake of a
                  nameless stranger, who had no earthly claim on her brother.
               
               "You admit, then, that he has clothed, and fed, and educated herâ€”that he has given
                  her every advantage which affection could dictate or money procure, and surely she
                  could not ask more, considering the peculiarity of the circumstances which
                  surrounded her."
               "I agree with you, Mr. Harding," she said, glad to be convinced so much to her own
                  advantage.
               "Then why ask me, madam, in view of all these facts, to lend my aid in divesting
                  yourself and your daughter of that which by right of blood and affection belongs
                  to you, and you only? I would never, Mrs. Edson, consent to be a party to any such
                  act of injustice, and I cannot give my approbation (pardon my using the word) to
                  the well meant, but false sentiment which would prompt you to carry out what you
                  imagine might have been the wishes of your deceased brother. Madam," he repeated,
                  energetically, with an awful wave of the hand, "I never can!"
               This was delivered in the most approved sentimental style, as adopted by Mr.
                  Harding, and as it was invariably practised by him when he sought to make an
                  impressionâ€”it had its effect upon Mrs. Edson.
               "But, Mr. Harding, what would the world say? Everyone knows how devotedly fond my
                  poor, dear brother was of Dora; she has everywhere passed as his
                  daughterâ€”everywhere been received as suchâ€”treated as such, and now to place her in
                  a position of utter dependence"â€”â€”
               "Oh, by no means, I did not counsel any such course as that. You can settle upon
                  her a few hundred dollarsâ€”that would be more than she would ever have possessed,
                  if chance had not thrown Mr. Barton in her way. Madam, be just before you are
                  generous. This young woman has no earthly claim on you; and, if any sickly
                  sentimentality is to influence you in her behalf, it can only result in gross
                  injustice to your own lovely and accomplished daughter."
               Mrs. Edson mused a few moments over these last remarks, and, without making any
                  direct reply, for she was glad to shift the responsibility on her legal adviser,
                  said:
               "I leave you to take the necessary steps in my behalf, and desire that you should
                  act for me in everything."
               "It will be necessary for me to have your power of attorney, if I am to represent
                  you in such an important matter."
               "Any papers you think right and proper for me to sign, I will give you, as I have the fullest
                  confidence in your integrity and ability."
               "You only do me justice, madam. I will have the necessary papers made out at once,
                  and call with them early to-morrow morning," and with a very warm shake of the
                  hand, and a very earnest recommendation for her not to give way to her grief, he
                  took his leave.
               As he walked away from the house, his portly form seemed to expandâ€”his gait grew
                  more statelyâ€”his head was more erect, and he moved on as one conscious of his
                  growing importanceâ€”one over whom the mantle of fate was about to throw a shadow of
                  greatnessâ€”for he was fully conscious of his standing with Mrs. Edson, and felt
                  sure of her; so sure, he did not intend to compromise himself by an abrupt
                  declaration, until, by virtue of the powers about to be intrusted to him, he was
                  convinced that no will was in existence, and that the property which she would
                  inherit, would compensate him for the sacrifice he would be called on to make in
                  uniting himself with her.
            
            
               Chapter XII.
               Mother and Daughter.
               MRS. EDSON remained seated for a few minutes after Mr. Harding had left the room,
                  evidently lost in thought. She tried very hard to reconcile the convictions of
                  duty urged on her by her conscience, with the suggestions of her legal
                  adviser.
               She was now in law, if not in justice, entitled to the full possession of her
                  deceased brother's large fortune. Dora had no claim upon any portion of itâ€”none
                  certainly which the law would recognizeâ€”and she was consequently thrown upon her
                  charity. Yes, charity; she could find no other word for one who for so many years
                  had been almost a daughter to herâ€”in some things much more than her own daughter
                  had been, for Dora had always been obedient, attentive, and affectionate.
               Her meditations had not reached any culminating point, when they were interrupted
                  by the entrance trance of Clara, who
                  was attired in the deepest and most fashionable of mourning, ready for a
                  promenade, for her grief at the loss of her best friend on earth, had not been so
                  excessive as to drive from her thoughts the necessity of taking exercise; and
                  consequently Madameâ€”â€”, who had the getting up of the mourning dresses for the
                  family, had been compelled to employ additional hands to meet the pressing
                  exactions of Miss Edson, the newly made heiress.
               "What was that pompous old fool doing here, mother?" was the salutation, as she
                  approached the mirror, and proceeded to give the finishing touch to her
                  toilette.
               Mrs. Edson's eyes opened widely at this remark, and she actually stared at her
                  daughter, but without uttering one word; the power of speech was taken from her by
                  the abruptness and impertinence of the question.
               Clara, who saw in the glass the expression on her mother's countenance, pretended
                  not to notice her look of astonishment, but repeated the question, and added, "I
                  hope you are not going to allow him to visit our family?"
               "Well, really, Clara," said her mother, having by this time recovered the use of
                  her voice, "that is the most impertinent remark I have ever heard you make."
               "Why, everybody says the same of him," she replied very quietly, half turning to
                  her mother, but still continuing to arrange a curl, which had gone astray the
                  tenth part of an inch from under her bonnet.
               This was adding insult to injury, for it touched Mrs. Edson in her most tender
                  spotâ€”her vanity; and her eyes fairly flashed as she retorted, "every body is a
                  fool; and if you will take good advice, you will learn to speak more respectfully
                  of that gentleman. He is my legal adviser."
               "Why, Uncle Charles would as soon have thought of admitting a barber to his house
                  as allow that man to enter it. He is, and I repeat it, a pompous old fool; and if
                  you weren't blinded by"â€”â€”
               "That will do, miss," replied her mother tartly, interrupting the sentence. "You
                  will please to remember that I am the legal representative of my dear brother, and
                  the sole inheritor of his property. I can do as I please with my own, miss; and if
                  you are not careful in your language, I may find it necessary to give you some
                  hard lessons in good breeding."
               Mrs. Edson spoke so very sternly, and looked so angry, and the threat held out was so very pointed,
                  Clara wisely forbore to pursue the subject, but apologized to her mother for
                  having spoken in such terms of her friend, and pacified her by the promise not
                  only not to repeat them, but to treat him with the attention due to her mother's
                  friend.
               "You would feel more than ashamed, Clara," said her mother, "if you had heard the
                  high terms in which he spoke of you this morning."
               This flattered Clara's vanity; and when Mrs. Edson made known to her that Mr.
                  Harding had spoken of her as "her lovely and accomplished daughter," her opinion
                  of him underwent an entire change, and mother and daughter parted with feelings of
                  complete reconciliation.
               "I wonder if mother is going to marry that man," Clara muttered, as she closed the
                  front door. "I shouldn't be surprised, I declare. Well, so be it; so long as he
                  acts fairly to me, I don't care. But, oh dear, I don't want a stepfather over me.
                  But what can't be cured must be enduredâ€”so I'll try to make the best of it, and
                  court him for my own sake." And thus soliloquizing, she left the house to meet the
                  sympathy and condolence of her many friends upon the afflicting bereavement which
                  had been visited upon the family.
            
            
               Chapter XIII.
               Another Will.
               DOCTOR THORNTON'S first care after returning from the chamber of death, was to pen
                  a hasty note to Mrs. Arden, recounting the melancholy occurrence of the day, and
                  begging to be excused from attendance on her, until he had performed the last sad
                  offices for his deceased friend.
               Mrs. Arden was inexpressibly shocked at the intelligence of Mr. Barton's awfully
                  sudden death, and her first thought was of Dora. She, of course, knew nothing of
                  Dora's position or circumstances, save that she was the adopted daughter of Mr.
                  Barton, and she was now, more than ever, anxious to learn more of her history.
               Courtesy, however, forbade that she, a stranger, should intrude on such an
                  occasion, much as she longed to be there and comfort the mourner, and she
                  therefore forbore to call upon her; but, if the warm-hearted lady could have known how Dora prayed
                  and longed for her presence and sympathy she would have flown to her on wings of
                  love.
               The doctor's next business was to visit Mr. Lander's residence; for, in his
                  anxiety to serve Dora, he could not wait until that gentleman had acted on the
                  message delivered to him through the coroner.
               He found him at home, and, after the first expressions of surprise and sadness at
                  the sudden affliction which had befallen them, for both were old and attached
                  friends of Mr. Barton, Doctor Thornton came at once to the purport of his
                  visit.
               "He was at my office this afternoon, and told me that, warned by the symptoms of
                  the previous evening, he had sent instructions to you as to the drawing of his
                  will."
               "That is so, but I am sorry to say it was never executed. I sent it to the house
                  by one of my clerks, but poor Barton was dead before it reached him."
               "That is dreadful. I am very sorry for Dora."
               "Of course, it won't make any difference to her. Mrs. Edson owes everything in the
                  world to her brother, and she will feel in duty and in conscience bound to carry
                  out what she knows to be his wishes â€”as expressed in that will, drawn up by his
                  directions."
               "Has she seen the will?"
               "Yes, the clerk very unwisely handed it to her when he learned that Mr. Barton was
                  dead, and, after she had read it, she handed it back to him, with orders to return
                  it to me. By the way, I wonder what he did with his first will?"
               "Good Heavens, Lander!" exclaimed the doctor, springing from his chair, in a high
                  state of excitement, "you don't mean to say there was another will prior to
                  this?"
               "Why, surely, I thought you knew it. You and I were made executors, but I begged
                  him so hard to excuse me, as I had so many pressing duties, he added a codicil
                  revoking my executorship, and stating that it was done at my urgent requestâ€”but
                  leaving you sole executor."
               "You surprise me beyond measure, Mr. Lander," said the worthy doctor, reseating
                  himself, and giving way to a fit of musing. "What was the nature of the first
                  will?" he asked.
               "Everything to Dora, except a thousand a year to his sister, and five hundred to
                  her daughter; and to you he left his pictures and library. I remember ber, at the time he executed it, he
                  told me he was very much offended at Clara's treatment of Dora, and at his sister
                  for upholding her, as he believed."
               "Poor Barton!" sighed the doctor, wiping the tear which this recital had forced to
                  his eyes, "to be cut off just in the very prime of his life and usefulness, with
                  everything so bright and fair before him. Truly, 'Death loves a shining mark.' It
                  was so of a verity in his case. But that will? What do you suppose has become of
                  it? Undoubtedly, he must have destroyed it, or he would not have given
                  instructions to have another drawn. Mrs. Edson, I presume, will take out letters
                  of administration now. Dear Dora! I am afraid hers is a poor chance, if that first
                  will has unfortunately been destroyed. I"â€”â€”
               "I have no doubt it has been, or he would not have been so precise in his
                  directions as to this one. But, don't you think his sister will do what is fair
                  towards Dora?" queried the lawyer, crossing his legs, and looking full in the
                  doctor's face.
               "That depends much on the influence brought to bear on her. I am inclined to think
                  that she is fond of Dora, though I know that Clara hates her with a mortal
                  hatred."
               "And, for what earthly cause?"
               "Jealousy. Dora was much the most beautiful, and drew many admirers from Clara;
                  though I know that ever since she was aware she had a heart, it has been given to
                  my nephew, Arthur, and she has not cared for the attentions of any one else. So
                  Clara might have spared her jealousy on that score."
               "Who will she employ, do you think?"
               "Why, Harding, of course. He has been dancing attendance on her for two or three
                  years, and any one with half an eye could see as plain as day that she was only
                  waiting to be asked, to answer 'yes.'"
               "Then Dora Barton's chances are poor, indeed. He is an unmitigated scampâ€”a
                  disgrace to the profession, and has only managed to be known at all by means of
                  his brazen effrontery and unparalleled impudence. He is thoroughly selfish and
                  unprincipled; and, if what you say is true, and his attentions are likely to be
                  appreciated by Mrs. Edson, Dora will never touch one cent of poor Barton's
                  money:"
               "Thank God, I have enough for her and myself, too, but I trust in Heaven she may receive, at
                  least, simple justice!"
               "Not from Harding, rest assured."
               I think, if that is the case, I had better see Mrs. Edson at once, and appeal to
                  her better feelings, before Harding gets hold of her. If I can wring a promise
                  from her, I will make her keep it. I will call as soon after the funeral as
                  propriety will permit. But that first will annoys me. If I only knew it had been
                  destroyed, I should feel better satisfied."
               "Oh, there is no use in worrying about that. He made it at the time he went South
                  to collect that debt from Holmes and Barnett, fearing he might be delayed there,
                  and be carried off by the fever, and I have no doubt that as soon as he returned,
                  he destroyed it, else why have another drawn up, and one so different in its
                  provisions? It was very thoughtless in me, however, not to have asked him about
                  it, when he was conversing on that subject."
               "I suppose, Lander, there is no use in trying to compel the execution of the will
                  on her part by any legal process?" queried Doctor Thornton, as he arose and took
                  his hat.
               "None, whatever. It would be time and money thrown away. By the way, doctor, who
                  was that queenly beauty at poor Barton's last night. I never saw such a
                  magnificent woman!"
               "Oh!" said the doctor, turning away to conceal the flush which arose to his cheek,
                  "It is a lady from the West, who is staying with Mr. Chapman. Mrs. Arden, from
                  some western city."
               "Well, she is to the western ladies, me judice,
                  so far as I have seen, what Cincinnati is to its citiesâ€”the Queen of the West. She
                  is a perfect Juno. Why don't you move up to her, doctor? You are quite old enough
                  to get married; and your practice, large as it is, would be amazingly increased by
                  such a step. I almost wished there wasn't a Mrs. Lander, when I saw her."
               "Good day, Lander," said the doctor hurriedly, for he felt the hot blood mantling
                  his cheeks, and he could not at his age bear the idea of being bantered. "I will
                  call on you again as soon as I have seen Mrs. Edson;" and without waiting for any
                  reply, the doctor took his departure.
               "Silly fellow!" laughed the lawyer, as the doctor closed the door, "as if anybody
                  could not see that he was desperately in love with that Juno. Well, I wish him
                  successâ€”for I am sure any man on earth might be proud of her, and Doctor Thornton
                  is good enough for any woman living.
                  The deuce take that first will," he suddenly said, rubbing his forehead. "I wonder
                  if Barton did destroy it. Oh, of course he must, or he wouldn't have caused this
                  one to be drawn up. Let me see. He must have left nearly three hundred thousand
                  dollars. Now, if Mrs. Edson is anything of a woman, and respects her brother's
                  memory, she will give Dora at least one-third. Two hundred thousand ought to
                  satisfy even that harpy, Harding, for I have no doubt he will have the fingering
                  of it. Oh, bless that first will; it will run through my brain."
               "Tea, eh?" he said, as his wife, entering his sanctum, interrupted his soliloquy
                  by announcing that social meal; for Mr. Lander, though wealthy, had not grown so
                  fast as to leave comfort behind, and he abominated those six o'clock dinners,
                  which had just then come in vogue. "Do you know, Martha," he said, putting his arm
                  around her waist and kissing her forehead, "I said something very naughty about
                  you a moment ago to Doctor Thornton, who has just left."
               "He didn't believe it, I know," she said, laughing, and parting his hair, on which
                  time had begun to leave a few grey streaks, and kissing him in return.
               "But he did though, I am sure."
               "Then I fine you new dresses for Susan and Martha," she said, laughingly.
               "And what for Susan and Martha's mother?"
               "Oh, I'll take my pay now," and she kissed him again with all the warmth of
                  unchanged love.
               "I'll pay the fine and tell you what it was. You remember that noble looking woman
                  at poor Barton's last night?"
               "Of course I do. But why do you say poor Barton; I am sure he is rich enough to be
                  happy, if wealth can confer happiness."
               "Good God, Martha; I quite forgot to tell you Barton is dead."
               "Dead, Robert!" exclaimed his wife aghast. "You cannot mean that."
               "Sure as Gospel, my dear; I would not jest on such a topic. He was at my office
                  this morning, and said that from certain symptoms he observed last night, he was
                  confident he had disease of the heart, and might drop off very suddenly. With this
                  apprehension before him he gave me directions to draw up his will, and bring or
                  send it to his house this evening. I sent it before six o'clock, but it was too
                  late. He had fallen dead an hour before it reached the house."
               
               "Then, Mrs. Edson will inherit all of his large property."
               "All she does not give to Dora."
               "All she does not give!â€”All she does give, Robert, you may put in my thimble, if
                  it depends on her."
               "Do you really think so?"
               "Let a woman alone to find out a woman's feelings. Why, Mrs. Edson idolizes Clara,
                  and Clara perfectly hates Dora, and has shown it unmistakably for years past. Any
                  one can see it is from mere jealousy of her beauty and superior attractions; but
                  her hatred is so intense, she misses no opportunity of abusing her behind her
                  back. Why, I have heard Clara in her mother's presence call her an upstartâ€”a
                  nobodyâ€”a nobody's childâ€”a charity girlâ€”and such names; and her mother made no
                  attempt whatever to check her. No, no. Mark my words: when Clara Edson finds out,
                  as she will, that the law makes her mother sole heiress, she will never give her
                  consent that Dora shall receive one dollar to keep her from the Alms House. There,
                  now you know my mind; tell me what it was you were saying of me."
               "Upon my word, Martha, you have so frightened me about Dora, I hardly know what I
                  said. What was I talking about?"
               "Why, that you had been saying naughty things of me to Doctor Thornton, and that
                  he believed them, and then I fined you dresses for Susan and Martha. There, is not
                  that very brief and lawyerlike?"
               "Very like a lawyer's wife. Well, I was speaking to Thornton of that splendid
                  woman we saw at Barton's last night, Mrs. Arden; and I was joking him about her,
                  for any one could see that she could lead him the world over with a hair; and I
                  told him that when I saw her I almost wished there was no Mrs. Lander."
               "Well, pay your fine and I forgive you; for I saw a gentleman there last night,
                  and I used precisely the same expression, only I said I wished there was no Mr.
                  Lander;" and with another kiss she led him to the tea-table, where Susan and
                  Martha were promptly informed that early on the morrow she would take them to
                  Stewart's, and allow them to select each a new dress.
               "You don't think you are mistaken, Martha," said Mr. Lander, between his
                  mouthfuls, "about Mrs. Edson?"
               "Mistakenâ€”of course not. You consult your law books, and find authorities there
                  for your assertionsâ€”I consult the book of nature and the human heart, and need not look beyond. Why, if what I
                  said of Clara was not true, as I know it to be, there's that lawyer, Harding. Mrs.
                  Edson has been dying for him these two years, poor fool as she is; and now that
                  she is rich, he will snap her up before any one has a chance to make an offer.
                  Once he gets hold of her money, Dora's share will dwindle down to a point so fine
                  you will need a very powerful microscope to discover it. Mark my words, Mr.
                  Lawyer; and I will put my woman's wit against a lawyer's learning for anything you
                  choose to venture."
               "I hope you may be mistaken, Martha," he said sadly. "Dora is such a dear, good
                  girl; and to see her thrust upon the world alone and unprotected would be
                  terrible."
               "She wouldn't remain alone and unprotected long. Arthur Randolph has been her
                  devoted slave these two years, and he is too much of a man, and too much like his
                  uncle, to desert his chosen one because misfortune may have overtaken her. Mark my
                  words again, and have no fear for Dora, Mr. Lawyer, and I shall not charge you
                  anything for my opinion."
            
            
               Chapter XIV.
               The Story of a Life.
               ON the day following the funeral of Mr. Barton, Doctor Thornton, who had practised
                  a large share of self-denial in not calling before, paid a visit to Mrs. Ardenâ€”and
                  was received by her with a warmth and cordiality which led him to hope that the
                  unwavering constancy of nineteen years had been properly appreciated, and might
                  not go unrewarded.
               "What a sad, awful visitation, doctor," she said, after the customary salutations
                  had been exchanged. "I was shocked beyond measure on the receipt of your
                  note."
               "Yes, madam; and it only adds another to the daily and hourly evidences brought
                  home to us, that in the midst of life we are in death. It seems that my poor
                  friend had been partially aware of his condition for a long time, but laid his
                  troubles to other causes, and therefore
                  delayed taking medical advice until he was beyond the reach of human aid. He only
                  realized the sad certainty on the night of the party, where we met for the second
                  time," and he emphasized his last words very pointedly.
               "What a terrible contrast it must have presented to his mind. The uncertainty of
                  life to be thus forced upon him in the very midst of his gaiety and happiness. How
                  truly it is said, 'we know not what a day may bring forth.' And how is dear Dora?
                  You cannot imagine, doctor, how I seemed to be drawn in spite of myself to that
                  lovely girl. Is she not truly a noble girl?"
               "She is worthy of all your love, Mrs. Arden; and I much fear she will need friends
                  now. Such friendship as I know you feel for her, will be most grateful to her
                  under this affliction."
               "Need friends! Why, doctor, she must always command friends! But surely Mr. Barton
                  has made ample provision for her; he seemed devotedly attached to her."
               "His last wish I know was to do so, for on the very morning of his death he had
                  caused his will to be drawn up, bequeathing half of his entire fortune to
                  her."
               "And is not that enough for her largest wants?"
               "Unfortunately, my poor friend did not live to execute that will; and as he died
                  intestate, to use a lawyer's phrase, his sister, Mrs. Edson, as his only surviving
                  relative, becomes heir at law, and comes into possession of the entire estateâ€”and
                  it is very large I know."
               "That is unfortunate," she replied, half musingly.
               "Do you think Dora would receive me," she continued, after a pause of a few
                  moments, which Dr. Thornton had not interrupted.
               "She would be more than delighted to see you, for I assure you that your kind
                  feelings for her are reciprocated with all the warmth and earnestness of her pure
                  and generous nature. She so longed for you before the funeral."
               "I will call at the earliest opportunity. And now, doctor," she continued, a
                  slight blush mantling her cheek, "since I saw you I have had ample time for
                  reflection, and I find no cause to regret having offered to place you in
                  possession of such portions of my history as you are entitled to know."
               "I make no claims, Mrs. Arden," he said very earnestly, "except such as you may
                  allow to nineteen years of unswerving fidelity to one object," and he drew forth
                  the locket containing her hair."
               A faint blush mantled Mrs. Arden's cheek, and a smile lighted up her beautiful features, for her
                  woman's heart was not proof against such an evidence of constancy; but she made no
                  direct reply to this remark.
               "I will be very brief, doctor; and leave particular details for some more suitable
                  occasion.
               "Of my birth and early years it is unnecessary to go into details, except to say
                  that in point of wealth and social standing my parents held the first rank in the
                  city where I was born. My father died when I was not quite four years old, leaving
                  his entire fortune to my mother, with reversion to myself after her death.
               "At the age of sixteen, I was sent to a large boarding-school in an interior town
                  of Kentucky, where there were some sixty young ladies, from every section of the
                  country; and as it was soon ascertained that I had abundant means at my command,
                  and was prospective heiress of a very large fortune, I had plenty of sycophants
                  and admirers.
               "I was naturally of a gay, reckless, impulsive disposition; and I was not long in
                  discovering that I could do almost anything with impunity, as it was known that I
                  was an heiress, with very large expectations.
               "I was encouraged in many acts of mischief and downright rebellion by some of the
                  older scholars, who ought to have known better, and I played many pranks, the
                  remembrance of which in after years has caused me to blush, and of which I have
                  been heartily ashamed, though I scarcely ought to blame myself, I was so led by
                  others.
               "I grew up thus absolutely wild, for no restraint which I heeded was put upon me;
                  and although I learned all my lessons, and received high marks of approbation for
                  my proficiency, I cannot but look back upon the time spent there, as worse than
                  lost.
               "It was a practice in the school to give musical soirees once a month, to which
                  the leading families of the town were invited; and as I had always been
                  passionately fond of music, I soon became a great proficient, and in fact stood as
                  the acknowledged head of the school in that accomplishment.
               "At one of these exhibitions, for I can only term them such, after I had concluded
                  a favorite song, I was applauded to the echo, and one gentleman continued his
                  manifestations of approval so long, I turned my eyes involuntarily to the quarter
                  whence they proceeded, and I met the gaze of the gentleman, who in truth had
                  attracted universal attention by the fervor of his applause, fixed upon me with an
                  intensity which drew the color to my cheeks.
               
               "I was compelled to repeat the song; and I can remember, even now, after the lapse
                  of so many years, that my pride and vanity were so flattered by the applause
                  bestowed upon me, I sang it infinitely better the second time than I did the
                  first.
               "After the musical performances had concluded, one of the teachers approached me,
                  bringing with her the gentleman whose loud and long-continued applause had
                  attracted my attentionâ€”as, indeed, it had that of every person in the roomâ€”and
                  introduced him to me as Mr. Edward Armstrong; and, while he was acknowledging the
                  introduction, she managed to whisper to me that he was the only son of a wealthy
                  planter in Louisiana, and had begged the pleasure of my acquaintance.
               "I felt my color come under the ardor of his gaze; and, as the teacher left us
                  alone, we were soon engrossed in an animated conversation.
               "He paid me the most fulsome compliments, and knowing apparently, or rather
                  reading my disposition, he had not been half an hour in my company, before he
                  boldly declared that he had never met a lady who had made so deep and lasting an
                  impression upon himâ€”that the moment he saw me, he felt that his destiny was fixed,
                  and that he could never have left the town without telling me how much he longed
                  to know me, and how he meant to strive to win me.
               "I was only seventeenâ€”young, ardent, impulsive, and impassioned. Mr. Armstrong was
                  one of the handsomest men I had ever seen, and there was an earnestness, a
                  sincerity in his passionate manner, which won me in spite of myself; and, if I did
                  not by words give him any direct encouragement, I am sure I must have done so with
                  my eyes, for, as he saw the party was about breaking up, he asked if he was not to
                  be permitted to have the happiness of seeing me soon again?
               "I told him that the scholars were restricted by certain rules, but that I walked
                  out very often accompanied by the teacher who had introduced him to me, and that
                  with her permission, he might see me when I was out with her.
               "'Oh,' he said, laughing, 'I can manage your duenna, I dare say, now that I have
                  your permission,' and, with a warm pressure of the hand, he took leave of me, and
                  I saw him cross over to the teacher through whom he had been introduced; and he
                  soon contrived to draw her aside and engage her in conversation, apart from the
                  rest of the company.
               "I knew well what was his object in accosting her, and, girl-like, admired his impetuous
                  boldness, which I construed into an evidence of his ardent love; and, while he was
                  conversing with her, my eyes were fixed upon him, and I gave way to the most
                  delicious reveries. In fact, I had been wooed and won in the short space of one
                  evening; for, so far as I knew my own feelings, every thought and impulse was
                  given to the handsome and engaging stranger.
               "Before we retired for the night, Miss Dubois (the teacher to whom I have
                  referred), drew me aside on some trifling pretext, and rallying me on the rapid
                  conquest I had made, said that Mr. Armstrong had been urging her to bring me out
                  on the following evening; and, looking into my eyes with a singular expression on
                  her countenance, she inquired, if I thought it would be prudent to grant his
                  request?
               "My heightened color and sparkling eyes, told her how gladly I heard and acceded
                  to the proposition, and, without further remark, we parted for the night.
               "On the next day, I found it impossible to fix my mind upon my studies, or, in
                  fact, upon any thing or any one but my first-lover, for such I counted him. I was
                  rallied every half hour during the day for my absent-mindedness, but I did not
                  heed it, for I was thinking of Edward Armstrong. I loved him with all the
                  intensity of my nature, and felt that I was beloved, and cared for nothing else.
                  Remember, Doctor Thornton, I was an impetuous, ardent girl, and had never been
                  taught or trained to restrain my feelings. I am telling sad truths, and I tell
                  them without concealment, for you are entitled to my fullest confidence.
               "Oh, how heavily the hours dragged! It seemed as if I had never passed so long a
                  day, and my heart leaped for joy when the exercises of the school were over, and I
                  could retire to my own room, and give free play to my thoughts.
               "My whole heartâ€”every feeling, thought, and impulse of my nature was engrossed by
                  this new and absorbing passion, and I actually longed for the hour to arrive when
                  I was to meet the burning gaze of Mr. Armstrong fixed upon me, and hear his soft
                  voice pour out his tale of passionate love.
               "We met, of course, for he was watching for me, and Miss Dubois was so
                  considerate, for so I then construed her conduct (though I afterwards learned that
                  she was heavily bribed to lend her aid) as to find some business in the village; and, excusing
                  herself for leaving us, said she would be sure to overtake us before we had gone
                  very far.
               "And, now that we were entirely alone, Mr. Armstrong poured out his whole heart,
                  and declared his passion for me. He had seen manyâ€”had known many, but had never
                  loved, and now he loved me with an intensity which nothing could subdueâ€”a devotion
                  which nothing could change! He was earnest, impassioned, and so ardentâ€”so wildly,
                  madly passionateâ€”so urgent in his appeals, I could not resist; and, on the second
                  evening I had ever seen him, I told him that every feeling of his heart was warmly
                  reciprocated by my ownâ€”that I loved him with a passion as strong as that which he
                  declared for me, and was thenceforward his and his only for ever!
               "He urged me to an immediate marriage. He said we knew each other's hearts as well
                  now, as we ever shouldâ€”that Providence had thrown us togetherâ€”that each had read
                  the other's heartâ€”that our feelings, impulses, and sympathies harmonized from the
                  first, and that a greater share of happiness would enure to those who had loved as
                  we did, whose love sprang fresh from the heart, than ever fell to the lot of those
                  whose love was fostered and cherished and nourished by years of acquaintance and
                  daily intercourse.
               "I told him it was madnessâ€”folly, to think of such a step, nowâ€”that I was but
                  seventeen, and that we knew nothing of each other's tempers or dispositionsâ€”a year
                  or two would enable us to study each other's charactersâ€”that I was but a
                  half-educated school-girl, and that under no consideration would I consent to
                  marry him without first consulting my only parentâ€”much as I loved him.
               "He argued, and urged, and pleaded. He accused me of trifling with him, swore I
                  did not love him, and declared that if I did not consent to become his wife
                  without delay, he would put an end to himself, for life without me would be of no
                  value to him.
               "In vain I urged that I knew my mother would never consent to a marriage with a
                  perfect stranger, on such a short acquaintance, and my own heart, much as it was
                  devoted to him, told me it would be madness; but when I resolutely persisted in
                  refusing to unite myself to him until I had at least written to my mother, he
                  stormed and raved, and swore he would destroy himself.
               "At this juncture. Miss Dubois made her appearance ance, and Mr. Armstrong, with the practised ease of
                  one who had large experience in the world, at once turned the conversation into
                  common-place topics; but even these, to my charmed ear, he invested with the most
                  marvellous interest.
               "Immediately on reaching the school, I sat down in my room and penned a long
                  letter to my mother, informing her of my meeting with Mr. Armstrong, and of his
                  declaration of love for me. I did not tell her how often, or rather, how very
                  little I had seen of him; but I added that every feeling of my heart was
                  engrossedâ€”that I loved him to desperation, and could never know an instant of
                  happiness without him. I added, that from what I had heard, (Miss Dubois was my
                  informant), I had every reason to believe that he was my equal in wealth,
                  standing, and social positionâ€”being the only son of a wealthy Southern planter. I
                  implored her to consent to my immediate marriage, as the happiness of my whole
                  life depended on my union with the man to whom every feeling of my heart was
                  given.
               "This letter I dispatched to the office that very night, by one of the servants
                  attached to the school, and retired to my bed to dream of Edward Armstrong and the
                  happiness, which a union with him would ensure to me.
               "On the next evening, Miss Dubois called me aside, and slily placed in my hand a
                  letter. The sight of it kindled anew the slumbering fires of love within me, and,
                  blushing, I hastily ran to my room to peruse it.
               "Of course it was from Edward, and it breathed the most ardent protestations of
                  undying love. He was sick at heart at the thought of having pained or offended me;
                  and begged me, if I really loved him or valued his peace of mind, to grant him an
                  interview that evening, alone.
               "This last request he urged with the most passionate entreaties; and he added,
                  that daring to confide in the strength of my love for him, he had arranged with
                  Miss Dubois to be admitted into the garden after the household had retired.
               "His perseveranceâ€”his devotionâ€”his professions of passionate love for me, overcame
                  all prudential scruples, and I blindly committed myself to the charge of Miss
                  Dubois, to whom I communicated that portion of the letter which connected her with
                  our intercourse.
               "I met him at the lower end of the garden, Miss Dubois keeping watch at a
                  distance, and again were his entreaties for an immediate marriage renewed.
               "I told him that I had written to my mother, naming briefly the tenor of the letter, and if I
                  had not been utterly blinded by the violence of my passion for him, the manner in
                  which he received that intelligence would have opened my eyes to his true
                  character.
               "He turned pale, and bit his lips until the blood almost came, and half-muttered
                  oaths escaped him. But he soon composed himself, and resumed his entreaties.
               "Doctor Thornton, there is no use of dilating upon this portion of my history. My
                  own wild, passionate love for him, aided by his arguments and pleadings, overcame
                  my objections and conquered my scruples, and in an evil hour I consented to wed
                  him on the following evening, on receiving his promise to keep our marriage secret
                  until I had won my mother's consent, which I assured him I could secure, or at
                  least fancied I could.
               "To this he cheerfully assented, and pressing me to his heart, swore by the most
                  terrible oaths, that he would ever prove worthy of my love and confidence.
               "To make this short, Doctor, on the following evening, with a heart trembling
                  between love and fear, for I could not feel that I was doing right, though I was
                  completely carried away by my passion sion for him, I met Mr. Armstrong, and
                  taking me to a house on the outskirts of the town, we were there married by a
                  travelling Methodist minister, whom he had found, and whom he had bribed to
                  perform the ceremony, without asking any questions.
               "After the ceremony was performed, the minister handed me a certificate, and Miss
                  Dubois, who had accompanied me as a witness, left, saying that she should return
                  in the course of a couple of hours, and I was alone with my husband."
            
            
               
               Chapter XV.
               The Story of a Lifeâ€”(continued).
               "I MET my husband every evening, with the connivance and aid of Miss Dubois, and
                  in his presence, and soothed by his caresses and protestations of unchangeable
                  love, I forgot all the world beside.
               "But I was aroused from my blissful dreams by the unexpected arrival of my mother.
                  Instead of answering my letter, the moment she received it she packed a small
                  trunk, and taking with her one of the old family servantsâ€”a favorite slaveâ€”started
                  for the town where our school was located.
               "Her first step as soon she reached the place, (and this I did not learn until
                  long afterwards) was to call upon one of the leading gentlemen in the town, and to
                  whom she was well-known by name and reputation. To him she made known that her
                  daughter's affections had been engrossed by a stranger, and she desired him as a
                  parent and as a gentleman, to make every inquiry concerning him, and to inform her
                  by letterâ€”a request with which he complied most faithfully and promptly.
               "Her next visit was to the school, where she was received with all the courtesies
                  and homage which were thought due to her wealth and standing; but, repelling them
                  all with a cold hauteur, she desired to have me sent to her, and wished to be
                  alone with me.
               "Fortunately, the message reached me through Miss Dubois, and I was thus put upon
                  my guard; and, in answer to her earnest entreaties not to betray her, and thus
                  compel her to forfeit her situation, I not only promised to keep her share of the
                  transaction a profound secret, but to reward her most liberally for the kindness
                  she had manifested from first to last, when I was in a position to do so.
               "Thus forewarned, I entered the parlor where my mother was seated; and, though
                  conscious of my wrongâ€”nay, my guiltâ€”I strove to compose myself, and, as I opened
                  the door, sprang forward to meet her embrace, which had never before been
                  withheld.
               "But she arose, with a stern, contemptuous look, such as I had never seen her
                  wear; and, scanning me from head to foot, with a glance beneath which I quailed in conscious guilt, she
                  sternly bade me be seated, an order with which I was too glad to comply, for I
                  trembled so excessively, I could scarcely stand.
               "'I received a letter from you a few days since.'
               "'Yes, ma,' was all I could reply.
               "'Have you seen that person since you wrote to me?'
               "'Yes, ma,' I said, hanging down my headâ€”for I felt that her searching glance was
                  upon me, reading my very soul.
               "'How often, miss?'
               "'Very often, mother.'
               "'Do you know anything concerning him more than you wrote?'
               "'Nothing, mother, except that I know he loves me most devotedly, and I love him
                  with all my heart.'
               "'Pshaw!â€”go to your roomâ€”pack up your things, and be ready to return home with me
                  this afternoon.'
               "'Oh, mother!' I commenced, but she cut me short, simply saying:
               "'Go, and do as you are bid. I will hear all you have to say when you reach home.
                  Go,' and she arose and rang the bell, which was promptly answered by a servant.
                  'Tell Mrs. Gleason (the principal) I wish to see her,' and, turning to me, as I
                  sat there mute and dumb-founded, she said: 'Did you hear me, Ellen? Go, pack up
                  your things.'
               "'Oh, mother, may I not see him before I go!' I exclaimed, bursting in tears.
               "'No,' said my mother, less sternly, however, than before: 'No, my dear. Do as
                  your mother bids youâ€”she acts only for your good.
               "'Won't you kiss me, mother,' I said, rising and approaching her, and without a
                  word, though I saw that her frame trembled with emotion, she strained me to her
                  breast, and then turning to conceal the tears which I felt were rising to her
                  eyes, she said:
               "'Go, my dear, and do as your mother bids you.'
               "I left the room with more cheerfulness than I had entered it, for my mother had
                  spoken kindly to me; and, on the way to my own apartment, I met Miss Dubois, who
                  had been anxiously awaiting the result of the interview.
               "'Come to my room,' I said, hastily, wiping my eyes, which were filled with tears,
                  'and I will tell you all. I want to see you.'
               "She followed me to my room, under pretence of assisting me to pack up, and I
                     communicated to her my mother's
                  orders. I begged her to see Edwardâ€”to assure him of my unchangeable love, and to
                  conjure him, as he valued my happiness, not to attempt to communicate with me
                  until he heard from me, which would be done through her, as soon as I could
                  possibly find the opportunity to write.
               "She promised to execute my commands faithfully; and, renewing the assurance on my
                  part, not to betray her agency as to my acquaintance and marriage with Edward, but
                  to reward her most liberally for her faithful services, I gave her a thousand
                  messages of love for my husband, and she left the room.
               "I departed with my mother that afternoon, but my heart was filled with the
                  saddest forebodings. My mother's sternness had measurably relaxed, but even her
                  kindness failed to cheer me, and several times during the ride, tears
                  involuntarily gathered in my eyes.
               "We reached our home in safety, and my first duty was to communicate with Edward
                  and Miss Dubois. To my husband I conveyed assurances of undying love, and bade him
                  be of good cheer. I strove to comfort him by the assurance that my influence with
                  my mother would bring everything thing to a happy termination; but I forbade him,
                  under penalty of causing me the most bitter pain and sufferings, to make any
                  present attempt to see me, or even to write to me, as any letters would surely be
                  intercepted; and I wrote in the same strain to Miss Dubois.
               "I managed to have these letters sent to the post-office undetected, but all
                  subsequent attempts at correspondence were foiled by the watchfulness of my
                  mother.
               "Matters remained thus for several months, and I cannot depict the sufferings I
                  underwent in that time. I had not received one word from my husband, nor from Miss
                  Dubois, and I was in constant dread lest they had written, and their letters had
                  fallen into my mother's hands.
               "I passed the greater part of my time in tears and mourning, and often started up
                  with the determination to make a full confession to my mother, to ask her pardon
                  for my fault, and implore her to allow my husband to come and see me; but her
                  sternness, her haughtiness, forbade the attempt, and I could only go back to my
                  tears and sadness.
               "My mother noticed my grief, and it touched her heart, for she strove to cheer and
                  comfort me, assuring me that in time I would cease to think of him who, she now so plainly saw, filled all my
                  thoughtsâ€”that I was so young, so unused to the worldâ€”I had seen so little of
                  mankindâ€”had been so little in society, I did not know my own mind or heartâ€”and she
                  was sure I would find some one more worthy of my affection.
               "I could only answer, amid tears and sobs, that I loved Edward, and him onlyâ€”that
                  I knew him to be worthy of my loveâ€”and I assured her that she was killing me by
                  inches by separating me from him.
               "'You would not, you could not, truly love him, my daughter, if you knew him to be
                  unworthy of you?' she inquired affectionately.
               "'That could not be, motherâ€”I know it could not. He is all that is noble, and
                  generous, and honorable in man, and I feel that I can never love another.'
               "'If I should prove to my daughter,' continued my mother, 'that Edward Armstrong
                  was a gambler by profession, a rouÃ© and libertine by choice, and a man devoid of
                  all principle, what would she say?'
               "'That the proofs were manufactured, mother; for my heart could not receive them
                  as truths.'
               "'Then read that,' she said, drawing a letter from her pocket, 'and if your heart
                  persists in its mad course, at least let self-respect have some sway over your
                  conduct, for the sake of your name, your mother, and your family,' and she placed
                  it in my outstretched, trembling hand.
               "It was dated several weeks back, and was from the gentleman in the town where I
                  had been at school, to whom she had first applied for evidence concerning the
                  character of Mr. Armstrong.
               "It declared him, as my mother had hinted, a gambler by profession, an
                  unprincipled libertine, and a man generally of a character so notoriously bad,
                  that no lady who had any respect for her reputation would be seen in his
                  company.
               "I read it through to the last word. I dared not disbelieve itâ€”I would not believe
                  it; and the conflicting emotions which excited me were too strong for me to bear
                  in my then nervous and enfeebled state. The last thing I remembered was my mother
                  gazing at me with looks in which sternness and compassion were strangely blended,
                  and in another moment I fell upon the floor in a swoon.

               The Story of a Life, Concluded.
               "BUT I know I must weary you, doctor," continued Mrs. Arden, wiping from her eyes
                  the tears which the remembrance of her sorrows and sufferings had caused. "I will
                  be brief with the remainder of what I have to narrate.
               "I believed, of course, that this character of the man to whom I had given my
                  heart and hand had been fabricated in order to wean me from him; but feeling in my
                  heart that injustice had been committed, I loved him more than ever, for the very
                  wrongs which I supposed had been done to himâ€”and began to study how I could escape
                  the vigilance of my mother, and communicate with my husband, for I so longed to be
                  near him again, the world seemed blank without his presence.
               "One day while I was seated in my room, seemingly employed in sewing, but in
                  reality thinking o my husband, and vainly striving to devise some plan by which I
                  might meet him once more, or at least communicate with him, my mother entered the
                  apartment, and handing me a newspaper which she had just received, directed my
                  attention to an article which she had marked; and with an expression of
                  countenance which I could not then define, she turned, and left me to myself,
                  without having uttered one word.
               "Doctor Thornton, it was a corroboration of all my mother had heard, and which I
                  had read. It was the narrative of a fight between the citizens of a town in
                  Louisiana and some gamblers, in which many were wounded on both sides, and several
                  of the gamblers had been killed.
               "Among the list of those killed stood conspicuous the name of my husband, who was
                  there described as a handsome, polished gentleman in appearance, but one known
                  throughout that section of the country as one of the most desperate gamblers and
                  unprincipled villains of the whole gang; and his death was the cause of special
                  rejoicing on the part of the citizens, who looked upon him as a moral scourge.
               "In order to dispel any doubt which might have rested on my mind as to his
                  identity, the article cle mentioned the
                  fact that he had a short time previously been engaged in an affray in Kentucky,
                  (and the town was named where I had first met him,) in which he had mortally
                  wounded a young gentleman who had offended him by refusing to gamble with him,
                  alleging that he had cheated at play.
               "I saw at once that this must be truth; and, oh, how my conscience smote me for
                  the deceit I had practised upon my doting mother.
               "I had but one course left. My whole nature was changed by the revelation thus
                  strangely made to me. I loathed the very name of him who but an hour before had
                  been enshrined as the idol of my heart.
               "I did not falter or tremble, but with firm step and determined air I proceeded at
                  once to my mother's room.
               "Holding the paper at arm's length, I pointed to her the paragraph to which she
                  had called my attention, and which had wrought such a fearful change in me, and
                  simply saying,
               "'Mother, that man was my husband,' I stood before her, awaiting her reply.
               "She staredâ€”no, doctor, she fairly glared at me for an instant, as if she would
                  annihilate me; then turning from me, she gasped a moment for breath, and fell
                  heavily to the floor in a fit of apoplexy.
               "It was several weeks before she recovered sufficiently to converse with me, and
                  then at her request I narrated everything from our first meeting to the subsequent
                  and disastrous consequences which had followed it, not forgetting the complicity
                  of Miss Dubois, by whom I felt I had been betrayed into a marriage with one whose
                  character was well known to her. I never had a doubt that she had been heavily
                  bribed to act as she had done.
               "My mother threw her arms around my neck, and poured out her very soul in tears.
                  She was a proud and haughty woman, doctor; and the idea of having such a disgrace,
                  as her daughter's marriage with a notorious gambler, entailed upon her family,
                  almost crushed her.
               "She rose superior, however, to her feelings; and exacted from me a promise that I
                  would be guided by her for the future in all things. But when I told her that I
                  expected to become a mother, her excitement and anger were so great I feared she
                  would relapse into another fit.
               "It passed over, however; and from that hour her whole course towards me changed.
                  She was not less affectionate at heart, but she was so imperious rious, so haughty, so commanding, I almost dreaded
                  to come into her presence.
               "Without giving me any notice of her intentions, she ordered me to pack my things,
                  and in a few days I found myself in New York. While there I was directed to keep
                  myself closely secluded, and for the whole time I resided in this city, I never
                  once crossed the threshold of the door of the house in which I dwelt, and even its
                  inmates were scarcely ever permitted to see me.
               "You know when my babe was born, doctor; and you had an opportunity of judging
                  something of my mother's character and temper. You remarked, as you have told me,
                  that she would never permit you to be alone with me one moment. You knew her only
                  as Mrs. Rushmore, and myself as her daughter Ellen.
               "I noticed the interest you seemed to take in me from the first, and longed for
                  the opportunity of thanking you for your kind and considerate attention; and I
                  certainly should have done so but that your name never passed my mother's lips,
                  and I never had the opportunity to ask you, nor dared I ask her, so much did I
                  stand in dread of her. When my child was about five weeks old, my mother took her
                  from me, and left the house saying she had found a nurse to take charge of it; and
                  from the moment I saw her depart with the infant in her arms until the present
                  hour I have never seen nor heard of her."
               Here Mrs. Arden gave way to a violent burst of tears, which Dr. Thornton made no
                  effort to repress, for he could well imagine what emotions such remembrances would
                  naturally excite.
               "On the day following," she continued, "we started homewards, and in answer to all
                  my inquiries for my child, my mother only responded, that it would doubtless be
                  well cared for, and that I ought to feel but too grateful to her for having saved
                  me from the shame I had brought upon myself, and the disgrace which would have
                  been entailed upon our name and family had my marriage with such an infamous
                  character been publicly known.
               "Soon after our return home we received information that Miss Dubois had been
                  drowned, while on a sailing excursion, and thus the only living witness to my
                  marriage was removed. On learning this, my mother, who had seen my certificate of
                  marriage, demanded it of me, and when I tremblingly handed it to her, she tore it
                  into a thousand shreds, and exclaimed, 'thus perish every memento of my daughter's
                  folly and shame!'
               
               "My mother survived these events only two years, and in her last sickness, I
                  entreated her as she hoped for mercy to give me some tidings of my babe, but she
                  died resolute in her refusal to make any communication concerning her.
               "I have hoped, and wished, and prayed, that Heaven would grant me a sight of her
                  once more if living, or that I might know if she was dead, and, oh, Doctor, you
                  would pity me, if you could but know what I have sufferedâ€”what remorse I have
                  endured on her account; and you will believe me when I say that I have made every
                  earthly effort, aided by money freely spent, to discover her, if living, or to
                  ascertain if she had died."
               "I do from my inmost heart pity and sympathize with you, my dear madam," replied
                  the doctor, earnestly. "But, pray tell me, how I find you Mrs. Arden, when your
                  husband's name was Armstrong?"
               "You did not understand aright, doctor. I was introduced as Miss Arden, but I
                  suppose you thought from my age that I must be married or a widow, and so gave me
                  the more appropriate appellation. As I had never changed my name after my marriage
                  with Mr. Armstrong, I retained it after his death.
               "And now, doctor, you are the only living soul who knows thus much of my history.
                  I thank you from my heart for the consideration which kept you from disclosing
                  yourself on the evening of our first meeting. It was nobly, generously done, and
                  in perfect keeping with your entire conduct towards me. How can I ever repay
                  you?"
               "By permitting me to hope, Miss Arden, that the interest so constantly felt for
                  you, for nineteen years, may be appreciated, and by allowing me to look forward to
                  the possible realization of the dream I have so long cherished. Miss Arden, the
                  feelings I entertain for you are of no common order. They have urged and
                  stimulated me for many years, and now that success has crowned my effortsâ€”now that
                  I find myself at last your social equal, let me look forward to the time when you
                  will feel that you may reward my constancy, as you only can reward it."
               "Doctor Thornton," she said, placing her hand in his own, with noble frankness,
                  and gazing kindly in his face, "you are worthy a better wife than I can ever be to
                  you. But I should be less than human if I failed to appreciate such fidelity and
                  devotion. I may not say I love you, for at my age love is a feeling which does not
                  spring spontaneously from the heart, as
                  with ardent and impulsive youth; but I honor, respect, and esteem you; and with
                  those feelings, receive my pledge to become your wife, if you continue to feel
                  that I am necessary to your happiness. But do not misjudge me for being so frank
                  on so short an acquaintance."
               "Short, dear lady," said the now happy doctor, imprinting a kiss upon her hand,
                  which he still retained; "I do not think nineteen years a very short courtship.
                  Remember," and drawing forth the locket, he held it up to her view, "that for
                  nineteen years this has been worn next my heart, and that the image of her, which
                  was stamped there then, is unfadingly fresh as it was the day the first impression
                  was made. I take you at your word, Miss Arden, and when you feel me worthy of the
                  high boon I ask, I will claim it."
               "There, then," she said, as he again saluted her hand, "that will do. Now, as your
                  business is settled, a few words as to mine and Dora's. In the first place, you
                  will have a great deal of care on my account, as my property is very large, and
                  widely scattered throughout the West."
               "I will try and manage that."
               "Then there is Dora. I can say to you now in perfect frankness, I never saw a
                  young person in whom I was so deeply interested as I have been in her from the
                  moment I saw her."
               "I can't condemn you for that, I'm sure; for I know her to be worthy of all the
                  love you could bestow upon her. A more loving, faithful, dutiful, obedient and
                  devoted child never lived than she has been to Mr. Barton, and she was to him as
                  the very apple of his eye. But do you know that I have great fears for her?"
               "In what regard?"
               "Mr. Barton died intestate, and of course, by law, his large estate goes entirely
                  to his sister, Mrs. Edson."
               "What the mother of Clara?"
               "Yes."
               "I am sorry for that; for if I dare express any opinion on so short an opportunity
                  for observation, I should say that Dora has no friend in Miss Edson."
               "I have long feared so; but, as Mrs. Edson knows what Mr. Barton's wishes were,
                  for she has seen the will drawn up by his order on the very day of his death, it
                  is possible that her sense of the obligations she owes to him, may prompt her to
                  carry them into effect."
               "And what if she should not?"
               "I must ask your consent that Dora become an inmate of my, that is of course, our home, until
                  Arthur and she are married, for such I know is their hope and intention."
               "Why, I should have preferred that very request to you, doctor; so we are
                  perfectly agreed."
               "Thank you, Miss Arden. We have agreed so well upon the first point, I don't doubt
                  we shall get along very harmoniously. Anything else?"
               "Not immediately. I must return to the West in the course of a few days, and I may
                  have occasion for your services before I leave."
               "You will allow my nephew to wait upon you?"
               "Are you not afraid to trust me with him?"
               "Um! I don't know as it would be exactly safe," the doctor replied, very
                  seriously; "I will consult him, and hear what he has to say. By your leave, I
                  shall see you to-morrow."
               "I am afraid you would pay little attention to my wishes in that respect. But,
                  comeâ€”joking apartâ€”you are ever warmly welcome, Doctor Thornton. You have awakened
                  a new life within me, and I am not ashamed to own it."
               "And you have given me a new lease of life; which God grant I may long enjoy!"
               Many things more were said, which do not of right belong to the public, and
                  therefore passing over them, and leaving them to the imagination of the reader, we
                  turn to Dora Barton and her troubles.
            
            
               
               Chapter XVII.
               Honors Change Manners.
               DURING the time the remains of Mr. Barton were in the house, preparatory to the
                  funeral, the inmates had very little intercourse with each other. Each seemed to
                  be bowed down with deep grief, and the few words spoken were uttered in whispered
                  tones.
               Dora kept her room nearly all the time, going occasionally to look at the cold
                  remains of him who was so dear to her. Her face was wan and pale, and her eyes
                  swollen with continual weeping. The servants who knew how fondly Mr. Barton loved
                  her, and who loved her for her gentle, amiable manners, and considerate kindness,
                  never passed her without words of sympathy and compassion.
               Mrs. Edson and her daughter sat in the room occupied by the former. The mother was
                  seated in a luxurious rocking-chair, while Clara was stretched at full length upon
                  a sofa. They were engaged in conversation, but it was carried on in subdued
                  tones.
               "You read the will, you say, mother?" asked Clara, half raising from her recumbent
                  posture.
               "Yes, I just glanced over it. The clerk who brought it was so dumbfounded when I
                  told him what had happened, he hardly knew what he was doing, and handed it to me,
                  I suppose, without thinking."
               "But, it wasn't signed?" she queried.
               "No, it was not," replied Mrs. Edson, with marked emphasis.
               "And, of course, everything goes to you?" Clara asked, leaning upon her elbow, and
                  looking her mother steadily in the face.
               "I do not know; but, I believe by law it does, as I am his only surviving
                  relative, except yourself."
               "I wonder how Miss Barton will take that," said Clara, with an expression of
                  scornful triumph. "I shouldn't wonder if she found things different from what she
                  has of late years," and her eyes sparkled with a malignant expression.
               "Hush! don't talk so now, childâ€”it is very improper and unkind; and, just at this
                  moment, too!"
               
               "Well, I may think as much as I choose," and the grief-stricken young lady turned
                  over on the sofa, giving free play to her thoughts; and visions of independence
                  and grandeur flitted through her busy, scheming brain. Even in that hour, when her
                  heart should have been bowed down with grief, it was filled with the most
                  rancorous hatred and jealousy of Dora, and she found a spiteful pleasure in
                  imagining how she would triumph over her when it was known that her mother was the
                  sole heiress of Mr. Barton.
               Poor Dora, she little knew what troubles were hovering over her!
               As it was well known that Mr. Barton was very rich, so rich that his property, if
                  equally divided between the three, would make them all wealthy, many were the
                  sympathizing calls made by their dear friends, who came to offer condolence upon
                  the occasion of this melancholy bereavement.
               To each, Mrs. Edson was particular to mention, as well as her tears and
                  overpowering grief would allow, that her poor, dear, departed brother had died
                  without making a will.
               This news spread with the most wonderful rapidity among her friends, and, after
                  the first day, it was only those who had not heard the news, who asked after Dora
                  at all; and, in answer to their kind inquiries, Mrs. Edson, with the most
                  sympathizing and patronizing air, said:
               "Poor thing! she don't feel like seeing any one. The change in her circumstances
                  is so great, she is completely overcome."
               This, of course, led to questions, and Mrs. Edson was thus enabled to inform them
                  of the unfortunate failure on the part of her poor, dear brother to execute any
                  will.
               It was wonderful to note the change which these few words produced upon her
                  hearers. "Poor, dear Dora," was dropped, and all the sympathy was doled out to the
                  unhappy and bereaved sister, and the grief-stricken Clara, whom everybody knew the
                  dear deceased had loved so devotedly.
               After this became generally known, the conduct of those who attended the funeral,
                  was equally marked. Dora was passed by with a bow of cold recognition, while the
                  sympathizing friends clung around Mrs. Edson and Clara, and strove by every means
                  in their power to encourage them in bearing up against this overwhelming
                  affliction.
               Dora, heart-stricken as she was, could not fail to notice this conduct, but in her
                  innocence and guilelessness, she very naturally felt that, as his immediate diate and only relatives, they had the
                  best claim to sympathy, though her heart told her that even they could not have
                  loved him more devotedly than she had done.
               On the day after the funeral, Mrs. Edson and Clara had a long consultation, in
                  which the future was duly canvassed. Mrs. Edson asserted her intention of carrying
                  out the wishes of Mr. Barton, but Clara opposed it with all the vehemence of
                  hatred and jealousy. What right had she to give to a nameless nobody her share of
                  her uncle's fortune? It was quite enough, she urged, that Uncle Charles had picked
                  her out of the streets, and had clothed, and fed, and educated her, and had done
                  his best to make a lady of her. And, wasn't she always putting herself
                  forwardâ€”didn't she always try and interfere when any one praised or admired her
                  (Clara)? She hated her!â€”she hated her from her inmost heart; and she would never
                  consent that a charity girl, picked out of the street, should receive her uncle's
                  fortuneâ€”no, not one dollar of it!
               Mrs. Edson strove in vain to overcome her daughter's prejudices; for, while she
                  naturally desired to have as large a share of that which the law gave her as was
                  consistent with fairness and honor, she could not but feel that Dora was entitled
                  to some consideration, for she knew how devotedly her brother loved her, and this
                  was evidenced by the fact that he had intended to leave her one half of his entire
                  property.
               But Clara would listen to no compromises, and made it a point that Dora should go
                  as she came. Mrs. Edson absolutely refused to be a party to such rank injustice,
                  but promised to consult her legal adviser, and accordingly Mr. Harding, as has
                  been stated, was invited to call around.
               The result of his first visit has already been made known.
               In the evening of the day on which he made his call, in pursuance of Mrs. Edson's
                  invitation, the family was assembled in the parlor, and Mrs. Edson broached the
                  subject of erecting a proper monument to the memory of her brother, declaring her
                  intention, at the same time, of procuring the most elegant and expensive one she
                  could have made, but was uncertain to whom she should apply for the composition of
                  an epitaph.
               Dora suggested that a monument, simple yet massive, would best comport with his
                  life and character; but Clara turned upon her, almost fiercely, stopping in the
                  middle of her walk (for, while Dora was
                  speaking, she had been nervously pacing the floor), and said in tones of insulting
                  defiance, which she made no attempt to disguise:
               "I wonder, Miss Pert, who gave you any right to say anything about it? Who asked
                  your opinion?"
               "Clara!" said her mother, imploringly.
               But Clara's temper was up, and she paid no heed to her mother.
               "Yes, Miss Simplicity, you have had your day, and it's my turn now; you have
                  lorded it over us long enough, but you've got to learn that you'll have a mistress
                  now."
               "Clara, be silent; I command you," said her mother, rising from her easy-chair,
                  and approaching her incensed daughter, who had paused before the affrighted
                  Dora.
               "I won't be silent!" Clara fairly screamed, giving free vent to her long pent-up
                  feelings. "I'll give her a piece of my mind, and she'll have to hear it. A charity
                  girlâ€”a street beggar, to come here and dare to put herself on a par with me! I
                  suppose you expected to be a rich lady one of these days, and I rather think
                  you'll find yourself mightily mistaken. Your dear father, as you had the impudence
                  to call him, didn't think so much of you after all. You've got to learn, Miss
                  Artfulness, that my mother is the sole heir to his property; and if you don't keep
                  a very civil tongue in your head, you'll have to go back where you came from. I
                  don't think it will hurt you much to be a little humbled," and she strode away
                  with the air and dignity of a tragedy queen.
               Poor Dora, who had never given a thought to the fortune of her dear friend and
                  benefactor, and whose heart was filled with a grief as deep and sincere as it was
                  merited by the love and kindness he had ever bestowed upon her, was completely
                  overpowered by this unexpected and most unmerited assault. She could not reply,
                  but with tears in her eyes looked imploringly at Mrs. Edson, as if to solicit her
                  protection.
               "My dear Dora," she said soothingly, "don't pay any attention to her. She does not
                  know what she is saying."
               "Don't she, indeed!" repeated Clara, approaching her mother, with flashing eyes.
                  "I tell you, mother, I have borne her impertinence and interference long enough,
                  and I won't submit to it any longer. I've seen her manÅ“uvres. Don't shake your
                  head at me," she continued, as Dora, with streaming eyes, shook her head in silent
                  contradiction of the foul accusation.
               
               "I tell you, mother, I won't submit to it any longer; and if she stays in this
                  house, I don'tâ€”I won't, when I am not obliged to do so, associate with a street
                  beggar, who doesn't even know her own mother or father. Who are you? What are
                  you?" she almost screamed, approaching so close to the trembling Dora their faces
                  nearly met. "You beggar bratâ€”you nobody's childâ€”who are you, I say?"
               Dora's tears were actually forced back by this cruel speech, and rising with all
                  the majesty and dignity of insulted innocence, she said, "I was loved by your best
                  friend, and I feel that I was worthy of that love; and that elevates me so far
                  above your insults, they pass me by as the idle wind. May God forgive your cruelty
                  and injustice as freely as I do now."
               "Oh, you forgive me, do youâ€”you meek Christianâ€”you pretty saint; your meekness
                  won't serve you now. I know youâ€”your hypocrisy won't serve you any longer. I see
                  what you are looking atâ€”you think you will get your share, forsooth, of my uncle's
                  property."
               "Oh, spare me, Claraâ€”dear Clara!" exclaimed the stricken Dora, completely subdued
                  by such terrible and unmerited assaults.
               "Don't dare to call me Claraâ€”my name is Miss Edson; and if I ever suffered you to
                  call me by such a familiar name, it was only from respect to my dear departed
                  uncle, who was so foolish as to believe you loved him for himself. You will please
                  be more respectful hereafter, at least while you are in our house,"
                  and she laid a terrible emphasis on the "our."
               Dora had no words to urge against such a tirade of abuse, and bowing her head in
                  meek submission to such an unmerited attack, she left the room in silence and in
                  tears.
               "Clara, I am perfectly ashamed of you!" said her mother. "Your conduct was
                  absolutely inhuman. How could you speak so?"
               "How could I speak so! I wonder how I have kept in as long as I have. If you knew
                  all I know, you would speak too, I think. If you knew the arts she has used to
                  draw gentlemen away from me, and all the time she seemed so meek and mild, as if
                  she was the twin sister of simplicity. I tell you, mother, she has set herself
                  against me for two years past, and has done more to wound and hurt my feelings
                  than any person living. I would not have borne it from any other person on earth,
                  and I would not have submitted to it from her, but for Uncle Charles' sake, as I saw he was so wrapped up
                  in her. He was blind to her faults; and I do believe that if Providence had not
                  removed him from her influence as it did, he would have been taught by her to hate
                  me, and to believe me as bad as she actually is herself."
               Poor Dora! your troubles have commenced very soon.
            
            
               Chapter XVIII.
               The Legal Adviser.
               PUNCTUAL to his promise, Mr. Harding was at the house of Mrs. Edson, on the
                  morning after his first interview with her, and that he had not been idle
                  meantime, was evidenced, not alone by the quantity of papers he had brought, but
                  by the extent of the information he had gathered.
               He was received by Mrs. Edson with a warmth of welcome which assured him that his
                  own suit was in no danger, as far as he was concerned, and her manner was so
                  cordial, he felt equally assured that his influence would be paramount as to the
                  management of her affairs. His mind was made up as to the disposal of Miss Dora;
                  and he had little doubt that in due course of time, he would have the control of
                  the vast property left by Mr. Barton.
               "I have not been idle, as you see, madam," he said, holding forth the papers he
                  had prepared for her signature, and he
                  laid them on the table; then, taking a seat by her side, proceeded to enlighten
                  her as to the amount of her brother's property, so far as his limited time had
                  allowed him to make inquiries.
               "It cannot be far from three hundred thousand dollars, Mrs. Edson," and his words
                  almost took away her breath, so little was she prepared to hear that she was the
                  sole heiress of a sum so vast.
               "I trust, madam, you have reflected upon what I said on the occasion of our last
                  interview," and rising, he approached the table on which he had laid the papers,
                  and proceeded with a deliberation fully in keeping with his portly, pompous
                  appearance, to open and spread them out separately.
               "Here, madam," he said, "is the power of attorney which will enable me to act in
                  your stead, and on your behalf in everything. Here," and he held forth another,
                  "is the form of application for letters of administration. And here," and
                  approaching Mrs. Edson, he handed to her another, "is the settlement I have drawn
                  up for Miss Dora. I have no doubt she will thank you for your liberality, for I
                  cannot but feel that in consideration of the peculiar circumstances under which
                  she is placed, she ought to be grateful to you for the very smallest favor."
               "Be pleased to read it, Mr. Harding," said Mrs. Edson, handing it back to him, and
                  settling herself back on the sofa, in an attitude of attention.
               He proceeded, in accordance with her request, and read, in his most pompous and
                  sonorous voice, the deed of settlement which, as the representative of Mrs. Edson,
                  he proposed to make on her who had been brought up under her own eyeâ€”had been the
                  chosen daughter of her brother's heart, and to whom she knew he had contemplated
                  leaving the half of his fortune.
               It proposed to settle upon her for life the magnificent sum of three hundred
                  dollars; but even to this a condition was annexed, and it was, that she should
                  forthwith drop the name of Barton, to which she had no legal right, and resume
                  that by which she was known when Mr. Barton first encountered her.
               "I would willingly make it five hundred, if she would accede to those conditions,"
                  said Mrs. Edson, when he had finished the perusal of that important document.
               "If she does not accede to them, I shall, as your selected legal adviser, insist
                  that she receive nothing whatever. You owe it to the memory of your brother, than
                  whom our city held no more valuable or honored citizen, that his name should no
                  longer be connected with that of an unknown street beggar, whom, in his charity and benevolence, he rescued
                  from starvation, and of whom no one knows any more than himself. Madam, you owe
                  thus much to his memory; and if I am to continue your adviser, I must insist that
                  my counsel be adhered to. Besides, madam, reflect that censorious people might
                  find occasion to make remarks derogatory to his character; and that, I am sure,
                  you would not allow."
               "Make it five hundred dollars, Mr. Harding," said Mrs. Edson, whose conscience
                  smote her, as she thought of the miserable stipend which it was proposed to allow
                  to one who, according to her brother's express design, was to have inherited his
                  large fortune equally with her daughter.
               "I could not think of binding you legally, Mrs. Edson, to pay any more than the
                  sum named. The property of your brother may not reach so large an amount as that
                  which I have named, and which I mentioned after very partial inquiries; and,
                  besides, you are bound to consider your daughter. She is your lawful heir, and you
                  have no right, Mrs. Edson, to deprive your only child of any portion of that which
                  the world will look upon as her inheritance, for the benefit of one who has no
                  claims, of blood or affinity, upon you, and who, everybody knows, had no claim on
                  your departed brother."
               The solemn pomposity with which this was delivered, was too much for Mrs. Edson,
                  and she yielded as gracefully as she could, though her conscience did smite her
                  for the manifest act of injustice which she felt she was perpetrating.
               "Be pleased, madam, to sign this," and Mrs. Edson, rising, rang the bell, and
                  directed the attending servant to bring pen and ink.
               This important document was duly signed and witnessed by Mr. Harding, and the
                  other papers having been signed, and attested by one of the servants summoned for
                  the purpose, Mr. Harding folded them carefully up, and put them in his breast
                  pocket.
               "Mr. Harding," said Mrs. Edson, when she had thus placed herself and her fortune
                  under the control and management of the crafty lawyer, "it will be a very hard and
                  trying task for me to communicate to Dora, the result of our deliberations. It
                  will be so far beneath what I believe to be her expectations."
               "That shall be my duty, madamâ€”and, disagreeable though it be, still, as your
                  friend, your best friend, and as your legal adviser, I will discharge it. I do not
                  wonder that you shrink from it; I have no doubt that she has expected to
                     inherit fully the half, possibly the
                  whole of your brother's fortune, and I can well feel for the disappointment she
                  must experience, when she learns how utterly dependent she is upon the goodness of
                  your heart."
               "Allow me to send her to you," said Mrs. Edson, glad to escape such a trying
                  interview; "and I will see you further after you have communicated with her," and,
                  with a smile and graceful courtesy, she swept out of the room; while Mr. Harding
                  rang the bell, and directed the servant to send Miss Dora into the parlor.
               In a few moments Dora, who was entirely unprepared for the summons, and little
                  dreamed of its purpose, made her appearance, and, pausing in his walk, Mr. Harding
                  waved her to a seat with a gesture whose lordly dignity ought to have awed her;
                  but, as she had not yet learned the bitter lesson that she was no longer at home,
                  she mistook it for his mode of exhibiting his politeness, and obeyed.
               Before he had time to open upon her the battery of his grandiloquence, the bell of
                  the front door was rung; and, as Mr. Harding heard the servant passing towards the
                  front door to answer it, he opened the parlor door, and with an air of authority,
                  said:
               "If it is any one for the family, show them into the third room."
               Dora's eyes actually expanded with astonishment at hearing orders given in such
                  pompous and peremptory tones, by one for whom she cherished the most supreme
                  contempt, in the house where she had always been accustomed to at least partial
                  rule; and, starting from her chair, she sprang to the door, and, seeing the
                  servant in the act of opening the door, said:
               "William, if any one asks for me, show them in the parlor."
               "Miss Dora!" said Mr. Harding, in his most magnificent tones, and with an air of
                  remonstrance.
               But she heeded him not, for she had caught a glimpse of the visitor as the front
                  door was opened. It was Doctor Thornton; and, with a scream of joy, she sprang
                  forward, and in an instant was clinging around his neck.
               "God bless you, doctor! I am so glad, so very glad to see you! Come inâ€”come in;
                  you are here just in time, I fear," and she led him into the parlor. "Mr. Harding,
                  my friend, and the friend of my protector and benefactor, Doctor Thornton," and,
                  seating herself, she drew the doctor close to her on the sofa, as if in his presence she felt
                  assurance of safety and protection.
               "I am happy to see any friend of Mr. Barton's," said Mr. Harding, with a pompous
                  wave of the hand, as if desirous of impressing the gentleman with a proper sense
                  of the honor conferred by the acknowledgment; but Doctor Thornton took it as a
                  matter of course, and did not deign to reply to it, except by a very civil bow. "I
                  had just summoned Miss Dora, for the purpose of making a communication to her on
                  behalf of Mrs. Edson, and"â€”â€”
               "Oh!" interrupted Doctor Thornton, "I am glad I happened in so opportunely. I
                  stand here in the light of Miss Dora's father and friend, and you can have nothing
                  to communicate to her which I may not hear."
               "Thank you, doctor," murmured Dora, and a gentle pressure of the hand still
                  clasped in his own, added to the earnestness of her words.
               "Ahem!" said Mr. Harding, a little nonplussed; for, with all his impudence and
                  effrontery, he could not fail to feel his vast inferiority in the presence of such
                  a gentleman as Doctor Thorntonâ€”"I don't exactly see the propriety of your presence
                  on such an occasion."
               "No matter what you see, sir!" said Doctor Thornton, very curtly. "Proceed with
                  your communication. "Miss Dora Barton, I know, would listen to nothing from you or
                  any other person which I have no right to hear, and you have no right to presume
                  upon her position. Go on, sir!"
               "Really, doctorâ€”doctor!" said Mr. Harding, hesitatingly, as if he had forgotten
                  the name, though it was in reality only a ruse to gain a little time, for he saw
                  he was likely to find his match in Dora's friend.
               "Thornton, sir, and you know it very well. I was a witness, not a month ago, in a
                  case you had in the District Court, and you have good cause to remember my name.
                  So, go on, and don't waste my time, for I wish to see Dora alone on business of as
                  much importance, as anything you can have to communicate."
               "Well, then, Miss Dora"â€”â€”
               "One word, sir," interrupted Doctor Thornton, "do you appear for yourself, or do
                  you represent Mrs. Edson on this occasion?"
               "I have had the honor," he replied, with his most pompous air, laying his hand on
                  the place where the human heart is supposed to be located, "to be selected as the confidential adviser of Mrs.
                  Edson; and I appear in this instance as her counsel, and act by her authority, as
                  you may see if you will take the trouble to examine these papers," and he
                  proceeded very deliberately to draw forth and open the papers which Mrs. Edson had
                  signed a few moments before.
               "You need not trouble yourself, Mr. Harding. I will take your word on this
                  occasion," said Doctor Thornton, with an expression so nearly approaching a sneer,
                  that the brazen-faced lawyer was half subdued, and pondered for an instant whether
                  he would or would not be safe in making a personal matter of it. His discretion,
                  however, came to his aid, and, with a very low and very distant bow, he proceeded
                  to open the business upon which he had summoned Dora before him.
            
            
               Chapter XIX.
               The Doctor and the Lawyer.
               MR. HARDING proceeded, therefore, with a flourish, which was intended to be very
                  impressive, to open the document, which placed Dora Barton in possession of the
                  magnificent income of three hundred dollars yearly, on condition of dropping the
                  name of Barton, and commenced to read it very slowly, very deliberately, and with
                  marked emphasis upon such words as in his opinion ought to impress his hearers
                  most deeply.
               As he progressed, Dora leaned forward with pale face, and eyes strained to their
                  utmost tension, as if doubting whether what she saw and heard was realityâ€”while
                  Doctor Thornton gave no evidence of emotion except by a slight quivering of the
                  lip, and the moisture which had gathered in his eye.
               When Mr. Harding had concluded, Dora sank back on the sofa, and leaning her head
                  on Doctor Thornton's shoulder, gave way
                  to an irrepressible burst of tears.
               Doctor Thornton blew his nose with tremendous vehemence, and gently disengaging
                  Dora, who threw herself upon the arm of the sofa, rose and approached Mr. Harding,
                  who, sooth to say, was quite surprised at the manner in which this formidable
                  document had been received.
               "Do I understand you to say, Mr. Harding," said Dr. Thornton, very earnestly,
                  "that the paper you have just read is duly signed and attested by Mrs. Edson?"
               "Be pleased to examine for yourself," said the imperturbable advocate, and he
                  tendered the paper for the inspection of the doctor. Doctor Thornton merely
                  glanced at the seal and signatures. They were indubitably correct, and everything
                  had been consummated with due formality.
               "Am I right in my understanding, that you are the legal adviser of Mrs.
                  Edson?"
               "I am honored by holding that position."
               "And may I ask, if your advice has operated on Mrs. Edson to an extent sufficient
                  to induce her to sign that paper?"
               "I am proud to say that I was listened to with attention, and my advice followed
                  to the letter. Mrs. Edson was willing to have made the annuity five hundred
                  dollars, but in view of the peculiar situation of the young woman"â€”â€”
               "Lady, sir," said Dr. Thornton, with flashing eyes, and in tones which startled
                  even Mr. Harding.
               "Lady, sir, if you insist; but"â€”â€”
               "I do insist, and without any buts. Now, go on."
               "Well, sir, as I was saying, Mrs. Edson was willing to make the annuity five
                  hundred dollars; but in view of the peculiar position of the young lady, and the
                  fact that Mr. Barton had rescued her from absolute poverty, and had clothed, fed,
                  and educated her for thirteen years, I insisted that she had received all she had
                  a right to expect, and that any thing which Mrs. Edson chose to give must be
                  received in the light of charity," and he paused, as if wanting words to finish
                  his sentence.
               "Go on, sir," said Dr. Thornton, through his clenched teeth.
               "Well, I thought further that she had no right to take from her daughter, a blood
                  relation, any more than was absolutely necessary for the support of one who had no
                  earthly claim upon her."
               "Mr. Harding," said Doctor Thornton, with forced emphasis, though he was ready to
                  burst with ill-concealed rage, "you are accustomed, I believe, in the course of your profession, to hear very
                  plain speaking; in fact, you rather like it?"
               "Decidedly; then I know where to find my man."
               "Well, sir, then listen to me. You are, as you say, the legal adviser of Mrs.
                  Edson?"
               "I have so said, and the lady will confirm it."
               "And it was at your suggestion that Mrs. Edson has tendered to Miss Barton, her
                  brother's adopted daughter, the contemptible pittance named in this paper?"
               "I cannot agree with you, sir, in your use of terms, in view of the peculiar
                  circumstances in which the young woâ€”â€”lady, I meanâ€”is placed. In fact, Mrs. Edson
                  was at first seriously inclined to carry out what she imagined to be the wishes of
                  Mr. Barton, and divide the property between her daughter and Miss Dora; but I
                  could not consent to become a party to such an act of injustice, and I am proud to
                  say that the arguments I used had their due effect."
               "And this paper," said the doctor, pointing to it, is the result of your arguments
                  and advice?"
               "Precisely, doctor," replied the lawyer, with an expression of triumph.
               "Now, then, let me say, Mr. Harding," continued Doctor Thornton, approaching close
                  to the "legal adviser," "that I consider you a most unmitigated scoundrelâ€”a base,
                  designing, scheming villain."
               "Sir," said the lawyer, not at all abashed, but swelling out until his portly form
                  seemed on the point of burstingâ€”and he prolonged the "sir" with a terrible roulade
                  of r-r-r's, which might have frightened some men, for his voice rose to a roar as
                  he uttered the word.
               Doctor Thornton, however, knew his man. "Perhaps," continued the doctor, with a
                  coolness and nonchalance quite equal to that of the lawyer in his most brazen
                  mood, "I did not make myself sufficiently understood. I said I considered you a
                  most unmitigated scoundrelâ€”a base, designing, scheming villain; and I will thank
                  you to let me finish my sentence without interruption. I am fully aware of the
                  purposes you had in view in giving to Mrs. Edson such advice; and I am only
                  surprised that the lady is so blinded as not to be able to discover the foulness
                  and impurity of the source from whence she derives her aid and counsel. I am glad,
                  however, to know that Mrs. Edson had some appreciation of what was due to her
                  brother's wishes, and what she owed to his bounty. As for you, if I did not feel
                  how much I should pollute myself, I
                  would wring your nose for your impertinent interference."
               "Sir," said the lawyer, bristling up, "I will have you to understand that I am
                  here as the legal adviser of Mrs. Edson"â€”â€”
               "'Pshawâ€”sit down, you bloated fool," said the doctor, going to the bell and
                  ringing it; "go tell Mrs. Edson that Doctor Thornton wishes to see her," he said
                  to the servant who entered the room, and as Mr. Harding stepped forward, as if to
                  countermand the order, the doctor said sternly, "not one word, sir, at your peril;
                  you are not master here, yet. Dora, my darling, there has been most foul wrong
                  done to you, and if Mrs. Edson confirms it, I shall lose all faith in
                  humanity."
               "Mr.â€”â€”Doctor Thornton, I must say I am surprised at such language from one
                  professional gentleman to another," said Mr. Harding, whose self-possession was
                  almost overturned.
               "Faugh! gentleman! You never had the most remote conception of the word. Stick to
                  what you do knowâ€”scheming, venality, rascality, and fraud"â€”â€”
               What more he would have said was interrupted by the entrance of Mrs. Edson, who,
                  little dreaming of the interview which had just been held between the doctor and
                  her legal adviser, and utterly unconscious that the former was acquainted with her
                  treatment of Dora, approached him with her wonted familiarity and with
                  outstretched hands.
               "Mrs. Edson," said the doctor, taking her hands, and holding them in such a
                  position that she was compelled to look directly in his face, or to avoid it by
                  turning her head on one side, "this man," and he nodded his head towards Mr.
                  Harding, "has just read to me a paper bearing your signature, which deeply
                  concerns Miss Barton. Is that paper your voluntary act?"
               "Why, really, doctor," she replied, encouraged by the presence of her legal
                  adviser, who managed to inspire her with confidence by sundry winks and mysterious
                  nods, "I am not aware that any person has a right to question my motives, or
                  criticise my conduct; and really, I think your question very extraordinary."
               "Your pardon, madam. I have that right. I claim it as the intimate bosom friend of
                  him to whom you, equally with Dora, owed everything on earth. I remember well,
                  madam, when your kind hearted brother rescued you from the poverty and distress
                  into which you had been plunged by your drunken vagrant of a husband. I remember
                     the time, madam, when but for him
                  you, too, would have been begging your bread in the streets, and your daughter
                  might have walked long and wearily before she found such a friend as Dora found in
                  your brotherâ€”such a friend as Dora deserved. And now, madam, how dare you, because
                  Providence, in its wisdom, has seen fit to afflict you with sudden wealth, for I
                  consider it an 
                     afflction
                     affliction
                  , since it seems to have removed all traces of humanity from youâ€”how dare
                  you presume to make such an offer to this child? She was the darling of the
                  brother who raised you from poverty to ease, from ease to luxury. He loved her for
                  her virtues and her worth; and you knowâ€”your heart tells youâ€”that if he could rise
                  from his cold grave, he would reproach you as my words do now. Madam, what has
                  Dora Barton done to deserve this at your hands? Are you not content with the
                  bountiful provision which he intended to make for you and yours? Have either of
                  you, by love, or attention, deserved more?"
               "If you please, doctor"â€”said Mr. Harding, approaching the pair as they thus stood
                  face to face.
               "If you say one word, I will throw you out of the window," said the doctor, now
                  fully aroused, turning to Mr. Harding as he approached, but not losing his hold on
                  the hands of Mrs. Edson.
               "Mrs. Edson, I ask you again," he continued, "do you really mean to perpetrate
                  this act of wickednessâ€”of injustice, of cruelty, to one who never harmed you in
                  thought, word, or deed?"
               "Doctor Thornton," said Mrs. Edson, firmly, for as she spoke she was looking at
                  Mr. Harding, who stood directly behind the doctor, "I must say, I think your
                  language extremely imprudent, to call it by its mildest name. This young woman had
                  no claim of blood or affinity on my brother, and I do not feel called upon to
                  sacrifice my daughter's prospects to advance those of one in whom we have no
                  earthly interest."
               "And is this your answer, madam?"
               Mr. Harding nodded to Mrs. Edson in the affirmative; and she, still keeping her
                  eyes fixed on her legal adviser, answered in a firm voice, that it was.
               "Dora, my dear," said the doctor, in his usual calm voice, "go and put on your hat
                  and shawl," and as Dora, without knowing what he meant, arose and left the room,
                  he dropped the hands of Mrs. Edson, and, standing before her, said:
               "Madam, you may think you are doing right now, but I won't disgrace
                  your sex by believing that you feel you are. You are acting under the
                  influence of a blind infatuation, from which you will awaken some day, to experience all the
                  pangs of the most bitter remorse. This fellow, it seems, acts for you. I act and
                  speak for Dora Barton. She shall not accept your contemptible
                  pittanceâ€”she shall not discard the name given to her through the
                  affection of him whose memory and services to you, are already forgotten! You
                  think you will enjoy your ill-gotten wealth, but you will not. Heaven will not
                  look upon such conduct without visiting upon it the punishment it merits; and, so
                  surely as you live, so surely will you bitterly rue the day you suffered yourself
                  to commit an act of such infamous injustice. You may think your wealth will
                  command friends, but I tell you that all who know you will despise you, and that
                  the hour will come when you will wish on your knees to ask pardon of the dear,
                  injured girl whom you have discarded."
               "Come, Dora," he said, as she entered the room, with her hat and shawl on, "this
                  is no place for you now. You may keep that paper, Mrs. Edsonâ€”we don't want it; and
                  I wish you much joy of that accession to your fortune," and, without vouchsafing
                  another word, he placed Dora's arm within his own, and, turning to Mr. Harding,
                  said: "I shall send to-morrow for the clothing and other articles which belong to
                  this young lady. Do you, as the legal adviser of this precious family, see that
                  everything is sent; and, if one single article, no matter how trifling, which
                  belongs to her, is missing, neither your legal attainments, nor your professional
                  standing, shall save you from the consequences!" and, without awaiting a reply, he
                  left the house arm in arm with Doraâ€”who, as she left the parlor, turned again and
                  again, as if to catch the eye of Mrs. Edson; and, had she seen there one single
                  expression of love or pity, she would have returned, and, throwing herself upon
                  her neck, begged her to remember how much she had loved her, and how grateful she
                  was for the past.
               She met no such look, and they parted in silence.
            
            
               
               Chapter XX.
               Another Change.
               "WELL, thank Heaven, she's gone!" exclaimed Mrs. Edson, drawing a long breath, as
                  if relieved by the absence of Dora.
               "Did you ever hear of such vile ingratitude? To think that one whom you have
                  fostered, and nourished, and cared for, almost from infancy, could have turned
                  from you so coldly, and received your kind offers in such a spirit. Really, my
                  dear Mrs. Edson, I was not conscious of all the excellent traits in your character
                  before. I had flattered myself that I knew you, for you have been the study of my
                  life for years past," and he bowed with an air which she interpreted as he meant
                  she should; "but such forbearanceâ€”such meeknessâ€”such submissionâ€”such Christian
                  forgiveness under insult and injury, are almost beyond belief! Had it not been for
                  the melancholy circumstances which surround you, and the fear of attracting public
                  attention, I should have punished that fellow on the spot for his impertinence to
                  you; for, of course, I could not, as a gentleman, pay any attention to what was
                  said to me."
               "Thank you, Mr. Harding, for your good intentions; but I had no fear for myself. I
                  must say, however, that I am disappointed in Dora. I have fostered and cared for
                  her for many years, as you have justly said. She has been treated, in every
                  respect, the same as my own daughter. No wish of her heart has been ungratified;
                  and now, when circumstances have placed me in the position to prove the sincerity
                  of my friendship, she turns from me, and leaves me without one word of thanks or
                  kindness. Oh! ingratitude is almost unpardonable! I could forgive anything but
                  that! And, to think what I would have done for her, notwithstanding the manner in
                  which she has treated Clara!" and, burying her face in her black-bordered
                  handkerchief, she gave way to a burst of tears.
               "What!" exclaimed the legal adviser, in tones of sympathy, "what an ingrate she
                  must be, and how thankful you ought to be that you are rid of her. Upon my word,
                  madam, in all my experience rienceâ€”and
                  I assure you I have had muchâ€”I have never met the equal of that young woman."
               But, we must leave Mrs. Edson and her legal adviser. They had a long and
                  interesting conversation, in which the past was freely discussed, and the future
                  as freely canvassed; and, when they parted, the one was convinced that she had
                  acted the part of a high-minded, honorable Christian woman, while the other was
                  equally convinced that his words and advice had been potential.
               Doctor Thornton and Dora walked nearly a block in silence, which was at length
                  broken by the latter, who said:
               "This is very hard to bear, Doctor Thornton."
               "Never mind, my child; brighter hours will come. Providence will set
                  all things right yet, and you will come out just where you ought. I wonder what
                  Arthur will say to all this?"
               "Please, doctor, spare me that now," said Dora, a crimson blush rising to her
                  cheek, though he could not perceive it.
               "Pardon me, my dear; I was thinking aloudâ€”I didn't mean to say that. But, Dora, I
                  suppose you are aware that you are my ward now. Such, I know, was one of the
                  provisions of your father's will, and I mean to carry that out, at all
                  events."
               "I am grateful for your kindness, doctor, and will do all you desire or command,
                  to prove my gratitude."
               "For the present, I am going to place you in the house of a friend, where you will
                  be well cared for, and, when I have time to turn around, I will see what is to be
                  done. I could not have suffered you to remain in that house another hour on any
                  earthly consideration, after the insults heaped upon you."
               "How I wish I could see Mrs. Arden," sighed Dora.
               "Miss Arden, Dora; she is not married."
               "I thought she was a widow, doctor," said Dora, looking in his face with an air of
                  surprise.
               "Umph," muttered the doctor; but he replied, "You misunderstood, as I did when I
                  was introduced to her. She is Miss Arden. And you want to see her?" he
                  queried.
               "I don't know why, but in all this sadness and sorrow I have wished for her more
                  than for any other human being."
               "And she for you, Dora; and was only kept away, I know, by the fear that she
                  might, as a stranger, have been considered intrusive."
               "Oh, dear, I wish she had come, I have been so sad and so lonesome; and it seemed as if my heart
                  turned instinctively to her in the midst of my troubles."
               "By Jove, I'll try it," said the doctor, and he suddenly turned round, going back
                  in the same route by which they had come. "I'll try it, any how. Come, Dora, let
                  us see if there is any faith to be placed in humanity at all."
               "Where are you going to take me, doctor?" she queried, as she obeyed him, and
                  retraced her steps, wondering, however, what this sudden change might mean.
               "You will know when you get there, my darling," he said playfully. "All in good
                  time;" and they walked on in silence, he revolving in his own mind the possible
                  reception he might meet at the hands of Miss Arden, for he had suddenly determined
                  to take Dora to her, and place her in that lady's chargeâ€”and she, wondering what
                  he could mean by such a sudden alteration of purpose, as was evinced by the change
                  in his destination from that which he had seemingly adopted when he left the house
                  of Mrs. Edson.
               When he ascended the steps of Mr. Chapman's residence, Dora asked whither he was
                  conducting her; but with a quiet smile he bade her fear nothing, adding, that
                  though he did not intend to put her on three hundred a year, nor compel her to
                  change her name, he would take good care of her.
               The door being opened, in answer to his summons, he led her into the third room,
                  and closing the door, bade her remain quiet until he should summon her; then
                  telling the servant, in a low voice, to inform Miss Arden that he wished to see
                  her, he entered the front parlor to await her appearance.
               He was not kept long in waiting, for she hastened down, and greeted him with a
                  warmth and cordiality which convinced him that she was quite reconciled to abide
                  by the decision she had so recently made.
               "You were just in time, doctor; I was packing up to be off to-morrow."
               "What, so soon!" he exclaimed. "Surely you would not have left the city without
                  seeing me," and he looked dubiously at her.
               "You quite forget that you were here yesterday evening, and that I told you I was
                  going off to-day."
               The doctor blushed, for he had forgotten it; but he was excusable, for he had been
                  much engrossed since they last parted.
               "Could you not postpone your visit a day or two?"
               
               "Not very readily."
               "Could you do so to serve Dora?" he queried, looking earnestly at her.
               "Of course I could, and would do so cheerfully. I would let things at the West
                  take their chance to serve her. But why do you ask that question?"
               "Now listen one moment, and please forget your woman's prerogative of talking. It
                  has turned out just as I expected," he continued, not heeding her mischievous look
                  as he uttered the last words. "Mr. Barton, you know, died without having executed
                  his will. Mrs. Edson is the sole inheritor of his property, and in her generosity
                  has offered to Dora"â€”â€”
               "The third, of course, of his estate," exclaimed the generous-hearted woman.
               "Yes, the paupers' third. She offers her an income of three hundred dollars a
                  year, provided she will drop the name of Barton."
               Miss Arden said nothing, but springing up with flushed cheeks, and eyes fairly
                  flashing with anger, rang the bell with a violence which brought the servant in
                  haste to the parlor.
               "Go up stairs, and tell Jane to bring down my hat and shawl;" and turning to the
                  doctor, she said, very calmly, "Excuse me. Go on, doctor. What did Dora say?"
               "Nothing."
               "Nothing at all?"
               "Not one word. I spoke for her, for I was present when the offer was made."
               "You dear, good soul," said Miss Arden, laying her hand on his. "How could I think
                  otherwise? What then did you say for her?"
               "I absolutely and positively declined to accept the contemptible offer."
               "Well, and what then?"
               "Nothing."
               "And what of Dora?"
               "What should become of her?"
               "Why, you brute, you ought to have taken her from the house at once. She should
                  not be allowed to stay there another hour. How stupid you men are."
               "What on earth would I have done with her? You know I am a bachelorâ€”I have my
                  rooms and offices, but I have no wife to take charge of her."
               "You have acted with uncommon and unpardonable stupidity," said Miss Arden, with
                  an appearance of real anger, "for a man of your sense. You should have brought her
                  here. You know I loved the child the
                  moment I saw her, and goodness knows I have enough to keep us both. I am perfectly
                  surprised at you, doctor;" and her foot patted the velvet carpet very
                  nervously.
               "Yes; but you are going West, you know, in the morning?" he partly queried, with a
                  singular expression of countenance.
               "But could I not easily postpone my visit there for a few days? Ah, here is my hat
                  and shawl; I will go and bring her myself. I wonder you had not more thought than
                  to leave her in that house, when you knew how they felt and acted towards her.
                  Come, sir," and she commenced nervously to put on her hat, "help me on with this
                  shawl;" but the doctor sat still, a quiet smile stealing over his face.
               "Doctor Thornton, you are very provoking," she said, stamping her foot, "I am sure
                  you know my feelings towards that girl, and you ought to have consulted them
                  better, sir. To leave her in that house! I am perfectly surprised at you."
               "I will surprise you more, Ellen," he said, taking her hand and kissing itâ€”then
                  going to the third room, he threw open the glass doors, and led forth the weeping
                  Dora, who in another instant was clasped in Miss Arden's warm embrace.
               "I beg your pardon, doctor," she said, smiling through her tears, "you are not at
                  all stupid, nor inconsiderate, but the wisest and most thoughtful of men"â€”and she
                  extended one hand to the doctor, which he seized, and saluted with a respectful
                  kiss.
               "Now, Dora," said the warm-hearted lady, wiping her own eyes, "wipe your eyes, and
                  don't let me see any more tears in them. I love youâ€”Doctor Thornton loves
                  youâ€”everybody who knows you loves you, and you must not be unhappy. We'll adopt
                  her between us, won't we, doctor? You shall have a little of herâ€”a very littleâ€”and
                  I'll have the restâ€”may I not, Dora?"
               Dora's heart was too full for words. She could not reply to such kindnessâ€”the
                  contrast between the affectionate warmth of comparative strangers, and the
                  harshness and insult which she had but now received at the hands of those with
                  whom were associated her earliest and most cherished recollections, was too great,
                  and leaning her head upon the arm of the sofa on which she had been sitting, she
                  gave way to the tears and sobs which she could no longer restrain.
               "Come, come, darling," said Miss Arden, affectionately, "you must not give way now
                  to your grief. You are with friendsâ€”with those who love you, and who will never forsake you under any
                  circumstances."
               "Dora, darling," said Doctor Thornton, approaching her, and laying his hand gently
                  on her head, "you must not grieve so. I honor the feelings which animate you, but
                  you must be more composed. You know me as your best friend, next to him whom you
                  have lost, and you must heed what I say."
               "God help me, Doctor Thornton," said the afflicted girl, rising from her recumbent
                  posture, "but I know not where to look. Oh, how he loved me, and they would not
                  even let me love himâ€”they would not let me say I loved him. Dear, dear friendâ€”how
                  gladly I would have died to save you!"
               "My darling," said Miss Arden, seating herself on the sofa, and drawing the
                  unresisting girl towards her, until Dora's head lay upon her bosom, "you must not
                  grieve so. You make us, as well as yourself, very unhappy. We love youâ€”you know we
                  doâ€”and all that love can prompt, we will do, to make you forget the past. Try and
                  forget that which has made you unhappy, and find your comfort in our affection,
                  for you know we love you," and she looked appealingly at Dr. Thornton as she
                  uttered the word "we."
               "With all our hearts, Dora, dearâ€”as well for your own sake as for the sake of him
                  whom I so truly honored and esteemed. Dora, my darling, you know I have another
                  claim on you," and he looked significantly at herâ€”"you must heed us, and for our
                  sakes try and forget the great wrong inflicted on you."
               Dora, even amid her tears, blushed as she heard these words, for she well knew to
                  whom he alluded, and hastily dashing the tears from her eyes, she extended her
                  hand to Dr. Thornton, and said, "God bless you, doctorâ€”do what you choose with me;
                  and, Mrs. Arden," and she placed the other hand in the ready palm of the lady
                  appealed to, "I will try and prove my gratitude to you."
               "Fudge! gratitude," said Miss Arden, as she wiped from her eyes the tears which
                  the loving earnestness of Dora had called thereâ€”"I love you, and you know I doâ€”and
                  I half believe that you love me. So"â€”â€”
               "Love you!" interrupted Dora, happy beyond measure to have found one sympathizing
                  heartâ€”"Love you! Oh, dear Mrs. Arden, I wish you knew how much I loved you, and
                  how my heart thanks you now."
               "Doctor Thornton, will you please leave this young lady with me?" queried Miss Arden, as she
                  clasped Dora to her heartâ€”"I think I can comfort her almost as well as you
                  could."
               "I am not quite certain that she is safe with you," he replied, with a meaning
                  smile, "but I will take the risk. Dora, darling," he said, approaching and taking
                  her unresisting hand, "you are mine now by every tie of honor, love, and
                  friendship. Henceforth you are my daughter, and"â€”â€”
               "God grant me life and power to prove how truly I appreciate your kindness," she
                  said, interrupting his sentence, and, rising from Miss Arden's bosom, strove to
                  clasp his handâ€”"Oh, doctor! oh, Mrs. Arden! how have I deserved such
                  kindness?"
               "Never mind that, Dora," said Miss Arden, drawing her again close to her heart;
                  "we will take your merits on trust. Come, doctor, are you not afraid some of your
                  patients will suffer from your neglect?"
               Doctor Thornton colored slightly at this rebuke, so very gently administered, but
                  he had no reply to make. Dora was in good hands, and with a low bow to Miss Arden,
                  which she alone could rightly interpret, and a paternal kiss imprinted on Dora's
                  forehead, as she lay weeping and sobbing in Miss Arden's arms, he took his
                  departure, quite convinced that he had performed at least his duty.
               "Now, my dear child," said Miss Arden, as the door closed upon the retreating form
                  of the worthy doctor, "you must compose yourself, and try, in remembering the love
                  we bear you," and instinctively she colored as the we was uttered,
                  "to forget the love you have lost. And, by the way, my dear, you must not call me
                  out of my name any more. Don't you hear Dr. Thornton call me Miss Arden?"
               "And are you Miss Arden?" asked Dora, looking up with an air of surprise, the
                  current of her thoughts being for the moment changed by this remark. "You are
                  surely too good and too beautiful to be Miss," she said, innocently.
               "Oh, you judge me by yourself," replied Miss Arden, coloring as the recollection
                  of the past flashed across her mind; "I am Missâ€”so, please, darling, don't spoil
                  my market any more."
               Dora smiled, even through her tears, at these words, and merely saying "I will not
                  forget," the conversation was changed.
            
            
               
               Chapter XXI.
               A New Friend.
               "NOT in! Oh, I am sure she is."
               "Indeed, madam, she is not."
               "Mary, my good girl, I am sorry to betray you; but I will take all the blame, and
                  expiate the sin. I am in to the owner of that voice," said Miss Arden, springing
                  from the sofa, on which, with Dora in her arms, she had been reclining. "I am
                  always at home to her," and she fairly rushed into the entry for fear that the
                  lady to whom she had been denied might have left.
               "My dear Mrs. Pollard," she exclaimed, hastening to the front door, "you must
                  pardon the white lie I bade Mary tell. I was not 'at home' to-day,
                  and so told her to say; but the sound of your ever welcome voice compelled me to
                  betray myself. Will you pardon me, and make me happy by being the exception?"
               "With all my heart, my dear," said the lady addressed, as she turned to the
                  waiting maid with a smile, which said, as plain as words could speak, "I knew she
                  would be at home to me," and they entered the parlor together.
               "You are always welcome, my dear Mrs. Pollard," said Miss Arden earnestly. "When
                  my dear Dora came in with Dr. Thornton, I gave orders to the servant to deny me to
                  everybody, not expecting this pleasure, and, Mrs. Pollard, when I say pleasure,
                  you know I mean it. Dora dear, Mrs. Pollardâ€”an old friend of mine."
               "And Dora is a dear friend of mine," said Mrs. Pollard, "for I have long known and
                  loved her. I have known her ever since she was so many years old," she added, as
                  she held her hands up to illustrate the age of her of whom she was speaking. "We
                  do not need an introduction. Do we, Dora?"
               "We do not, indeed," said Dora, wiping her eyes, still moist with tears. "I am
                  most happy to see you."
               "I am almost sorry you were not here a few minutes since, Mrs. Pollard," said Miss
                  Arden, as she motioned her friend to a seat, "you would have seen Dr. Thornton. Of
                  course you have heard of Mr. Barton's sudden death?"
               
               "My dear Miss Arden, I know all about that. I have heard everything from Mr.
                  Pollard, for he and my husband were very intimate friends."
               "Then I presume you have heard everything?" queried Miss Arden.
               "Oh, yes," replied her friend, with a very meaning smile. "Mrs. Edson took
                  particular pains to impress upon meâ€”as indeed she did on every one who has called
                  on herâ€”the fact that her 'poor dear brother' died without having executed a will;
                  leaving me of course to infer that she, as his only relative, would inherit his
                  estate."
               "Now, Dora, my dear," she continued, turning to Dora, "when I left home, I started
                  with the intention of calling at your house, and inviting you to pass a few weeks
                  with us in the country. You know we always go out very early in the season, and I
                  thought the change of air and scene would benefit you."
               "You are very, very kind, to interest yourself for me," replied Dora; "but"â€”â€”and
                  she turned to look at Miss Arden, who, interpreting the expression of her face,
                  promptly replied,
               "It will, I think, be decidedly the best thing you could do. You must know, Mrs.
                  Pollard, that we," and she blushed as she checked herself, "I mean Dr. Thornton,
                  has adopted Dora. He was named her guardian in that unfortunate willâ€”and
                     he, at least, means to carry out the kind intentions of Mr.
                  Barton, so far as lies in his power."
               "I don't really understand what you mean by saying, he means to carry
                  out Mr. Barton's wishes. Of course, ample provision will be made for her."
               "Such was Mr. Barton's intention, but the suddenness of his death prevented the
                  execution of his will; and Mrs. Edson has offered to Dora the magnificent income
                  of three hundred dollars, on condition that she drops the name of her 'poor, dear
                  brother.' You know, of course, that she is sole heir."
               "What an infamous shame!" exclaimed Mrs. Pollard, reddening with anger at the
                  inhumanity of one who could claim the title of womanhood. "Now, then, Dora, I
                  shall the more urgently press my request to have you come and pass some time with
                  me, since I have learned thus much. Of course, you can never again wish to live
                  with Mrs. Edson, after such treatment."
               "Of course, she never shall!" warmly replied Miss Arden. "This is her
                  home for the present, unless, indeed, she avails herself of your kindnessâ€”and I
                  would advise her to do so. I know she
                  appreciates and is grateful for your attention at such a time; and I think it will
                  be the best for her. I am compelled to leave the city for the West, to be absent
                  for some time on business; and I had intended to take Dora with me, instead of
                  leaving her with my friend Mrs. Chapman, though I know how heartily she would be
                  welcomed. What do you say, my dear?" she asked, turning to Dora.
               "I am truly grateful for Mrs. Pollard's kindness, and, if I was not afraid
                  I"â€”â€”
               "There, you need not finish that sentence," interrupted the kind-hearted lady.
                  "You were going to add, you feared you would give troubleâ€”no such thing. I shall
                  be delighted to have your company, and so will the girls and boys; and I am sure
                  the change will be of service to you. So that is settled. We shall leave about the
                  middle of next week, and I count upon your company."
               Again, Dora thanked her friend warmly for the kind interest manifested for a
                  comparative stranger, and, after some further conversation on the melancholy
                  occurrence which had brought her there, Mrs. Pollard took her leave.
               "I wonder who would have done the same for Clara, had she been placed in your
                  circumstances?" said Miss Arden, looking fondly in Dora's face, and gently
                  smoothing her glossy hair. "Ah! well, it's all for the best, I am sure; so dry
                  your eyes, my pet, and try to compose yourself. Remember, you are with friends who
                  truly love you, and who will do everything to fill the place of the dear friend
                  whose loss we all mourn so grievously. I will postpone my visit to the West, until
                  you are ready to leave with Mrs. Pollard. I shall be absent, a couple of months or
                  more, perhaps, and, when I return, I trust the roses will have come back to your
                  cheeks, and that I shall see only your bright smiles."
               "My heart must always smile in your presence, dear Miss Arden," replied Dora,
                  warmly, "though my face may wear a cloud of sadness. "If I had not loved you
                  before, your present kindness would have won the deepest and warmest feelings of
                  my heart."
               Miss Arden kissed her new protÃ©gÃ©e affectionately, and, divesting her of her hat
                  and shawl, led her to the apartment occupied by herself, where they passed the
                  morning in conversation, which, if not cheerful, was adroitly led by the more
                  experienced lady, so as to divert the thoughts of the hapless orphan from her
                  present grief.
            
            
               
               Chapter XXII.
               Dora's New Home.
               WHEN Doctor Thornton returned in the evening, and heard from Miss Arden the
                  arrangement for Dora's comfort, which the kind-hearted and sympathizing Mrs.
                  Pollard had proposed, he was delighted, and warmly approved of her acceptance of
                  the invitation.
               "Why, darling," he said, "it is, without exception, I presume, the most extensive
                  and magnificent private establishment in the Northern States. For thirty years Mr.
                  Pollard, who is one of our wealthiest bankers, has added to and improved and
                  ornamented it, until it is, I really believe, without a parallel in extent or
                  completeness. You can't fail to enjoy yourself there, if anywhere. And he is such
                  a fine, hospitable gentleman, and Mrs. Pollard, the model, according to my ideas,
                  of a wife and mother. Indeed, I do not know a lady in my circle of acquaintance
                  better suited than she is to be at the head of such an establishment. The family
                  is large, but so unitedâ€”so harmoniousâ€”so happy in themselves, you can't help
                  loving them. Oh! go, by all means, and tell me, when you return, if I have said
                  more than I ought."
               "I shall be glad to know more of a lady who comes up to your standard of a model
                  wife and mother, doctor," said Miss Arden, with a very faint blush, and a rather
                  mischievous smile, for she had spoken without thinking of Dora's presence; "I have
                  no doubt I shall profit by the acquaintance. Do you not think so?"
               Doctor Thornton looked at her with a mirthful expression; and, after a momentary
                  pause, replied: "I will give you my opinion on that point on some future
                  occasion," and Miss Arden was forced to turn aside her face to conceal the blush
                  and the smile which her question and the apt reply had called to her face.
                  Pretending not to notice her confusion, he turned to Dora, and said: "I have just
                  given directions to James to go to Mrs. Edson for your wardrobe, and everything
                  that belongs to you. They will be brought here, and you will, doubtless, find
                  occupation in arranging and preparing for your trip to the country."
               
               Doctor Thornton remained as long as courtesy would permit; and, in the presence of
                  two such warm and devoted friends, Dora forgot for the time one-half of her
                  griefs.
               The events of the few days which passed between these interviews, and Dora's
                  departure with Mrs. Pollard, may be mentioned very briefly.
               Both the ladies found occupation in arranging and in packing their trunks for
                  their respective journeys; and, as many purchases had to be made by both, they
                  found their time fully engrossed.
               The day at length arrived on which the friends were to part, and amid tears, and
                  kisses, and mutual blessings, they separated, Miss Arden for her residence in the
                  West, accompanied by Arthur Randolph, and Dora for the new home so kindly
                  proffered by Mrs. Pollard.
               Doctor Thornton was particularly sad on that occasion, for he bade adieu at the
                  same time to the two persons to whom he was most attached on earth; but, recalling
                  to himself the fact that their parting would be only of short duration, and that
                  when they met again, it would be never to separate, he brought his stoicism to his
                  aid, and resumed the pursuit of his profession with his wonted skill and
                  success.
               A couple of hours' rapid riding in the cars, carried Dora and Mrs. Pollard to the
                  dÃ©pÃ´t, where they were to stop; and, as the family carriage was there in waiting
                  to convey them to Mr. Pollard's mansion, they were soon whirled away towards their
                  destination.
               The drive was most lovely, and in her admiration of the beautiful country through
                  which they passed, Dora forgot for the time her present griefs; but, when they
                  reached the entrance of Mr. Pollard's elegant residence, and the carriage was
                  driven through the gateway arched with evergreens, she was completely carried away
                  by the loveliness of the scenery surrounding her.
               At every turn of the road, some new beauty attracted her observation; and, between
                  wood, and lawn, and grove, and meadow, so lavishly spread out before her, she
                  found so much to engross her attention, she forgot for the moment the terrible
                  ordeal through which she had been called to pass, and thought only of the kindness
                  of those who, though comparative strangers to her, had proved the sincerity of
                  their friendship by enabling her to enjoy such pleasure.
               The carriage halted in front of the palatial mansion occupied by Mr. Pollard; and,
                  as Dora alighted, followed by Mrs.
                  Pollard, she turned to take another look at the magnificence which surrounded
                  her.
               Woods, lawns, meadows, groves, and walks, extending for miles apparently, were
                  spread out before her; and, turning from the view with a sigh, she inwardly wished
                  that her dearest and best friend had been spared to enjoy it with her.
               "Come, Dora, I will show you the room I have assigned to you," said Mrs. Pollard,
                  as they ascended the steps of the portico, "and, I think you will say I have made
                  a good choice," and, without waiting for any reply, she ascended to the second
                  story, followed by the surprised and delighted Dora. Opening the door, she ushered
                  her guest into a large corner room, from the windows of which a view of almost the
                  entire estate could be commanded.
               "How very, very lovely," murmured Dora, as she approached the window, and grazed
                  out upon the splendor of the landscape spread before her; but Mrs. Pollard, who
                  had grown up with the place, and was familiar with every nook and corner, and had
                  learned every one of its beauties by heart, smiled complacently at the enthusiasm
                  of her young friend.
               "Do you like it?" she asked, as Dora stood at the window, drinking in the glorious
                  beauties of the landscape.
               "Like it, Mrs. Pollard! Why, even in my wildest dreams, I have never conceived
                  anything like this. I have no words to describe my feelings."
               "Wellâ€”you will find words enough before you have been here many days. But I am
                  glad you like the place. We take great pride in it, and Mr. Pollard loves to have
                  our friends appreciate it.
               "Now, then, Dora," continued Mrs. Pollard, as the servants brought her trunks in
                  the room, "get ready for dinner. For a few days we shall be alone, with the
                  exception of the girls. When we get fairly settled, Mr. Pollard and the boys will
                  come up to dinner every day, and we shall try to make your stay pleasant."
               "I see something which I know will make it pleasant, even without your studied
                  kindness," said Dora, and she looked meaningly towards the door of the apartment
                  in which they were standing.
               "Why, Nellie!" exclaimed Mrs. Pollard, half reproachfully, turning to the quarter
                  indicated by Dora's looks, "I declare I am ashamed of you."
               This was spoken to a bright, active child of some ten or eleven years, who had
                  been peering into the room while Mrs. Pollard and Dora were conversing versing, and who was evidently watching
                  the new comer with great interest.
               "Come in, Miss Curiosity," added the loving mother, with a faint attempt to frown,
                  "come in now. Dora, my dear, this is the baby of the family," and she drew forward
                  the petted childâ€”"there, Doraâ€”there she isâ€”our last and worst."
               "Come here, darling," said Dora, moving towards the child; and taking her
                  unresisting hand, she gazed earnestly in her clear, deep blue eyes for a moment,
                  and said, "I am going to love youâ€”what is your name?"
               "I don't know that I have any name. Brothers call me Pug, and father calls me
                  Pussy; mother sometimes calls me Nellie, but I believe that is a nickname," and
                  she looked so mischievously at her mother, the fond lady had to turn aside to
                  conceal the broad smile which had been called forth by the apt replies of the pert
                  little minx.
               "Well, Pug, Pussy, or Nellie, I shall claim you," said Dora, passing
                  her hand gently over the flowing curls of the lovely child. "You and I will be
                  friends, I know," she added, emphatically, and Mrs. Pollard answered only by a
                  very emphatic "ahem!"
               But it is not necessary for the purposes of this story to attempt any description
                  of Mr. Pollard's beautiful place, or of the manner in which Dora Barton passed her
                  time.
               She was as happy as she could be, in view of the trials through which she had been
                  called to pass, and surrounded as she was by every luxury and comfort, and treated
                  with a delicate kindness and attention which won her warmest gratitude, she
                  partially forgot her past griefs, and revelled in the happiness which everything
                  around her encouraged her to enjoy.
            
            
               
               Chapter XXIII.
               Another Nobody's Child.
               IT was not very difficult for a young, warmhearted, and enthusiastic girl, such as
                  was Dora Barton, to find happiness, situated as she now was.
               Art, taste, and wealth had combined to make the place everything to be desired,
                  and Dora found full vent for her enthusiasm in the daily discovery of new beauties
                  which challenged her admiration.
               And she was treated so kindly, so tenderly, so affectionately, by every member of
                  the family, it would have been almost a wrong to feel unhappy in such society, and
                  almost in spite of herself, she half forgot her past griefs, in the enjoyment of
                  her present pleasuresâ€”and nothing contributed more to that enjoyment, than the
                  perfect harmony which pervaded the family of Mr. Pollard, large as it was.
               For Mrs. Pollard, her children exhibited an affection amounting almost to
                  veneration, while to the father was extended that respectful attention and ready
                  obedience which belonged, as well to his kindness as a parent, as to his worth as
                  a man and a gentleman. Everything around the estate was conducted on a scale of
                  magnificence commensurate with the wealth of the proprietor, and on the second
                  week of her arrival, a pet pony, the property of the youngest son, who was off at
                  boarding-school, was placed at her disposal, for her exclusive use.
               The sons went daily to the city in company with their father, and Dora was
                  therefore left with Mrs. Pollard and her daughters, one aged about sixteen, the
                  other, Miss Nellie, who has been already introduced to the reader. As for Nellie,
                  or Pug, or Pussy, as she called herself, she became so much attached to Dora, that
                  whenever she was missed, it was only necessary to search for Dora, and Nellie was
                  sure to be found.
               One day, very soon after her arrival, while strolling about alone, she noticed a
                  youth working in one of the beautiful groves which were scattered over the place,
                  whom she had not before seen, and as it was evident that he was employed there,
                  she approached the spot where he was working, and accosting him pleasantly, they
                  soon fell into conversation, and leaving his work, he joined her in her walk. He was a bright, pleasant-looking
                  lad, who had probably seen seventeen summers, and whenever Mr. Pollard's name was
                  mentioned, his eye kindled, his face brightened up with pleasure, and his words
                  came out so earnestly, Dora surmised that there must be some special cause for the
                  exhibition of such deep feelings.
               "You love Mr. Pollard very much, Edward?" she queried.
               "Love him, miss! That word, strong as it is, cannot half express my feelings for
                  him. I am sometimes afraid I worship him," replied the lad, his very soul speaking
                  through his flashing eyes.
               "Indeed!" said Dora, with a pleased look at the ardent young speaker, and her
                  glance seemed to encourage him to continue his remarks, for he added warmlyâ€”
               "If I did not love him with all my heart and soul, I should be the most ungrateful
                  of beings."
               "Are you in anywise related to him?" asked his companion, with an air of deep
                  interest.
               "Not at all," he replied earnestly, "though I am sure no relation can love him
                  better than I do. Why, I owe everything on earth to him, and ought I not to love
                  him?"
               "Indeed, you ought," replied Dora, in a voice trembling with emotion, for in the
                  few words thus far uttered by her companion, she had discovered the strong
                  similarity in their positions.
               "Why, Miss"â€”â€”and he looked inquiringly at her, pausing at the same time, as if
                  awaiting her answer.
               "Dora," she said, rightly reading his meaning.
               "Miss Dora," he continued, with glistening eyes and glowing cheeks, "a few years
                  ago I was a poor, houseless, homeless, friendless orphan, without one human being
                  on earth to care whether I lived or died. I passed my whole time in roving the
                  streets, staying at night in such places, the remembrance of them makes me
                  shudder. One dayâ€”when I was about twelve years of age I suppose, for I don't know
                  really how old I amâ€”I was injured, while playing about a train of cars. Mr.
                  Pollard happened to witness the accident; and what do you think he did?" he added,
                  with an expression in which such deep gratitude shone forth, the tears actually
                  started to Dora's eyes, and she could only shake her head in reply.
               "Why, he had me brought up here, and he had me cared for and nursed as if I had
                  been one of his own. And not only that," he continued, with, if possible, increased earnestness, "but he has kept
                  me ever sinceâ€”he has given me a good educationâ€”and has secured a place for me as
                  soon as I am capable of filling it. And don't I love him; and ought I not, Miss
                  Dora?"
               By this time, Dora's eyes were running over; and Edward now, for the first time,
                  noticed her excessive agitation. The parallel between their positions was so
                  marked, it went to her inmost heart, and she poured forth her tribute of tears to
                  the memory of the dear friend and benefactor who had taken her to his heart and
                  home when she, too, was a friendless outcast.
               Edward looked at her for some moments in surprise, then said respectfully, "I
                  hope, miss, I have not said anything to offend you."
               "Oh, no, no," she eagerly replied; "wait one moment, and I will talk with you,"
                  and burying her face in her hands, she gave way to the tears and sobs she could no
                  longer restrain.
               They walked on, side by side, in silence for some distance, until Dora had become
                  more composed, when, wiping her eyes, she extended her hand to her companion, and
                  said, with a sad, sweet smile, "Your words affected me very much, Edward. I, too,
                  was a poor, friendless, homeless outcast, when I was found by just such a friend
                  as Mr. Pollard has been to you."
               "And you love him just as I love Mr. Pollard?" he queried. "Then you know how I
                  feel," and his very soul seemed to speak through his eyes.
               "I did love him, but,"â€”and here her sobs and tears broke out afresh, and her lips
                  could utter no sound.
               "I do beg your pardon, Miss Dora," said Edward earnestly, as he now noticed her
                  deep mourning.
               "You need not, Edward; I did not require your words to recall to my heart him who
                  was my best friend and benefactor. But come," she said, wiping her eyes, and
                  forcing herself into composure, "do not let us speak of this again. We will be
                  friends; will we not?"
               "I will do anything on earth for you, miss; for you can understand me, I know, and
                  won't blame me for loving Mr. Pollard."
               "Blame you for loving him!" she exclaimed, looking at him with an expression of
                  surprise.
               "You need not look so astonished, Miss Dora. There are plenty who say I only
                  pretend to love him, because I expect favors from him."
               "Thereâ€”please don't say any more, Edward," said Dora, with a strong effort forcing back the
                  tears which these words, reminding her so truly of her own past, had brought again
                  to her eyes in spite of herself. "Talk about something else;" and guided by him,
                  she strolled through the groves, and lanes, and by-paths of the estate, he
                  pointing out whatever he thought would attract or interest his companion, until,
                  looking at her watch, she found that it was nearly dinner time, and turning back
                  they hastened towards the house.
               As she ascended the broad steps of the portico, which ran the whole length of the
                  house, Edward stood gazing at her with an expression of the most earnest
                  admiration; and as the closing of the front door shut her from his sight, he
                  murmured, "God bless that girlâ€”she has a heart, I know;" and turning away, he went
                  back to the place where Dora had found him, and resumed the work on which he was
                  engaged when accosted by her.
               "You have been crying, Dora," said Nellie, looking into Dora's flushed face and
                  red eyes, as she took her seat at the table; and this remark drew Mrs. Pollard's
                  attention to her.
               "Excuse my looks, Mrs. Pollard," said Dora, with some emotion, "but I chanced to
                  meet a young lad while I was strolling about, and we fell into conversation. His
                  words forced upon me the consciousness of my sad position."
               "I can readily imagine the rest, my dear," said the kind matron, who justly
                  imagined that she had met Edward, and that he had been talking in his usual strain
                  of high eulogy of Mr. Pollard to Dora, and that his words had awakened the
                  reminiscence of her departed friend.
               "He is a good, truthful boy," she said earnestly; "and if ever any one was truly
                  grateful for a kindness, he is. You may like him, Dora, as much as you please; he
                  is a great favorite throughout the family, and deservedly so. I really believe he
                  would lay down his life to serve us."
               "Yes, he is a good boy," said Mr. Pollard, (for he and his sons came now regularly
                  home to dinner, as the trains from the city allowed them ample time after the
                  close of business hours for that purpose); "he is rather too enthusiastic; but his
                  heart is in the right place. I think he will be something in course of time."
               "It was really pleasant," said Dora, to whom this remark had been addressed, "to
                  see gratitude so warmly expressed. It actually seemed as if words could not
                  suffice to tell me how devotedly he was attached to you."
               
               "Yes, of course," said the banker, who, having no motive save that of humanity in
                  his care of the friendless orphan, could not realize the propriety of such high
                  praise and such boundless devotion for the performance of that, which his heart
                  told him was a simple duty, and which he had discharged without any thought, save
                  that of doing unto others as he would have wished others to do unto him.
            
            
               Chapter XXIV.
               The Heiress in Possession.
               BUT turn we now to Mrs. Edson, her "lovely and accomplished daughter," and her
                  "legal adviser," for that was the term invariably applied to himself by Mr.
                  Harding, when Mrs. Edson's name was uttered in his presence.
               Armed as the pompous lawyer had been with plenipotentiary powers, from the sole
                  heiress of the wealthy Mr. Barton, he found very little difficulty in
                  substantiating her claims to his estateâ€”in fact, none at all, save such as were
                  thrown in his way by the necessity of the proper legal publications. His
                  connection with Mrs. Edson, and his prospective control of her estate, enhanced
                  very considerably his importance, if not in the eyes of his brethren at the bar,
                  certainly in his own, and he moved around among such as chose to pay deference to his assumed greatness, a perfect whale
                  among the minnows.
               The proper legal forms had been complied with. Mrs. Edson was entitled to, and had
                  received letters of administration upon her brother's estate, for there was no
                  opposition, and she entered into full possession of a fortune, large beyond her
                  most boundless ambition, yet one to which she was not entitled, save as it had
                  been committed to her by the sudden dispensation that called Mr. Barton away from
                  earth.
               Doctor Thornton and Mr. Lander had many earnest consultations upon the subject,
                  but no scheme could be devised by which the due course of law could be delayed,
                  and they saw with undisguised sorrow, Mrs. Edson take possession of the large
                  property left by Mr. Barton.
               Mr. Harding, now satisfied that there could be no mistake as to Mrs. Edson's
                  position, and, of course, fully acquainted with the exact amount of the property
                  to which she had so unexpectedly fallen heiress, renewed the suit which he had
                  formerly paid to her, and with entire success, for in addition to her preconceived
                  attachment for him, his conduct throughout, since the death of her brother,
                  convinced her that there was no person who could with such perfect propriety, be
                  intrusted with the management of her affairs. She did not know that the law in due
                  course would have put her in full possession of her rights, without the important
                  aid rendered by her legal adviser, and he took good care to impress upon her the
                  value of the services he had rendered.
               The result may be readily anticipated, for she promised to intrust to him, not
                  only the care of her fortune, but of her happiness, as a wife, after a sufficient
                  time had elapsed to comport with propriety. Meanwhile, everything was left to his
                  management, and he found so much to engage him in looking after the affairs of his
                  future wife, he partially neglected his extensive practice in the Marine, and
                  other courts of equal dignity and importance.
               From the day in which Mrs. Edson was, by the process of the law, put in full
                  possession of her property, an entire change came over her. Until everything had
                  been duly arranged, she kept herself measurably aloof from society, and moved
                  about in her circle of acquaintances, in a quiet, unpretending manner, speaking
                  everywhere, and upon every possible occasion, of her "dear brother," in terms of
                  the most exalted eulogy, and acting to perfection the grief-stricken mourner.
               
               Of Dora she spoke (for she was often compelled to answer questions concerning her)
                  in terms of the warmest affection, and of mild reproval.
               "Dora was a good girl, no doubt, but it was a great pity she had not properly
                  understood her position. Her 'dear brother,' she was afraid, had so spoiled her by
                  his indulgence, she would never be of any service to herself or others. She (Mrs.
                  Edson) had offered to her a very handsome annuity, but the ungrateful girl had
                  actually spurned it, and insisted upon half the fortune of her dear brother,
                  claiming that he intended to have bequeathed it to her."
               There were many among those who worshipped Mammon alone, who chimed in with Mrs.
                  Edson in condemning Dora for her ingratitude and selfishness, but there were also
                  many who could not be made to believe that Dora, in losing a fortune which she had
                  certainly a right to expect, had lost her worth or her virtues, and while they
                  honored and esteemed her, they gave her also their pity and sympathy.
               As for Clara, her delight at the change in her position was unbounded, for in one
                  sense she was now independent, as she could easily rule her mother, either by
                  coaxing or flattery. The change in her manners towards most of her old friends
                  disgusted them, for they could not but feel that it was solely on account of her
                  wealth she assumed such airs of superiority and patronage.
               Some she cut directly; others she treated so coldly they were glad to avoid her;
                  and having weeded her list of acquaintances to her own satisfaction, she commenced
                  to make new ones, and as she selected them solely on account of their wealth and
                  the position which that wealth gave them, it will readily be imagined that she had
                  not secured many friends.
               
               Her mother's well known wealthâ€”for the whole fashionable world had heard of Mrs.
                  Edson's sudden accession to Mr. Barton's large fortuneâ€”drew around her many
                  admirers, and her vanity was gratified to her heart's content. The flatteries
                  poured into her willing ear rendered her, if possible, vainer than ever, and her
                  manners grew so haughty, so imperious, and she was so unmistakably selfish in all
                  her requirements, that gradually even her oldest and best friends dropped off from
                  her, and she had really in the whole world, no one to whom she could look for
                  heart sympathy or true friendship.
               Mrs. Edson, immediately after being put in possession of her brother's property,
                  changed her course entirelyâ€”and from
                  being the grief-stricken mourner, ever speaking of her "dear brother" in tones of
                  most affectionate warmth, now rarely ever mentioned his name, or if forced to hear
                  it recalled to her by some of those who, knowing her past dependence, took delight
                  in quietly but pointedly recalling it to her upon every available occasionâ€”she
                  turned the conversation into some other channel, and invariably cut the speakers
                  thereafter.
               She had set up her carriage, with a coachman and footman, dressed in the deepest
                  of mourning livery, and as an added testimony of her deep grief at the loss of her
                  dear brother, her coach was trimmed with black inside. It was kept in constant
                  service by mother or daughter, and this was the only recompense they could find
                  for being compelled to decline the many invitations sent to them, for they could
                  not so far violate the rules of propriety, as to go into company so soon after the
                  death of their only near relative. However, as has been said, they found some
                  compensation for this deprivation, in the daily exhibition of their new and really
                  elegant equipage on Broadway at all hours of the day, and in the admiration which
                  it excited.
               It had been arranged between Mrs. Edson and her "legal adviser," that it would
                  comport much better with their wealth and position to make a wedding tour to
                  Europe, than to remain in the city after the ceremony, and to that end it was, on
                  consultation, deemed advisable to sell off the furniture and rent the house,
                  taking up their residence meanwhile at a hotel.
               Everything was, of course, left to Mr. Harding's management, and, in due time, he
                  had secured apartments for the family (including, of course, himself) at
                  theâ€”â€”Hotel, then the most fashionable, as well as the most expensive in the
                  country.
               Clara was perfectly delighted at the idea of hotel life, and her happiness was
                  completed, when she found herself installed with her mother in a suite of rooms,
                  furnished in the most luxurious manner, and with an army of waiters at her
                  command.
               Mr. Harding, of course, engaged an apartment at the same hotel, but his whole
                  time, when not compelled to attend to his legal business, was given to Mrs. Edson
                  and Clara; and he was always to be found in their parlor, where he seemed to be,
                  as he really was, at home, as much as the regular occupants.
               The furniture of the house in which Mrs. Edson had passed so many years, was duly
                  advertised for sale, as that of a
                  "family about leaving for Europe;" and the sale being intrusted to
                     the auctioneer of the city who held the first rank in his
                  business, was heralded with all the pomp and ceremony for which he had made
                  himself so famous.
               The advertisement of the sale attracted the attention of Arthur Randolph, who drew
                  Doctor Thornton's notice to it, and his first comment upon perusing it was a very
                  expressive "Umph!"
               "I wonder what next?" queried Arthur.
               "Put a beggar on horseback, etc.," replied the doctor, moving restlessly in his
                  chairâ€”"I tell you what, Arthur, the library and pictures are mine by right, if not
                  by law, for I know that they were intended for me. I want you to attend the sale,
                  and purchase all the pictures and the entire library, even to the smallest volume.
                  I will have something to remind me of my best friend."
               "Would not Dora like something, too?" queried Arthur, slightly coloring as he
                  mentioned the name of her who was so dear to him.
               "I am glad you thought of that. I remember, I often used to find her seated by the
                  side of Barton of an evening, when he was at his secretary, looking over his
                  papers. Now, I think that secretary would please her better than anything else.
                  Buy that, at any price, and I'll have it placed in my office; and she will see her
                  old friend in her new friend's house, when she returns from the country. On second
                  thoughts, perhaps you had better not go to the saleâ€”at least, not to bid; for, if
                  that precious scamp, Harding, finds that you or I are seeking anything, he will
                  run it up to double its value. Better get some person who is posted in such
                  things, and tell him what to buy. You can be there, and pay for them."
               "Won't it be grand to get ahead of that vagabond!" said Arthur, rubbing his hands
                  in joyful anticipation.
               "I tell you what, Arthur," replied his uncle, "when the secretary is bid off, do
                  you be sure and announce Dora as the purchaserâ€”and give the full name; you
                  understand?"
               "Perfectly, uncle. I will guarantee that every person in the room shall hear her
                  name. That is a grand idea," he continued, half aloud. "How it will make that
                  rascally lawyer squirm!" and he chuckled at the thought.
               "Do you remind me on the day before the sale, and I will give you a check for all
                  you will be likely to purchase," said the doctor, turning to his table, and
                  resuming the perusal of the work on
                  which he had been engaged, when interrupted by his nephew.
               "All, except the secretary," said Arthur, quietly.
               "Oh!â€”ah!â€”of course," replied the doctor, with a pleased expression, for he knew
                  that Arthur wished to purchase that himself, and present it to Dora.
               The sale of Mr. Barton's furniture took place in a few days after the conversation
                  just detailed, and Doctor Thornton's directions were scrupulously obeyed. As only
                  Arthur attended the sale, and, as he was almost unknown to Mr. Harding, who was
                  present, it was not known, until after the close of the auctioneer's duties, who
                  had become the owner of the library and pictures; but, when Mr. Harding was
                  informed that Doctor Thornton had purchased the entire lot, he was absolutely
                  mortified and angered to think that he had not been shrewd enough to suspect it,
                  and make him pay well for them. But, it was too late now; and, consoling himself
                  with the reflection that, as it was, every dollar paid in was clear gain to Mrs.
                  Edson, and, of course, to himself, he submitted with the best grace he could.
               The books and pictures were removed on the day following the sale to Doctor
                  Thornton's residence dence, and the secretary was placed in his office; and, as
                  Arthur looked at it, he wondered if his darling Dora would take as much pleasure
                  in receiving such a memento of her dearest and best friend, as he derived in
                  presenting it.
            
            
               
               Chapter XXV.
               Dora's New Friends.
               ON Mr. Pollard's beautiful place there was one particular spot, remarkable as well
                  for its uniqueness as for its marvellous beauty.
               It was a small, circular grove, composed of every kind of tree which could be
                  acclimated; and although it was some hundred feet in diameter, the trees and
                  shrubs had become so interwoven, the sunlight could not illuminate its recesses;
                  and though anything but gloomy, it was even in midday so dark, it almost cost an
                  effort of the eyes to distinguish the features of those within its beautiful
                  inclosure. It was a favorite resort of Dora, as indeed it was of every guest who
                  visited the place, and no doubt many a tale of love had been breathed within its
                  shades.
               Dora had been domesticated nearly two months with this happy family, and, thanks
                  to the kindness and sympathy of all by whom she was surrounded, had measurably
                  recovered from the shock which the loss of her friend and benefactor had
                  caused.
               With Edward she had long and pleasant strolls, and she took as much delight in
                  listening to his warm praises of his generous patron, as she did in speaking of
                  him who had made the world so bright to her when he was living, and whose death
                  had cast such a dark shadow across her pathway.
               Dora often retired to this grove to indulge in thought, and seated on one of the
                  rustic couches which were placed within, she passed hours in sad solitude: for,
                  surrounded as she was by every comfort and luxury, and blessed as she was by the
                  kind sympathy of those who loved her for herself, she could not forget him to whom
                  she owed even the present luxury of griefâ€”him who had so wound himself about her
                  heart, life itself seemed a blank without his presence and his love.
               She had thrown herself one day after dinner on one of the couches in the grove,
                  and was ruminating upon the sad past and possible future, when the sound of voices
                  entering the grove aroused her, and springing up, she started towards the only
                  spot through which entrance or exit might be had.
               "Is that you, Dora?" was asked in tones which she knew well were those of Mrs. Pollard, who was
                  accompanied by some one whose features in the darkness she could not
                  recognize.
               "Yes, madam; I was about to return to the house."
               "Come back with me, I have something to say to you. Oh, you need not draw back,
                  Charley; you must come in, too, and face the musicâ€”I believe that is the term;"
                  and as she spoke, Dora knew that Mrs. Pollard's companion was her eldest son, a
                  fine, well bred, and handsome youth of some two and twenty summers.
               "Oh, mother, this is too bad!" he said, half reproachfully.
               "It will be worse, Charley, if you don't mind me. Do you think I am going to
                  listen to such things when I know how false they are? Come, sir, in with you, and
                  finish your sentence in Dora's hearing and presence"â€”and seizing his arm, she
                  dragged him reluctantly enough to the centre of the grove, where she compelled him
                  to be seatedâ€”and then going towards Dora, who stood in the entrance, wondering
                  what this might portend, she drew her unresistingly forward, and quietly forcing
                  her to a seat on the rustic bench opposite her son, she seated herself by her
                  side, and turning to him, said very composedly, "Now you can go on, Charley?"
               "I declare, mother, this is too bad!" exclaimed the young gentleman blushing,
                  though his companions could not perceive it.
               "Go on, sir, and finish your story," said his mother composedly, taking a hand of
                  Dora, who sat there mute and trembling, wondering what was coming next.
               "Miss Barton, of course you will excuse me?" he queried, addressing Dora. "It is
                  mother's fault," and he turned appealingly to Mrs. Pollard.
               "Of course, sir; I can excuse anything you may do, for I cannot conceive that you
                  would do or say anything requiring an apology."
               "There, Charleyâ€”do you hear that?" said Mrs. Pollard, turning to her son. "You
                  don't deserve such a compliment as thatâ€”so thank Dora by completing your story, as
                  I bid you."
               "Miss Dora, it concerns you," he said, bowing; "and if any one but my mother had
                  bidden me to repeat it, I should have refused. Her word is my law," and he turned
                  with an air of reverence to her who well deserved that mark of respect.
               "Of course, Mr. Pollard"â€”â€”
               "Oh, stop there, Miss Dora. If you call me. Mr. Pollard I shall call you Miss Barton. No, no;
                  we are too good friends, I trust, for such formality."
               "Well, then, Charley, go on," said Dora, her eyes gathering moisture as such kind
                  words saluted her ears.
               "Well, then, Miss Dora, you are the party most interested; and as mother orders, I
                  will finish what I had just commenced saying. I was dining yesterday at
                  theâ€”â€”Hotel, and I chanced to overhear your name mentioned. I suppose it was not
                  very polite, mother, to listenâ€”but knowing she was our guest, I could not help it.
                  The speaker was a young lady, who, with her mother, and a very portly, pompous
                  gentleman, was seated near me. I heard your name coupled with epithets which made
                  my blood boil, and when the laugh was raised at your expense I felt that, but for
                  the possibility of compromising you, I should certainly have got into
                  trouble."
               Dora knew but too well to whom he alluded, and burying her face in her hands, gave
                  way to tears and sobs, which could not be restrained.
               "Now, Dora, I won't allow this," said Mrs. Pollard, earnestly. "I know all about
                  it, and it has no more effect upon me than the idle wind. Charley," she said,
                  suddenly turning upon her son, who was gazing upon Dora, and striving through the
                  gloom to discover why she was so much affectedâ€”"how old are you, Charley? Let me
                  seeâ€”twenty-two."
               "Pretty near," responded her son, wondering what was to come next.
               "I wish she was a man," said Mrs. Pollard, half aloud, but loud enough for her son
                  and Dora to hear, and both turned to her with inquiring looks.
               "And why, mother?" asked her son, in wonderment.
               "So that my son might punish her slander as it deserves. I tell you, my son," said
                  Mrs. Pollard, with all the energy of an honest, earnest heart, "if Doctor Thornton
                  had not adopted Dora, I do believe I would have done so. That is my answer to all
                  you have heard."
               "Thank you, mother. I did not need your commendations to make me honor Miss Dora.
                  I am only sorry I mentioned the matter at all."
               "You have made me very happy by doing so, Mr. Pollard," replied Dora.
               "There you go again," said the young gentleman, interrupting her. "Mr. Pollard is
                  at the house, smoking his cigar."
               
               "I beg your pardon, Charley. I do not deserve such kindness"â€”â€”
               "There, that will do, Dora," said Mrs. Pollard, interrupting her. "Clara Edson,
                  Clara Edson's mother, and their combined slanders, can never change my opinion of
                  you. Come, Dora, go up to the house; I have something to say to Charley," and she
                  took Dora's hand so warmly, so affectionately, the dear girl's tears started
                  afresh, but she wiped them away, and leaving the mother and son alone, started for
                  the house.
               When about half-way towards the mansion, she was startled by a voice at her elbow,
                  but recognizing on the instant the tones of Edward, she saluted him kindly, and
                  asked him to accompany her, as it was now quite dark, and she feared she might be
                  lost amid the labyrinth of lanes, lawn, and groves, through which she would have
                  to pass.
               "I heard every word," Edward said earnestly, as he walked by her side.
               "Edward, that was very wrong; you did very wrong to listen."
               "I know I did," he almost sighed, "but I heard your name mentioned as I was
                  passing the grove, and I could not resist. I am sorry," he said, half musingly, as
                  he thought of the wrong he had done, for he felt keenly the reproach from Dora;
                  "but I am glad, too," he added in his natural tones. "Now, let me tell you
                  something. Charley is desperately in love with you."
               "Hush, Edward; that is worse than the other. You must not talk so," and she felt
                  the crimson blush starting to her cheeks.
               "I can't help it. He has seen how kind you have been to notice me, and I half
                  think that he spoke to me on purpose that I might repeat what he said to you; and
                  so he has hinted, and hinted and spoke so much about you, that I ventured to ask
                  him once"â€”â€”
               "Edward, you must stop; you have no right to speak thus, nor I to listen to you.
                  You have done very wrong."
               "It can't be worse if I finish my sentence, and I will. He said he would give all
                  the world if he could make you his wife!"
               "Edward!" said Dora, bursting in tears, "you have pained and grieved me. I did
                  think you knew me better than to think that I could discard"â€”â€”
               "Edward!" shouted a voice in the path ahead of them, and both recognized it as
                  that of Charley.
               Edward, who knew that he had left the young gentleman with his mother far away in
                  the grove, could not account for his
                  presence so far ahead of them, but with a bow, and a few deprecatory words, he
                  left Dora, and hastened to answer the summons.
               Dora walked along slowly, revolving in her mind what she had heard within the past
                  few minutes; but, before she had time to collect her wandering thoughts, she was
                  again startled by the voice of Charley, who, by some means or other, had managed
                  to intercept her on her return to the house.
               "Miss Barton," he said, respectfully, "I hope you will pardon me."
               "Certainly, Mr. Pollard, if Miss Barton can have anything to forgive to such kind
                  friends."
               "I won't say it again, Doraâ€”Miss Doraâ€”dear Dora!"
               "Stop, Charleyâ€”not one other word."
               "But, oh! Dora, let me say what I think, and feel, and dare to hope!"
               "Not one word, Charley, or I must leave this forever. Let me speak as plainly as
                  you would, if I would allow you. I knowâ€”nay, Charley, I feel, what you wish to say
                  to me, and to which I cannot listen. It is impossibleâ€”hopelessly, and utterly
                  impossible! Now, Charley, let us be friends. You understand me?" she asked,
                  earnestly, laying her hand gently on her companion's arm. "Let me say more, and
                  end this subject as between us forever: I love another so well, I could not love
                  even you."
               "Thank you, Dora, for your candor. It has only made me regret the more that I did
                  not know you before."
               "Come, come, Charley, you are young, very young yet. A whole life is before you,
                  and you will forget this in time, and thank me for being so truly your friend.
                  Now, Charley, give me your arm, for I am tired, and don't say a word of this to
                  any one, unless you want me to leave a place where I have been so happy."
               "I wish she was a man only for one day," muttered Charley, but loud enough to be
                  heard by Dora.
               "There, never mind her. I have heard such things as that for a long time from her,
                  and you see I don't mind it; and, I am sure, if you are my friend, you will never
                  notice it."
               "Well, I won't, of course, because I have no right to; but Dora, I can't help
                  wishing she was a man," and Charley's hands were closed very tightly, though he
                  did not know it.
               
               "You couldn't marry her if she was," said Dora, thus adroitly changing the
                  subject; and by the time they reached the house, Charley, who was young, ardent,
                  and enthusiastic, had been so calmed by the superior mind of his companion, he
                  almost forgot that he was a rejected suitor; but he loved Dora with a true love,
                  for all.
            
            
               Chapter XXVI.
               Approaching a Crisis.
               IT is not necessary to go into a detail of the occurrences which transpired during
                  the few months after the parting of Miss Arden, Doctor Thornton, and Dora.
               The former lady had disposed of her property in the West, and returned to New York
                  towards the close of the summer, taking up her residence with Mr. Chapman's
                  family, until, by becoming the wife of Doctor Thornton, she should acquire a
                  permanent home.
               Dora was still at Mrs. Pollard's when Miss Arden returned from the West, and, in
                  compliance with the banker's urgent request, backed by the pressing entreaties of
                  his amiable and kind-hearted lady, Miss Arden consented to pass a few days with
                  those who had proved themselves such warm and true friends; and the time passed so
                  pleasantly, it was almost with a sigh
                  of regret she took her leave to return to the city.
               As for Dora, there was a general crying spell when she had to take leave of her
                  hospitable friends, and Edward, who loved her with all the intensity of youth and
                  enthusiasm, would not be consoled, while Nellie wandered about for several days,
                  sorrowful and lonesome.
               In truth, the dear girl had so wound herself around the hearts of the whole
                  family, there was not one member of it who would not gladly have hailed her
                  permanent stay among them with delight.
               On Dora's return to the city, she was installed as the present head of Doctor
                  Thornton's establishment; for, in anticipation of his marriage, he had purchased
                  an elegant house, and furnished it in a style commensurate with his means and
                  standing.
               Arthur Randolph, who had managed during Dora's absence to pay a visit at Mrs.
                  Pollard's place once in each week, had, after a great deal of persuading and
                  coaxing, obtained her consent to be married at the same time that Miss Arden and
                  the doctor united their fortunes; and, as it now lacked but a few weeks of the
                  time set for that ceremony, she found abundant occupation in making the necessary
                  preparations. She was daily with Miss Arden on their shopping excursions, and, in
                  fact, when she was not at Mrs. Chapman's, Miss Arden was at the doctor's house
                  with her. They were inseparable; and the love which had sprung so suddenly in
                  their hearts on the occasion of their first meeting, had by this time attained
                  full, vigorous growthâ€”and they were perfectly happy in each other's society, and
                  equally happy in anticipation of the future.
               As for Clara, her delight at the change in her position and circumstances knew no
                  bounds. She was surrounded by a throng of idle butterflies, who, readily
                  discovering her weak points, so flattered her, and so encouraged her self-love,
                  she had no room in her heart for any other feeling.
               Settled in the magnificent apartments selected for them by Mr. Harding, she had
                  nothing to do but to dress, flirt, and exhibit herself daily on Broadway, and she
                  found her pleasure and happiness in the adulation so freely poured out from her
                  bevy of admirers, who, having ascertained the precise extent of her expectations,
                  were perfectly willing to sacrifice themselves upon the shrine of Mammon.
               Mr. Harding, who, with all his ignorance, was a shrewd observer of human nature,
                  was quite content tent to allow Clara
                  to follow unchecked the bent of her inclinations, for he foresaw, that the more
                  she flirted and coquetted, the smaller grew her chances of being married, and this
                  was a consummation which he did not wish to see fulfilled, for it would involve
                  the necessity on the part of her mother of making a suitable marriage provision
                  for her, and consequently withdrawing from himself a portion of the fortune which
                  she had so providentially inherited, and which, in his opinion, 
                     wasn
                     wasn't
                   one too large for his comfort or enjoyment.
               He, therefore, encouraged and stimulated her vanity and self-importance, until she
                  grew so insufferably proud and vain, he was satisfied that she would never consent
                  to link herself and her fortune with any one under the rank of a Duke or
                  Marquis.
               There was one, however, who had carried by storm the heartâ€”no, not the heart, for
                  Clara Edson had no longer a heart, but the preferences of the prospective heiress,
                  and before her mother or her "legal adviser" dreamed of such a consummation, she
                  had actually pledged herself to him, and had granted him permission to accompany
                  them on their contemplated tour, promising that if she did not find there any one
                  whom she liked better than himself, she would become his wife.
               The gentleman who had received such decided marks of preference, was a young Cuban
                  adventurer, whose chief merits consisted in his splendid black moustache, his
                  silky whiskers, his brilliant eyes, and his consummate impudence.
               He was a boarder at the hotel, and the lavishness of his expenditure (Clara did
                  not know how much he owed, nor what terrible efforts it cost him to keep up
                  appearances), assured her that he was wealthy, and she built a thousand castles,
                  based upon the happiness she would enjoy when surrounded by the luxuries which her
                  intended had promised should be hers when they reached his home in the Queen of
                  the Antilles.
               Mr. Harding was considerably annoyed when Mrs. Edson communicated to him the fact
                  that the young Spaniard, whose attentions to Clara had often attracted his
                  attention, was to form one of their party in their European tour, but he was not
                  then so situated as to venture a remonstrance, and contented himself by expressing
                  the hope that she had made a selection worthy of her rank, wealth, and
                  station.
               Meanwhile, preparations for the double marriage of Dr. Thornton and his nephew
                  were proceeding harmoniously. Every day Dora and Miss Arden were out on shopping excursions, making purchases
                  of the dresses, and thousand et ceteras, which ladies about to be married find so
                  indispensable.
               Occasionally they encountered, in these excursions, Mrs. Edson and Clara, who were
                  engaged on a similar expedition. The latter invariably refused to recognize Dora,
                  and she so far forgot what was due to herself as a lady, as to point her out when
                  they chanced to meet, and with sneers to whisper loud enough to be heard by all in
                  her vicinity, that there was the charity girl, picked up in the streets by her
                  dear Uncle Charles.
               Dora's good sense enabled her to bear up under these inflictions, and, cheered by
                  the love of Doctor Thornton and Miss Arden, who seemed actually to grow into her
                  very heart, she moved on happily and steadily, turning neither to the right nor
                  the left, but content to feel that she was treading in the path of duty.
               A very trifling circumstance, however, which transpired very shortly before the
                  period appointed for the nuptials of Mrs. Edson, changed very materially the
                  aspect of matters so far as she and her daughter were concerned.
               One morning the servant, in cleaning out the office of Doctor Thornton,
                  accidentally overturned his heavy rocking-chair, and in falling, it struck one of
                  the doors in the bottom of the secretary which had been purchased for Dora at the
                  sale of Mr. Barton's furniture, and broke it in two.
               The servant, who knew the attachment with which Dora regarded that piece of
                  furniture, was excessively frightened at the mishap; but as it was purely
                  accidental, Dora forbore to chide her, and consoled her by the assurance that it
                  could easily be repaired, and made as good as it was before.
               When the doctor returned home in the evening Dora was waiting to receive him, and
                  first exacting from him a promise not to scold the servant, she showed him the
                  fractured door, and with a "pooh, pooh," he told her not to mind it, as he would
                  have it mended at once.
               Accordingly he dispatched a servant to the shop of a German cabinet maker who
                  resided in the next street, with a request that he would come round in the
                  evening, as he wished some repairs to be done to a piece of furniture.
               The man made his appearance while the doctor and Dora were at dinner, for Arthur
                  had not yet returned from his business, and was shown into the office, whither he
                  was soon followed by the doctor.
               "You see what is to be done?" he queried, as the man stooped down to examine the extent of the
                  damage. "You can mend that without taking the secretary away?"
               "Oh, yes," he replied, "I can make a new door at the shop, but I must take the old
                  one off for a pattern."
               "Certainly; take it off," replied the doctor.
               "That is a nice piece of furniture you have there, doctor," said the workman, as
                  he proceeded to unscrew the remains of the broken door.
               "It looks to be well made."
               "It is well made, sir. I made that myself for Mr. Barton. There is
                  not another in the city like it."
               "You are sure of that? You made it for Mr. Barton?"
               "I ought to be sure of it, sir. Why, the secret drawers in that book case cost me
                  a week of good hard labor."
               "Secret drawers! Why, I never knew of any. Mr. Barton was my dearest friend, but
                  he never spoke to me of any such thing. Show them to me."
               "Certainly, doctor;" and stooping down, he opened the uninjured door, and putting
                  his hand to the extreme end of the desk, touched a spring, and that which had
                  seemed to be scroll work on the side of the drawer above the doors, sprang out,
                  and disclosed a long, narrow drawer, divided into compartments, and in the extreme
                  end arranged in pigeon holes.
               "There is one on the other side," resumed the man, and touching a spring on the
                  other side of the desk, a drawer similar to the first was exhibited.
               Doctor Thornton, who had approached the desk in surprise and astonishment at this
                  discovery, pulled both drawers out to their extreme length, and perceiving some
                  papers in one of the pigeon holes, took them out carelessly, and proceeded to
                  examine them, while the workman was still engaged in unscrewing the broken
                  door.
               Three or four unimportant papers were hastily looked at and thrown aside, but one
                  of them seemed to command the doctor's earnest attention. Hastily glancing at the
                  heading, he tore it open, and one look seemed to suffice him, for he put it into
                  his pocket without a word of comment, but with a singular smile upon his face; and
                  drawing forth a gold piece, tendered it to the astonished workman, saying, "There,
                  my good fellow, take that; I am obliged to you more than you can realize, for
                  showing me those private drawers. Now show me how to open and close them, and then
                  you can finish the job afterwards."
               
               The man did as he was desired, and the doctor having watched him in silence until
                  the door was unscrewed and borne off, took from his pocket the paper which had
                  been found in the secret drawer, and perused it with evident interest and
                  attention.
               Replacing it in his pocket, he took up his hat, and sending word to Dora that he
                  would be home in the course of an hour or so, and bidding her tell Arthur not to
                  go out until he returned (little need was there of that while Dora was at home),
                  he left the house, and wended his way, directly and with rapid steps to the
                  residence of Mr. Lander.
               That gentleman was at home, and the doctor was ushered into the library, where he
                  was cordially greeted by his friend.
               "Why, doctor, what on earth is the matter with you? You look as if you had just
                  won your lady-love, or killed a patient!" and, truly, the doctor's appearance
                  fully justified that or any other supposition; for his face was flushed, and his
                  eyes shone with a most wicked, mischievous expression.
               "I have not lost anything, but I have found somethingâ€”there, look at that!" and he
                  threw on the table before him, the paper which had been discovered in the secret
                  drawer of Mr. Barton's secretary. "Perhaps you know that handwriting."
               "I ought to know it," he said, carelessly taking up the paper, and glancing at it.
                  "I have seen it for fortyâ€”â€”Why, holloa! doctor, where in the name of justice and
                  honesty did this come from?" and he fairly sprang from the chair, as he held the
                  paper in his extended hand.
               "Never mind where. I found it where it was put. It's all right, isn't it?"
               "Right as seals and signatures can make it."
               "And, it's valid, ain't it?" queried the doctor, earnestly.
               "All the lawyers in the State could not set it aside."
               "And Dora comes out right, after all?"
               "And Mrs. Edson won't come out with such high honors. Oh! won't I be glad to pull
                  down that vagabond, Harding. I'll be at him to-morrow."
               "No, you won't. I have a better plan than that. If you let him know that the first
                  will is found (for such, in truth, was the discovery made by the doctor), he will
                  never marry his charmer. No, noâ€”listen to me," and, in a low voice, the worthy
                  doctor proceeded to unfold his plans, which seemed to please the lawyer very much,
                  for he rubbed his hands with great glee, and promised to lend his aid to the
                  doctor in carrying them out to the letter.
               
               The doctor's next visit was to Miss Arden, where, of course, he was welcomed with
                  real warmth.
               "Now, my dear lady, I want very much to make you happy," said the doctor, his eyes
                  actually brimming with pleasure.
               "It is not quite time yet," she said, archly, as she withdrew her hand from his
                  earnest grasp. "I believe that the 18th of next month was the day settled on."
               "You need not remind me of that," he said, with a smile. "I should not be apt to
                  forget it, I am sure. But, I am in very earnest, Ellen. I have something to
                  communicate which will make you very happy, but I can only tell it on one
                  condition, and I scarcely think you will be able to comply with that."
               "Suppose you try me."
               "It involves a desperate effort, and the practice of much self-denial on your
                  part."
               "I can make the one, and practise the other, if either will afford you pleasure,
                  Doctor Thornton," she said, looking him full in the face, and with an expression
                  which he could not withstand.
               "I'll trust you, if you are a woman."
               "Thank you, at the expense of my sex," she said, very demurely.
               "Well, then, Ellen, I have found Mr. Barton's will."
               "Honest?"
               "Upon my honor! The secretary which was bought for Dora, was broken this morning
                  by accident, and I sent for a German cabinet-maker, around the corner from my
                  house, to fix it, as I knew how highly Dora prized it. He, it appears, had made
                  that very piece of furniture for my dear friend Barton, and showed me two secret
                  drawers, of which I had never heard or dreamed, and in one of those I found the
                  will."
               "And what are the contents?"
               "I thought I had mentioned to you before that he had made a will some three or
                  four years ago, when he went South on business."
               "You never named it."
               "It was because we thought it was not in existence."
               "We!â€”pray, who do you mean by we?"
               "Oh! you need not be jealous, Ellenâ€”there is only one we in the
                  worldâ€”I mean Mr. Lander, my friend's counsel. It gives all to Dora, except
                  annuities of a thousand a year to Mrs. Edson, and five hundred to Clara."
               "And, what else!"
               
               "Why, the pictures and library which I purchased, to me."
               "Good! You want me to keep that a secret?"
               "I do."
               "And, why?"
               "Because, I have my own plans to carry out, and I am sure you will approve of
                  them."
               "Suppose you tell me what they are; you might as well trust me with the whole; I
                  shall be better able to judge whether I ought to keep the secret or not."
               "I don't think you a very good judge, so I shall hold you to an unconditional
                  promise," and he proceeded to detail his plans as arranged between himself and Mr.
                  Lander.
               "You are a good soul, doctor, and I don't believe I shall ever repent the
                  sacrifice I have promised to make," she said, when he had concluded.
               "It is a sacrifice, I admit, but it is made on an altar, at which we all worship,"
                  replied the doctor, gallantly; and, having urged upon her the necessity of the
                  most profound secrecy, so as not to foil his plans, he took his leave.
            
            
               Chapter XXVII.
               Operations of the Law.
               THE day fixed on for the wedding of Mr. Harding and Mrs. Edson was rapidly
                  approaching. Invitations had been sent out by hundreds, and the proprietors of the
                  hotel at which they were boarding had received instructions not to spare any
                  expense, and they promised to make the affair one of the most brilliant and
                     recherchÃ© of the season, if not of the city;
                  a promise which was abundantly fulfilled, if the expressions of admiration from
                  the guests were any test.
               And they were marriedâ€”Clara and Mr. Cordeba (her Cuban admirer) acted as
                  bridesmaid and groomsman upon the occasion, and many were the remarks made upon
                  the appropriateness of the match between the young couple, which every one
                  considered as a settled thing, and many were the expressions of wonder that both weddings had not
                  taken place at once.
               Mrs. Edson was merged into Mrs. Harding, and a proud and happy bride she was, or
                  seemed to be, while Clara, thinking only of the pleasures in store for her in view
                  of their European tour, quite overlooked the influence which her new father might
                  exercise over her actions as well as her fortunes.
               She was thoughtful only for the present, and found ample occupation in receiving
                  the congratulations of her mother's guests, and in displaying the magnificence of
                  her own attire and the splendor of her jewelry.
               The new-married couple had engaged state-rooms on board the steamer which was to
                  leave for Liverpool on the second week after their marriage, and preparations for
                  the journey had been nearly completed.
               On the morning of the day appointed for the sailing of the steamer, the family
                  were seated at the breakfast table in the hotel, and they were so late that there
                  were very few present in the saloon except themselves.
               Mr. Harding was now in his element. He was, if possible, more pompous than ever.
                  His voice sounded like the tones of a brazen trumpet, and every word he uttered
                  was heard from one end of the immense hall to the other.
               "A gentleman to see me!" he said, swelling out until the waiter who made the
                  announcement feared he would burstâ€”"Set another plate, and show him up. Some one
                  from the steamer, I presume, my dear," he said, with a smile, to his new-made
                  bride, who, in all the luxury of laces, jewelry, and bridal finery, was enjoying
                  her triumph.
               The plate was set, and the servant retired to usher in the visitor whom he had
                  announced.
               At sight of him every one arose. Mrs. Harding with something like contempt on her
                  countenance; Clara with an absolute sneer, and Mr. Harding with his stolid, brazen
                  look, which seemed to defy oppositionâ€”for he was now master of Mrs. Edson and of
                  her fortune.
               It was Doctor Thornton, and with a courtly bow he approached the party, holding in
                  his extended hand some folded papers, having very much the appearance of legal
                  documents.
               "For you, Mr. Harding," he said, tendering to him one paper, "and this for you,
                  madam," he said to Mrs. Harding, as he extended the other to the lady, who took
                  it, without exactly knowing what she was doing, looking at the same time at her new-made husband, as if to ask what was
                  the meaning of this ceremony.
               "What's all this, sir?" said Mr. Harding, in a loud, blustering voice, for he had
                  glanced casually over the contents of the paper, and its purport was recognized by
                  him at onceâ€”"What's all this, sir? Some forgery, I have no doubt;" and he put on
                  one of his fiercest looks.
               "Stop, sir!" said the doctor, with an air of dignity which actually overawed the
                  questionerâ€”"You must not forget to whom you address such language."
               "I did not accuse you, sir," said the lawyer, regaining his impudence and
                  composure, for both had been sadly disturbed by the perusal of the document handed
                  to him by Dr. Thornton.
               "It was well you did not," was all the reply vouchsafed by the doctor, who had
                  begun to exhibit some symptoms of anger at the manner in which he had been
                  received, though the recollection of the triumph which he knew he would soon
                  enjoy, enabled him to conquer his feelings, and to smile upon the feeble attempts
                  of the dumbfoundered lawyer to annoy him.
               "I should like to know what this means," said Mrs. Harding, who had been perusing
                  the document ment handed to her, while her husband and the doctor were conversing,
                  which, from its technicalities, was in truth quite incomprehensible to her. "This
                  is all a mystery to me. I am sure I don't know anything about it."
               "Your legal adviser, there," replied the doctor, with a very marked expression of
                  contempt, "will inform you fully on the subject, I have no doubt. For the present,
                  I wish you a very good day, and prompt digestion;" and with a very low bow, and
                  with an expression of the most absolute defiance, the doctor took his leave of the
                  astounded family, wearing a most unmistakable look of triumph.
               "What did that horrid doctor want?" lisped Clara, for she had acquired the very
                  rational accomplishment of torturing her words so as to be scarcely intelligible
                  when she spoke.
               "Never mind that child, Mr. Harding," said his bride, with a meaning look. "Clara,
                  go to your room, and see that everything is properly arranged. We have to be on
                  board the steamer by half-past eleven, you know. Come, go along, my dear," she
                  repeated, seeing that Clara paid no attention to her directions, for she dared not
                  give positive orders.
               "I think we will all retire to the parlor," said Mr. Harding, who, while his wife
                  was speaking, had been carefully
                  perusing the document handed to him by the doctorâ€”and his face wore such an aspect
                  of seriousness and disappointment that Clara took alarm, and hastened off; while
                  Mrs. Harding, rising and approaching her husband, put her hand gently on his
                  shoulder, and queriedâ€”
               "What does it mean, my dear? What on earth brought that horrid doctor here?"
               "Mean, madam!" he said in stentorian tones. "Mean! It means, madamâ€”my dear, I beg
                  your pardon," he interrupted, seeing that his harshness had brought the blood to
                  the face of his new-made bride. "The fact is, this silly imposture has almost
                  thrown even me off my guard," and offering his arm, which she took without any
                  further remark, for she noticed that their conversation had been overheard by all
                  in the dining room, he led her silently towards their parlor.
               When they reached their apartments, which were strewed with trunks, bandboxes,
                  shawls, and the omne genus of a female
                  traveller, the porter of the hotel was in waiting to collect the baggage, for the
                  purpose of taking it to Jersey City, whence the steamer was to sail.
               "Please, sir," he said, respectfully, "there's so much, I thought we had better
                  get ahead an hour or so, and then you would be sure to have it all on board."
               "I'll do the thinking," replied Mr. Harding, with rather more than his wonted
                  pomposity. "The baggage is not ready yet. I will ring when I am prepared to have
                  it dispatched," and he waved the man out of the room.
               "Now, then, my dear," said his wife, seeing that they were alone, for Clara had
                  retired to her own room to collect her scattered et ceterasâ€”"please to tell me
                  what this means."
               "Why, simply this, my darling," he replied, with a very wry face, and an air
                  anything but affectionate as contrasted with his words. "It means that this is
                  what we members of the bar, call a citation to yourself, as sole heir, and myself,
                  as your husband, to appear at the office of the surrogate, and show cause, if any
                  there be, why a certain instrument purporting to be the last will and testament of
                  Charles Barton, gentleman, deceased, should not be admitted to probate.
               "I don't understand your long words, Mr. Harding," she replied, with more of
                  tartness than well became so new a bride. "So please to make your meaning more
                  intelligible, and speak so that I may know what you mean."
               
               "My meaning, then, is simply this," he replied, with something of asperity in his
                  tones, "that there has been a prior will, it seems, made by Mr. Barton, your
                  deceased brother, the existence of which was unknown to you or to anybody else;
                  and from the tenor of these papers I have no doubt that will has been found."
               "Some forgery, anybody might know. Why it is as well known as that my dear brother
                  died, that he died without leaving any will," and she tapped the floor nervously
                  with her delicately slippered foot.
               "And that you, as his sole, surviving relative, took possession as heir-at-law of
                  his effects, real and personal," continued her husband, with a dignified wave of
                  the hand; for as yet he was the master of Mrs. Edson that had been, and had the
                  control, by virtue of his power of attorney, of her large fortune.
               "A gentleman to see you, sir," said an obsequious waiter, throwing open the parlor
                  door, and a short, genteelly dressed, and rather handsome man, whose nose was
                  ornamented by a pair of gold spectacles, was ushered in.
               "Have I the honor of speaking to Mr. and Mrs. Harding?" he said, in courteous
                  tones, and with a bow that would have graced the court of the Louvre, though he
                  knew Mr. Harding as well as he knew himself or any one else.
               "You have that honor," said the legal adviser of the late Mrs. Edson, putting a
                  thumb in either arm of his waistcoat, for he was well acquainted with the face and
                  character of the intruder.
               "Allow me, sirâ€”allow me, madam," and drawing forth a large pocket book from his
                  breast pocket, he extracted from it two portentous looking papers, one of which he
                  handed to either party addressed; and exhibiting to each a third paper of similar
                  dimensions and appearance, he held it open for their inspection, and simply
                  saying, "this is the original," he bowed again with the grace of a courtier, and
                  retired.
               "Well, I declare," said Mr. Harding, glancing at the contents of the document
                  which he held in his hand. "He has not omitted anythingâ€”exceedingly well and
                  correctly done, upon my word. He has evidently had good legal advice."
               "Well, Mr. Harding, and what is this?" said his wife, extending towards him the
                  document which she had received from the courtly official.
               "Well, my dear, to spare long words, it is very simply an injunction restraining
                  each of us from disposing in any manner
                  of any portion of the estate, real or personal, of your deceased brother."
               "What does that mean?"
               "So very much, my dear, that we shall have to postpone our trip to Europe for the
                  present, at least."
               "My dear!" exclaimed, or rather gasped his wife, for she was almost dumb-struck,
                  "what does all this mean?"
               "I dare not say, until I have been to the surrogate's office. There is evidently
                  something serious in this, or that doctor would never have taken such measures as
                  he has. There is something more than you or I dream of."
               "But, are you earnest about our European trip?"
               "Most earnest," he replied, very energetically, and with an air of the most woeful
                  disappointment.
               "Can you not leave your matters in the hands of proper parties to attend to them
                  for you during our absence?" queried his wife, now seriously alarmed by his
                  manner.
               "I have no doubt, my dear," replied Mr. Harding, extending to her the paper which
                  had created such confusion, "that this very excellent doctor has served a document
                  precisely similar to this on the bankers from whom I procured our letters of
                  credit, as well as on the bank where your money is deposited."
               "This is some ridiculous scheme of his to frighten me into an arrangement with
                  that beggar's brat, Dora! I'll see her starving first!" replied Mrs. Harding, with
                  clenched hands and flashing eyes.
               "Better wait and see what will be the end of it," replied the lawyer, very coolly.
                  "This trip must be abandoned now. The steamer sails at twelve, and it is
                  impossible for me, even if he has not stopped the letters of credit at the
                  banker's, which I am quite confident he has, to employ any one to attend to such
                  matters. Besides, my dear," and he grew a little more affectionate, "where your
                  interests are concerned, it is my duty to attend to them in person. We must
                  forfeit our passage money."
               "Are you in earnest, Mr. Harding?"
               "In very sober earnest."
               At this juncture, Clara entered the parlor where this conversation had been held,
                  loaded down with shawls, and other paraphernalia of travelling; and, as she threw
                  them on the piano, turned to her mother with a flushed and angry face, saying:
               "I am sure you might have sent the maid to do that."
               "The maid may undo it all," said her step-father, authoritatively. "There will not be any need of
                  them at present."
               Clara made no reply, but stood mute and aghast.
               "You did not hear me, perhaps," he said, in tones meant to convey a very
                  unmistakable meaning; "let me repeat my words: the maid may undo them allâ€”there
                  will not be any necessity for them at present."
               "I don't know what you mean," she said, turning to her mother, with a look of
                  amazement.
               "It is as Mr. Harding has said. There will be no present need of them, Clara.
                  Circumstances have transpired which will render it impossible for us to take our
                  trip to Europe at presentâ€”certainly not by the steamer of to-day."
               Clara made no reply, but bursting into an agony of tears, partly of rage, partly
                  of mortification, threw herself at length on the sofa, and sobbed, as if she had
                  met some hidden grief.
               "There, go to your room, and don't make a fool of yourself," said her mother, in
                  harsh and commanding tones; and, for a wonder, Clara, without pausing to ask any
                  questions, arose and obeyed.
               "Now, then, my dear, I must go down to the surrogate's office at once, and see
                  what all this means. It is either some prodigious fraud, or there is more in it
                  than we dream of."
               "I have no doubt there is some fraud about it. Everybody knows that my dear
                  brother died without a will, and the idea of trumping one up now, is simply
                  ridiculous. No, no!â€”that doctor has chosen this time, when we were about to leave
                  the country, to frighten me into some settlement on Dora. But go, my dear, and
                  hurry back; I want to hear what all this meansâ€”if, indeed, there is any real
                  meaning in it."
               Mr. Harding awaited no further urging, for he was as anxious as was his wife to
                  learn the true state of the case, but left the room without another word, while
                  Mrs. Harding proceeded to join her daughter in her own chamber, whither she had
                  retired.
               "Clara," she said, "don't make a fool of yourself. The idea of crying like a
                  child, because of a little disappointment"â€”â€”
               "Littleâ€”little!" she exclaimed, drying her tears. "You call this little? Well,
                  it's very unfeeling in you, mother, after all the preparations and expectations;
                  and Juan is on board now, waiting for us."
               "Juan had better come back, then, as quickly as possible," said her mother, with
                  the slightest perceptible ceptible
                  sneer, "or he may lose a wife, and you may lose a husband."
               "You talk like a fool!" was the reply of the affectionate daughter, and then
                  commenced a scene of crimination and recrimination much more common than polite,
                  and which it is unnecessary to repeat.
               It was interrupted by the return of Mr. Harding, who appeared with a very long and
                  sombre face, for he had been to the office of the surrogate, and had been favored
                  with a perusal of the will discovered by Doctor Thornton, the contents of which
                  Mr. Lander had so faithfully remembered.
               "Well, my dear, what is it?" queried his wife, nervously.
               "It does not look much like a forgery," was his reply. "It was drawn up three
                  years ago, and is witnessed by Lander and two of his clerks."
               "Yesâ€”I remember. He went South about three years ago, but he never said anything
                  to me about a will."
               "I have no doubt of that. But the will is in Lander's writing, and is perfect in
                  every respect."
               "Well, what does it say?"
               "Five hundred a year to Clara, and a thousand to you," he replied, with something
                  very like a groan.
               "And the rest?"
               "All to Dora, but the books and pictures."
               "And those?"
               "To Doctor Thornton; and he is appointed Dora's guardian."
               "Well, and what next?"
               "That's allâ€”and I think it quite enough for one day."
               "You hear that, you undutiful minx," said Mrs. Harding, turning to her daughter,
                  who had remained silently drinking in every word uttered by her new father.
               "Five hundred dollars a year to me!"
               "And one thousand to your mother," he replied, with a very low bow to his new
                  wife.
               "Oh," said Mrs. Harding, with ill-concealed agitation, "this is some monstrous
                  fraud. I appeal to you as my husband, as my counsel, to protect my rights."
               "My dear, from present appearances, your rights will be well cared for. The will
                  is perfectly regular, the witnesses are living and can prove it, and the only
                  thing to be at all relied upon, is the lateness of the period at which it is
                  brought to light and the manner of its discovery."
               "Of course, you will not allow it to go on without attending to my rights?"
               
               "Of course, I shall do no such thing. If the will is, as I suppose, perfectly
                  regular, all the lawyers in New York would fail to upset it, and I cannot in
                  conscience recommend you to incur any expense in contesting it; especially as I
                  can see no grounds for opposition."
               "One thousand dollars a year to me"â€”â€”
               "And five hundred to me," said Clara, interrupting her mother.
               "That's just the sum I wanted to allow Dora," said Mrs. Harding, with something
                  like self-reproach.
               But it is needless to prolong this scene. Mr. Harding, who was acute enough to
                  discover that he had fallen into a trap, saw that his only present course was to
                  make the best of it, for he found some comfort in the consciousness that an income
                  of a thousand dollars a year was not to be despised, even though encumbered with a
                  wife, and a shrewish daughter. The one he knew he could manage, the
                  other he determined he wouldâ€”and there we leave this interesting
                  family.
            
            
               Chapter XXVIII.
               A Discovery.
               THE day appointed for the nuptials of Doctor Thornton and Arthur Randolph was
                  rapidly approaching, and as yet the secret intrusted to Miss Arden had been
                  faithfully preserved, though the good doctor kept her fully informed as to every
                  step he had taken in the matter.
               Mr. Harding had turned and twisted the matter over in his mind a thousand times,
                  but he saw no hope of escape from the certainty that the fortune which he had
                  married would pass from his grasp. There was no doubt that the will which had been
                  discovered was genuineâ€”no doubt that it was duly attested, because he knew
                  personally every one of the witnessesâ€”and equally no doubt that any hope of
                  contesting it would be fruitless, and involve unnecessary expense, which in his
                  present mood he felt no inclination to incur. He therefore, as the legal adviser of his wife, counselled her to submit
                  with the best grace she could, especially as such a course would avoid any present
                  public exposure; and Doctor Thornton found himself duly installed without any
                  opposition as sole executor of his dear friend's last will, by which his friend's
                  adopted daughter came at length into possession of her rights, and he became her
                  legal guardian.
               Dora had been kept in blissful ignorance of this whole transaction, and it was the
                  doctor's purpose to reserve the information at his command, until the proper time
                  and occasion warranted him in making it known.
               Mr. Harding yielded with the best grace he could, to proofs which could not be
                  invalidated; and the doctor enjoyed his greatest triumph in forgiving him the
                  amount he had already spent of Mr. Barton's fortune, the restoration of which Dora
                  could have enforced by lawâ€”and the pompous lawyer's expression of thankfulness for
                  the considerate kindness of Miss Dora (to quote his own words) was a grateful
                  tribute to the worthy doctor, who felt and acted for his ward.
               Doctor Thornton positively declined any interview with Mrs. Harding or Clara; for
                  their cold-heartedness, to call it by no harsher name, had impressed him so
                  unfavorably towards them, even if their conduct to Dora in past times had not, he
                  could not bring himself to consent to an interview with them. It was sufficient
                  that, as Dora's guardian, he forgave them the sums they had squandered, which, of
                  right belonged to her; and with the promise to carry out faithfully the provisions
                  of Mr. Barton's will, he declined most emphatically any communication with
                  them.
               Mr. and Mrs. Harding, as soon as it was certain that the will of Mr. Barton, which
                  had been so singularly discovered, was legal and binding, removed quietly from the
                  hotel, and had, much to Clara's mortification, established themselves in a small
                  two-story house which had been hired in Grove street, where, upon the income
                  derived from Mr. H.'s profession and the thousand a year bequeathed to his wife,
                  they could manage to live in comfort.
               Clara suffered more mortification than her mother or her stepfather; for her
                  Juanâ€”her devotedâ€”had not only gone to Europe without her, but had gone with money
                  borrowed on the strength of his approaching marriage with her, though of this she
                  was happily ignorant at the time.
               None of the admirers whom she had attracted at the hotel, followed her to her new
                  and humble abode, and she was for a
                  season left alone to mourn over her departed glory.
               It lacked a few days only of the time which had been appointed for the double
                  nuptials of the doctor and his nephew, and early in the afternoon Arthur sent word
                  to Dora that he would call for her in a light wagon to take a ride, requesting her
                  to be in readiness at the hour named.
               They started in high spirits, unknown to the doctor, whose calls had kept him out
                  quite late, so late that he had not been at home to dine.
               On his return, towards the close of the day, he was a little annoyed at finding
                  his house deserted, but on hearing the cause, grunted out some remark, but whether
                  of approbation or disapprobation, the servant, who chanced to be the bearer of the
                  information, could not exactly understand.
               He sat in his office, after finishing his solitary meal, grumbling and
                  discontented, for he could scarcely bear Dora out of his sight when he was at
                  home, quite forgetting how long he was away from home each day.
               While thus engrossed, if engrossed he was, the sound of a carriage pausing in
                  front of his door caused him to look up, and supposing it to be some passing call
                  upon one of his neighbors, his attention tion was not further attracted, but in
                  another moment a hurried ring at the office bell aroused him, and he went to the
                  door himself.
               To his great surprise Arthur stood there, with anxiety and pain on his
                  countenance; and before the doctor had time to ask any questions, the young man
                  broke out in incoherent exclamations, "Oh, she's killed! Dora, uncle!"â€”and the
                  good doctor, without waiting for the conclusion of his sentence, rushed out to the
                  carriage, which was standing in front of his house, and thrusting his head in,
                  discovered Dora reclining on the back seat.
               "Dear doctor, he was unnecessarily alarmed, I am not much hurt, I assure you," she
                  said, smiling faintly.
               Thus reassured, the doctor entered the carriage, and seating himself by her side,
                  commenced to question her as to the cause of her injuries, but was interrupted by
                  the appearance of Arthur, who had followed him out, and begged him, for Heaven's
                  sake, to take her right in the house.
               "Please to go about your business, young man," said the doctor, very coolly; "this
                  is my affair. You have had your fun. It is my turn now."
               "Dear Arthur," said Dora, holding out her hand with a bright smile, "I assure you
                  I am not much hurtâ€”not at all, in fact;
                  I was only frightened, and I suppose you thought, because I fainted, I was
                  seriously injured."
               "Come, Dora, can you walk?" said the doctor, rising. "Please to stand aside, you
                  break-neck rascal," he added, turning to Arthur, who stood at the door of the
                  coach. "Now, Dora, try," and the doctor, alighting from the carriage, stood at the
                  door ready to receive his precious charge.
               "Oh yes, don't you see?" and she arose and stepped from the coach; but as each
                  movement caused an expression of pain to cross her features, the doctor motioned
                  to Arthur, and gently lifting her between them, they bore her into the house and
                  up stairs into her own chamber, where, having deposited her carefully on the bed,
                  the doctor questioned Arthur as to the how, and when, and where of the
                  accident.
               "The hind wheel of the wagon came off just as we reached the pavement, on our
                  return, and Dora fell out head first. Fortunately, the horse stood still, or she
                  might have been killed."
               "Now, Arthur, you can go down stairs, and stay there until I call you. Send Jane
                  up here, and Martha."
               Arthur sulked a little at this command, but Dora beckoned to him, and drawing his
                  head down close to her own, whispered something which brought a bright smile to
                  his face, and with a soft kiss, he stole out of the room, turning back, however,
                  at every other step.
               "You don't deserve that, you vagabond," said the doctor, with something of a
                  grunt; but Arthur did not hear him, or if he did, not care. It was too late
                  now.
               Jane and Martha were promptly in attendance, and while they were disrobing her,
                  the doctor was questioning her as to the locality of her injuries.
               "Oh, doctor, I was only a little bruised, and very much frightened. I don't think
                  I am really hurt at all. Arthur was much more alarmed than was necessary."
               "Oh, of course notâ€”not enough to render a postponement of the"â€”â€”but seeing the
                  blood mount to her cheek and brow, he forbore to finish the sentence, which she
                  rightly interpreted.
               "Where do you feel the most pain?" he queried, as the servants, having removed her
                  clothing, placed her in the bed.
               "I think the most serious injury is here," she said, pointing to her left
                  shoulder. "I fell on that side. I feel considerable pain there."
               
               "You can move your arms? Oh, yes, I remember; I saw you move them both when Arthur
                  was by your side, "he said, with a comical expression.
               "Fie, doctor!" said the blushing girl, "I did notâ€”I only raised one arm."
               "Well, let me raise the other;" and he proceeded gently to examine the wounded
                  limb. It was discolored, but there was evidently no dislocation or fracture, and
                  the doctor was about to rise, when she said, placing her hand lower down on the
                  arm, "I feel a great deal of pain there," and in an instant the arm was bared to
                  the spot pointed out by her.
               There was a small bruise there on the muscles, but nothing of consequence, and the
                  doctor so pronounced it; but there was something else which attracted his
                  attention, and which excited an unusual degree of emotion in one so staid and
                  composed as Doctor Thornton generally was.
               It was a perfectly defined strawberry, on the outer portion of the arm, just below
                  the mark left by vaccination. It was clear, well defined, and distinct, and it was
                  that which had attracted his attention.
               "Let me see your other arm, Dora," said the doctor, with an air of anxiety which,
                  under the circumstances, might have seemed singular, and withdrawing drawing it
                  from her side, Dora held up for the doctor's examination the beautifully moulded
                  and rounded limb. In nearly the same spot on the other arm, was a small red spot,
                  formed, apparently, by an aneurism of the veins. It had evidently been there from
                  her birth.
               "That is enough," said the doctor, bending down and kissing her with a warmth
                  unusual even in him. "You won't die from these injuries, my dear. Jane," and as
                  Jane approached, he gave her directions as to the treatment of the wounded
                  shoulder, promising that if his commands were faithfully obeyed, his patient would
                  be perfectly recovered by morning, and there would be nothing left to remind her
                  of the accident, but the ugly black spot left by the bruise on her delicate
                  skin.
               "There, now, lay quietâ€”mind what I tell you, and if you are a very good girl, I
                  shan't forbid your getting marriedâ€”when your time comes."
               "Thank you, dear doctor," she said, with a blush and a smile, holding out her
                  hand, which he took, and as he did so, he said with deep earnestnessâ€”
               "You may have to thank me for more than this, Dora. But never mind now. Lay
                  stillâ€”mind the doctor, and to-morrow morning you will be up, as bright and well as ever. Would you like to see
                  Arthur, now?"
               She made no reply, but the love-beaming eyes, and the bright blush which
                  overspread her face, were sufficient answers to his question, and going to the
                  door, he was about to summon that gentleman, but he was spared the trouble, for
                  Arthur, who had taken a chair from one of the bedrooms, had posted himself as
                  close to the door of Dora's room as he could get.
               "Umph!" said the doctor, smiling, "you can go in now," and before the words were
                  fairly out of his mouth, the young gentleman had dodged past him, and was at
                  Dora's side.
               The doctor turned for an instant, and with a low chuckle retired to his
                  office.
               "Well, I declare," said the worthy doctor, as he threw himself into a chair, "what
                  will come next? I cannot be mistaken now. I can never forget those marks. Let me
                  see," and going to his secretary, he searched around for some time, and at length
                  discovered the object for which he was lookingâ€”a small, half-bound book, in which
                  he had kept his diary in the early days of his profession; a practice to which he
                  had faithfully adhered up to the present hour.
               Turning over the leaves carefully, he came at length to the page which he had been
                  seeking, and as he read, he sprang from the chair with an exclamation of joyful
                  surprise, and folding down the leaf where he had been reading, threw the book on
                  the table, and commenced to pace the floor with rapid strides, muttering to
                  himself; but the only words which could be heard wereâ€”" marvellousâ€”wonderfulâ€”how
                  very singularâ€”and just at this time!"
               Doctor Thornton was evidently in a high state of excitement, and it was, perhaps,
                  fortunate that his attention was drawn from the subject which had so aroused him,
                  by a call which demanded his immediate attendance.
               Placing the book carefully in the private drawer which had been the depository of
                  a secret so important to his dear friend's adopted child, he put on his hat and
                  coat, and left the office, muttering, "It won't spoil by keeping, and I'll bide
                  the right time."
            
            
               
               Chapter XXIX.
               The Test of Love.
               TRUE to his promise, on the following day Doctor Thornton permitted Dora to leave
                  her room and join him at the dinner table, for she had entirely recovered from the
                  effects of the accident of the previous day, which had left no marks save the
                  trifling bruise on her arm.
               Doctor Thornton thought he had never seen her look so lovely, and he gazed upon
                  her with an expression which more than once caused her to ask why he looked at her
                  so intently.
               "Only because I suppose I love you to-day more than I did yesterday," he replied,
                  smiling.
               "I am sure I cannot see why, doctor. Have I grown very much better to-day than I
                  was yesterday?"
               "Well, I think you have. At all events, you look better in my eyes to-day, than
                  you ever did before," and he emphasized the "ever" very pointedly.
               "That is very strange," she said; "however, I am glad to please you at all times.
                  But there is certainly something singular in your looks to-day, which I cannot
                  understand."
               "Dora, dear, there is something singular on my mind to-day, and it concerns you.
                  Perhaps that is the reason why I look so at you."
               "Me? Doctor Thornton?"
               "Me, Doctor Thornton!" he replied, mimicking her voice and expression. "Yes, you,
                  Miss Bartonâ€”that was what I said."
               "Perhaps you will tell me what it is?" she queried, with an arch expression.
               "I am very certain that I won'tâ€”â€”at all events at present," he replied, with a
                  pause between the words.
               "And I am very certain I can wait. Ah, here is Arthur," she said, rising and
                  moving towards the door.
               "I don't see him," said the doctor, laughing.
               "I hear him," she said, gaily, and blushing crimson at this detection of her
                  weakness, she left the room.
               In a few moments Arthur Randolph entered alone, and greeting his uncle cordially, took a seat, making at the time some
                  passing remarks on the topics of the day.
               "Where is Dora?" inquired the doctor, rather abruptly.
               "Gone to her room," was the reply.
               "Come down to the office with me," said the doctor, rising, and moving towards the
                  door, and he was followed by Arthur, who wondered what his uncle meant, for his
                  face bore a very serious aspect.
               As soon as they had entered the apartment, Doctor Thornton locked the door, and
                  seating himself, bade his nephew take a chair.
               Arthur looked at him with surprise, but obeyed without any remark, though he
                  thought his uncle's conduct very singular.
               "Sit down, Arthur," said the doctor, kindly, as he noticed his nephew's look of
                  surprise; "I have something important to communicate."
               "Does it concern me, Uncle John?"
               "Well, I think it will pretty soon, if it does not now. You love our Dora?"
               Arthur made no reply in words. The question was so strange, so sudden, so
                  unexpected, and so very unnecessary, he could only answer by a stare of supreme
                  astonishment.
               "Well, I take your answer for granted," said the doctor, laughing at his amazed
                  looks. "I suppose you do love her. At all events, you are about to give a very
                  strong proof of it by marrying her. I have something to communicate concerning
                  her, and as I have reason to think you a rational being, I shall expect you to
                  receive it in a rational manner, and act accordingly;" and he looked earnestly at
                  his nephew, but received no reply.
               "I know you love Dora," continued the doctor, "but I want to ask you, Arthur, if a
                  very great change in her circumstances would make any alteration in your feelings
                  for her?"
               "Nothing you or any living being might communicate, could change my opinion of
                  her, nor my feelings towards her. You may rest perfectly assured of that."
               "I believe youâ€”at least, I believe you think and feel so now," replied the doctor.
                  "But answer me one or two questions. You know, of course, that Dora has no
                  fortune?"
               "Thank God, I don't care for money, for I can earn enough by my profession for our
                  comfort, and you know that. I never sought her for her fortuneâ€”and you know
                     that, too. So, go on, Uncle John."
               
               "I believe you, firmly. But, Arthur, you know there is a cloud over her birth,
                  and"â€”â€”
               "Uncle, you have said as much before. I have known it from my first acquaintance
                  with her, but I love her the same, notwithstanding."
               "Suppose, Arthur, that by a singular, I might say a providential chain of
                  circumstances, the real origin of her birth should have been discovered. Suppose
                  that it should turn out that she is socially, and in every other sense, your
                  inferior?"â€”â€”
               "My dear uncle," said Arthur, rising, and laying his hand upon his uncle's arm,
                  interrupting his sentenceâ€”"My dear uncle, I knew from the first, for you told me,
                  the history of Dora's connection with Mr. Barton. I knew that she had no name save
                  that which his affection gave her. I knew that she was ignorant of her birth or
                  parentage. I knew that she was, as that envious Clara has so often called her, a
                  charity girlâ€”a nobody's childâ€”but I loved her for her worth and virtues. I never,
                  for one instantâ€”and that you know, Uncle Johnâ€”dreamed of her fortune, for I have
                  resolutely refrained from speaking my wishes to her, until I felt independent,
                  even of your kindness. She has the same worth now, in my eyes. She possesses the
                  same virtues, I know, and there is nothing which you could say, except that which
                  might implicate her character and conduct, which could alter my determination to
                  make her my wife. I know her, I know myself, and, God willing, she shall be my
                  wife at the appointed time."
               "Suppose, Arthur," said his uncle, with a smile, which it would have been
                  difficult to interpretâ€”"Suppose, Arthur, that this circumstance, or, as I said
                  before, this providential interference, should prove her to be utterly unworthy of
                  you in a social position?"
               "I would cast such consideration aside, and prove the sincerity of my affections,
                  and my appreciation of her virtues and her worth, by fulfilling my promise to her.
                  She may be what you say, or rather hint, but she is to me Dora Bartonâ€”worthy of
                  any man on earthâ€”and I shall feel proud and happy in the hour that makes her mine.
                  If she was the daughter of a street-sweeper, she would be Dora Barton to me."
               "Arthur, my dear boy," said the doctor, with affectionate earnestness, "you are
                  very young. You have scarcely had opportunities to know your own mind."
               "Uncle John, I don't know what you are driving at. You cannot doubt me, for I say
                  it earnestlyâ€”I say it meaninglyâ€”I say
                  it in the spirit of many independence, for, thank God, I am independentâ€”I love
                  Dora Barton with all my heart and soul. I know herâ€”I love her. No matter what her
                  antecedents may beâ€”she knows nothing of themâ€”she has not been guided or controlled
                  by them, and they cannot affect her so far as I am concerned."
               "My dear Arthur," said the doctor, with great earnestness, "I honor your manly
                  independence, and your adherence to what you believe to be right, but there are
                  circumstances which may operateâ€”nay, ought to operate, on you in your selection of
                  a wife, and it is my duty as your only relative and best friend to make them known
                  to you."
               "Uncle John," said Arthur, with an earnestness quite equal to that of his uncle,
                  "if you know anything which may affect Dora's conduct, or which can impeach her
                  character, you are bound in duty to me to name it. If you only know that which may
                  prove her to be inferior to me in birth, I shall not heed it, even at the expense
                  of your displeasure. You will bear me witness that I have resolutely refused your
                  kind offers to make a settlement on me when you knew my wishes with regard to her.
                  You know that I have refrained from any definite arrangement for our future, until
                  I felt that my own exertions and my own talents, properly exercised, would secure
                  our certain comfort. I have attained that position, and unless you know something
                  which may directly affect her character, I shall marry her on the day appointed,
                  as truly as the sun rises."
               "Arthur, you can keep a secret?" said the doctor, in tones of inquiry.
               "I have been often tried, professionally, Uncle John," replied Arthur, very
                  composedly.
               "Yes, Arthur; but this is personal, and I must exact your promise, that what I
                  have now to communicate shall be kept profoundly secret, until I permit you to
                  divulge it."
               "I can promise that with safety, for I know you will not communicate anything
                  which can impugn Dora's character, or change my feelings for her."
               "I have your promise, then?"
               "On my honor."
               "Arthur, you love Dora truly and devotedly, I know," said the doctor, approaching
                  his nephew and laying his hand on his shoulderâ€”"you loved her when you had reason
                  to believe she was richâ€”you loved her when the world believed she was poor."
               The doctor paused for a reply, but Arthur merely bowed assent, and he
                  continuedâ€”
               
               "Her father, or rather Mr. Barton, who had adopted her as his child, died, as you
                  have heard, intestate, and his sister inherited his estate."
               Arthur again bowed assent.
               "There was a prior will made, which it was thought had been destroyed"â€”â€”
               "Go on," said Arthur, with a simple nod, as his uncle paused to watch the effect
                  his words might have on his listener.
               "That will has been found, and it makes her the sole heiress of his fortune," said
                  the doctor, and he watched his nephew narrowly, to discover the effect of his
                  words.
               "Thank God, she has had justice done to her at last!" Arthur exclaimed, with
                  hearty energy.
               "I am her guardian, and the sole executor of Mr. Barton's estate," continued the
                  doctor.
               "She is in very good hands, and I have no doubt the estate will be prudently
                  managed. But that makes no difference to me. Poor or rich, she is Dora Barton,
                  stillâ€”the only woman I have ever lovedâ€”the only woman I ever can love. That is my
                  answer, Uncle John."
               "Wellâ€”that is her good fortune. Now hear the rest, and it concerns
                  her much more nearly than the mere inheritance of a fortune. Many years ago, when
                  I first commenced practice, I was called on to attend a person in
                  child-birth"â€”â€”
               "Uncle John," said Arthur, with earnestness, "I see now what you are driving at.
                  You mayâ€”nay, I dare say you have discovered, for I judge only from the fact of
                  your speaking in this strain, the secret of Dora's birth. Keep it. I do not want
                  to know it; and I ask you, as a personal favor, not to make it known to me. Nay,
                  moreâ€”I will not hear it. She is my chosen wife, and if she was the offspring of
                  the lowest creature on earth, I could not be insensible to her worth or her
                  virtues, and would wed her for herself alone. I ask you, as a favor, not to say
                  one word on that subject."
               "Suppose, Arthur"â€”â€”
               "Please, Uncle John, if you have any regard for my feelings, say no more,"
                  interrupted his nephew. "What you know, keep to yourself. It mayâ€”it might make me
                  unhappy for a time. I tell you, and I say it in all the sincerity of my heart, you
                  cannot say anything to change my love for Dora."
               "As you choose, Arthur," said his uncle, warmly and affectionately; "I will say no
                  more. The consequences be on your own head. You refuse to hear me, and I can only
                  add, that knowing what I do, I am
                  perfectly prepared to accord my sanction to your marriage with Dora."
               "I can't understand you, Uncle John," said Arthur, with an appealing look. "In one
                  breath you strive to excite my suspicions, and in the next you dissolve them. What
                  does it mean?"
               "Never mind; you will find out in time. I can only repeat, you have my free and
                  full consent to your marriage with Dora, and my hearty wishes for all the
                  happiness you anticipate. God bless you, Arthurâ€”you are a noble fellow, and
                  deserve all the happiness you hope to enjoy. You will hear strange things ere you
                  are many days older; but I assure you, on my honor, they will not detract from
                  your pleasure or happiness."
               "I declare, Uncle John," said Arthur, "I am almost sorry to hear that Dora is
                  rich. I was so happy in the consciousness that I had proved my love to her
                  by"â€”â€”
               "By loving her in spite of yourself. No, no, Arthur," said the doctor, laughing,
                  "don't take any credit to yourself for that. I have had some experience," and the
                  doctor, reflecting that he might say something which might commit another than
                  himself, blushingly cut his sentence short.
               "When am I to know your great secret?" asked Arthur, with a quiet smile.
               "When I am ready to make it known," replied the doctor, with a very ceremonious
                  bow, and the conference ended.
               Arthur retired from the office, full of wonderment as to the possible meaning of
                  his uncle's words, but utterly unable to frame even the remotest conjecture, while
                  the doctor remained seated in his easy-chair, chuckling over the pleasurable
                  surprise which he intended to communicate when the proper time had come.
            
            
               
               Chapter XXX.
               Nineteen Years After.
               IT lacked only one day from the time named for the double marriage of Dr. Thornton
                  and his nephew. Every preparation had been made, but much to the doctor's chagrin,
                  he was enjoined to have the ceremony conducted as privately as was consistent with
                  propriety.
               Invitations were, therefore, sent to those only who were counted
                     friends, and first among them, and this by Dora's choice, was Mr.
                  Pollard and his family, who had contributed, by their kindness so much to her
                  happiness, at a period when kindness was so grateful.
               The only other invited guests were those who might be classed as intimates, and
                  these arrangements having been perfected, the expectant bridegrooms had only to
                  await the hour which was to complete their happiness. Miss. Arden, as well as
                  Dora, positively refused to allow any public reception, at least for the present;
                  Dora, from respect to the memory of her deceased friend, and Miss Arden from
                  respect to Dora's feelings. Both of the gentlemen acquiesced in this arrangement
                  with a very bad grace, but as they were not masters yet, they were forced to
                  submit, and it was arranged that after the ceremony, which was to be performed at
                  the residence of Mr. Chapman, the party were to adjourn to the house of Dr.
                  Thornton, and partake of the refreshments which he had provided.
               On the morning before the eventful day, Doctor Thornton was, of course, at Miss
                  Arden's. She received him as in duty bound (and in love, for she had learned to
                     love him, in spite of her protestations to the contrary), but
                  there was a cloud upon her face, which the practised eye of the doctor soon
                  discovered.
               "I suppose my call is mal-apropos, Ellen," he said, earnestly, "for I have no
                  doubt you have many preparations to make with which I am interfering."
               "Oh, not at all, doctor," said Miss Arden, with her lips, though her countenance
                  belied her words. "You know you are always welcome."
               "Yes; when I don't interfere with a lady's prerogatives gatives. But come, I shall be excused, I know,
                  before I leave. Try and forget dressmakers and milliners, and listen to me for a
                  few moments. Sit down, Ellen, I have something to say to you."
               "Well, you are very cool about it, doctor, considering that you know nothing of
                  what you are speaking. The idea of a lady forgetting milliners and
                  dressmakers!"
               "Sit down, Ellen," and he led her to the sofa, on which she took a seat, but with
                  an air of reluctance which drew a smile from her companion, "I have something very
                  important to say to you."
               "Oh, you always commence in that strain, doctor, when you have nothing to say. I
                  am not your patient yet, and you can't frighten me into a fit of sickness. I
                  suppose you want to tell me I look pale and haggard."
               "Well, now that I look more closely at you, I think you do; but, really, I had not
                  observed it. Are you ill?"
               "Come, doctor, no trifling. If I am pale and haggard, and look wan,
                     you know I have a cause for it. I have not forgotten the past, nor
                  its consequences."
               "Ah, now you talk sensibly. Ellen, I should not have intruded upon you to-day, but
                  that I have something to say to you which will require all your nerve and courage.
                  Give me your hand," and as she extended it to him, and he placed his fingers on
                  her pulse, she drew it away with something of irritation in her manner.
               "There, that will do. Now, listen to me. Ellen, I have recently communicated to
                  you a secret concerning Dora, which I am pleased to know has been most faithfully
                  kept."
               "Well, and was that very astonishing?" she asked, turning upon him, and opening
                  her eyes in well-feigned wonder.
               "Rather so to me, who know the sex so well," he replied, maliciously. "Can you
                  keep another, concerning yourself, until I think proper to release you from your
                  promise?"
               "What, more secrets? Why, doctor, you will become a perfect myth, if you go on at
                  this rate. Well, I will try. Go on."
               "I think I told you, some months since, that it was a little more than nineteen
                  years ago, since I first met you," said Doctor Thornton, fastening his eyes on
                  those of his companion.
               "And I remarked then, doctor, that you had a very extraordinary memory for dates,"
                  responded Miss Arden, with a deep blush.
               
               "There was so very much to impress that circumstance on my mind, I should have
                  been recreant to the best feelings of my heart, if I had forgotten it," and he
                  imprinted a kiss upon her hand, which he had taken when he first commenced to
                  address her.
               "That, I know, concerns me, doctor," said Miss Arden, with a sigh. "Go on."
               "Some few months ago, when you honored me by your confidence, you mentioned that
                  your mother had resolutely refused, even in her dying moments, to afford you any
                  information as to your child, and that in spite of every effort, and of money
                  lavishly spent, you had been unable to ascertain whether she was living or
                  dead."
               "In the name of Heaven, doctor, what do you mean?" said Miss Arden, half starting
                  from her seat, but he drew her back, retaining her hand in his own, and continued
                  in the same calm voiceâ€”
               "I have reasonsâ€”strong reasons to believe that your daughter is living."
               "Doctor Thornton!" exclaimed Miss Arden, springing up, and snatching her hand from
                  his own, and as she spoke, her whole frame was convulsed with emotion, "you are
                  too much of a manâ€”too much of a gentleman, to trifle with me on a subject so
                  sacred as that."
               "Sit down, Ellen," said the doctor, composedly, "and listen to me," and he drew
                  her again to his side, she looking at him the while as though she would read his
                  very soul.
               "Now, my dear Ellen," he continued, taking her hand again, "I know you are a woman
                  of strong sense. You must not give way to any unnecessary excitement, for I am
                  here to tell you that I have good reasons to believe your daughter is living,
                  and"â€”â€”
               "Oh, doctorâ€”dear doctor!" exclaimed Miss Arden, rising, and throwing herself on
                  her knees before him, she clasped both his hands in her own "in the name of God,
                  tell me where she is? Let me see herâ€”let me tell her how miserable I have been
                  these twenty years. Let me tell her what I have suffered on her account. Let me
                  tell her the agony, the remorse, the anguish, which have wrung my heart, least she
                  should have been taught to believe that her mother had willfully abandoned
                  her."
               "Rise, my dear Ellen," he said, tenderly, and placing an arm around her waist he
                  seated her again by his side. "Try and compose yourself, or I shall have to keep half of my secret from
                  you."
               "Oh, doctorâ€”no matter what she isâ€”where she isâ€”only let me see her. Let me"â€”â€”
               "My dear Ellen," interrupted the doctor, deprecatingly, "I shall have to stop,
                  unless you control your feelings better. I have nothing unpleasant to tell you. On
                  the contrary, I can add more to your happiness than I had believed within the
                  range of possibility; but I dare not do it, unless you are prepared to listen to
                  me more calmly than you do. You must not give way to such excitement."
               "How can Iâ€”how can I be calm, doctor, when you speak to me of that which has been
                  on my heart like a dead weight for so many years? Oh, dear doctor! if you love me,
                  tell me what you know of her. Is she happy?"
               "Ellen, such questions cannot be answered now. You either assumed too much, or I
                  was too abrupt. I only said I had good reasons to believe that I had discovered
                  your daughter."
               "You would not have spoken thus without good grounds," she said, trying to
                  restrain the sobs and tears which his first words had called forth. "Doctor
                  Thornton, as you love me, tell me, do you know she lives?"
               "Ellen, my dear wife, that will so soon be, I do."
               "Bless you! bless you!" she murmured, laying her head on his shoulder and sobbing,
                  but she had no voice for further words.
               "Now, Ellen, if you will compose yourself and listen to me, I will tell you as
                  much now as I think it prudent to intrust to your keeping. I have told you that I
                  had good reasons to believe I had discovered her. I now say, I know beyond
                  peradventureâ€”that I have seen her, and know her."
               "Know her, doctor! God help me, but I should not, if she was to stand before me
                  now."
               "I will ease your mind, by telling you that Providence threw her in early life
                  among friends. That she is loved and lovelyâ€”surrounded now by every comfort that
                  affection can bestow. She is beautiful, accomplished, amiable, and all that a
                  parent's heart could wish."
               "Doctor Thornton, is she happy?"
               "As happy as the love of all who know her can render her."
               "God be praised for his goodness to her," she said, clasping her hands and raising
                  them to Heaven with devout thankfulness. "I have no right to know more, though the
                  Lord knows my child has never been absent from my thoughts, and that my prayers have been offered up daily for
                  her."
               "I am going to promise you something more, Ellen," said the doctor, with a smile,
                  "seeing that you have partially recovered your senses. If you will promise to be
                  very good indeed, you shall be made happy to-day by seeing her."
               "To-dayâ€”to-day! doctor?" she exclaimed, the blood rushing to her face and
                  neck.
               "This very day. I have chosen this day to bring you face to face, because I wished
                  to add to your happiness, and in doing so increase my own. I have known this only
                  a few days, but have chosen to keep it from you until now, for reasons which I am
                  sure you will approve."
               "It seems like a dream, doctor," she said, rubbing her hand slowly across her
                  forehead, as if to collect her thoughts. "I can scarcely realize what you have
                  been saying."
               "Let me repeat it, Ellen," he said, placing one arm around her waist, and taking
                  one of her hands in his own. "I have seen and conversed with your daughter. I know
                  her to be your child by evidences which cannot be controverted, and if you promise
                  me to behave very well, you shall see her this day, as I have just told you."
               "Yesâ€”yes," she murmured, dropping her head on his shoulder, "I am not dreaming. I
                  see it now. God bless you, doctor, and make you as happy as I shall strive to do.
                  You said to-day, doctor?" she queried, raising her head, and looking at him with a
                  smile of love and hope.
               "This very day, Ellen; within a few hours I shall bring you face to face."
               "Does she know anything of"â€”â€”
               "Not one word has passed my lips," said the doctor, interrupting her sentence,
                  "and she has no more idea of seeing a mother, than you had an hour ago of seeing a
                  daughter."
               "May I ask you some questions?" said Miss Arden, looking confidingly in his
                  face.
               "Any you chooseâ€”but, of course, that does not involve the promise of an answer to
                  them."
               "She is beautiful?" said, or rather queried, Miss Arden.
               "Very beautiful, indeed," was the response.
               "And happy?"
               "As happy, I said, Ellen, as the love of all who know her can make her. She is
                  engaged to be married."
               "God forbid that she should"â€”â€”
               "Don't finish that sentence, Ellen. I happen to know the one to whom her faith is plighted, and I
                  can assure you that he is in all respects worthy of her."
               "And she loves him?"
               "They have known each other many years, and have ever loved each other."
               "Doctor," said Miss Arden, her countenance assuming a shade of sadness, "she has
                  rights as well as myself. With all my wishing, my longings, my prayers for her, I
                  would, even with the information you have imparted to me, forego the bliss of
                  having her know me, if you think it would cost her one pang."
               "Pang!" echoed the doctor, "it will make her the happiest of created beings, and I
                  know"â€”but fearing least he might prematurely betray his secret, he abruptly
                  checked himself.
               "Go on," said Miss Arden, with a meaning smile, for she noticed his
                  embarrassment.
               "Never mind," replied the doctor, recovering his self-possession. "You shall see
                  her very shortly. By the way, Ellen, Dora is so soon to become one of our family
                  in reality, do you not think she ought to know something of the past? She is a
                  high minded, noble-hearted girl, and her own sorrowful experience has, I am sure,
                  taught her to look upon things as they really are, and not as they seem to
                  be."
               "Do you think so?" queried Miss Arden, musingly.
               "I really do. You know how devotedly she loves you, and the very fact of your
                  having been unhappy in your earlier years, will, from very sympathy, bring her
                  closer to youâ€”if, indeed, that is possible."
               "Well, doctor, you have proved so often that you know so much more of the world
                  and its ways than I do, and you have been such a dear, good, considerate
                  man"â€”â€”
               "And constant, Ellen," he interrupted.
               "And constant," echoed his companion, with earnestness, "as any woman could
                  desire. I will do just as you say."
               "Then put aside your millinery for a few minutes. Put on your hat and shawl, and
                  let us go around and tell Dora as much as is proper for her to know. You must
                  remember, Ellen, that to-morrow she becomes your niece, and it would never do for
                  her to hear anything concerning you, except from yourself."
               "You dear, good soul!" exclaimed Miss Arden, rising, "I don't believe I shall ever
                  make you half so happy as you deserve to be," and she gaily ran out of the room to conceal the blushes her own
                  remarks had called to her face.
               A very few moments elapsed before she returned hatted and shawled, and taking his
                  arm, they started for the doctor's house, for the purpose of communicating to Dora
                  the important information which they had just decided it was proper she should
                  know.
            
            
               Chapter XXXI.
               The Revelation.
               OF course Dora was delighted to see Miss Arden, and after the regular ceremony of
                  kissing and embracing had been gone through with, the doctor said very
                  composedlyâ€”"Come, now, suppose we proceed to business."
               Dora's eyes opened very wide at these words, but as the doctor was often in the
                  habit of quizzing and teasing her, the emotions which his words had excited passed
                  quickly away, and she said, with a smile and a very demure courtesyâ€”"Proceed,
                  doctor."
               "Ahem!" said the doctor, very emphatically, and he thought to himself, "perhaps
                  you won't be so cool about it, before I have done."
               "Well, then, Dora, as you are about to become the niece of Miss Arden that is,
                  Mrs. Thornton that is so soon to be, I have thought it advisable that you should know something of her earlier
                  history, for she has a history."
               Dora looked surprised, but said nothing, and the doctor continuedâ€”
               "She has a history, Dora, and one as full of romance as your own. In the first
                  place, my dear, I am going to be very brief. Miss Arden has been married, although
                  you and I know her as Miss Arden. I know the circumstances of her marriage. It was
                  unfortunate in many respects."
               "You know, doctor!"exclaimed Dora with an air of surprise.
               "Yes; I knowâ€”and now is the proper time to tell you that I have known Miss Arden
                  for twenty years. We are very old friendsâ€”are we not, Ellen?" and he turned to
                  Miss Arden.
               That lady, however, could not reply. She was thinking of the past and presentâ€”for
                  the doctor's words at Mr. Chapman's had set her thoughts going, and she could not
                  stop their current. She, therefore, only nodded an affirmative reply to his
                  question.
               "She had a daughter who was born in this city," and Dora, at these words, sprang
                  from her chair, exclaiming, almost unconsciously, she was so excited, "Oh, where
                  is she? How I will love her!"
               "One moment, my dear; be calm;" and Dora reseated herself, though as to being
                  calm, that was out of the question.
               "She had a daughter, but owing to circumstances over which she had no control, she
                  has never seen that child since she was five weeks old.
               "There, Ellen, don't weep. It must be told," he said, turning to Miss Arden, whose
                  tears and sobs had broken out afresh at this recital. "There is no use in crying.
                  Well," and he resumed his narrative, turning to Dora, "she has made every effort
                  to discover that child She has spent money freely, and has done all that a mother
                  could do."
               "And has she never heard of her?" queried Dora, turning to Miss Arden, with
                  streaming eyes and pitying looks.
               "Never. But I have, Dora. I have reason to remember that child," and he looked at
                  Miss Arden, but she did not notice him, for her face was buried in her
                  handkerchief. "A few days since I discovered her by a mere accident. The child had
                  peculiar marks on her person, which I noted in my diary at the time of her birth;
                  for I, Dora, was present, professionally, when she was born."
               "Oh, why don't you bring her here, doctor?" exclaimed Dora; "how I would love
                  her!"
               
               "I mean to do so, Dora, very soon," he said, with a very meaning expression. "That
                  child has grown up to be a beautiful, accomplished, and lovely woman. Every one
                  who knows her, loves her."
               "How happy she will be!" murmured Dora, in very low tones, but they reached the
                  doctor's ears. "Oh, when will you bring her, doctor?"
               "I shall not have to go very far for her," replied the doctor, nerving himself for
                  the last effortâ€”
               "Doraâ€”Ellenâ€”as the Lord is my judge, you are mother and daughter."
               Doctor Thornton had expected, and was prepared for a scene, but he was
                  disappointed for the moment. The announcement had been so sudden, that neither of
                  those most directly interested could realize it, and they sat gazing at each
                  other, mute and motionless.
               Doctor Thornton turned from one to the other in amazement, and, for a moment, he
                  expected that he would be called on professionally. But he was happily
                  disappointed; for, after gazing at each other for a few moments, Dora and Miss
                  Arden sprang forward with a wild cry of ecstatic joy, and throwing themselves into
                  each other's arms, gave way to tears and sobs; but they were tears of the most
                  exquisite happiness.
               "Well," said the worthy doctor, when he had allowed, as he thought, sufficient
                  time for the expression of their new happiness, "suppose you say a word to me,
                  now," and he wiped from his eyes the tears which the scene had called there.
               "Dearâ€”dear doctor," said Miss Arden, releasing Dora from her embrace, but still
                  clasping her waist with one arm, and approaching him as he sat in apparent
                  composure on the sofa, "how can I ever thank you enough? How can I ever prove my
                  boundless gratitude?"
               "I am not quite sure that I deserve all of your thanks, nor all of your
                  gratitude," he said, rising; "now, sit down, and try to be quiet for a moment, if
                  you can," and drawing Miss Arden to one end of the sofa, he attempted to place
                  Dora on the other, intending to take a seat between them; but before he could seat
                  himself, Dora had moved close to her mother, Miss Arden no longer, and with her
                  head nestled on her bosom, looked at him with a face wearing a smile of such
                  ineffable happiness, he had not the heart to find fault, but with a very emphatic
                  "umph!" he seated himself by the side of Dora.
               "Go on, doctorâ€”we are quite ready now," said Miss Arden, gently smoothing the
                  glossy hair of her new-found daughter, no longer the charity girl, the nobody's child. "Go onâ€”we are quite
                  ready for anything you may have to say."
               "What was I saying?" queried the doctor, with an air of abstraction, which brought
                  a smile to the face of his future wife.
               "Something about not deserving thanks, or some such nonsense."
               "Oh! ah! yesâ€”I remember. The fact is, Arthur is entitled to half the credit of
                  this discovery."
               "Arthur?" queried Dora, half rising from her mother's armsâ€”"Arthur?"
               "Yes, Arthurâ€”is that so wonderful? But no thanks to his professional skill. You
                  remember taking a ride a few days since, Miss Barton?" he said, "or rather,
                  Miss"â€”â€”
               "No, doctor, not now," interrupted Miss Arden, "that must come from me alone."
               "Then, Dora dear, the accident which befell you on the occasion of that ride, led
                  to the discovery which has just been announced. It has always been my practice,
                  ever since I entered upon my profession, to keep a diary, in which I enter
                  anything of interest. When you were born, for I was present then, I noticed two
                  marks, which attracted my especial attention, and in addition to the entry of your
                  birth in my diary, I noted those marks. When you exhibited your arm to me, on the
                  occasion of your accident, I remarked them. They were so peculiar, I knew I could
                  not be mistaken, and, to make assurance doubly sure, I consulted my diary. So, you
                  may thank Arthur and his break-neck ride, and not myself."
               "God works in a mysterious way," said Miss Arden, for such we must continue to
                  call her, "and He has blessed me beyond my fondest hopes," and she clasped Dora
                  again to her heart, and the happy girl nestled there, as if it had been her
                  resting-place from infancy.
               "How very, very strange!" murmured Dora, raising her eyes to her mother's
                  face.
               "Nothing is strange to me, now, darling," replied the happy mother; "Doctor
                  Thornton has"â€”â€”
               "Thereâ€”that will do, if you please," interrupted the doctor, whose eyes were
                  filled with tears, which he tried to conceal. "Never mind the doctor, now. His
                  time has yet to come. But, Dora," and wiping his eyes, the doctor continued, "I
                  have a secret to confide to you. Can you keep it until to-morrow? After that, you
                  know, I shall have no control over you," and he looked significantly at Miss
                  Arden.
               "I will try, doctor," she said, with a blush, for she anticipated something concerning her
                  approaching nuptials.
               "On second thoughts, I believe I had better keep it to myself. Dora, my
                  darlingâ€”Ellen, my chosen one, I leave you together. God in his goodness has made
                  me the instrument of bringing together those who never should have been separated.
                  Thank Him only, for He works in his own mysterious way. Ellen, have I kept my
                  word?" and he turned to Miss Arden, with an appealing look.
               "Doctor Thornton, you are the best and noblest of men," she said, extending her
                  hand to him. "You have no thought of yourself, and I owe so much to you, I shall
                  have no thought beyond you."
               "Never mind that, now, Ellen. To-morrow, you know, is to be a very eventful day
                  with some persons," and he looked mischievously at her; "I know you have your
                  dressmaker, and your"â€”â€”
               "Thereâ€”that will do," said Miss Arden, with a blush and a bright smile; "I can
                  find plenty of time for those things."
               "I suppose, as you and Dora have not seen each other for so long a time, you have
                  a great deal to talk about, so I will leave you. In fact, I must. Now you can tell
                  her all you choose, and I will make it my business to tell Master Randolph. But,
                  Dora, don't forget that I have a secret to communicate to you, and as I do not
                  expect it to be sacredly kept, I shall not exact any promise from you. So,
                  good-day, ladiesâ€”we shall meet again very soon, I trust."
               "Doctor Thornton," exclaimed Miss Arden, rising, but not loosing her clasp on
                  Dora, "how can I ever thank you?"
               "Really, I don't know," be said, with an air of apparent musing. "Let me
                  see"â€”â€”
               "Let me thank him for you, dear mother," said Dora, and as she spoke, she threw
                  her arms around the doctor's neck, and covered his face with kisses, exclaiming,
                  between each salute, "dearâ€”dearâ€”good friend!"
               "Young lady, be pleased to remember that I am engaged to be married to Miss
                  Arden," said the doctor, trying to smile, though his eyes were filled with tears,
                  "and she may not like this peculiar method of manifesting your happiness."
               "Oh, Doctor Thornton!" exclaimed Miss Arden, and she, too, flung her arms about
                  his neck, and showered kisses upon him, while tears of happiness were streaming
                  from her eyes.
               "Thereâ€”that will do, good people," said the doctor, struggling to free himself; "I
                  have business to attend toâ€”my patients"â€”but he could say no more. His own sympathizing heart was too full for
                  wordsâ€”least of all, words of triflingâ€”and with a warm salute to those whom he had
                  made so happy, he took his leave, and mother and daughter were left alone.
            
            
               Chapter XXXII.
               Drawing to an End.
               THE morning of the eventful day which was to change the destinies for life, of
                  Miss Arden and Dora Barton arrived, and with the aid of a minister of God, they
                  became the happy wives of happy husbands.
               In compliance with Dora's urgent request, and from respect to her feelings, the
                  ceremony was conducted with as much privacy as possible, there being none present,
                  save the most intimate friends of the families. Mr. Lander and his family were
                  there, of course, and the good-hearted lawyer rubbed his hands, and chuckled with
                  glee, as he thought of the pleasant surprise which he knew Dora would receive,
                  when she learned as much as he knew.
               Mr. and Mrs. Pollard, with all their family, were there; Edward was there, and
                  Nellie was there, and of all in the
                  room, these last seemed to take most to heart the loss of Dora, for they
                  considered her marriage a loss to them.
               As for Edward, when the words were pronounced, which converted Dora Barton into
                  Mrs. Randolph, he turned away with tears and sobs which he could no longer
                  repress. But his emotions were joyful, for he had learned to love Doraâ€”so learned
                  to appreciate her worth and virtues, it really seemed to him as if in her
                  happiness he found an addition to his own.
               But Nellie absolutely refused to be comforted. The idea of losing Dora was more
                  than she could sustain, and she was only restored to comparative peace and quiet,
                  by the assurance from Dora, and the promise exacted from her mother, that she
                  should spend as much time with her as she chose.
               "Come, good people," said Dr. Thornton, "when you have done kissing our wives, the
                  carriages are waiting; we will adjourn to our house," and he turned
                  with a significant look to his new bride. "I have something to communicate which I
                  prefer to leave unsaid until we reach our own home," and he turned with a meaning
                  glance to Mr. Lander, who stood there smiling and laughing, and apparently almost
                  as happy as the doctor himself.
               The parties entered the carriages which were in waiting, and, in a few moments,
                  were conveyed to the residence of the happy doctor.
               "My dear," said Doctor Thornton, saluting his wife, as he led her into his
                  magnificently furnished parlors, "I welcome you to our home. Dora,
                  darling, you have always been welcome. I need not say more to you, now.
               "Good friends," said the new-made bridegroom, "I want you to listen a moment or
                  two. I am not accustomed to make speeches, but I have one to make now, and you
                  must pardon all my imperfections. Mrs. Randolph," he said, turning to Dora, who
                  stood by her husband's side.
               "Doctor!" she said, turning to him with an expression of astonishment.
               "Yesâ€”Mrs. Randolph. You shall be Dora forever hereafter; now, you must be Mrs.
                  Randolph; and be pleased to listen to me, and do not interrupt me.
               "You all know, my friends," he continued, addressing the wondering friends who
                  stood about, "that Mr. Barton died without having executed his will, and that in
                  consequence, his sister, Mrs. Edson,
                  inherited his entire property. You do not know, perhaps, that there had been a
                  will previously executed, nor did I know it until Providence disclosed it to me in
                  a mysterious way.
               "It was my good fortune to discover that will. Arthur Randolph, it is your good
                  fortune that I discovered it; Mrs. Randolph, it is your good fortune, also, that I
                  discovered it; for, with the exception of two trifling legacies, it makes you sole
                  heiress of Mr. Barton's fortune, and me your guardian. Arthur, from the moment you
                  saluted her as your wife, my duties as guardian ceased; and I transfer to your
                  care the property which, of right, belonged to Dora."
               Mrs. Thornton (we shall find it hard to call her Mrs. Thornton, after knowing her
                  so long as Miss Arden) of course knew this before, as the reader is well aware,
                  for the doctor had communicated it to her, under the injunction of secrecy. Mr.
                  Lander, who had also known it, had religiously kept the secret, even from his wife
                  and children, and the surprise of all but those to whom the secret had been
                  intrusted, was not greater than their joy, in being able to congratulate Dora upon
                  this accession to her rights.
               As for Dora, she had no voice for words. Her heart was too full, and she could
                  only give vent to her emotions by throwing herself upon her husband's neck, and
                  sobbing with very excess of joy. "Oh, Arthur," she murmured, "I am so happy; it
                  was so noble, so generous in you to wed me when you thought I was poor and
                  friendless."
               "Never friendless, Dora," interrupted Mrs. Thornton, "never friendless! Never
                  friendless, my darling, from the moment I laid my eyes upon you."
               "How shall I ever thank you, Doctor Thornton?" said Dora, extending her hand to
                  him, while her eyes were suffused with tears, "how shall I ever thank you?"
               "By being a good wife to my graceless young nephew, and by loving me. Now, my
                  friends, you have the great secret. I have made my speech, and I will thank you
                  for your applause."
               The applause came, but it was of a character entirely different from that which
                  the doctor anticipated, for it was all given to Dora, in the shape of kisses,
                  embraces, and congratulations, which she received more as a tribute to the
                  doctor's kindness than to her own worth.
               "Now, then, my friends," said the doctor, "as this matter is all arranged, we will
                  adjourn to the dining-room, and drink
                  the health of our new wives, and the new-made heiress."
               Of course that was a pleasant gathering. Edward forgot his griefs, Nellie forgot
                  hers, and perhaps no happier party was ever assembled within the walls of any
                  house in the city, than was gathered in that room on that occasion.
               "Dear doctor," said Dora, after their friends had left, "my good, kind friend, why
                  did you not tell me of this before? It would have made me so happy! Oh, if
                     he were only here!" and tears rose to her eyes, as she thought of
                  the kind friend and benefactor, now no more, whose generosity had contributed so
                  much to her happiness.
               "Because, my dear, I thought it best to keep it from you until after you were
                  married. I made it known to Arthur only yesterday; and it was solely upon his
                  assurance that he would marry you, whether I liked it or not," and he turned with
                  an arch look upon Arthur, "that I communicated it to him. He, it appears, did not
                  care much whether you were rich or poor. But when I told him that you were rich,
                  what do you suppose he said?"
               "I am sure, I cannot imagine," said Dora, turning with a look of affection to her
                  husband, on whose arm she was leaning.
               "He only said, 'God bless her. I am glad justice has been done to her at
                  last.'"
               "I wonder if Clara is as happy as I am?" said Dora, turning to Mrs. Thornton.
               "No, my dear; she can never be happy with her disposition," was the mother's
                  response. "I pity her from my heart; not because she is poorer than you were
                  before, but because she does not know how to submit to circumstances."
               "By the way, Arthur," said Doctor Thornton, turning to his nephew, "I have a
                  secret which I have not communicated even to you. My wife knows it; your wife
                  knows it; and I am almost afraid to trust them longer with it; so, I think I will
                  make it known now to you. Miss Dora cannot keep it long from you, I am sure. I beg
                  your pardon, Mrs. Randolph," and the doctor looked archly at her.
               "You must know, Arthur, that my wife that is now," and he turned with a look of
                  fondness to his blooming bride, "was married many years ago and had a daughter.
                  Circumstances rendered it necessary that her marriage should be kept profoundly
                  secret. That daughter was lost in early infancy. Dora will explain that to you
                  some other time. That daughter has been recently found. I know all the circumstances. Arthur, I will confide now
                  my great secret to you, and tell you, that her daughter is now your wife."
               "Good God! Uncle, what do you mean!" exclaimed Arthur, turning to Dora with a look
                  of amazement, and from her to his uncle.
               "I mean just what I say, my dear boy. Dora Barton that was, Dora Randolph that is,
                  is my wife's daughter, and my daughter now. So, I will thank you to remember that,
                  and treat her well, now she is your wife," and the doctor tried to laugh, but the
                  subject was too serious, and tears rose to his eyes as the remembrance of the
                  nineteen years which had passed, since he first saw Dora's mother, crossed his
                  mind.
               "That is so," said Mrs. Thornton, to whom Arthur had turned with an appealing
                  look. "Doctor Thornton speaks solemn, but happy truth; she is my
                  darlingâ€”my heart's treasureâ€”my own daughter. My dear, good husbandâ€”I suppose I
                  must learn to call him husband now," she said, turning to the doctor with a look
                  in which smiles and tears were strangely blended, "made me happy only yesterday by
                  communicating this fact to me. My heart sprung to Dora at our first interview,
                  from some cause for which I could not then account; but it is all accounted for
                  now. Is it not, darling?" and turning to Dora their eyes met, and, unable to
                  resist the impulse, Dora sprang from her husband's side, and threw herself into
                  her mother's arms.
               "Well, Uncle John, really you deal in mysteries," said Arthur, wiping his eyes,
                  into which tears had come unbidden, "I did not think that anything could add to my
                  felicity, after I saluted Dora as my wife, but I must say that I have derived
                  added happiness from what you have just told me. I do not know, though," he said,
                  turning to Mrs. Thornton, "that I shall yield any of my rights to you. If you are
                  her mother, she is my wife."
               "But I have the first claim upon her," said Mrs. Thornton, extending her hand to
                  him. "Now, Arthur Randolph, make one promise to me, as her mother, and I promise
                  never to exact another."
               "I do not know that I dare to," said Arthur, turning to Dora with a look of
                  deepest love.
               "Oh yes, you may, with perfect safety; I know it will make Dora happyâ€”it will make
                  me happyâ€”it will make us all happy."
               "Well, I don't think you are an unreasonable lady, and although it is not very
                  professional to make an unconditional promise, I will do so."
               "Promise, then, never to take Dora from me."
               
               "You need never have asked that, Mrs. Thornton," said Arthur, "I would not
                  interfere so much with her happiness, as to think of separating you; more
                  especially now that I know what claims you have upon her."
            
            
               Chapter XXXIII.
               Conclusion.
               AND Dora was no longer Nobody's Child. She was happy as her heart
                  could desireâ€”happy in the boundless love of her new-found motherâ€”happy in the warm
                  affection of Doctor Thornton, and happy, of course, as the wife of him who had
                  proved so truly his love for her.
               It is not necessary to follow her fortunes further. Surrounded by all the
                  appliances of comfort and luxury, she never forgot her own sad past, and no appeal
                  from poverty was ever unheeded by her. Her friends, those who know her, love,
                  honor, and esteem her for her worth and virtues. Her husband idolizes her, and
                  next to her, a little miniature likeness of his wife, which has been christened
                  Dora, and which is in a very fair way of being spoiled.
               Mr. Harding, with his wife and Clara, left the city for the West, soon after Dora's marriage,
                  having previously sold out the annuities bequeathed to them by Mr. Barton for
                  ready money, Doctor Thornton becoming the purchaser.
               Clara sought an interview with Dora before their departure, but her husband and
                  Doctor Thornton insisted that Dora should not grant it. The conduct of Clara had
                  been unjustifiable, and while they were quite willing that Dora should forgive,
                  they would not allow her to meet one who had so wronged and abused her.
               Mr. Harding will undoubtedly make a mark in the new sphere to which he has been
                  called. He will certainly make a noise, and as for Clara, she is in a
                  fair way of remaining Clara Edson for the rest of her days. The reverse of fortune
                  has so soured her temper, and so embittered her against all mankind, she would
                  scarcely accept a suitor if Providence should throw one in her way. At least, she
                  says she intends to remain an old maid, and there are no present indications that
                  she is willing to change her mind.
               Edward Arthur, Mr. Pollard's protÃ©gÃ©, has been long in the situation provided for
                  him by his generous benefactor, and has serious thoughts of matrimony, but he has
                  been waiting to find one as near like Dora as possible. He has not succeeded thus
                  far, but time and perseverance will conquer all obstacles, and he may yet attain
                  his end.
               Nellie has grown into a tall, handsome girl, but time has not changed her love for
                  Dora. They are close and constant friends, and the promise which was exacted from
                  her mother on Dora's wedding day, has been faithfully adhered to, for she passes
                  fully one half her time as Dora's guest and friend.
            
            FINIS.
