            To THE HON. JACOB A. WESTERVELT, LATE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK, This Volume is Dedicated, AS A FEEBLE TESTIMONIAL OF THE HIGH ESTEEM AND PROFOUND REGARD OF HIS GRATEFUL AND ATTACHED FRIEND,

            PREFACE.
            THE Publisher has encouraged me to believe, that although six years have elapsed since I appeared before the public as a candidate for its favor, I have not been forgotten, and hoping that his judgment may prove correct, I venture to send this volume forth, trusting it may be received with the kindness which was accorded to my previous efforts.
            The story here presented, was narrated to me many years ago by a physician well known in this city, and if I were at liberty to mention his name, no doubts would be entertained as to its entire truthfulness.
            I "tell the tale as 'twas told to me," and if it shall serve to amuse or interest, the object for which it was written will have been attained.
            I have used the "first person" throughout, as most appropriate to the narrative, and as best enabling me to preserve the unity and correctness of a tale, relating, as it professes, occurences which transpired in this city, and which will be recognised as strictly true by many, who were at the time familiar with them.

            THE SECOND MARRIAGE.
            
               CHAPTER I.
               THE ORPHAN.
               IN a neatly but poorly furnished room, on the second floor of a two-story house, in the upper part of Forsyth street, a woman was lying in the last stages of consumption. Her features had wasted away until there was scarce a semblance of humanity left upon them. Her glassy eyes were deep-set in their bony sockets, but they gleamed occasionally with a fitful fire, partly caused by pain, the attendant of approaching dissolution, partly by some high excitement over which she has been unable to maintain entire control.
               Kneeling by her bedside, her face buried in the clothes which were moist with her tears, her fair hair hanging in dishevelled masses about her neck and shoulders, her hands tightly clasped, and sobbing as if her heart would burst with the deep grief which must find some vent, was Julia Seaton, her only daughter, soon to become an orphan.
               She was a poor girl, the only daughter of a poor mother—the cherished child of a Christian parent, who had never in a life of eighteen years caused that parent a moment of pain, or an instant of unhappiness.
               "Julia, dear," said the mother, in broken accents, for her strength was rapidly passing away, and her breath was failing, "Julia, dear, trust in God, and be virtuous. Remember what your mother has striven to instill into your young heart—you will soon have no protector or friend but Him; trust in Him, and lead a virtuous life; your reward will be certain."
               "God bless you, my daughter," she continued, slowly and with difficulty, each word costing, evidently, a terrible effort from the dying woman, and laying her thin attenuated hand upon the fair head of the weeping sorrowing girl.
               They were her last words, and with this prayer upon her lips, the mother's spirit took its flight from earth for ever, and Julia Seaton was an orphan.
               Mrs. Seaton was the widow of a ship carpenter, who after a life of toil and struggles in the vain endeavor to place his family above want, had met with a sudden and accidental death, leaving them entirely unprovided for. He had managed to keep them together in tolerable comfort during his life-time, and had educated his children, George and Julia, with a view to their future usefulness to themselves and others so far as his means would allow.
               George had early imbibed a passion for the sea, which his father thought it best to indulge, and he was accordingly apprenticed to a well known and estimable captain sailing out of New-York, who promised the father that if there was any thing in the boy, he would bring it out and make a man of him.
               At the time of his father's death, George was nearly twenty years of age, a ruddy, hearty young giant, who had made three voyages around "the Horn," and whose passion for the sea was in no wise abated by the hard rubs and harder fare he had endured during his brief experience as a foremast-hand.
               A few weeks after that sad event, he sailed on his fourth voyage as second mate, and was absent at the time his remaining parent died, so that Julia was, in the most terrible meaning of the word, alone. She had no friends—the poor have few—and her prospects were dismal indeed.
               
               But let me not anticipate.
               After Mr. Seaton's death, the mother and daughter had managed to eke out a subsistence by their needles until Mrs. Seaton fell sick, and then the burthen fell upon the devoted and self-sacrificing daughter, who toiled wearily but cheerfully, until the lamp of that life which was dearer than her own, went out and left her in a dreary, cheerless, hopeless darkness. Then her spirits sank within her, and despair took the place of hope.
               The last words Mrs. Seaton uttered showed that she had been a Christian woman, and must pre-suppose that her daughter Julia was brought up as a Christian mother would wish to bring up a child.
               She had been not a canting, but a trusting Christian—not a loud-mouthed professor, but a firm believer in those truths which have moved the world for nearly two thousand years; and she felt, that without belonging to any sect or acknowledging any creed, she had placed her trust on a sure foundation.
               But Julia Seaton was now an orphan.
               She could scarcely—she would not bring herself to realize that the lips which had never been opened to her save to utter words of love and kindness, were closed for ever. She would not believe that the eyes which had only beamed upon her in love, were sealed in death—that the hand which had so often been laid upon her head, invoking the blessings and protection of Heaven, would never again be raised in life.
               But the reality came to her with all its terrible truth.
               "Come, Miss Julia, there's no use in grieving. You know we've all got to die once, and your mother was fitter to die than any of us—so don't take on so any more"—and the speaker essayed with gentle violence to raise Julia from the bed where she had thrown herself beside the lifeless form of her mother.
               There was, indeed, no use in grieving; but the overcharged heart of the bereaved girl refused to acknowledge it.
               "Come, Julia—come into our room, and we'll see to every thing here. You can't do any good, and it only worries you."
               "Oh, I can't leave my mother—I can't leave her."
               "Yes, but Julia, she has left you, and you can't go with her; so come with us;" and with kind but gentle firmness the warm-hearted speaker dragged the weeping daughter from the room, and left her to tears and solitude, while herself and two other inmates mates of the house performed the last offices for the inanimate form of the widow.
               The funeral took place the next day. The mourners were few but sincere; for Helen Seaton was a woman whose worth could not fail to be appreciated where known.
               And Julia was now alone in the world—a world of trials, sorrows, and temptations—a world of struggles and conflicts.
               I was a witness to the scene which I have just narrated, and have told it as I saw it. It was one of those episodes in the life of a physician almost of daily occurrence, and which justify the members of that profession above all others in asserting that one half of the world does not know how the other half lives.
               I found I could do nothing more either in the way of aid or sympathy, and took my leave with a sorrowful heart; for I could not but feel deeply interested in the unhappy girl thus thrown upon the cold charity of a heartless and selfish world.
               Such scenes were, however, of frequent occurrence with me; for being comparatively a young physician, I had, of course, numerous poor calls, as they are callously termed by some; and at this hour, with the sun of prosperity shedding his benign beams upon me, I can say with pride and pleasure, that no one ever went unheeded by me, and that I never hesitated to inquire whether I should be remunerated or not.
               As I left the house, saddened by the scene which I had just witnessed, and in which I had participated, and half lost in thoughts of the orphaned girl whom I had just left to her sorrows and her solitude, I bethought me of another patient whom I had not seen for two days, and whose case, though desperate, did not require unremitted attention.
               Buttoning up my coat tightly, for it was a raw March day, I started to pay my visit, which I felt had been long delayed, and had not proceeded half-a-dozen blocks, when a sharp cutting rain set in; to avoid which, I beckoned to an omnibus, and I was soon safely, though temporarily housed from the storm which I saw was brewing.
               I was the twelfth passenger, and right glad was I to escape the pelting of the storm, which increased with such fearful rapidity, that before the stage had proceeded half-a-dozen blocks the rain was coming down in torrents, and the wind was howling with angry violence.
               Squeezing myself into the smallest possible compass, and settling back into my seat, I buried my face deep in the collar of my coat and was soon engrossed in thoughts of the poor girl I had just left, and wondering what would be her future lot.
               The sudden stoppage of the omnibus aroused me, and hastily looking up to see who was so unfortunate as to be compelled to get out in such a pitiless storm, I perceived the face of a young female who was standing on the step and peering anxiously into the stage.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               THE OMNIBUS.
               THE stage was stopped, and the young woman stood upon the steps anxiously looking in, and seemingly saying by her very looks, "I hope there is room."
               "No room, driver, all full," was shouted in a stentorian voice by a large, gruff-looking man, wrapped to the eyes in a heavy cloak, and who was seated in the farthest corner of the stage. "All full—twelve inside now—go on."
               "Yes, there is room," I said, as I saw the female in the act of getting from the step, with a look of disappointment which spoke volumes to my feelings.
               "There is room here, madam;" and springing from my seat, which was nearest the door, I pushed it open, and beckoned her to come in, at the same time extending my hand to aid her.
               "Never mind, don't make any excuses," I added, hastily, seeing that she was about to withdraw; and as I spoke I cast a look at the voice in the farthest corner, which ought to have annihilated its owner—at least I thought so then—but I have grown wiser since, and am very glad now that it did not.
               "Here, madam, take my place," and I fairly pulled her in—for she half resisted my attempts—seating her in the place which I had first vacated, evidently to the annoyance of my neighbor, who cast contemptuous looks at both of us, and drew himself up into the smallest compass, as if fearing contamination by contact with such a forlorn being.
               Seating herself, or rather crowding herself on the edge of the seat, for no one offered to make any room for her, except the one I have mentioned, she said to me, with an air and tone far above her appearance, "I thank you very kindly, sir, and am really sorry to incommode you."
               "Not at all, not at all, I can do very well standing up;" and to prove it, I seized hold of the door to prevent my falling into her lap, an occurrence which had nearly happened by a sudden jerk of the stage.
               There was something in the air and manner of the young woman so far superior to her personal appearance, I could not but notice the contrast; and as I was compelled to stand opposite to her, I had a good opportunity of examining her without the danger of being deemed impertinent.
               She was young—perhaps she had seen two or three and twenty summers—and the passing glimpses which I had of her face, showed expressive and regular features—not that she had any claims to beauty, but there was an indescribable air about her which excited interest, and commanded respect.
               There was an expression of sadness, too, which could not be mistaken, and which poverty alone could not and does not fix, and that interested me—and she was evidently in feeble health—that my professional experience enabled me to detect—and that too interested me.
               I have said that it was a cold, raw, wet, disagreeable March day, and I was well protected against the inclemency of the weather, while my vis-a-vis was clad in a coarse mourning dress of calico, and her only protection from the cold and storm was a small, faded, black worsted shawl, which she had drawn closely around her, and which I saw from an occasional shiver which passed through her, was insufficient to keep either the warmth within, or the cold from without.
               I found ample occupation in studying the interesting woman whom I had been enabled to oblige, to keep my mind busy, and was lost in thoughts of her, for I am somewhat addicted to giving play to my imagination, when she arose and pulled the strap for the driver to stop.
               It was at the corner of Bleecker and Christopher streets; and as she handed her fare to me to pass to the driver, with a renewed expression of thanks for my kindness, I was determined that I would not so soon lose sight of one who had excited such an interest in me, and who, as I, with the impulsiveness of my nature, had already made up my mind, was evidently fitted for some better sphere than that of the poverty and suffering which were evidently allotted to her.
               "I should not have been so anxious to reach home," she said, with a sad smile, as she held her hand waiting for the change, "but that I have a sick child, and he needs my constant care. Your kindness is therefore the more grateful."
               In an instant my hand was in my pocket, my own fare passed up, and jumping out, I assisted her to alight, amid the ill-concealed smiles and sneers of the eleven who were left inside.
               As we reached the side-walk, she turned towards me as if to bid me adieu; but I prevented that by accosting her—"Madam, you must excuse a stranger ger, but I heard you say you had a sick child at home; possibly I may render some assistance."
               For a few moments she hesitated how to reply. The rich color came to her cheek, her brow, her temples, and gazing at me for an instant with her large calm blue eyes, she seemed in that look to have made up her mind, and fortunately I was neither young nor handsome enough to be the object of suspicion.
               "You are right, sir; I have a sick child at home," she said, with perfect self-possession, and still fascinating me with those large deep blue eyes, which seemed to read my very soul; "but how can that interest you, a stranger?"
               "Pardon me, madam, but really I cannot say why or how I have ventured to accost you at all, and yet something has seemed to say to me, though I never saw you before, that you believe I am prompted by no improper motive;" and I gave her look for look, for I was, and felt honest: "friendly aid, though coming from an utter stranger, may perhaps not be unacceptable."
               "You are correct, sir; I do believe you honest, and God knows I need friendly aid; will you venture into the abode of sickness and poverty?"
               "My profession carries me there almost every hour in the day."
               
               "Are you a physician?" she inquired, her countenance beaming with an expression in which hope, joy, and fear were strangely blended, and her eyes moistened with tears as she possibly thought of the little one at home.
               "I am, madam, and entirely at your service."
               "Oh, sir, I am so thankful. My poor Clarence has been so sick, and I have not dared to send for a physician yet."
               "And why not, pray," I said, anxious to put her at her ease, and draw her from the possible idea that I had any improper motive in my conduct.
               "How could I, sir, when I have not the means to——"
               "Stop, madam; you have wronged the profession by your implied suspicion; I know of no one who would hesitate for an instant to respond to the cry of sickness, though it did come from the abode of poverty, vice, or wretchedness; I am sorry you have been so unjust."
               "Pardon me, sir, I meant for the best. But I am so thankful that you are a physician; you have no idea how great a relief it is to me. But here we are; enter, if you please, sir, and behold poverty and wretchedness."
               "It is because I saw poverty and feared wretchedness edness that I ventured to address you. But come, we must not talk so formally; what is the matter with your boy?"
               "You shall see, sir. Come in;" and she led me into the back room on the second floor of a two-story house near Greenwich Lane, as it was then called, though now dignified by the high-sounding appellation of "Avenue."
               A small cast-iron stove sufficed to keep the uncarpeted apartment in comfortable warmth, near which was seated a hard-featured, but honest, kind-looking woman, who arose as we entered. On a pillow, placed across two chairs, lay the sick child, the mother's treasure, a fine hearty-looking fellow, who had seen some eighteen or twenty months. Hastily throwing off her shawl, the anxious mother approached the sleeping boy, and in whispered tones said, "Has he been asleep ever since, Maggie?" and bending over his humble couch, she kissed his fair forehead gently.
               "Ever since, ma'am; I don't think he has stirred once't: I guess he ain't so very bad. But I must go, now; I've a monstrous ironing yet to do 'afore night."
               "God bless, you Maggie, I won't forget this kindness," said the young mother, as the tear started to her eyes; and as the honest Maggie left the room, she turned to me and said, "Here, sir, you can see sickness and poverty; God grant you may never realize them, for I am sure you have a good heart."
               "Come, come, never mind that, let me look at the child," I said, approaching the sleeper; and as I said so, he opened wide a pair of large blue eyes, which were fixed intently on me for an instant in wonder and surprise, and turning to his mother, his countenance lighted up as he stretched forth his chubby arms for her embrace.
               Taking the child's hand, I examined him carefully for a few moments, and looking at the mother who was watching my every movement with the most anxious solicitude, I said, "My dear madam, you are unnecessarily alarmed; this little fellow has nothing but a heavy cold; we will soon drive that away; there is no earthly cause for apprehension." The expression of gratitude and thankfulness which crossed the young mother's face as I spoke, was a rich reward for my poor services; and as I saw the tear of happiness steal unbidden to her eye, I thought I had never seen a woman for whom I could feel so deep an interest.
               "He only wants a little care, a few nice things, and all will soon be well; and," I added, seeing the expression which the words nice things had brought to her face, "I must take upon myself the charge of those. You must permit me to offer this," and I tendered some money, without which I knew nice things could not be procured, and of which there was every indication that she stood sadly in need.
               Her first motion was to stretch forth her hand instinctively to receive the proffered money. The next was to draw back, and coloring deeply, she said, "This, sir, to a stranger. How can I? how dare I?" and she cast a look upon her child, which seemed to say, "For him, I could do or dare any thing."
               "Pray, madam, if you believe me honorable or honest, make no excuses. I know you need it, and I do assure you I shall derive a thousand times more pleasure in being allowed to relieve your necessities, than you can in receiving it. Take it, madam—for your child's sake," I added, seeing that she still hesitated.
               Taking the money with a trembling hand, she glanced hastily at the amount, and sinking into a chair, with her child closely clasped to her heart, she gave way to a burst of tears, which I made no attempt to check, for in truth I felt very much like joining her, though without exactly knowing why.
               "Oh, sir, how can I be sufficiently thankful? But for this we should have been turned into the street this very day."
               "You cannot mean that? You surely cannot mean that any thing wearing the shape of humanity, could have put you and that sick child into the street in such weather, and for such a paltry sum as that?"
               "Indeed I do. But for this Heaven-sent aid, we must have been houseless and homeless, as we are friendless."
               I was too much incensed to make any reply to this remark, for much as I had heard and read of hard-hearted landlords, I did not think such a thing could be; so having nothing to say, I said nothing, but after musing a few moments, I pulled out my tablet, and writing a prescription, handed it to her, with the necessary directions. "And now, madam, by your leave, I will go, and return again to-morrow."
               "Not, sir, until I tell you that my visit down town to-day, when Providence sent you to my assistance, was to obtain the amount due me for work done for a store in Pine street, and which, if paid, would have—"
               "Deprived me of the pleasure of aiding you. Pray say no more—I understand it all. Take good care of the boy Ah, by the way, what did you say was his name?" I suddenly asked, intending thus indirectly to ascertain the name of my incognita.
               "Clarence Marvin, sir," she replied, comprehending in an instant my poorly-concealed manœuvre; and feeling that I had no right to intrude further, I handed my card to her, merely saying, that in case my services should be required before the next day, she would find me entirely at her service.
               She commenced pouring out renewed expressions of thankfulness and gratitude; but as I found my eyes were growing dim, I hurried off without giving any time to finish her sentence, not even daring to trust myself to a farewell look—and in a few minutes I was in my own office, with my feet on the mantel-piece, and a cigar in my mouth, pondering over the singular events of the day, and wondering what fruits they would bring forth.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER III.
               A NEW FRIEND.
               "YOU have kept those vests a long time, Miss Seaton," was the stern salutation of Mr. Edwards, the manufacturer from whom she received employment at the magnificent remuneration of eighteen cents a-piece for vests, "we can't allow this at all—it will never do."
               "My mother is dead, sir," was all Julia could say, as the hot scalding tears forced themselves to her eyes, and found their way down her checks.
               "Oh—ah—hum. Well, I'm very sorry," he said, carelessly glancing at her coarse black dress and veil, the only outward emblems of mourning which poverty permitted her to display, and he carelessly tossed over the garments she had brought, checked them in her little pass-book, threw out another bundle which he entered as carelessly, and turned away to resume a book he had been reading, without uttering another word or vouchsafing a look.
               "Please, sir," said Julia, timidly approaching the great man, "could you let me have the money now, I have to pay some expenses for the funeral."
               "It's against our rules, Miss Seaton, to pay out of the regular times," he replied, half angry that she should dare to disturb him by such an application, "it's entirely against our rules, and if we break them once——"
               "But, sir, I'll never ask again. I want it very much, Mr. Edwards. I must pay the expenses of my dear mother's funeral."
               "Well, I suppose you must have it. Mr. Farmer," he said, without rising, to his clerk who was near, "give this girl the amount due her on the book up to this date;" and he resumed his book, with a muttered growl at her importunity.
               Mr. Farmer, the gaily-dressed, highly-perfumed, and heartless clerk, arose lazily from his seat, and taking Julia's book without a word, added up the trifling amounts due to her, and going to a drawer in the desk, counted out the money she had so hardly earned, which he threw down before her, without condescending to give a look at the trembling, shrinking, suffering girl.
               Silently and with brimming eyes she took it up, placed it in her well-worn glove, and slowly left the store.
               
               Julia Seaton's trials had now commenced. She was indeed alone in the world. The kind-hearted neighbors who had helped to lay out and bury her mother, were as poor as herself, and as they could not afford to spend the time it would require for sympathy with the bereaved and lonely girl, she was thus left to solitude and her own sad thoughts.
               Julia lived in a small two-story house in Forsyth street, which as I have said, was occupied by several other families, whose poverty compelled them to be contented with the wretched apartments of the house. The occupant of the room next to her own was a young woman named Lee, who had often attracted the attention of Julia by the sadness of her manner, and the melancholy smile with which she received and returned her salutations whenever they occasionally met on the stairs.
               Helen Lee, was a seamstress also, who had occupied the back room some three or four months, and there was a something about her which, while it caused Julia to wish for her acquaintance, made her afraid—if that is a proper word—to seek it. She worked in her lonely room from morning 'till night. She never received any friends nor yet company of any kind, and, indeed, seemed to be alone in the world. Nor did she seek any society from the inmates of the house, returning courteously and sadly their salutations, yet ever refusing their invitations to be more sociable and friendly. No one in the house knew anything of her, and indeed all were too much occupied with their own cares and troubles to make many inquiries. No one knew where she came from, what were her antecedents, who were her friends—if she had any, nor, in fact, anything concerning her, except that she was a quiet industrious woman, and evidently very unhappy.
               She was a pale delicate creature, who might possibly have seen better days, for there was about her an air of partial refinement which even poverty could not entirely conceal; and although she had returned with sweet affability the various tenders of friendly intercourse which had been made to her by the inmates of the house, she had repelled their advances more by her manner than her words.
               Julia entered the house with a bundle of vests, and ascended to her solitary room; she met Helen who was in the act of closing the door of her own apartment. The sad, weary, and woe-begone appearance of Julia could not fail to attract the notice of Helen, who paused for an instant as if hesitating whether she should address her or not; and while she was thus considering, they had approached so near that to pass without absolute incivility was impossible.
               "I am very sorry to know of your misfortune," said Helen, with a kindly smile, "but I did not call in to see you, because——"
               "It was not necessary," said Julia interrupting her, and somewhat coldly; "I found very kind friends in the house, who did all that I could have asked of any one, and to whom I cannot be too grateful."
               "You are happy to have friends," said Helen, sadly, a shade crossing her features, "I hope you may always be so blessed;" and she was passing on, when Julia, scarce knowing what prompted the action, placed a hand upon her arm, and said, "We ought not to be such strangers. You appear to be alone—I am alone—alone in the whole world; my only true friend," and here tears almost choked her utterance, "has left me forever."
               "We will not be," said Helen impetuously, "we must not be—come in my room, come in," and she hurriedly replaced the key which she had withdrawn after locking the door of her humble apartment; "we must be friends, come in." And Julia, half-smiling at the sudden change in the words and manner of her neighbor, and more than half liking the generous impulses which gave them birth, suffered herself to be almost dragged into Helen's room, and before she knew what she was doing, had laid down her bundle, and was seated in a low wooden rocking-chair which Helen had dragged up for her.
               "We must be friends," said Helen, drawing a chair close to Julia, taking both her hands in her own, and looking affectionately in the wan face of the orphan—"we must be friends. God knows, I think we need them enough;" and from that moment their hearts were opened to each other, for Julia could not resist her open frankness.
               Julia passed an hour unconsciously in the company of her new-found friend. They talked of their wrongs and hardships, their trials and their sufferings—for they were both seamstresses, and the reader need hardly be told that they had enough of all, at least for sympathy.
               "But, Helen dear," (for they had already reached this point in their intimacy), "how came you to be here alone? you, so young, so handsome, so far above your position? As for me, these weeds tell my tale; and what they do not tell, you know, as you have been here so long."
               "It is a long, sad story, Julia. I won't tell it now, but it may serve you to know it hereafter, and at some other time I will make you acquainted with it. God preserve you, my dear Julia, from my trials and my sorrows. A parent's curse hangs heavy on my heart, and in the veriest sense of the word I am alone. Oh, I want a friend indeed; and if I had but one bosom in which I dared confide my sorrows, and from which I might look for sympathy"—and without concluding her sentence, she covered her face with her hands, and gave way to the tears which she could no longer repress. And thus was commenced an intimacy which begun in tears, ended in sunshine—born of sorrow, continued in joy—but it was darkness now for them both.
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               THE SECOND WIFE.
               MY practice, though large among the poor and needy, was not entirely confined to that class.
               It had been my good fortune to be called in attendance on patients among the better classes, and I had the better fortune to retain them.
               Among these was the family of one Mr. Evarts, a merchant of high standing, great wealth, and good social position. Besides having been regularly retained as his family physician, I was on terms of intimacy with the family, and passed many pleasant evenings there. The friendship of such a family was of vast importance to me in a professional point of view, and I cultivated it gladly for that reason, apart from the pleasure I derived from social intercourse with its members.
               I had been a regular visitor upon Mrs. Marvin's child nearly a month—indeed I don't know but I called often when my professional services were not required. I had seen it restored to perfect health, had received the tearful and grateful acknowledgments of the now happy mother, and had imbibed an increasing desire to know more of her history—for each interview only served to strengthen my first opinion, that she was out of her sphere, and that some secret sorrow was preying upon her—so that I found myself irresistibly drawn towards her.
               I could not, of course, upon an acquaintance so limited and so singularly formed, make any inquiries of her, but her manner towards me convinced me that she relied upon me as a friend, and I left it to time to unravel the mystery which hung over her—for mystery I was sure existed.
               On the evening after my last call upon her, finding nothing of special moment upon my hands, I determined to visit Mr. Evarts, and was welcomed by all with their usual warmth of friendly greeting.
               As Mr. Evarts and his family will play a prominent part in this narrative, a few words concerning them must be permitted.
               I have said he was a gentleman of wealth—high social standing, well esteemed as an honorable and successful merchant. He was about fifty years of age—a fine, healthy, hearty-looking gentleman, but there was about him a peculiar nervous irritability, for which I could not account.
               His pecuniary circumstances were excellent. His position was enviable as a merchant. His domestic relations, so far as could be judged from external appearances, were calculated to make any man happy, for he had a wife and daughter, of whom, with the same criterion, the world might be justified in calling him a happy man.
               And yet he was not happy, and it was made painfully evident to me at times, though he made great efforts to conceal it. There was, I was satisfied, some hidden cause for his occasional fits of gloom and despondency, varied only by high nervous irritation which annoyed me excessively, and I wished I could discover it, not with any hope or desire of alleviating them, but from the natural impulses of my heart, which made me wish every one to be happy.
               Mrs. Evarts was his perfect counterpart, and she was a study indeed—an enigma, which I sought in vain to solve. She was a large, elegantly-formed, really fine-looking woman for her years, (for she had passed the middle stage of life), but she was excessively vain—fond of admiration, which she almost courted, and proud even to haughtiness. Her manners were pleasing, her address polished, and there was that about her, which, barring her excessive vanity ity and foolish pride, would have made her a most attractive companion.
               It required very little discernment to discover that she was the mistress not only of the mansion, but of all that pertained to it, and I had learned enough in my contact with the world to pay my court to her accordingly, which might probably account for the constant graciousness of my reception.
               Mr. Evarts seemed to live in constant fear of her—not that she exhibited any arbitrary conduct in my presence, but he paid to her a marked deference, which my experience told me arose more from fear than from affection or acknowledged superiority.
               Miss Martha, or Mattie, as the family called her, (and by the way, my intimacy was so close that I too had reached Mattie,) was a pretty, blue-eyed, dark-haired, well-formed, and well-informed girl—decidedly attractive in her manner and appearance; generally cold in her expression until warmed with animation, when her conversational powers excelled those of almost any one I had ever met. Indeed, she possessed that rare faculty to such an eminent degree, that she could if she chose, invest the most trivial subject with the deepest interest, and possessing wonderful powers of description, her conversation was, when she chose to display herself, perfectly fascinating.
               Her deportment was generally calm, quiet, and self-possessed, and so far as I could judge, and I certainly had every opportunity to form what I deemed to be a correct opinion, she was of an even and amiable disposition.
               So much then for the family with whom I passed my first evening since my introduction to the reader.
               I was, as usual, graciously received. Mr. Evarts was engrossed in the evening papers, and left me to the ladies. To Mrs. Evarts I paid the most deferential attention, while Mattie played and sang at me, and for me, with condescending affability, and with evident satisfaction to herself, for as I was a sort of Cœlebs, rising in my profession, and moving in excellent society, I was a fair match even for the daughter of Mr. Evarts.
               I confess to passing a very pleasant evening; Mattie was unusually interesting, and I found myself more than once during the evening wondering what kind of a wife she would make for a physician.
               As the evening wore on, Mattie having wearied of playing and singing, the conversation took a general turn, in which all participated, for Mr. Evarts had finished his papers, and joined in with pleasant alacrity.
               It turned at length upon the profession I had chosen, and by mere chance I spoke of the numerous calls to which a physician has constantly to respond, and which appeal so strongly to the deepest feelings of the human heart—pity and sympathy.
               I spoke of some cases of pitiable suffering which had come under my own observation and care, and drew a true but strong picture of the misery, want, suffering and sickness, which it had been my lot to witness. I spoke of those whom I had seen sick and destitute, with no one near to comfort or console them, with no friendly hand to offer the most trifling assistance.
               "Oh Doctor!" exclaimed Mattie, her countenance beaming with a generous sympathy, which seemed to spring from the heart, "how I envy you the opportunities which your profession affords of alleviating the distresses of those unfortunate beings. It must indeed be a source of boundless gratification to know that you can give them at least the comfort of your occasional presence," and she gazed into my face with such an earnest expression of sympathy, it fairly brought the hot blood to my cheeks.
               "Indeed, it is a great pleasure, though not unmixed with pain, for I can only minister to their diseases, and their wants are sometimes harder to bear than the sickness. Why, within the past few days, I have met one—a young female—almost destitute tute—whose heart was racked with apprehensions for her only child—a lovely boy of some eighteen months, and who, but for my chance acquaintance with her circumstances, must have been thrust into the street by a hard-hearted landlord for the paltry rent of one miserable, cheerless apartment."
               "Poor creature," said Mr. Evarts, involuntarily putting his hand in his pocket, and in that simple act affording me, as I thought, a clearer insight into his true character than months of ordinary intercourse would have enabled me to reach.
               Mrs. Evarts, however, was not equally touched by my narrative, or if she was, she concealed her feelings very effectually. She glanced at her husband, however, with an expression of uneasiness for which I could not then account. He met her look, and seemed fairly to quail beneath it, for he essayed at once to change the conversation, but in this he was foiled by Mattie very innocently, who, seeming really interested, asked how I chanced to meet the person who had excited such a warm interest in me.
               Carried away by my feelings, I narrated briefly the omnibus ride—my visit to her house—the sick child, and drew a vivid picture of the miserable condition to which she was reduced, closing by a very emphatic declaration that I believed she was suffering ing wrongfully, through no fault of her own, and I expressed the hope that I might be enabled yet to serve and right her.
               "Poor creature," said Mattie, a tear trembling on her eyelid, which I must confess I wished to kiss away—"here, Doctor, give this to her as a token of sympathy from one of her own sex," and she drew from her purse a gold piece, which she placed in my hand.
               Mrs. Evarts looked reprovingly at her daughter, but her father rewarded her with a glance of approbation, and if she had taken the trouble to look in my face, she would have read there the admiration which I did not care to conceal.
               "Pray, Doctor," said Mrs. Evarts, with a cold, deferential air, which chilled me to the heart, "I should like to know who this paragon is, and where she may be found. I am connected with an association which has for its principal object the relief of cases such as you have described; and I am sure it will afford us pleasure to aid one who seems to have enlisted your sympathy so warmly. I fear—perhaps I ought not to say that—but possibly the natural kindness of your heart may have led you into an error, and has run away with your judgment. Give me her name and address, and, if she is really a worthy object, I assure you her distress shall be promptly alleviated."
               "Marvin—Cora Marvin," I exclaimed, impetuously—as if the very mention of that name must inevitably dispel all doubts as to her worth and virtues.
               These were very simple words; but before I had time to add to them, I discovered that I had sprung a mine unconsciously; and the explosion was actually terrific in its consequences.
               "Sir—Doctor—Sir!"—exclaimed Mr. Evarts, springing from his chair—his face crimsoned with excitement, and his frame trembling with indescribable emotion—"Do you dare to insult us in our own house? How dare you, Sir, mention that name in my presence?"
               "Doctor," said Jane, with a glance of haughty indignation, mixed with the most supreme contempt, "I must confess my surprise that you have chosen such a time and such a subject."
               "In the name of goodness, Mr. Evarts," I said, utterly dumbfounded at this sudden explosion, and covered with a confusion which I could not conceal, "What have I said? what have I done? and how have I insulted you?"
               "Doctor," said his wife, waving back her husband band with a haughty gesture, as he was advancing towards me to reply, "I am convinced you have not intended any wrong. There is some unfortunate mistake. You cannot, I am sure, be acquainted with the character and conduct of that vile woman, or you would never pollute our house by the mention of her name."
               "I do assure you, on my honor"—and I placed my hand on my heart to add to the solemnity of my asseveration—"I had not the most remote idea that you had ever before heard of such a person; how, therefore, could I imagine that you were in any wise connected with her. You must pardon me, for my offence has been most unintentional."
               "I believe you, Sir," she replied with a calm dignity; "I could not be so much mistaken in a gentleman who has been admitted to our friendship—" and, without trusting myself to a reply, I bowed to her implied compliment.
               Mr. Evarts, while this brief conversation was carried on, had thrown himself into a chair, with his face buried in his hands, and as his wife concluded her last remark, he uncovered it, and I actually started back at the sight. He was ashy pale; his eyes were wet with tears; and there was an expression of anguish which called forth my deepest pity. Such mental torture I never before witnessed under any circumstances.
               I saw that this evening was spoiled for any further pleasure, and, stammering out some words which were meant as an apology for my unintentional offence, I bade them good evening; Mrs. Evarts, contrary to her usual custom, waiting on me to the door.
               As I turned to bow a last adieu to Mr. Evarts and Mattie, I saw him look at his wife so imploringly—so beseechingly—with such an expression of misery—I regretted from my heart that I had been the unwitting cause of such unhappiness; though of course it was impossible for me to have foreseen that Cora Marvin was in any wise connected with the happiness or unhappiness of Mr. Evarts and his family.
               When I reached the front door, closely followed by Mrs. Evarts, she touched my arm gently as I was about to open it, and said—in tones intended to convey the impression how deeply she shared in the unhappiness of her husband—"Doctor, you have unwittingly touched a chord which I am afraid will vibrate long. The unfortunate woman whom you have named, has brought shame, disgrace, and infamy on a doating father, and wretchedness to all of us: she is the guilty daughter of my unhappy husband." And, without giving me an opportunity of saying more than, "Good Heavens! is it possible?" she opened the front door; and, before I was fairly aware of it, I was in the street alone—lost in amazement at the extraordinary disclosure just made.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               THE STEPMOTHER'S STORY.
               THE next morning, while seated in my office, pondering upon the events of the past night, and wondering where this extraordinary adventure would terminate, a slight tap at the door, answered by the usual "come in," ushered in a lady whose face was covered by a green veil, so heavy I could not distinguish her features.
               As I rose to salute her, she threw up her veil, and I saw before me Mrs. Evarts, who half smiled at the look of astonishment which I could not repress, on beholding her there at such an hour.
               Recovering myself, I proffered a seat, which she took with one of her blandest smiles, and I could not but think what must have been the fascination of those smiles, when she was in the full bloom of her power and beauty.
               "I trust no one of the family is ill, Mrs. Evarts," I said, for I saw that I was expected to say something, though I must confess I had no idea that her visit was at all professional.
               
               "No, Doctor," she replied, with a sigh of well-affected humility, "my visit here is in connection with a matter, compared with which sickness would be almost a pleasure. It may appear singular that I should——"and as I saw that she hesitated to finish the sentence, I interrupted her, and said, "If it is of such a character, madam, as may be confided to a friend, and I may be enabled to serve you or yours, I am sure you must feel that I am at your service."
               "Thank you, Doctor," she replied, bending on me a glance from her piercing black eyes, which seemed to penetrate my very soul, "it is because I believe you are a sincere friend—because I believe you have the will to serve us, that I am here. I wish to consult you with reference to the miserable young woman whose name, so long forbidden utterance in our house, was mentioned by you last evening."
               "Of Mrs. Marvin?" I inquired, as if I had not fully understood what she had said.
               "Precisely. It is of her I would speak. I—indeed we are all confident that you could not have been aware of the peculiar circumstances connected with her, and her conduct towards our family, or you would never have introduced a subject so painful and mortifying."
               "Most assuredly not," I replied, with an earnestness ness which convinced her of my sincerity. "I never saw or heard of her until within the past few days. As I told you, I met her by chance, and had an opportunity of serving her through her child. Of her history I know nothing, nor have I spoken one word to her of her past or future. I never have refused to render assistance where it was required, and I must confess that I did so in her case with real pleasure, as my interest was awakened for her."
               "Oh, Doctor," said my visitor, covering her face with her handkerchief, and feigning or feeling deep emotion, "how gladly would we have placed that unhappy woman in a position where she would not be compelled to rely upon the casual relief of strangers. She herself has placed a barrier between us, which now can never be removed. No doubt you were deeply interested in her," she said, suddenly changing her tone, and giving me another of those piercing glances.
               "To a certain extent, yes. I considered her as I have found her, a modest, well-behaved woman, suffering from misfortunes, and evidently one who had seen better days. Besides, she had a sick child, to which I ministered; and being brought in daily contact with a woman young and beautiful, thus unfortunately placed, it would have been unnatural had I not felt some interest in her. I trust you know nothing which will compel me to change my opinion of her—nothing to make me feel she is unworthy of the interest I have taken in her."
               "Doctor," she said, slowly, and with an impressiveness of manner which quite startled me, "as your friend, I feel it my duty to communicate what I know of her—you may then draw your own conclusions. Heaven forbid," she added, with deep earnestness, "that I should attempt to check one generous impulse of your heart, but I cannot doubt that you would feel grateful to any one who should warn you against the arts of a woman who has proved so unworthy the regard even of her own family. If she heeds not their feelings, you may judge how capable she would be of appreciating such noble and disinterested conduct as you have displayed towards her. Indeed, you have been wofully deceived, Doctor, for she is unworthy a single generous thought of your heart."
               "Certainly, madam, not only should I regret such a discovery, but I would feel grateful, indeed, for that friendly warning which might save me from the consequences of misguided impulse. I never yet paused to ask whether sickness and suffering was caused by vice or misfortune; it was enough to know that I could be of service; distress and want, whether real or feigned, never fail to awaken sympathy in my heart."
               "I do not doubt it. But I am detaining you; a few words will suffice to accomplish the purpose of my visit—have you a few moments to spare?"
               "I am all anxiety, madam, proceed."
               "You are aware, I presume, that I am the second wife of Mr. Evarts," she said with a sigh, wiping her eyes with her perfumed handkerchief.
               "Until now I did not know it; my acquaintance with your family has not been of long duration, and I have never made any inquiries concerning you, which might be deemed impertinent."
               "I am, of course, the stepmother of Mrs. Marvin, and although that is a position always open and subject to reproach and censure, I feel that in all things I have faithfully discharged my duty as a wife and mother.
               "Four years since, while Mr. Evarts was at the South, we were married, and from the first hour of our meeting, Cora exercised the most decided repugnance to her father's marriage, and an hostility to myself equally marked. I made use of every art and effort to win her affections and regard, for having, as you know, a grown-up daughter of my own, I foresaw saw what disagreeable consequences must ensue if she continued to cherish such sentiments towards me.
               "Mattie joined me in essaying to win the affections of Cora, but in vain; and surely, though she is my own daughter, I may say with pride and pleasure, that she has one of the best and most amiable dispositions I ever knew. We failed, however, with all our efforts to win more from her than the merest ordinary civility; and at one time, so determined seemed her hostility, that rather than risk the happiness of myself and daughter by being brought in constant contact with Cora, I positively declined to become Mr. Evarts' wife, for I foresaw that it would cause unhappiness, and, perhaps, a separation of his family.
               "Mr. Evarts, however, assured me that Cora was a hot-headed, impulsive, head-strong girl, accustomed to have her own way, and that the only real objection to our marriage, was the dread that I might exercise an influence over her, and attempt to control her conduct. He knew she would love me when she came to know me better; and overcome by his arguments and entreaties, I withdrew my opposition, and we were married."
               "I have never ceased to regret that as one of the most unfortunate steps I ever took: not that Mr. Evarts is anything but the best and most devoted of husbands, and he loves Mattie as though she were his own, but it causes me ceaseless unhappiness to know that I have been the cause, unwittingly, Heaven knows, of all his troubles, when I had hoped to bring peace and happiness to his heart and home. I assure you, Doctor, that thought costs me restless days and sleepless nights; and I never cease to reproach myself for the weakness which led me to listen to his persuasions, in spite of my better judgment.
               "I believe it, madam—from my heart I believe it," I said, carried away by my sympathy for her evident distress; for the tears were coursing down her cheeks while she was speaking.
               "Cora, Doctor, has been the cause of all our troubles. No sooner was our marriage consummated, than she commenced a systematic course of warfare upon me. Daily she outraged my feelings by reminding me of what cher mother was—how she acted—what she did and spoke, and in a thousand ways lacerating my feelings.
               "I strove to make myself all her mother had been; and even in that she found cause for censure, reproaching me with striving to win her father from even the memory of his first wife's virtues, as if it was not my duty to make him forget the loss he had sustained in her.
               
               "I knew, however, that my duty as a mother and wife demanded I should 'bear and forbear,' and I did so; yes, I would have done so to this hour, but that she chose another method, and assailed me through my daughter Mattie. Her cousin, Robert Barton, a young, high-spirited gentleman, was constant in his attentions, but Cora succeeded not only in inducing her father to forbid him the house, but shamefully circulated reports concerning her, which would have blasted her character for ever. Robert never entered the house from the time after Mr. Evarts forbade his presence; and, it was only when Mr. Evarts was entirely convinced of his perfect integrity, and so expressed himself, he could be induced to renew his visits, notwithstanding his strong attachment to Mattie.
               "This course on the part of Cora I knew was prompted solely by jealousy of poor Mattie, who really did not care for Robert, while Cora took no pains to conceal her passionate attachment to him.
               "It was not long before I discovered that she had actually thrown herself into his arms, and had offered to sacrifice her honor to her passion for him.
               "This was more than I would submit to; and I therefore resolved that she or I must leave the house; and I will do Mr. Evarts the justice to say, that when made fully acquainted with her conduct, he did not hesitate an instant in his choice.
               "Cora was sent to a respectable boarding-house, in charge of an intimate friend of her father, but she had not been there long before she became attached to a young sailor, named Marvin, and I believe she was married to him.
               "After he went to sea, her conduct became so openly loose, Mrs. Edmonds refused longer to allow her in the house. Her father offered to make ample provision for her, but she obstinately refused it, declaring she would rather starve than accept aid from him, so long as he lived with one so unworthy of his name as I was.
               "Finding remonstrances useless, and almost heartbroken at the misconduct of his only daughter, my husband strove to forget her entirely, and by common consent her name has never been mentioned in our house from that time forward."
               "But did Cora admit her guilt?" I asked, shocked at the unexpected discovery made to me; "was she not repentant?"
               "Oh, Doctor, no; on the contrary, with the most unblushing effrontery, she persisted in asserting her innocence, in spite of the strongest possible proofs, and even had the shamefacedness to assert, that the whole was an affair of my invention, without a shadow of foundation. Nay, she even went so far as to accuse Mattie of the very crimes which I had fastened upon her. I would have borne every thing but that; and, as I have said, a separation took place. The rest I have told you; and now, Doctor, draw your own conclusions."
               "Really, Madam, you have astonished me beyond measure. What you have told me is so foreign to her manners—her air—her general deportment. She seemed so modest—so retiring—so melancholy."
               "She has enough to make her melancholy, if she is capable of feeling at all. She has nearly broken the heart of the best and kindest of fathers; ruined the peace of mind of one who would have been a mother to her, and attacked the reputation of a girl as pure and gentle as ever breathed. But her artfulness is beyond comprehension. She can assume an appearance of modesty and artlessness, which would deceive the wisest; and I do not wonder at all, that with one so full of noble and generous impulses as yourself, she found an easy convert to her arts.
               "But, Doctor," she continued, wiping her eyes—for she had wept freely during this recital—"I have warned you, as I felt it to be my duty, against her. She will inevitably lead you into some disagreeable position if you continue to visit her; and that, you know, would be fatal to your professional career. The interest which I take in you as our friend and physician, is the only excuse I can offer for my appearance here, and for what I have told you."
               "For which I thank you from my heart. I am astonished and bewildered beyond measure at what I have heard, but rest assured I shall not fail to heed the warning you have so kindly given, and prove myself worthy of the interest you have professed for me."
               "And now, I must go," she said, rising; "it is not necessary that you should mention to any one" (and I knew from the emphasis on her words she meant only her husband) "that I have been here, or what has passed between us; I rely upon your honor for that; it would only cause added unhappiness were it known that a friend, whom we all so highly esteem, was acquainted with this melancholy history. My sole object has been to prevent you from being put in a false position, and drawn into a vortex from which you might find it impossible to extricate yourself. Good morning, Doctor; come around soon." And, drawing ing her heavy veil over her face, she left the office, and I was alone with my thoughts.
               For a few moments I sat mute and wondering, and at length, muttering to myself, "I believe it's a cursed pack of lies from beginning to end," I seized my hat and coat, and sallied forth to make my routine of professional calls.
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               FATHER AND DAUGHTER.
               FILLED with my own thoughts, and they were not very pleasant, I was just stepping off the office stoop, when I stumbled against a gentleman who was in the act of ascending, and looking up, I found myself face to face with Mr. Evarts.
               Excusing myself for the unintentional rudeness, I invited him to walk in, and, as he complied, he cast stealthy glances up and down the street, as if to observe if he was watched.
               "Doctor, can you give me a few moments of private conversation—I will not detain you long," and he spoke in those quick, anxious, nervous tones which had often before attracted my attention.
               "Certainly," and locking the door so as to prevent possible interruption, I handed him a chair, into which he sank as if exhausted, exhibiting every sign of deep emotion. I maintained silence, for I well forebode the purpose of his call, and from my heart felt for him the deepest sympathy.
               
               "You are not well," I said, at length, finding that he uttered no word, "you look pale and nervous—let me give you something to quiet you."
               "No, no—never mind—it will pass over directly—don't mind me. You can imagine, Doctor, why I am here," he said, with a strong effort at composure; "you mentioned last night the name of one who was dear—oh! how dear to me"—and he spoke so sadly, so sorrowfully, I pitied him from my heart, for I saw that she still held the first and holiest place in his heart.
               I merely bowed assent, and he continued: "Unworthily as she has acted—unkindly—unnaturally—she is still my daughter. She was my only child, Doctor, and oh! how I loved the very ground on which she trod. But I cannot, I could not hear that she was suffering, without at least a wish to relieve her. I would not for the world have her to know that I have even heard of her position. Will you, Doctor, be my friend and almoner? Your professional character will enable you to do that without suspicion. She must not, however, on any consideration, know that it comes from me, or she would refuse it."
               "And why, Mr. Evarts?" I inquired, for notwithstanding what Mrs. Evarts had just told me, I could not feel that a daughter, an only, loved, and petted child, would refuse a father's bounty—"why should she refuse it as coming from you? Will you not go yourself, and—?"
               "Not for the world," he hastily interrupted—"on no conceivable account. Excuse me if I do not give you any reasons for my conduct. Do not ask me any, but consent to my request. You can manage it in any manner you think proper,—only do it, and I shall have the consciousness that I have done my duty."
               "I am afraid not," I thought, but I said, "I will do as you wish with pleasure, and shall ask no reasons, but I cannot help thinking, if you saw that sweet, mild, modest face—if you could witness how uncomplainingly she suffers—if you could see that lovely boy, of whom any one on earth might be proud, you would—"
               "No more, Doctor. Do not speak so. I tell you it is utterly impossible. You can tell her that the money was raised by voluntary subscription among those to whom you had mentioned her condition and circumstances. That would be true, you know," he added, with a ghastly attempt at a smile.
               "I fear she would not receive it on those terms; for if I read her aright, she has her own share of pride."
               "Well, try it; there is no harm in that. Here, take this," and he handed me a roll of bills, some fifty dollars in amount—"take it to please me, and give it to her as you choose, so she does not know whence it comes."
               "I will give it to her as the voluntary contribution of a benevolent gentleman," I said, thrusting it into my vest pocket, and as I spoke I noticed a peculiar expression cross his countenance, the meaning of which was an enigma to me.
               "Some other time, when we have both of us more leisure, I may make you acquainted with my history, so far as she is concerned. I will call to-morrow, and you will let me know then the result of your visit. Of course you will see her to-day?"
               "I will, though I have no professional excuse to make, for her child has been quite well for a week past. However, I do not need any excuse for calling."
               "Who does the child look like, Doctor?" he said, as if half ashamed to ask the question.
               "Now I look at you more closely, Mr. Evarts, I think he favors you wonderfully. He is a noble, beautiful child."
               "One thing more, Doctor," he said, relapsing into his nervous, anxious manner, as he took off his hat; "there is no necessity of naming my visit or its object to any one—I presume you understand?"
               "Perfectly, Mr. Evarts. You may confide in me, I assure you."
               "Then, good morning, and success to your mission," he said, as he bowed himself out of the office.
               "Here, then," I said to myself, "is a partial solution of this mystery. There is some deviltry going on, and I will fathom it. Mrs. Evarts, you need not tell me. No matter, I'll get at the bottom of this yet. I can play as deep a game as you can, any day, and I hold the trump cards now."
               True to my promise, when I had finished my regular visits, I called on Mrs. Marvin, and found her as usual seated at her sewing, while Clarence was amusing himself on the floor with a little toy which I had brought him during his sickness.
               She received me with her wonted frankness and warmth, and I actually blushed when I looked at her, to think that for an instant I had given credence to a report derogatory to one on whose truth and purity I would have staked my life.
               This was the first thought; then came to my mind the words of Mrs. Evarts, her father's refusal to see her, the peculiarity of her present position, all combined to change my views; and though I could not bring myself, as I looked in her open, ingenuous face, to believe her capable of such artfulness and deceit, I resolved to be on my guard, and watch her narrowly Even her frank and cordial manner of receiving me startled me, and I half shrank from her extended hand.
               Fortunately she did not notice the movement, but exclaimed, "Oh, Doctor, I am so glad to see you, and I am so grateful to you—my darling here is so well, and so cheerful, and so happy, and I was so frightened for fear I should lose him;" and she drew the smiling little rascal to her heart with a fervor that showed how deeply he was imbedded there. "How can I ever repay you?"
               "Tut, tut—never mind that now—some other time. No one knows what a day may bring forth. You will be rich one of these days, and perhaps you will recommend me to a large practice. Come here, youngster," and the little fellow, who had grown really attached to me, was in an instant seated on my knee, playing with the seals of my watch.
               "See, Doctor," she said, with a bright, winning smile, and her countenance beaming with gratitude to me, "Clarence knows who is kind to him. I never saw him go to any one but you. Young as he is now, he remembers your kindness, and I will see that he never forgets it as he grows up. And now, doctor, I want to return the money you were so kind as to loan me the first day you saw me;" and going to a small cupboard, she took thence some silver wrapped up in a bill, which she placed in my hand. "There, Doctor, that makes me happy."
               "But really, I don't want it, and I know you can't spare it."
               "Indeed, but I can. Mr. Parsons has paid up all he owed me, and I have more left. With my health preserved, I can get on well enough now."
               "Mrs. Marvin," I said, now perfectly convinced by the earnest, single-hearted sincerity of her manner, "I cannot refuse to take this, for I have no right to ask you to remain under obligations to a stranger."
               "A stranger, Doctor—may I meet more such strangers," she said, with a frank ingenuousness. "You must not speak in that manner to me. I assure you that should circumstances again require it, I would seek assistance from you with entire freedom, before any other person in the city."
               "Mrs. Marvin," I said, determined to come to the point at once, "I took a great liberty last night with you, and in your behalf."
               
               "With me, sir, and in my behalf?"
               "Yes; I was in company where the subject of the low wages paid to female operatives was broached, and I spoke of the many cases of sickness and destitution I had witnessed professionally, by reason of their inability to eke out a living on the miserable pittance paid to them."
               "Well, sir," she said, 
                     inquiringiy
                     inquiringly
                  , holding out her arms for the child, as if fearful that some harm was about to come to him, and I could see by the expression of her countenance that she was deeply pained.
               "I assure you, madam, I spoke in very sincerity, and from the best of motives."
               "I do not doubt it, sir—I cannot doubt it. I know not why I should feel at all, placed as I am; but you will, I am sure, appreciate my motives in wishing to keep the knowledge of my poverty from the heartless world."
               "I do assure you, madam, that what I mentioned last night will never go beyond the family circle in which it was named; and to prove to you that my narrative had effect upon at least one person, there was a gentleman present who handed this to me as a tribute from his benevolence," and I tendered to her the bills which Mr. Evarts had given to me for her.
               She took the notes, and glancing hastily at the amount, turned ashy pale, and I noticed that she was excessively agitated.
               Raising her eyes to my face, she looked at me with a cold calm gaze, which I could not have withstood had I harbored an improper thought towards her, and extending the bills to me, she said calmly but firmly—
               "You are very kind, indeed, and your friend is very kind also, but I cannot accept this money."
               "But, Mrs. Marvin, I assure you, your refusal would be a source of great pain to the donor."
               "Oh, no, that cannot be. I am an utter stranger to him, save as your kindness may have made me known and magnified my wants. This sum will serve to relieve a great many who are in greater need of it than I am."
               "Really, Mrs. Marvin, I cannot consent to receive it. It was sent for your personal use; and if I were to make your refusal known to your fa——
               I checked myself before the word was uttered, but she caught my meaning, and springing towards me with a flushed countenance and flashing eyes, she exclaimed, eagerly—
               "Oh, did my dear father send this to me? Tell me truly, Doctor; do not deceive me; do not let me feel I may not look for truth in any one in the whole world. Tell me, Doctor, in very truth, was this my dear, dear father's gift?" And as she spoke, tears gathered in her eyes, and her whole frame quivered with excitement.
               I dared not deceive her, as I had already said sufficient to give her reason to doubt my denial if I had felt inclined to make one, and I said frankly, "Mrs. Marvin, upon my honor, it was given to me by him for you."
               "Thank God—thank God," she exclaimed, passionately, "he loves me yet—I knew—I felt he did; God bless you, Doctor, for this moment of happiness—the only one I have known for many months. Now, tell me Doctor, how did he send it? Why? What did he say? Tell me all about it. Do tell me, Doctor. Do not conceal anything from me. Oh, you have made me so happy;" and taking my hand she pressed it with the fervor of earnest thankfulness. "Oh, how happy it has made me, the thought—nay, the certainty, that my father does love me still."
               If I had chosen to avail myself of the opportunity to learn all I desired of her history, it was now afforded me; but I forbore to take advantage of her present position and feelings; and therefore concealing the fact, that Mr. Evarts had been at my office on that very morning, I merely mentioned, that having chanced to name her on the previous evening in the presence of her family, her father had called at my office in the morning, and had instructed me to present that to her.
               "But not as a gift from him, Doctor, not as coming from a loving father's heart;" and she spoke with a tone of sadness and despondency that almost brought the tears to my eyes.
               "No, Mrs. Marvin, I could not deceive you; on the contrary, I was expressly forbidden to mention the fact of his agency at all."
               "I feared so," she said, mournfully, and tears gathered in her eyes, as she bent over her child and imprinted a kiss upon his upturned forehead, as if in that act she derived some comfort in her affliction.
               Suddenly raising her eyes to mine, she said eagerly, "Oh, Doctor, tell me about it—all about my dear unhappy father, for I know he is unhappy. How does he look? Is he well? Do you think he loves me?"
               "Loves you? Why, Mrs. Marvin, every thought of his heart is centered in you. I may have done wrong; but you cannot imagine how I longed and strove to bring him here that he might see this noble little fellow;" and I patted Clarence's head, as he crept up to me.
               "Did he ask after Clarence?"
               
               "Oh, yes; he asked who he looked like, and I said I thought he favored him."
               "And did he seem pleased at the thought?"
               "Indeed he did; he smiled as I have not seen him smile in a long time."
               "You must have thought it very strange, Doctor," she said, half musingly, "when you found out who I was, to find me in such a situation; a daughter—an only child—separated from her only parent and protector, and thrown, as you see me, upon the cold world."
               "I must confess that I did; and if I may be permitted to speak in perfect candor, I should like to say——"
               "Go on, Doctor," she said, seeing that I hesitated—"you can say nothing for which I am unprepared."
               "Well, then, frankly, I was about to say, that what I heard of you made a deep impression on me to your prejudice. That I cherish such feelings no more, is abundantly evidenced by the fact that I am here; and, permit me to add, I am perfectly satisfied that all was pure invention, and intended to operate on my mind against you. More yet—"seeing she was about to interrupt me—"I know and feel they have been falsehoods; and I tell you that, while I honor and respect you, I will, with my whole heart, serve you to the best of my poor ability. I am sure you do not merit the treatment you are receiving."
               "My conscience tells me that I do not; and I cannot but believe that there is a day of terrible retribution coming, for those who have wrought so much misery. You have received your information, of course, from Mrs. Evarts—my poor father's wife?"
               "Yes."
               "In the name of all that is evil," she exclaimed, vehemently, wringing her hands, "why can she not leave me alone now? Surely she ought to be satisfied. She has blackened my character—she has driven me from my father's home, and almost from his heart—she has wrought the worst!—why can she not leave me to my misery, and why pursue me here?"
               "I believe you, Mrs. Marvin; and this morning, even while she was detailing her history of your conduct, I could not but feel that there was more than she cared to have me know. Her very anxiety to put me on my guard against your arts and wiles, as she terms them, convinced me of that."
               "Then you are not afraid of me, Doctor," she said, stretching out a hand, which I took respectfully—"I could not, if I would, deceive you; you have rendered me too great a service."
               "But do you care to hear what I have to say? Perhaps our stories may differ somewhat. Shall I tell you how you find me here?"
               "Most willingly would I hear of it; and I trust from my heart that I may yet be enabled to serve you."
               "Now then, Clarence, go play; that's a good boy. Sit down, Doctor; I won't detain you long." And she proceeded to give the narrative of her first acquaintance and connection with her father's second wife.
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               THE DAUGHTER'S STORY.
               "IT is not necessary, Doctor, to go back many years," she commenced, when I had seated myself with an air of interest and attention. "My dear mother, by whom, as well as by my father, I had been much petted, died about six years ago, and I was left in charge of my father's establishment.
               "About two years after her death, business, and my father's health, which physicians declared required a milder climate, took us to Savannah, where he purposed remaining for at least a year, trusting that the change of air would restore him.
               "His position in New-York was such as to entitle him to an entrée into the best circles there, and we were not long in forming many and pleasant acquaintances. Among them was Mrs. Main and her daughter Mattie, with a nephew, Robert Barton, who boarded at the same house with ourselves, and with whom an intimacy soon sprung up, for I was exceedingly pleased with them.
               
               "The mother, I fancied, had some odd ways, but I was ready to excuse them, attributing them merely to a natural eccentricity of character, at which I often laughed, while Martha seemed to me to be one of the most loveable, amiable girls I ever knew.
               "Her cousin Robert, a handsome, well-informed young man, was our constant attendant, and in such pleasant society, the weeks and months flew rapidly by.
               "My father was equally pleased as myself with the family, and Mrs. Main, seeing the impression she had made, commenced laying her plans for the future. To me she was all gentleness, kindness, and affability. If I complained of a headache, she affected the greatest interest and sympathy, and was always at hand with some remedy. Indeed, she exhibited such an unusual affection for, and interest in me, I began to doubt her sincerity, and set a watch upon myself lest I should be carried away by my infatuation.
               "Robert Barton was exceedingly attentive to me, and but for a lucky chance, I must confess I might have learned to love him in time, and become his wife, for such I thought were his intentions.
               "I chanced one day to overhear a brief conversation between the cousins, which opened my eyes to the reality of my position, so far as he was concerned, and thenceforward, though I permitted him to continue his attentions, the better to further my own plans, I was fully on my guard against his arts.
               "As for Mrs. Main, from the moment I commenced to suspect her, I began to find cause for suspicion, and I learned to dread the influence she was rapidly gaining over my poor father. Towards myself, her conduct was in no wise changed, nor was that of Martha, but I saw through the motives by which they were prompted, and despised them, for I knew that the efforts they so assiduously made to win my feelings, were only made in dread of the influence I had over my father, which both knew to be paramount.
               "Matters continued thus for some six months, when my father one day startled me by broaching the subject of his possible marriage.
               "I knew at once to whom he alluded, and remonstrated quietly but affectionately; I promised never to marry, but to remain always with him, and care for him, so that he would not miss the comforts of his own home.
               "He kissed me laughingly, and said he was afraid I was too late, as he was already under an engagement to Mrs. Main, and when he added that the wedding was to take place within a month, my heart sank within me, for I felt that my happiness must be the sacrifice,—and I spoke of Mrs. Main in pretty strong, and not very flattering terms.
               "I do not know, but I always suspected that Mrs. Main had overheard our conversation on this occasion, but I found from that time a marked change in her conduct towards me. As my future mother, I tried to respect her, and sought now as much to win her affections, as she had pretended to seek my own; but she received my advances with a coldness and hauteur which I could not penetrate, and which caused me many bitter tears, for the prospect of having her for a step-mother grew daily more and more odious to me.
               "Martha, however, continued to treat me as before—nay, if possible, more kindly and affectionately. She was so gentle, so apparently sincere in her affection—so sisterly in her conduct, I looked upon her as my only friend, and to her I confided all my sorrows, and sought her advice as to the best means of winning back her mother's feelings.
               "Would you believe it, Doctor, ever word that I uttered to that artful hypocrite was carried directly to her mother, and I doubt not, with exaggerations, thus enabling her to gain a perfect insight into my feelings, and to retain the ascendancy which she had gained over my father by her arts, and over me through my fears.
               "The month flew rapidly by, and my father was married. A few weeks afterwards, finding his health entirely established, he removed to New-York, bringing his family with him, and followed by Robert Barton, who continued his attentions to me, notwithstanding the repugnance which I had latterly evinced to his presence.
               "For a short time after we reached home, matters went on so smoothly, I began to hope for happiness again. My step-mother treated me kindly, Martha was all affection, and Robert, if not less persevering in his attentions, had grown more respectful, and had abated much of his wonted familiarity, so that I could at least endure him.
               "My dear father appeared perfectly happy, and surely he deserved to be. You know that he is wealthy, and his greatest delight consisted in adding to the comfort and happiness of his family. He was, so far as Mattie and I were concerned, perfectly impartial, never making a present, no matter whether small or large, to the one unless the other received its counterpart. No distinction was ever made between us, at home or abroad.
               "A few months of comparative happiness soon wore away, when suddenly a change came over the whole tenor of my life.
               "Robert Barton, whose continued attentions to me (for he had thus far been an inmate of our family at my father's request) had attracted the notice not only of my father, who frequently hinted at them in a laughing manner, but of visitors to the house suddenly assumed an air of rude familiarity which disgusted me. He sought every possible occasion to be alone with me; and almost invariably when thus placed, Mattie or her mother was sure to enter the room, which they instantly left with a half-concealed laugh.
               "From familiarity he grew to absolute rudeness; and on one occasion, when he uttered some remarks which were insulting beyond forbearance, I so far for got myself as to spit in his face, and ordered him never again to venture to address me.
               "Slowly and deliberately he left the room, but turned to me, and said, 'Cora Evarts, to the latest hour of your life you shall repent this.'
               "The same day he left the house suddenly, and I saw no more of him, nor did I even inquire after him. Alas! I little knew then how capable he was of fulfilling his threat; and how terribly he has kept his promise!
               "From that hour an entire change came over Mrs. Evarts—I cannot call her mother—she was not only cold to freezing, but she was insolently haughty, while Mattie followed directly in his mother's footsteps. I was treated by both of them more as a menial than the daughter of her husband, to whom both owed all they had on earth, and I vainly sought for some explanation of their extraordinary conduct.
               "If I spoke to Mrs. Evarts, she turned from me with freezing coldness, hoping sarcastically that my own heart and conscience could not give me any satisfactory reply. Mattie absolutely refused to hold communion with me, and even my dear father spoke to me at times with a harshness of manner which drew tears to my eyes.
               "In vain I endeavored to find in my past conduct some cause for this change. I reviewed my course since my father's marriage, but could find nothing to condemn.
               "This state of things continued some weeks, until my spirits and health were so visibly affected, my father could not help noticing the change in me; and on one occasion, when we were alone, and I saw that he was looking at me with on air of affectionate compassion, I threw myself on his bosom, and begged him, for the love he used to bear me, to tell me what had caused this dreadful change.
               "He colored, stammered, hesitated, and pressing me to his heart with a sigh, promised to give me an explanation at the earliest moment; and without affording me an opportunity of saying another word, he left the room.
               "On that same evening, while we were at tea, I noticed an air of constraint on the part of my father, so foreign to him, I could not keep down the presentiment of coming evil; and when he bade me go into the library, and await his coming, my heart sank within me, and I was in no wise reassured when I noticed the contemptuous glances cast upon me by Mattie and her mother. I trembled with apprehension, as I entered the library where my father was seated.
               "As I met his cold, stern gaze, I could no longer restrain my feelings, but bursting into tears, I sank into the nearest chair. My father uttered no word until he saw that I was more composed; then rising, he approached me, and simply asked, 'Do you know where Robert Barton is?'
               "This question, so sudden, so unexpected, so foreign to my thoughts at that moment, took me completely by surprise, and fairly stupefied me. I could not imagine his object in asking such a question, and I felt that my cheeks and brow were crimsoned as I answered, 'No, father, I do not.'
               "My hesitation, my evident confusion, and my blushes, all told against me, and he put his own construction upon them.
               "He evidently attributed them to guilt, for with a sternness, which in his worst mood I had never before witnessed, he said, 'Then it is true, and my daughter has disgraced herself and her father.'
               "Doctor, I dare not recount what was said to me on that occasion by my unhappy and deceived father. He accused me of having disgraced myself with Robert Barton, of having actually thrown myself away upon him, and he, would you believe it, Doctor, my own father, actually told me, that Barton, sooner than continue thus to injure and disgrace one to whom he was under so many obligations, had decided to leave the house and the city. I need not tell you that I denied the charges with all the vehemence of conscious and injured innocence; but to no avail. My father was convinced of their truth, and finally, in answer to my most impassioned appeals, declared that his wife had the most irrefragable proofs of my guilt.
               "At the mention of that name, I felt that I was lost indeed, for I knew too well her power and her malignity, from past and bitter experience. But I felt my courage rise with the emergency, and I implored him that I might be allowed to confront her. I denied with all the earnestness of my nature the truth of any charge against my integrity; and I conjured him by the memory of his deceased wife, by the love which he had borne me, and which I felt I had ever deserved, not to believe such things possible.
               "He merely replied coldly, 'Your wish shall be gratified,' and rising, he rang the bell, and ordered the servant to summon his wife. 'You shall have every opportunity, Cora, of clearing yourself of this degrading charge. Your mother has known of the circumstances for a long time, but her respect for my feelings has induced her to withhold all mention of them, until I actually forced it from her. I trust you may be able to clear yourself and me from so foul a stain.'
               "Before I had time to reply she entered, and I strove to catch her eye, but she carefully avoided it.
               "'Here, Cora, is your mother.'
               "Oh, father, dear father, can you call her my mother? Can you utter that word at such a time as this? Can you call her my mother, who would traduce me to my own father?
               "'Silence, Cora, I will not hear such language. She has behaved throughout this whole affair with a spirit of Christian charity and forbearance for which I cannot too much honor her. Now, if you have any thing to say, she is prepared to hear it.'
               "'Oh, Mr. Evarts,' said his wife, with well-affected sorrow and humility, 'do spare me—let it pass; indeed, I do not wish to become the accuser of your daughter. Heaven knows how I have loved her, and striven to act a mother's part to her. I did not wish to say anything of this unhappy affair—you know I did not, and would not, until you forced it from me.'
               "'I know my dear—I know I did, and can only regret from my heart that you are placed in this unhappy position. This, however, is no time for mere personal regrets. Cora has demanded to be confronted with you, and defied you to prove the charges against her.'
               "'Heaven knows, my dear husband,' said the viper, who had not yet dared to look me in the face, and wiping the crocodile tear from her eyes, 'heaven knows how deeply I deplore this unhappy affair. But my love for you, and my reverence for your character is too great to permit any personal feelings to weigh with me against them. These are my proofs,' and she handed to my father a small package of letters, 'and Martha,' she added, 'I am sorry to say, has been acquainted with her conduct from the first.'
               "'Call Martha,' said my father, opening one of the letters, which having hastily glanced over, he handed to me, and I seized it eagerly.
               "While striving to make out its contents, for my eyes were streaming with tears, Mattie entered the room and took shelter behind her mother, so that I could not look her in the face.
               "I dare not, Doctor, repeat the contents of that letter. In it, the villain Barton had the infamy to declare, that he left the house because I had actually thrown myself into his arms, and had voluntarily offered to sacrifice my honor to my passion for him. That I had offered to marry him if he would aid me in bringing about a separation between my father and his wife; and that shocked at my proposals, and dreading to be the means of bringing infamy and reproach upon one to whom he was under so many obligations, he preferred to take the only course left to him, and absent himself from the society of a woman whose passion for him rose superior to her duty, her honor, her affection for her parents, or her self-respect.
               "I was so utterly dumbfounded at the perusal of this infamous letter, I could say nothing, but turned from one to the other in stupid amazement.
               "'Do you require further proof, Mr. Evarts,' said his wife with mock humility, 'Martha and myself, have frequently seen them in——'
               "Stop—one moment—let me say one word," I exclaimed, dashing away my tears, and approaching Mrs. Evarts, who retreated to the farther corner of the room, closely followed by Mattie, as if she apprehended personal violence from me.
               "'Not one word, Cora, unless to disprove the truth of that letter,' said my father.
               "Not one word, father, and this to your only child? Oh father, by the memory of my dear mother, by the memory of the happiness which was ours, before that serpent entered our paradise, I conjure you to listen to me. That vile, canting hypocrite—that woman whose life is made up of artfulness and lies—that——"
               "'I will not hear such language, Cora, it is not the proper way to meet charges so clearly proved. Confess your guilt——'
               "Oh, father," I could only say, in tones which must have reached his heart, had it not been steeled against me by his wife's fiendish machinations; but he would not listen.
               "'Now listen to me, Cora. You have accused my wife of plotting against you, when her sole object has been to serve you, and save me from the disgrace you have brought upon me——'
               "I repeat it," I exclaimed, stung to the heart—"she has plotted against me—she has sought to undermine me in your affections—she has sought to win your heart from me, for the base purpose of securing to herself and daughter, that wealth which she knew was rightfully my own.
               "Oh, Cora—Cora," exclaimed his wife, feigning the deepest emotion, and wiping her eyes, "how can you say so? Have I not ever acted a mother's part towards you? Have I not ever been kind and affectionate? Have I not treated you as my own child?'
               "'Can you deny that, Cora,' said my father.
               "Oh, my father, can you hear this against your own, your only child?
               "'Would to Heaven I had no cause,' he replied, much moved.
               "'It is a sad thing for me to feel that one on whom my hopes and affections have been so fixed, should prove so unworthy—should bring shame to herself and disgrace to her doating father. Cora, there is but one course left—confess your guilt—acknowledge your sorrow for the past, and vile as has been your conduct, if your mother consents to overlook it, I will—'
               "'Of course, I will,' said Mrs. Evarts. 'God forbid that I should be the unhappy means of separating a father from his only child—I have one of my own, and thank God, I have a parent's feelings——'
               "Never—so help me Heaven, never," I exclaimed, with energy, for every feeling was now thoroughly aroused. "Never—I would beg, starve, or die first. Father, I am innocent; I am as worthy of your love, as I was the hour you sacrificed your happiness and mine to the arts of that infamous woman. She is guilty—she it is who should in the very dust crave my pardon for the wrong she has done to me. But mark me, father, she will as surely reach her reward, as there is a just God above us. He will never suffer the innocent to fall before such art and lies. Perhaps not until she has driven me into the grave, but it will surely come, and deep will be the retribution which Heaven will visit on her."
               "'Oh, Cora!' exclaimed his wife, 'how can you talk so of me? If you knew what I had suffered since the discovery of your——'
               "'Silence!' I said, in tones that caused her to start back in affright, 'you vile, polluted, polluting thing—silence! Your aim is accomplished, your end is attained for the present, but your punishment will come. And now, father, what am I to do?" I said, turning to him with forced calmness.
               "'Do you refuse to ask your mother's pardon for the vile insinuations you have made?'
               "'Oh, do not insist on that, Mr. Evarts,' said his wife, with well-feigned earnestness; 'I forgive her, Heaven knows I do, from my heart, for the unjust suspicions she cherishes against myself.'
               "'But I do insist,' said my father, and well she knew that he would.
               "'Father, I cannot—I will not, though I die for it—I will not so wrong you and myself.'
               "'Then this house is no longer your home, Cora.'
               "'Oh, dear husband,' said his wife, 'this must not be—this shall not be. Rather let me go, for I have been the cause of this unhappy scene, and Heaven knows how unwillingly,' and again her tears flowed freely.
               "'Cora,' said my father, without heeding her, 'you have heard my conditions, are you prepared to comply with them?'
               "'Though I should die here at your feet, father, I would not.'
               "'Then we must part. Had you exhibited any signs of contrition for your guilt, so plainly proven, I could have overlooked every thing in pity for you; but your conduct now, shows that you are lost to all feeling of self-respect or shame. Henceforth you are no more my daughter.'
               "'Oh, father!' I exclaimed, sinking on my knees before him, 'do not discard me thus, and with such feelings. As I stand before my God, I am utterly innocent of a single charge brought against me. We are the victims of a deep-laid plot.'
               "'I will not hear those words again. You have refused to adopt the course I pointed out, and must abide the consequences. You shall not want, Cora, but here you cannot remain. I will see that due provision is made for you.'
               "'No, father, no. I must either live here with you, as your child, worthy of your love, or I must go alone and uncared for, unprotected. God will provide for me, for I could not receive any thing from a parent who denies to his only child, simple justice. The hour will come when your heart will ache with bitter sorrow, as you are made to feel the wrong you have done to your innocent, unoffending child. As for you, madam,' and I turned to Mrs. Evarts—
               "'Spare your reproaches to her,' said my father, 'she has only discharged a sacred duty which she owed to me as a wife, and to you as a mother. I honor and approve her course from first to last. You have made your own choice, and you must abide by it.'
               "'Father, dear father! do you mean to turn me from your home and heart thus rudely?'
               "'Cora, it is your own work—you have sinned deeply. Had you but acknowledged your fault, I could have taken you again to my heart, and called you what you have ever been to me, my daughter; but now—'
               "'Oh, Mr. Evarts—dear husband,' interrupted his wife, 'do not go to such extremes. Do not, I pray you, compel me to feel that my affection for you has wrought this misery. Oh, I wish to Heaven I had never seen you!' and sinking into a chair, the vile hypocrite covered her face with her handkerchief, and shed copious tears.
               "This had precisely the effect upon which she had calculated. The more she interceded for me, the more obstinate my father became; for, deceived by her tears and her well-feigned sorrow, he was so blinded he could not distinguish truth from falsehood."
               While Mrs. Marvin had been engaged in this narrative, little Clarence, who had been playing about unnoticed, wearied of being left to himself, had crept upon the bed, and had fallen fast asleep.
               The fond mother, perceiving his position, and blushing at the thought that she had been so interested in herself as to forget him, hastily arose, and having placed him in an easy posture, and covered him up, resumed her seat and continued her narrative.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VIII.
               THE DAUGHTER'S STORY CONCLUDED.
               "I BEGGED and implored my father," she continued, "to examine for himself—to institute thorough inquiries, and not to trust to evidence so uncertain in condemnation of his own daughter; but Mrs. Evarts was prepared for this, for she had tutored two of the servants, John and Julia, so well, that when summoned by her, they stated, in the most positive terms, the most infamous stories concerning my interviews with Mr. Barton.
               "I saw through the plot, but was unable to defend myself, except by my protestations, and they availed nothing against the lies and perjuries brought against me.
               "To be brief, Doctor, for I have detained you too long already, let it suffice to know that my father, without shedding one tear, and so far as I could perceive, without a sigh of regret, suffered me to leave his house alone, unprotected and penniless, for I resolutely refused to receive any thing from him, so long as he deemed me to be so unworthy of his affection, and could believe me guilty of the vile charges brought against me, to the ruin of my own character, and the destruction of his peace and happiness.
               "I found lodgings at once with a kind-hearted old lady, a friend of our family, who having known me from my infancy, would not give credit to the vile slanders against me, and from her I received every care and attention. She had predicted trouble from the moment she heard of my father's second marriage, and was well assured that the whole was a plot of his new wife's, concocted to wean my father's love from me, and thus secure for her own daughter my portion of his fortune.
               "Robert Barton had the insolence to call on me, as soon as he could ascertain where I had gone, and made to me the most infamous proposals, which I need not say, Doctor, were rejected with the scorn they merited; but he had the audacity to threaten that I should see the day when I would be glad to have him renew them.
               "I remained some four or five months with Mrs. Edmonds, when I was one day surprised by a visit from my present husband. He was a young man of respectable parents, who had visited occasionally at our house, and who had always exhibited a marked preference ference for me. Having chosen the sea as his profession, I did not see him very often, but was always favorably impressed with his frank, manly deportment, and was pleased with his evident admiration of myself, which he made no attempt to conceal.
               "He had found me out, somehow; I believe through one of the servants, who had always liked me, and who told him as much as she knew of the occurrences which drove me from my father's house.
               "The change in my position and circumstances had made no change in his affection for me, and at length I yielded to his entreaties, and became his wife. He was a fond and devoted husband, and though he was as poor as myself, I felt proud of his honest, disinterested love, and have striven to make him as happy as I could. As soon as we were married, he proceeded to my father's, and producing the wedding certificate, sought to obtain his renewal of the intercourse with me; but my father insulted him by congratulating him on his marriage with a woman of such exalted character as myself, and refused absolutely ever to acknowledge me as his daughter, unless I would confess, my guilt and ask pardon of his wife.
               "To this, of course, my husband had but one reply to make, and from that time forward no communication tion of any kind has passed between my father and myself. Indeed, I did not know, until you told me, Doctor, that he ever gave me a thought.
               "We prepared then to face the world and its sorrows with courageous hearts, and as I loved him truly and devotedly, I was ready to share his lot, no matter where it might be cast.
               "Soon after my marriage, my husband went to sea, and during his absence, Clarence was born. On his next voyage he was made second mate of the vessel on board which he now is, and which has been gone nearly twelve months. I do not expect him home for a year to come, as he is on a trading voyage, and the half-pay which he left for my support has been cut short for some months by the failure of the firm owning the vessel in which he sailed. He does not know of my present position, for from the character of the voyage, he could not let me know where to direct his letters. However, I do not doubt that I shall get on until he does return, and as he expects to command a vessel on his next voyage, and has promised to take me with him, I shall try and make myself contented until he comes home.
               "And now, Doctor, you know every thing. I have given you a true narrative of the causes which placed me, the daughter of the wealthy Mr. Evarts, as you have found her. I do not doubt that you have been warned to beware of me, and of my arts; that you have been told I am a vile, deceitful woman, unworthy of your kindness or your sympathy; but, as I stand before Heaven, I have told you but the simple truth. I have not told you all I have been compelled to bear and suffer since the failure of the firm from whom I received my husband's half-pay; that was not necessary. You have heard my history; judge now for yourself, if you can believe me worthy of the epithets conferred on me."
               "Mrs. Marvin," I said, as she concluded—and with an earnestness which must have carried conviction of my sincerity—"I believe every word you have said. You have been infamously belied, and cruelly abused and insulted; but with you, I cannot but feel that brighter hours will come. A just Providence will never suffer such wickedness to go unpunished, and in time your triumph over your enemies will be complete. That you have been made the victim of a foul, disgraceful plot, and from mere mercenary motives, I think painfully evident; but how your father could have been induced to join in it against you—how he could be persuaded to condemn his only child—is past my comprehension."
               "Oh, Doctor," she replied, "you little know the artful character of his wife. While feigning the deepest affection for him, she was secretly plotting against his happiness and my peace. Her whole aim has been to secure for Martha that fortune which my poor father, I know, would gladly have divided between us; and, Heaven knows, she would have been welcome to my share if she had let me alone, and suffered me to remain, as I was, happy in the consciousness of my father's love.
               "And now, my dear, kind friend, you must pardon me that I have made you the recipient of this unhappy domestic narrative. I would not have done so, but for the conviction that Mrs. Evarts had essayed to instil prejudices against me into your mind, and to deprive me of so true a friend as you have proved. I am truly grateful for your past kindness, and could not bear the thought that you might deem me so unworthy of it as I had been represented."
               "I thank you for the confidence placed in my friendship. I wish—nay, I intend—to serve you. Now, answer me a few questions. Where are John and Julia, those servants of whom you spoke, to be found?"
               "John is married, and is only at father's during the day-time; he resided somewhere in the upper part of the city. I do not know if he is still in the family. Julia was brought from the south by Mrs. Evarts, and is never in attendance on any one but her; so I doubt if you have ever seen her.
               "John, I have never seen; perhaps she has thought it wisest to get him out of the way. Julia may be reached somehow; I'll try and manage that. Now, as to that scoundrel Barton, have you any idea where he is to be found?"
               "I have, as I said, scarcely heard of him, since he called to make those infamous proposals which I mentioned. I did hear that he had resumed his visits to my father's, probably with a view to an union with Mattie, now she is to become his heiress. He has been to Europe, too; but whether he has returned or not, I do not know. I scarcely think he has, or you would surely have met him there."
               "One thing more. Have you the order for the half-pay left by your husband?"
               "Yes; it is in my trunk." And rising, she unlocked it, and handed the paper to me.
               "Trust this with me for a few days. I will find out the assignees of B. & W., the owners, and I doubt not they will cheerfully pay such a claim, especially when I tell them how much you stand in need of it. Now, this money from your father?"
               "I would not touch one cent of it, knowing the circumstances under which it was sent, if I were starving. Give it back to him in any manner you choose."
               "Well, you are right, perhaps. You may not see me again for two or three days; but, bear in mind, that I shall be working for you. Trust implicitly in me, and, my word for it, you will see happier days. "And, after having received renewed expression of her gratitude for my kindness, I took my leave.
               "I felt, as I left the house, that she was an injured, maligned, and persecuted woman; and I determined, if it was within the range of possibility, to see her restored to her rights. How that was to be accomplished, I had no idea; but there was within me a presentiment of coming good, which I encouraged, but for which I could not account, except that, perhaps, "the wish was father to the thought."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IX.
               THE ORPHAN'S ADVENTURE.
               TURN we now to Julia Seaton and her friend Helen Lee.
               Some three months, perhaps, before her mother's death, there occurred an episode in the life of Julia, which is so directly connected with this narrative, it should properly have been named before. For the omission the reader will pardon me.
               She had been down town with a bundle of vests which her mother and herself had completed, and was on her return home with a small parcel of new work.
               At the junction of Broadway and Grand street, she was in the act of stepping off the curb-stone, when she felt herself seized by the arm, and drawn violently back upon the pavement.
               Before she had time even to think, a baker's wagon, driven at a furious pace, dashed by, and then she saw the danger from which she had been rescued, for another step must have put her life at hazard; and she felt that she had been preserved from the most imminent danger by some unknown hand; for, even as it was, the wheel of the cart grazed her dress, and left the mud-stains on it.
               Trembling with excitement, she turned to thank her preserver, and her eyes met those of a tall, fine looking young man, some four or five and twenty years of age, who still held her arm, and who, as she turned, dropped his hand from her arm, and raising his hat, politely, and with great respect, said, "I hope, miss, you will excuse my rudeness, but really I had no time for ceremony then."
               "I am too thankful for your kindness and appreciate your bravery too highly to require any apology. From my heart, I thank you sir;" and she extended her hand with candid frankness and sincerity to him whom she looked upon as her preserver.
               "Take my arm a few moments, miss," he said, "you are weak from fright, and tremble very much; let me assist you until you recover yourself a little;" and he tendered his arm so courteously, that Julia, who really needed some support, could not refuse, and placing her arm within his own, she moved slowly on, pondering how she could again express her thanks for her companion's politeness and gallantry.
               "Allow me to take that bundle," he said, at the same time taking from her reluctant hand the small parcel she was carrying, "now, lean on me; really, you tremble so, you require some support; do not be afraid."
               Julia had not yet fully recovered her consciousness, and silently walked on, pale, and trembling in every limb.
               Her companion strove to divert her thoughts from the danger she had incurred, and conversed rather at, than with her for some time, she answering only in monosyllables, but by the time they had walked some four or five blocks, she had recovered her strength and composure, and was enabled at last to understand where she was, and what was said to her.
               She was walking arm-in-arm with a handsome, fashionably-dressed young man, who was striving to interest her by his conversation, and certainly it seemed to her that she had never heard any one converse so fluently or so pleasantly.
               It was not long before Julia almost forgot the danger she had incurred in the interest she took in the conversation of her companion, who strove to make her feel at ease, and appeared to take an interest in her. He spoke of almost every subject but himself, and drew from her a brief history of her position and circumstances, and before she knew it, so rapidly and pleasantly had the time passed in the society of her companion, she was at her own door.
               Quietly dropping his arm, (and she blushed at the thought that she had held it so long), she stretched out her hand for the parcel, which he still retained, but instead of tendering it to her, he took her extended hand, as if he had mistaken her motion, and retaining it while he spoke, said, "May I not hope to meet again one who has interested me so much?"
               Julia, blushing and pleased, yet half doubting, replied, "I shall always be happy to see one to whom I am so much indebted, but my home has no attractions for you."
               "I need not your home to attract me," he said, with a glance which she could not mistake, and which brought a deeper blush to her cheek and brow.
               "Do you often go down town?" he said, changing the current of her thoughts so suddenly, she answered without a thought,
               "Oh yes; I go down every Wednesday afternoon, to take home my work."
               "Indeed, and for whom do you work?"
               
               "For Mr. ——, in Broadway."
               "Oh, thank you; I shall be very sure to see you; and now one favor before I leave you—may I know your name?"
               "Julia Seaton," she replied, her eyes sinking beneath his burning glances.
               "Then, Miss Seaton, I wish you a very good day until I have the pleasure of seeing you again," and pressing the hand which she had unconsciously suffered to remain within his own, he turned and left her.
               In a moment Julia was in the house, ran up stairs, and throwing the parcel upon the bed, sank into a chair without stopping to take off her hat, and was soon lost in a reverie, from which she was only awakened by the steam whistle of a neighboring manufactory, which warned her that it was six o'clock. Fortunately her mother had that day gone to visit a sick friend, taking her work with her, and there was no one to notice her singular conduct.
               Was it possible!—she had been nearly two hours sitting there with her hat on. Who can tell what were her thoughts, and what fairy dreams floated through her excited brain?
               "I must make up for this," she said to herself, arising and going to the little looking-glass, which showed a very pretty face with a heightened color, and eyes sparkling with unwonted animation, "I must make up for this," and undoing her bundle of vests, she seated herself at her work, and plied her needle with a zeal and industry unwonted even for her. But ever and anon she would pause in her work, and laying the garment on her lap, gave way to her thoughts, and suddenly seeming to recollect herself, she would blush and smile, and resume her work, at which she continued until the twilight set in and warned her to prepare for tea, for her mother promised to be at home in season for that meal.
               But, to shorten this part of my story, it is only necessary to say, that the young gentleman was particular to be on the look out on the following Wednesday, and for many other Wednesdays, until it became a part of her existence to see him.
               He was so polite—so attentive—so respectful, and he so evidently admired her, she could not be insensible to him, and step by step she went on, until every feeling of her heart was engrossed by the handsome stranger who had preserved her life.
               She gave to him her whole heart. She confided to him her history. She made him the recipient of her hopes and fears, her joys and sorrows, and he sympathised with her so warmly when she spoke of her apprehension of losing her only parent, she was almost ready to fall down and worship him.
               Matters continued thus until after her mother's death, and then his presence became dearer and more necessary to her than ever—for was she not alone in the world, and did she not need some one on whose love and sympathy she could lean?
               He said his name was Robert Marston—that he was a student at law, and hoped yet to make his share of noise in the world, and when he spoke, Julia felt that he must in time be a great man, for in the simplicity of her heart, she clothed him with all the attributes of goodness and greatness combined.
               As yet he had never made his appearance in her house. He had always some excuse for not being introduced to her mother, and the poor, fond fool believed him.
               After her mother's death, he continued to meet her as usual, and was more tender, more devoted, more affectionate than ever. He had, too, since that event, spoken more plainly of his intentions—which were, as soon as he was admitted to the bar, to make her his wife. He had not much to live on, but, as he laughingly said, it did not cost half as much to support a prudent, industrious wife, as it did one fashionable vice, and he would give up all his follies and vices for her dear sake.
               Oh, how happy she was, and how cheerfully she worked and sang all the day long! yes, reader, sang, for her all-absorbing love for Robert Marston had completely neutralized her deep grief for her mother's death; and why not?—she no longer felt alone in the world, she had a strong and willing arm on which to lean for support and protection, she had a loving heart in which to pour all her joys and sorrows—in fine, she loved him with an intensity, an exclusiveness, a devotion, which changed her very nature, and made her all love.
               Their meetings had not been confined to the days on which she went to and returned from the shop for which she worked, when he was always sure to join her, but she would steal out on pleasant evenings to keep appointments with him, and listen to his protestations of changeless devotion—building castles of love, home, and happiness with the idol of her young heart.
               One evening they had been walking, and returned rather earlier than had been his wont, and for the first time he insisted on inviting himself to her room. Glancing upwards as she neared the house, she saw that Helen's room was not lighted, and at once conjectured that she had retired; so that the fear of detection being removed, at least so far as her friend was concerned, she consented that he should pass the remainder of the evening in her apartment. How long he had remained there neither exactly knew; but they were disturbed in the midst of their conversation by a gentle tap at the door, in answer to which Julia unthinkingly invited the visitor to come in; and Helen opened the door gently, saying, at the same time, "Did you say come in, dear?"
               "Come in, Helen, come in. It is only a friend of mine, to whom I am under many obligations," she said, hastily, and coloring to the very roots of her hair. "Mr. Marston, Miss Lee," she added, turning to her companion, thus completing the introduction.
               But he paid no attention to her words. At the sound of Helen's voice he remained rooted and motionless in his chair. The blood left his face until it was of an ashy whiteness, and he seemed like one suddenly paralyzed.
               Julia turned an inquiring glance at him, and then upon Helen; but if her surprise was great at Mr. Marston's conduct, it was heightened by that of Helen Lee.
               She stood before him, within an arm's length, mute and motionless, her eyes fixed upon him with an expression which it would be impossible to convey by any words; and with her right arm extended, her outstretched hand pointing towards him, she seemed as though frozen into a statue.
               Julia Seaton turned from one to the other with wonder and amazement, at this incomprehensible scene; but at length she broke the silence by moving towards Helen, and exclaiming, "In God's name, Helen, what does this mean?"
               "Mean! mean!" said Helen, sternly, never removing her eyes from the miserable object before her, and still pointing at him with an air and expression of scorn, hatred and despair, "mean, why, that he is the foulest, vilest villain that ever disgraced humanity; it means that he dare not look me in the face, and say that I do not speak the truth."
               "It means, that if he is a friend of yours, fate could give you no greater curse than his friendship. If he has dared to say he loves you, and I have no doubt he has, he is a vile infamous traitor to honor and decency. Out upon you, Robert Barton, out upon you, and do not dare to think you may repeat your triumphs here," and she moved towards Julia, clasping her waist with one hand, and keeping the other still pointed at the trembling coward who writhed beneath her just rebuke, and quailed beneath the glance of injured and insulted innocence.
               "It means, Julia," she continued, pressing the affrighted girl to her side, "that he has broken my parent's hearts; that he has brought ruin, infamy and disgrace upon a happy home; that he has turned an unprotected girl, whom he had foully wronged, from her parent's home, followed by a parent's curse; it means, that he has doomed to a life of poverty, sorrow and remorse, one whom he swore to love, cherish and protect; it means, Julia, that promising marriage to a loving, trusting girl, he basely ruined her, cowardly deserted her, and has dared to think that his wickedness would go unpunished. He would make Julia Seaton what he has made Helen Lee.
               "Leave this room, sir," she continued, with a stamp of her foot and a menacing gesture, "the air here is too pure for you to breathe," and she advanced towards him, while the affrighted Julia clung closer to her—"your presence, pollutes the very atmosphere mosphere—leave this room, sir, and let me tell this dear unprotected orphan what I know of her friend. Begone, I say," she added, stamping her foot impatiently, and without a single word of reply or remonstrance, he slowly left the apartment, and the girls were alone.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER X.
               A GENTLEMAN'S REVENGE.
               ROBERT BARTON moved along mechanically after he left the house, for he had been completely stunned by the sudden and unexpected discovery he had made.
               A few blocks, however, of walking enabled him to collect his thoughts, and he muttered to himself threats of the direst vengeance against the detector of his former villainy, swearing a bitter oath that he would bring them both so low, they should yet be glad to receive even charity from him; and unfortunately, with his evil inclinations and intentions, he had the means of carrying his threats into operation.
               On the next occasion when Julia returned her work to the store, Helen accompanied her at her own request, lest, as she feared, Barton might accost, and perhaps insult her; and, as they neared the place, they cast furtive but eager glances about, to see if he was in the vicinity; but there was no indication that he was near, and they entered the store together.
               Julia, as was her custom, handed in her work with her pass-book, for it was the regular pay day; and when the clerk had made the necessary entries and additions, he laid down her money, and putting the book towards her, turned away.
               "You have not given me any work, Mr. Farmer," she said, thinking he had accidentally omitted to do so.
               "I have orders not to give you any more work, Miss Seaton," he replied, coldly, and with the barest possible approach to a sneer, which brought the blood to poor Julia's face, from which in a moment it, rushed to her heart, which seemed as if it must burst.
               "No more work," she tremblingly said—"is there any reason for that? I am sure I am punctual, and is not my work well done?"
               "I never ask questions of my employers, Miss; I obey orders, and that is enough for me."
               "But it is not enough for her, Sir," said Helen, stepping up—"there must be some cause for such an order. Why should Mr. Edwards wish to deprive an orphan of her only means of earning a livelihood? We must see Mr. Edwards."
               "We need not trouble ourselves, Miss," said the clerk, with a very decided look of contempt; "I have had my orders, and I must obey them."
               "I must see Mr. Edwards," said Julia, taking up the idea which Helen had started—"he cannot be so unjust—so cruel—so illiberal. What have I done, that he will not allow me even to work for him? I must see him, and," she added with bitter emphasis, "I will see him."
               "You will have to wait some time then, I am afraid, for he left this morning for Newport; and here is his written order, the last I received from him;" and he handed her a hastily-written scrawl, which he took from the drawer, and which she rapidly glanced over.
               "Why, Helen, you are included too, in case you should ask for work. There is something more here than meets the eye."
               "Me!" said Helen, impetuously snatching the note, and hastily scanning its contents—"he might at least have waited until I had asked for work."
               "I only obey orders, young woman," said the clerk, very decidedly—"I did not know you, Miss Lee, or——"
               "Of course not, Sir," she interrupted—"you could not well know me, as you never saw me; and I should really like to know why I am included in the banns?"
               "Oh, I have it," she said, after a momentary pause, a gleam of intelligence lighting up her pale face—"I see 
                     throught
                     through
                   it now. Come, Julia, there is no use in waiting here, even if we could see Mr. Edwards—come. But," she said, turning to the clerk, "I do not think Mr. Edwards will sleep the easier or more quietly for having deprived two helpless females of the means of earning an honest livelihood, to gratify the malice of any one."
               "What did you mean, Helen," said Julia, when they had regained the street.
               "Can't you read the riddle, dear? Why it is Barton's work. He was foiled in his efforts to ruin you one way, and he means to do it in another."
               "Good God! can it be possible," exclaimed Julia; "can any man be so mean—so base?"
               "Not only possible, but true, my life on it. But come; there's no use in despairing; he can't go to all the shops in New-York, and you can get work where I do. Go over there with me; Mr. Graham is human, at least; he won't descend quite so low I think in meanness as Mr. Edwards, although he is the richer man of the two."
               "You measure a man's meanness by his wealth, dear?" said Julia, inquiringly.
               "It is a fair standard in some cases, especially with those who employ female operatives. The more they gain, the more ready they are to cut down the prices of their workmen. That is my experience, and if you have not learned that lesson yet, you had better begin at once."
               And they passed on to Mr. Graham's store, which was situated on the Bowery, which they entered in full confidence of being treated there with ordinary humanity and civility, and on the part of Helen, with the certainty of procuring work for Julia.
               In this she was successful, and as they left the store, Julia fairly hugging her bundle to her, Helen strove to raise her spirits by the assurance that Mr. Barton could never have any influence in Mr. Graham's store. He was a kind-hearted, charitable, christian man, whose munificent donations to almost every charity in the city, had been blazoned abroad through every newspaper in which it was worth while to have one's name mentioned.
               "Now, Julia," said Helen, with a very faint attempt at a smile, "I suppose we may put Mr. Barton at defiance, but—"
               "Oh, pray don't say but. It is an awful word, and carries awful meanings. It is the dividing mark between promise and fulfillment—between anticipation and reality. I would,—but—I wish to—but. Don't say but, dear—say the worst—let the worst come, I do not fear it. I am alone and unprotected, but—and Julia faintly smiled too as she caught herself using the forbidden word," I do not fear, and will not despair. I do not forget—I never can forget my dear mother's last words."
               "And what were they, Julia?" inquired Helen, turning eagerly to her companion.
               "Trust in God, and lead a virtuous life," said Julia, with solemnity, for the remembrance of the terrible circumstances under which these words were spoken, was fresh in her mind, and her present circumstances caused the remembrance of those words to make a deeper impression than they ever had before, even in the sad hour in which they were spoken. Helen turned away with an expression so sad, so sorrowful, so agonizing, Julia would have regretted that she uttered the words, could she have seen it, but she made no reply. They soon reached home, and after an hour of quiet, but pleasant intercourse, they separated for the night.
            
            
               CHAPTER XI.
               HUSBAND AND WIFE.
               THE occurrences detailed in a portion of the last chapter but one, occurred shortly after my last interview with Mrs. Marvin.
               I was called to a patient in the house where Julia Seaton resided, and as I ascended the stairs, he was in the act of leaving her apartment, the light from which shone so full upon his face, I could distinguish plainly not only the deathly pallor of his countenance, but the expression of devilish malignity which crossed it as he closed the door.
               As I had not seen Julia since her mother's death, I determined to pay her a call, and having concluded the visit to my patient, I knocked at her door, which was opened by Julia herself.
               She recognised me on the instant, and appeared very glad to see me, introducing me to her friend, Helen, as one to whom she was under many obligations.
               I saw that her eyes were red with weeping, while Helen, (who, by the way, I had only seen before occasionally as I passed in and out of the house while attending Mrs. Seaton, and who had stopped me two or three times to inquire after my patient), was excessively pale, and apparently laboring under some terrible excitement.
               I felt that I had some claim upon Julia, and did not hesitate to ask the cause.
               Her reply, after interchanging glances with Helen, and receiving her assent, was the brief narrative which I have given above. I listened patiently, and turning to Helen, asked by what name he was married to her, (for a ceremony had been performed, which afterwards, when he had wearied of her, he declared was a sham), and she replied, "Robert Barton."
               At these words, I felt the blood coursing through my veins with tremendous rapidity, but concealing my emotion, I asked where she had met him?
               "In Otsego county, where my father is a farmer of wealth and high standing; he was there passing the summer in fishing and gunning, and boarded at a neighbor's, within a few yards of my father's house."
               "Where was this ceremony performed?"
               "In New-York. He persuaded me to elope with him, my parents having absolutely forbidden his further visits to our house."
               "Was there no certificate given?"
               "Oh, yes; but he took that to keep for me, tho' I have no doubt, the certificate was no more genuine than the marriage."
               It is not necessary to detail the further conversation I had with the unhappy victims of this infamous villain. I did not give them any intimation which might lead them to believe I had ever heard of Mr. Barton, and kept my own counsels, well assured, that if it was the Robert Barton, whose true character I was so anxious to discover, I should learn it in due time.
               I bade them to feel no apprehension from him for the future, and took my leave with a heart filled with the most joyous anticipations, for here was one clue which might enable me to thread the labyrinth through which Mrs. Evarts had reached the goal of her desires.
               My first care on the following morning was to proceed to the store of Messrs. B & B., owners of the Omega, on board which Marvin was mate, and having ascertained the name of their assignees, I went at once to their office.
               I laid the case of Mrs. Marvin plainly before them, and had the satisfaction of receiving not only his back pay, amounting to some seventy dollars, but their acceptance of the order for the regular payment until the vessel should return.
               This was a source of great satisfaction to me, for I knew that while it placed her above absolute want, she could, by her needle, earn enough for the comfortable subsistence of herself and child.
               That I was favorably—nay, more than favorably impressed with Mrs. Marvin, I make no denial—I was deeply interested in her welfare, and fully believed her to be the victim of a nefarious plot. To ferret that out, I determined to lend all my energies; and I resolved to follow out cautiously, but perseveringly, the clue afforded by the discovery of Barton's villainy. I well knew that one who had the shrewdness and cunning to devise and carry out such plans as those laid so successfully by Mrs. Evarts, was also shrewd enough to place herself beyond the reach of suspicion or discovery, and the inevitable consequences. I must work therefore cautiously; for if once she entertained an inkling of my suspicions, she would doubtless interpose every possible obstacle to any further movement on my part.
               It was a very busy day with me, so that it was quite dark when I reached my office, and as I entered tered, I observed a gentleman seated in my armchair, his head buried in his hands, and his elbows resting on the table.
               "Ah, Doctor," said my visitor, raising his head, and I recognised the voice at once as that of Mr. Evarts, though it was so dark I could not distinguish his features, "I am glad you have come—I have been waiting some time for you."
               "I am sorry to have kept you waiting," I said, proceeding to light the gas; and turning to him, I saw that he was ghastly pale, and very much excited.
               "Oh, not long—I have not been here more than an hour."
               "An hour!" thought I, and his words satisfied me that the father, after all, predominated over the man.
               "But it's no matter. Have you seen her?" for he would not mention the name of "daughter."
               "I have—I saw her the day before yesterday afternoon."
               "And did you give that money to her?"
               "I offered it to her, but she absolutely refused to touch one cent of it. Indeed, she seemed hurt and offended that I should have taken the liberty of using her name and mentioning her circumstances at all; and all my efforts to persuade her to take it were in vain."
               
               "What reasons did she give?"
               "Simply that there were others much more destitute than herself, and that the sum intended for her, would relieve them from absolute suffering, while she was able to earn at least a living."
               "Noble—generous," he said; then suddenly checking himself—"then she is not really destitute?" he inquired, with affectionate earnestness.
               "Oh, no, Mr. Evarts—so far from that, I have only this day arranged with the assignees of B. & W. that she shall receive the half pay which her husband left; and they have paid me some seventy dollars which had become due since the failure of the owners. She did not know how to arrange such matters, but I had no difficulty whatever."
               "Doctor," said Mr. Evarts, after a pause of some moments, and drawing his hand across his forehead, as if to collect his thoughts, "you have known my—I mean Mrs. Marvin—some time now?"
               "Between five and six weeks."
               "You see her frequently?"
               "Hitherto I have, professionally. I saw her daily for two or three weeks, and have visited her several times since her child's recovery."
               "And what is your candid opinion of her?"
               "May I speak with perfect plainness?"
               "I have asked the question, sir."
               "Then, sir, my honest opinion is, that you and your daughter are the victims of a deep-laid plot to—"
               "Stop, stop—that will do, Doctor," he said, rising, his countenance flushing with excitement—"I cannot hear such language. My wife is a virtuous, high-minded, affectionate woman, and as incapable of plotting or scheming against me or mine, as any one could be. You take advantage, sir, of my confidence in you, by the use of such language;" and as I saw that he was seriously hurt, I merely bowed as if in assent to his right thus to check me, and said nothing.
               "We will change the subject, Doctor," he said, with an effort at a smile. "I am obliged to you for your care of, and interest in my—Mrs. Marvin, and can only regret the failure of your mission. I am glad, however, to hear that she is not likely to suffer."
               "Not while I live, and am able to prevent it," I said, with an earnestness which caused him to look upon me with a searching glance.
               "Come around soon, Doctor. You will meet a nephew of mine, or rather of my wife, who I think would be a pleasant acquaintance. He returned from Europe some months since, but his evenings have been engrossed in business until now, and I think you have never met him there. I don't know that you have ever heard of him. His name is Barton—Robert Barton, the son of a highly respectable southern planter, as my wife informs me."
               "I never have," I said, scarce concealing my joy at the possibility of meeting the person whom I was so anxious to see.
               "He was principal book-keeper in a large house down town, which engrossed all his evenings; but as I think he and Mattie are making up a match, I have some thoughts of taking him in with me."
               "If you do," I said, mentally, "and he don't take you in, I shall be egregiously mistaken;" but I merely bowed to his remark, and promising an early call, he took his leave.
               You may rely upon it, reader, I did not leave that invitation long unheeded.
               On the following morning I sent the seventy dollars to Mrs. Marvin, with a brief note, informing her that she would thenceforth receive her half-pay regularly through me, and added that it might be some days before I saw her again.
               A few evenings afterwards I paid my promised call at Mr. Evarts' and, in added to the usual family, was introduced to "my wife's nephew," the veritable Robert Barton, whom I had seen coming from the room of Julia Seaton, and with whom the reader is already partially acquainted.
               He was a tall, fine-looking young man, easy and graceful in his manner, and with an air of frankness and candor which might deceive a saint.
               The manner in which he met me on our introduction, convinced me that he had been well "posted up" by mother and daughter; and I had really some difficulty in convincing myself that he was not one of the most sincere, open-hearted, and generous-minded men in existence.
               But he was Robert Barton—the Robert Barton of Cora Evarts—the Robert Barton of Helen Lee and of Julia Seaton—and I was proof against him.
               Of course I was as polite as himself; and I don't know but I went more than half way to meet him. Mrs. Evarts and Martha looked upon our growing intimacy with evident pleasure, and this very fact served to confirm my suspicions as to the trio.
               Mrs. Evarts was more than usually gracious, and Mattie made no scruple of exhibiting her very marked appreciation of myself, though I could not perceive that it caused any uneasiness to Mr. Barton, which would have been natural, if Mr. Evarts was correct in his surmises as to their position.
               
               Very soon after tea, Mr. Barton and Mr. Evarts excused themselves on the plea of business, and soon after they had gone, Mattie left the room, so that Mrs. Evarts and myself were alone.
               I was well convinced this was a premeditated scheme, and it was not long before my suspicions were confirmed.
               After a few minutes of general conversation, Mrs. Evarts drew her chair closer to my own, and with an air of confidential intimacy, inquired, "have you seen that unfortunate young woman, Doctor, since our interview?"
               I was fully prepared for this question, and without hesitation answered, "yes, Madam; I have seen her occasionally, on account of her child, who has been ailing."
               "You have reflected, no doubt, on what I told you, Doctor?"
               "Frequently, Madam. I could not fail to be grateful for the kind interest you took in me, a comparative stranger, and have endeavored to profit by your advice and warning."
               "Do you not think her a very remarkable woman?"
               "Very, indeed," I replied, rather impetuously, without giving her time to finish her sentence.
               "I mean do you not find what I said of her to be true? that she is an artful, deceitful woman?"
               "I must confess I was very much disappointed in her," I answered, equivocally.
               "I knew it could not be otherwise. Once you were put on your guard against the impulses of your too generous heart, you could not fail to discover her true character. I am really glad I had it in my power, and had sufficient confidence in you, to warn you against her arts.
               I dared not trust myself to any reply, and merely bowed, a movement which she might construe as she chose best.
               "But, Doctor," she continued, with well-feigned earnestness, and drawing her chair still closer to me, at the same turning towards the door, as if to make sure she could not be overheard, "I have that to tell you, which will surprise even you. You will hardly believe her capable of such baseness, but I have reason to know, that she has already boasted of her influence over you; for I know that she has given you her version of the causes which led to the separation from her family—" and she paused, leaning back in her chair, watching my countenance to observe the effect her words had upon me.
               I was so completely taken by surprise at her last words, the color mounted to my cheeks, and I could feel my very ears tingling; and this, to a woman of her perception, was a virtual acknowledgment that what she had said was true.
               I saw by her glance that she read my very thoughts, and, cursing my stupidity, I was fain to slip into the net spread for me. In truth, I did not believe she had ever heard a word, directly or indirectly, from or of Mrs. Marvin; but my blushes had betrayed me, and I was measurably at her mercy.
               "Yes, doctor, and she has boasted openly that her influence over you was so unbounded, you would do anything she required. I am afraid, doctor, you have not heeded all I said to you the other morning."
               "It is a wicked lie, madam," I said, referring to her own words; but she applied my remark as I knew she would, to the assertion of Mrs. Marvin's influence over me, and I steered clear of that. "I confess that I am much disappointed in the woman."
               "I knew you would be," she said, not waiting for me to finish the sentence; "it could not be otherwise. Heaven knows," continued she, with an affectation of humility and sorrow, "how I loved that girl, and what efforts I made to screen her from the consequences of her own acts; but she was so impetuous —so headstrong—so passionate—she would not appreciate my motives. Poor Barton! it was a long time before I could coax him into the house; but now Mr. Evarts has discovered his true character, he is as much attached to him as if he was his own son."
               "Indeed," I thought—but not aloud—"perhaps when he learns a little more of the truth, his attachment may not be quite so strong;" but I said, "he appears to be an uncommonly fine young man."
               "Indeed, he is; and worthy of all the friendship you may bestow upon him. I am not ashamed to say, I like him—not alone because he is my nephew, but——"
               "Because he is likely to become your son," I said, smiling; and, as she smiled without making any reply, I was satisfied with her meaning.
               "Is the poor thing entirely destitute, Doctor?" she inquired, with an appearance of deep interest.
               "Oh, by no means," I said, unthinkingly; "I have succeeded in securing for her not only her husband's half-pay, but some seventy dollars of arrearages due."
               "Indeed!—then she has made some use of your friendship," she said, with the slightest tinge of sarcasm in her tone.
               
               "Oh, not at all," I said, and I could have bit my tongue off for my folly, "it was a mere matter of humanity. Surely, remembering your kindness, and the interest you have taken in me, I could not be so ungrateful as to be influenced by one who bears you no love."
               This soothed and pacified her; and after a few minutes passed in general conversation, Mattie returned, and the evening was passed in apparent pleasure—for I strove to make myself forget what an ass I had been in suffering Mrs. Evarts to worm from me so much as she had done.
               The gentlemen did not return until a late hour; and receiving pressing invitations from mother and daughter to make my calls more frequent, with the assurance that they would always be welcome, I took my leave.
               A few days after this visit, I received an anonymous letter, warning me that my visits to Mrs. Marvin's were well known, and that it was equally well known that my professional services were not required. I was cautioned to desist from them if I valued my future character and prospects, and the writer assured me that it had been the topic of conversation already among my friends.
               This "weak invention of the enemy," which I attributed to Mrs. Evarts, served to light a segar, and all thoughts of it passed from my mind. Of course I carefully avoided any mention of it to Mrs. Marvin, as I had no desire to wound her feelings by any unnecessary allusion to a subject so painful.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XII.
               A DISCOVERY.
               MATTERS proceeded quietly for a few weeks, during which nothing occurred from which I might glean any information useful to Mrs. Marvin.
               I visited her occasionally, and was always received as a valued friend. No allusion was made to the circumstances detailed in the previous chapters, except when I mentioned my meeting Mr. Barton at Julia Seaton's, and my subsequent introduction to him at Mr. Evarts.'
               Julia and Helen I continued also to see, and was glad to learn that Barton had not made any new attempt to see Julia, or to annoy her by his attentions, although his attempt to deprive them of employment had compelled me to believe him capable of any thing.
               I was in the habit of calling at Mr. Evarts' at least once in each week, and I always found Barton there, who received me in the frankest and most cordial manner; and when we met, as we did occasionally sionally by chance in the street, he evinced the greatest desire to court my intimacy.
               Mrs. Evarts and Mattie treated me with their wonted kindness; and but for the certain conviction I had of their iniquity, I could have enjoyed their society, for they were well-informed and agreeable.
               Mrs. Marvin's name, of course, never passed my lips, and no allusion was made to her by any member of the family. I knew that any attempt to force a discovery would end in my discomfiture, and probably bring additional trouble on her, so I prudently left it to time and Providence to set her aright.
               One day, by invitation of an intimate medical friend, I accompanied him to see a patient, the character of whose disease was so singular as to be almost an exception in ordinary practice.
               On reaching the house, which was in the upper and eastern section of the city, my surprise and delight may be imagined, when I discovered in the patient, John, the servant of Mr. Evarts, who had been suborned to perjure himself against his master's daughter.
               He knew me well, and was much pleased to see me; asking after the family, and showing that he was aware of the intimate footing on which I stood towards them. In answer to my question why I had not been sent for, as he knew I was Mr. Evarts' family physician, he answered, without thinking, that Dr. D——, my friend, had been sent by Mrs. Evarts. This at once let me into the secret that she feared I might discover from John some things which she would prefer to conceal from me.
               My plans were rapidly laid; and after examining his case professionally, I called Dr. D—— into another room, as if for the purpose of a consultation, and briefly made known to him the condition of things, so far as John was concerned. He readily assented to aid me in my wishes; and returning to our patient, we found him in a high state of nervous excitement, for he was dreadfully frightened at the idea of having a consultation over his case.
               Putting on an air of solemnity befitting the part I was playing, I told him that his disease was of a complicated and most serious character, in which Dr. D—— coincided. That the utmost care would be required on our part to insure his recovery, but that every thing in our power would be done to serve him.
               He promised implicit obedience to our directions, and I agreed to give Dr. D—— the benefit of my aid and counsel, on condition that he should not mention the fact of my being employed by Mrs. Evarts, as she would, doubtless, be very angry to find that he had not reposed full confidence in the physician provided by herself.
               John and his wife promised ready compliance with this or any other condition I might impose, for they were both dreadfully alarmed; and having prescribed some very simple and harmless medicine, we took our leave.
               On our way down in Dr. D——'s gig, I narrated to him enough of Mrs. Marvin's history to interest him deeply, and his hearty co-operation was cheerfully promised. He consented to let me have my own way with his patient, and, as well as myself, was quite sanguine that some good would come out of this evil after all.
               This day was doomed to be one of uncommon adventure. It was nearly the hour for dinner when we reached my friend's house, and he pressed me so earnestly to join him, I consented; and it did not cost much of an effort, for I was in the daily practice of taking my meals at the nearest restaurant where I chanced to be at the time, and to any thing like home-comfort I was an absolute stranger.
               Mrs. D—— had gone to pass the day alone with a friend, so we had a bachelor's dinner, and a pleasant talk over old times, there being no one to overhear us but Dinah, an old negro woman, employed as cook and general maid of all work, who was waiting on the table.
               While she was clearing away the dishes and we were preparing for our punch and segars, D—— said to me,
               "Come—give me some more of the history of your protege. Two head's are better than one, if one is a pin's head; who knows what service I may be enabled to render you; of course, it shall be in strict confidence."
               Thus assured, I gave him a detailed history of Mr. Evarts, his marriage, his cruelty to his daughter, and her present condition, not forgetting to give Mrs. Evarts due credit for her agency in the matter.
               "Who was this Jezabel," he asked, "before she had the good fortune to hook so fine a prize?"
               "A Mrs. Main; they met at Savannah, in the same boarding-house; she spread her net, and caught him, but as to who or what she was before, I don't believe Evarts knows any more than myself."
               A low "yah-yah-yah" from Dinah, caused me to turn my head, and I saw her mouth stretched from ear to ear, displaying her toothless gums, while her whole frame was quivering with the laughter she was trying to suppress.
               "Why, Dinah, what on earth ails you?" said her master, "are you sick? Here, take a glass of whiskey—that's your standard remedy;" and he poured out for her half a tumbler of the raw material, which she drained at a draught, wiping her mouth with her apron.
               "Come, Dinah, out with it; that darkey knows something," he said; "speak up, Aunty—don't be afraid."
               "Afeard—I guess I'd like to know who's afeard. I does know suthing, and I aint afeard to tell it. I guess I knows Ma'am Main, as well any other nigger. I wonder if dis nigger did'nt live with her five years down in Alabama. Ma'am Main, indeed—afeard of Ma'am Main?" and she looked at the whiskey-bottle with such longing eyes, Dr. D——, with a wink to me, poured out another half-tumbler, which went the way of the first.
               "That will loosen the muscles of her tongue," he said, laughing, as Dinah set down the glass.
               "Come, now, Dinah, tell us what you do know about Ma'am Main," I said, slipping a gold piece into her ready palm, and without more ado, she did tell us.
               What was the nature of her information, it is not necessary to mention now; but it caused me to feel that the hand of Divine Providence had been interposed posed in behalf of the injured and persecuted daughter of a most unhappy father. Dinah had indeed lived with Ma'am Main, and to some purpose, and was familiar with events in her life, which——. But no more at present.
               "Now, Dinah," said D——, as she concluded, "you know I have been kind and indulgent to you, and don't scold you, when you get too much whiskey on board, because I like you."
               "Dat you is a fust-rate man," she said, her eyes sparkling with animation at this praise, and the whiskey combined.
               "Well, then, you mustn't breath a word of this to a single human being, 'till I tell you; you hear?"
               "Sartin. Dey don't get nuffin out of dis nigger. Mind you, massa, all I said am de trute—ebery word, and Ma'am Main duss'nt say it wa'n't;" and she sailed out of the room with a gait marvellously unsteady, for she had drank a full half-pint of raw whiskey.
               "Dr. D—— and I remained silent for a few moments. As for myself, I don't believe I could have spoken rationally then on any subject, so highly was I excited at what I had just heard.
               I could not repress my desire to be moving about, though I had no earthly object in view. In fact, I was for the nonce, a little touched, I think, in the upper story, so marvellous had been the narrative which I had heard, and so certain of the consequences which I knew would ensue on its being made known in proper quarters.
               Bidding my friend a good-day—first heartily thanking him for the assistance he had so unwittingly rendered, in a matter so deeply interesting to myself, I took my leave, and went about my routine business.
               I am afraid I made some sad mistakes that day. In fact I know of a violent emetic having been administered to a patient, which I am sure I never prescribed, but which I was compelled to acknowledge, when my own writing was exhibited to me.
               My first resolve, after leaving Dr. D——'s, had been to go direct to Mrs. Marvin's, and make her acquainted with the occurrences of the day—and I pictured to myself her cheeks flushed with pleasure, her eyes sparkling with delight, and her frame trembling with excitement, as she listened to me; but second thoughts prevailed.
               I realized painfully that the denouement must be much farther off than my heated imagination had first proposed; and to excite expectations in her which might not be realized for months, if indeed at all, would have been but the refinement of cruelty; for "hope deferred maketh the heart sick."
               I therefore kept my own counsel; and, having closed the duties of the day, retired to my office, and smoked my cigar with unwonted gusto, for I felt that I had accomplished much indeed, though the actual result of my labors might be far off.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIII.
               MR. BARTON'S ADVENTURE.
               THE same night, as I was in the act of retiring, my office-bell was rung violently, and, on admitting the visitor, I found him to be a servant with a note from Mr. Barton, requesting me to call around immediately, but without stating the purpose of his call.
               Throwing on my cloak, I followed the man, and was soon at his apartments; an elegantly-furnished suite of rooms in Bleecker-street.
               I found him with two shocking black eyes, and some severe cuts about his face, the evident consequences of a hard fist well planted on his head.
               "In the name of goodness, Mr. Barton," I said, "where have you been, and what have you been doing, to get such a pair of black eyes?"
               "Go on, and fix me up, Doctor, and I will tell you all about it."
               Accordingly, I lanced his eyes, and having ordered some raw oysters to be placed over them, dressed the other cuts about his face; and, while thus engaged, he told me that during the evening he was at a well-known restaurant with a friend, and, after having their supper, they stood at the bar waiting for the change, engaged in conversation.
               While thus engaged, a tall, brawny-looking man, having the appearance of a sailor, though he was well dressed, came up to him, and asked him if his name was Mr. Barton, to which he replied in the affirmative, and without a word he went at him, and before he had time to put himself on his guard, beat him most terribly, as I could see for myself.
               "Well, that was strange," I said; "did you ever see him before?"
               "No; and I don't know now who he is, or what earthly cause he had for attacking me. As soon as he was taken off, for he was nearly twice as large as myself, I gave him in charge to the police, and he was taken to the Tombs."
               "Now, I want you to do me a favor, Doctor," he continued; "I don't want to prosecute the poor devil, though I could send him to the 'Island' for this; will you go to the Tombs in the morning, for me, for I would not go out with this face for an hundred dollars, and just whisper to the magistrate what I have told you. I won't prosecute him, but just have him bound over to keep the peace. He can't get bail, I am sure, and a few days in the cells there will cure him of his fighting propensity. As soon as I can get out, I will go and have him let out myself, on his own surety."
               Of course, I promised to do as he desired, and was about to take my leave, when he called me back, and raising one of the poultices from his swollen eye, said, "Doctor, you must manage this at the house for me. I wouldn't have the old gentleman see me with a pair of black eyes for half New-York. Make it a bilious fever, or any thing you like; but if any of them talk of coming to see me, do you forbid it, professionally. You take, eh?"
               "Oh, perfectly;" and with an inward chuckle, I took my leave; for really I was at heart not at all sorry that he had got his just desert, for I had then no doubt that he had been trying to play the bully over some one whom he thought was a safe customer, and had caught a Tartar.
               I did not believe a word of his sailor story; but as I had promised, and to satisfy my own curiosity, I meant to keep my promise, and to attend at the Tombs in the morning.
               I arrived there before the regular business of the day had commenced, and being well acquainted with the sitting magistrate, obtained a private interview, detailing to him the occurrence as narrated by Barton, and concluding by asking that he would be content to bind the offender over to keep the peace.
               "Oh, certainly," he said, "if the complainant don't appear, I'll do it in here. Sit still, Doctor, and I'll have the man brought up," and he left the room to give the necessary orders.
               A few moments were passed by us in general conversation, when an officer ushered in a tall, stalwart, noble-looking young man, about twenty or two-and-twenty years of age. He was, as Barton had said, "decently dressed," though the sailor stuck out at every corner, and he looked, as he undoubtedly was, a perfect Hercules in strength. I did not at all wonder at the appearance of Barton's face, but was rather surprised that he survived at all the sledgehammer blows which such a man, when enraged, could inflict.
               "My man," said the magistrate, "you acted very foolishly, last night; I dare say you were a little the worse for liquor. Just ashore, eh, and off on a spree?"
               "Not a bit of it, sir; I was as sober as I am now, and would do the same thing again. If you don't believe me, just bring that fellow here, and give me five minutes alone with him."
               I thought Barton would stand a poor chance even for five minutes, but said nothing.
               "The gentleman who was so brutally assaulted, declines to prosecute you."
               "He is no gentleman, sir," said the sailor, firmly, yet with respect; "he is a liar, a scoundrel, and a villain; and it won't do any good to bind me over to keep the peace, for if I catch him, I'll——"
               "There, you must not talk so; I must bind you over to keep the peace for six months. I want bail in three hundred dollars," said the magistrate, desiring to end the matter at once.
               "Make it three thousand, Judge; I can get one as easy as the other. I see—it's all right; I understand the game. Judge, I can't get bail, and that's the end of it."
               "Then I must commit you, temporarily. Have you no friends who would go your bail for such a small sum?"
               "Not one whom I would ask."
               "Then I must commit you; I dare say, when they find out where you are, you'll get bail fast enough," and he went into the office to procure a blank commitment.
               
               While he was gone, the sailor sat down at the table, leaning his head upon his hands, but not even honoring me with a look.
               The magistrate returned, and commenced filling up the blank. "What is the name?" he said, to the prisoner.
               "George Seaton; and I ain't ashamed of it," was the reply.
               "Well, George," said the magistrate, with an air of compassion, "I am really sorry to see a fine-looking fellow like yourself in such a fix. But I must do it."
               "There,"—and he finished the commitment, and was in the act of rapping for an officer, when I arrested his uplifted arm.
               "Make out a bail-piece, Judge; I will go his security," and as I spoke, the sailor raised his head, and looked at me searchingly, while the magistrate could not repress his astonishment.
               "I suppose you know—" he said.
               "I know all about it; I will go his bail for any amount you fix, to which I can respond."
               "I tell you what, Mister," said the sailor, rising and fairly glaring at me, "if you belong to the same gang as that fellow I thrashed last night, you'd better let me go to prison—I wouldn't have your bail."
               "Never fear, my fine fellow," I said; "Judge, make out the bail-piece."
               It was soon done, and I left the office in company with George.
               As we descended the steps, he said to me, "I'd like to know what all this means?"
               "Never mind questions, now. Come with me; I want to ask you a few," and in silence I led him to my own office, and having locked the door to prevent interruption, I told him to be seated, a direction which he obeyed with a kind of dogged obstinacy.
               "Your name is George Seaton?"
               "You heard me say so."
               "Your father was a ship carpenter?"
               "Yes."
               "He was killed by falling from a staging, in the ship-yard where he was at work?"
               "Well, he was; but I'd like to know how you know so much?"
               "Where is your mother?"
               "I can't find out; I've only been ashore these three days, and have been hunting for her ever since. The old woman has moved since I went away, and I can't find her, high or low."
               "And your sister Julia?"
               "Look here, Mister; you are coming too near home. Do you know why I thrashed that long-tailed monkey last night?"
               "No; but I can guess."
               "Well, I won't leave you to guess; I overheard him speaking of Julia, in—"
               "There; I told you I guessed, and now let me tell you something. First George, I honor you for what you have done; he won't forget you in many a day. Your mother, I am sorry to say, is dead; I attended her in her last sickness."
               "You did; is she gone? Are you a doctor?" he asked, incoherently, as the tears gathered in his eyes and coursed down his sunburnt cheeks; "God bless you;" and he hid his face in his hands, weeping with uncontrollable emotion.
               "Poor old soul—dear good mother, to think I wasn't there. Did you ever hear her speak of me?"
               "Often and often, George, and always, as I am sure you have deserved, as a dutiful and affectionate son. But, come, George, be a man; what can't be cured must be endured. Of course you want to see Julia."
               "You needn't ask that."
               "Well," and I wrote her address on one of my own cards, "you will find her there. Don't forget to show her both sides of the card," I said, as he sprang up and seized his hat in his anxiety to discover his sister, "and mind you, George, I want to see you this evening; will you come around?"
               "If I'm alive, and don't get in the Tombs again."
               "You need not be afraid of that; Mr. Barton wont show his face out of doors for a month to come."
               "You don't say; well, he got off cheap at that, I can tell you."
               "There, go along, see Julia; she will tell you who I am; and when you come to-night, I will tell you why I bailed you out, if she does not."
               He hardly paused to thank me, but snatched up his hat, and with a squeeze of the hand which reminded me of him for the entire day, darted out of the office.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIV.
               PLOT AND COUNTERPLOT.
               MATTERS had gone on thus far very quietly, and I had now begun to turn about in my mind how I should begin the ending of the affair.
               I was an occasional visitor at Mrs. Marvin's, and am now free to acknowledge that my interest in her grew more and more absorbing every day; so much so, I do not know but I caught myself wishing more than once that Davy Jones' locker—that receptacle for the lost things and beings of the sea, had caught her husband, too. But when I called to mind the open-hearted frankness with which she invariably received me, and the sincere cordiality of her welcome upon all occasions, I felt that such thoughts were as unworthy of my professed friendship for her, as they were unjust to herself; her character was so pure and spotless, her conduct so irreproachable, her manners so confiding, I felt that even to love her was sinful, and to have breathed a word of love, would have been the height of infamy.
               I had never yet breathed to her a word of what I heard from John, Dinah, or Julia Seaton, but since I had heard their narratives, my conduct and manners, when in her presence, had undergone a marked change. I was gayer—more lively in my conversation, and, indeed, every thing about me was so altered, she could not fail to notice it.
               How could I feel otherwise? I knew that a day of brightness and happiness was soon to dawn for her—that her sorrow would be changed into joy, her garments of mourning for the habiliments of peace. At times she seemed to catch an inspiration from me, and then her clear, ringing laugh, was very music to my soul. Her countenance would light up with a bright and joyous smile, such as was wont, I doubted not, to shed joy and gladness over her father's house and heart; such as would now, if he had but the courage to break the meshes of the net which compassed him, have made his heart leap within him for joy.
               As I was specially anxious that Mrs. Evarts should not entertain any suspicion that my intercourse with Mrs. Marvin was continued, I was more than ever a frequent visitor at the house.
               
               Barton, who seemed deeply grateful to me for the part I had acted in the affair with George Seaton, and for the manner in which I had professionally concealed all knowledge of it from the family, treated me with more than even his wonted courtesy, and let me into his intimate confidence.
               He informed me of his approaching nuptials with Mattie, and of the brilliant prospects held out to him by the alliance, as it would, in all probability, insure him an interest in Mr. Evarts' business.
               I taxed him, laughingly, with having been a sad fellow; but he shrugged his shoulders, and treated his infamous conduct as though it had been something of which he might feel proud. He was careful never to mention any names to me; and if he had even named the poor deserted Helen, I was so well prepared, I should not have exhibited any surprise.
               But my time was soon to come, and I was looking forward to the hour when I should feel at liberty to bring matters to a crisis, when every thing was nearly ruined, one day, by my accidental meeting with Mrs. Evarts in the sick chamber of John.
               She had called up to see, as she said, how he was getting on, and the start which she gave on meeting me in that place, had nearly thrown me off my guard.
               I quickly recovered myself, and giving John a look which I knew he dared not disobey, I opened upon her by accusing her of insincerity in the professions of friendship she had so often made to me.
               "How?" she inquired.
               "By permitting any one but myself to attend a person in whom you take an interest, unless indeed"—and I bowed with humility—"you distrusted my ability to be of any service."
               "So far from that, Doctor, it was only because I knew that your time was so well and profitably employed in your extensive practice, it would have been unkind in me to have asked your attendance upon a patient who has nothing to render but thanks in return."
               "I should have been paid in the feeling that I had served you," I replied; but the lie almost choked me.
               "Come, come, Doctor, no compliments here, if you please," and she looked any thing but displeased. "How do you find John? and how did you come to be here at all?" she asked, in a low voice.
               "Oh, he is getting on slowly," I answered, in the same tone, determined that I would finish my business that day; for delays would very likely prove dangerous, now I had her to deal with. "As to how I am here, Doctor D. was somewhat alarmed, and fearing he did not fully understand the case, sent for me in consultation tion. He is out of town, for a few days, and I am here as his substitute; I hope you feel that he is safe in my hands."
               "Perfectly," she replied; "we have had so many evidences of your skill, how could I doubt it?" and I bowed to the compliment—not daring to trust myself with any more words than were necessary, for I well knew the desperate character of the game I was playing.
               After a few common-place remarks to me, and a few words of encouragement to John, she took her leave, insisting that I should make an early call, which I promised to do.
               Almost immediately after her departure—so soon, indeed, I dreaded lest she had seen him enter—my friend D—— entered; and giving him a private sign, which he understood, we approached the bedside of the patient, and after a long examination and many whispers, we retired with awfully solemn faces into the next apartment.
               Briefly, I made known to him my meeting with Mrs. Evarts, and the necessity for instant action, ere we were thwarted by her; and having received his assent, we returned to the patient with faces long enough to have frightened a healthy man.
               "Now, John," said D—— taking his pulse, "tell us the truth—have you obeyed our directions implicitly?"
               "I am sure I have," he said, trembling like an aspen leaf, and the cold sweat starting at every pore.
               "Was the medicine given every hour last night, as I directed?" he asked, turning to his wife, who stood behind him, pale and trembling.
               "No, Doctor, I would not wake him up, he was sleeping so nicely, and he has not had any from ten o'clock last night until near daylight."
               "Just as I feared," he said, turning to me with a look of the most profound anxiety; "I am sure I was very particular in the directions."
               "Shure, and, Doctor," she fairly howled, "you wouldn't—"
               "Hold your tongue—see how you frighten your husband," I said, for John turned such an ashy paleness, and his lips grew so colorless, I was really afraid he would die on the spot.
               Beckoning to my friend, D—— and I stepped aside, where we pretended to whisper very mysteriously, and, approaching the bed again, I said:
               "John, your failure to follow our directions may prove very serious. There, don't be frightened, man," I said, seeing that he was fairly gasping for breath; "I do not say that there is any immediate danger, but you are a very sick man."
               With a groan which ought to have made me repent of my cruelty, and which would, if Cora Marvin had not just then risen up before me, he drew the bed-clothes over his head, and for an instant lay so motionless, I feared he had actually died of fright.
               In an instant, he threw them off, and half rising in bed, raised his clasped hands, and with an expression of terror and anguish, exclaimed—"Oh, Doctor, Doctor—save me; you can, you know you can; don't let me die."
               "There, there—lie down," said D——, forcing him gently on the pillow; don't get so excited—we will do all we can. Doctor S. has told you there is no immediate danger, but you must be careful, and not get so excited. You know that every man must die once, and if there is any thing you wish to arrange, it is well enough to do it. Mind, I repeat there is not any immediate danger, provided our directions are implicitly obeyed," and turning to me, I assented, of course.
               "But you must remain perfectly quiet, and place entire confidence in us."
               John listened to us with an expression of wildness, which under other circumstances would have been ludicrous, but which was really painful to behold; and gazing at us alternately with doubting looks, both at the same instant caught the idea that he was debating within himself whether or not to make a clean breast of it, when seeing my chance, I said—
               "Now, John, I want to ask you one question, and you must tell me the truth, for I am convinced you know all about it. What has become of Mr. Evarts' daughter, Miss Cora?"
               "As God is my judge, I do not know."
               "Yes, but you do know how she came to leave her father's house—I know that much, and I know that you had a hand in it. I know there was a plot to ruin that poor girl, and that you aided in it. I know enough, John, if you do recover, to send you where you would be very sorry to go. Now, tell us the truth, for surely you would not dare to die with such a sin upon your soul—tell us the whole truth, and we pledge ourselves that no harm shall ever come to you. Surely Cora never harmed or injured you?"
               "Indeed indeed, she never did," he said, dashing away the tears which my words had called to his eyes. "She was the sweetest and best girl that ever lived."
               "How could you then, tell such infamous lies about her. How could you, John?"
               
               "Oh! it was wrong—I know it was wrong. It was wicked, but God knows I have sorrowed for it. It was all through Mrs. Evarts."
               A glance of intelligence passed between the Doctor and myself, but he went on without noticing it. "It was indeed all through her."
               "Come, John, tell us all about it. Don't be afraid of her. She cannot harm you, if she dare, and I pledge you my word of honor to screen you from any thing she may say or do."
               "You won't let me die, will you, gentlemen? You will cure me, won't you?" he asked, in a tone struggling between the agony of fear, and half-renewed hope.
               "John, we will do our very best. I tell you again there is no immediate danger, and I have no doubt of your recovery if you will keep perfectly quiet and follow our directions. We thought it our duty to tell you what we did, but really there is no cause now for such alarm."
               This re-assured him, and closing his eyes and clasping his hands, he lay quiet for a few moments, and then beckoning us to be seated, he made a clean breast of it indeed, confirming all my suspicions as to Mrs. Evarts' conduct throughout.
               With my consent, Dr. D. took down his statement in writing, and I do not know as I ever experienced such a thrill of exquisite pleasure as when I placed my name beneath my friend's, as a witness to his signature, for it was the realization of my long-cherished hopes, and insured a perfect triumph over her enemies for Cora Marvin.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XV.
               ANOTHER DISCOVERY.
               "NOW then, Tom," said my friend, as we left the house, "what is your next move? Fate and Providence have wonderfully befriended you in this matter."
               "First, my friend, I will thank you for the kindness you have displayed throughout in this affair, for without your assistance I could not have accomplished thus much. Next, I shall go to Mrs. Marvin's, and give her at least an inkling of what has been going on, and what she may expect. It will not do to tell her too much at once, for I would not for the world excite hopes which I may be unable to realize. Would you like to go with me—you have earned a fair share of the pleasure I anticipate."
               "Not now—some other time. My presence may be necessary hereafter, and it will be as well for me not to have known too much. It is better, I think, that she should not see me at all, at present."
               "I believe you are right," I said, though I knew not why. "Now I must leave you. I will meet you at John's to-morrow."
               "No, you won't. You will take tea with me to-night, for I want to hear how the news you bring is received"
               "As you say," and I left him.
               I was not long in reaching Mrs. Marvin's, and my excited manner and flushed cheeks told her that something unusual had occurred. In truth, my delight was too great for concealment, and after the first salutations, Clarence having established himself in his accustomed quarters on my knee, she said:
               "Something has occurred to-day, Doctor, which seems to give you great pleasure. You look so happy, I really almost feel so myself. I do not know how, or why it is, but ever since your last visit I have had an unusual flow of spirits. It seemed as if I could not repress them; my heart has been unaccountably light. Who knows but my husband will be home soon, and then my troubles will be over."
               "Who knows, indeed," I said, almost blurting out the object of my visit, and blushing to think how little her husband's presence was connected with my present happiness; "but suppose we do not wait for his arrival to end your troubles?"
               
               "Doctor," she said, her countenance changing suddenly to an expression of doubt, "you are not trifling with me? you have not been in the habit of doing so."
               "Well, I won't begin now, Mrs. Marvin, you may be assured; could you receive some good news, without——?"
               "Dear Doctor, don't keep me in suspense," she said, not permitting me to finish my sentence; "has my father sent for me, and is he convinced of my innocence?"
               "He has not sent for you, Mrs. Marvin, but he will very do it soon, or I am a poor judge of human nature; and as for the rest, I can pledge my word that he will be soon as entirely convinced of your innocence, as I have been from the first."
               "God grant it," she said, raising her eyes heavenward.
               "There, read that;" and I handed to her the statement just received from John.
               With moistened eyes and trembling hands she opened the paper, and a glance at the first few lines were all that were needed to tell her the contents. She did not wait to finish its perusal, but extending both hands to me, with a countenance fairly beaming with happiness, she exclaimed, "how can I thank you, my kind, my noble friend, for your generous sympathy and aid."
               "I did not come here for your thanks, and don't want them until I have finished my work. All I want of you is to dry your eyes, and obey my directions for the future, no matter what they may be."
               "Could I do otherwise, Doctor," she said, still retaining my hands, and pressing them with a fervor which, while it spoke her gratitude, sent the blood tingling to the ends of my fingers, "how can I repay such noble, generous kindness to a poor persecuted woman?"
               "By being happy, and trusting to me for guidance, until I trust you to walk alone."
               "But I have not half done yet;" and I proceeded to recount rapidly, but briefly, what I had heard from Dinah.
               "My poor abused and deceived father," she said, as I concluded, "how will he receive this extraordinary disclosure, and he so proud? But is this all truth? is there room for doubt?"
               "Not a particle. I have every thing so arranged, that when the proper time comes, I can overwhelm her so suddenly with proof, she will not dare even to raise her voice in her own defence."
               
               "But more yet. Your quondam lover, Barton; I have a great mind to let him finish his own work, and his career will end in Sing Sing."
               "Why, Doctor, more marvels?"
               "Yes, Madam, more marvels; but no matter for him now; you don't care much for him, and you will hear all about him in due season."
               "Is he really cousin to Martha?"
               "No more than you are mine. He knows as much about Mrs. Evarts and Mattie as Dinah does, and is only playing a deep game to deceive your father. But it requires two to play at his game, and I hold the leading trumps. Oh, Madam, you will hear a grand explosion yet, when I touch the match to the magazine. But I have one thing yet to accomplish, and that is with Julia; she is as much like her mistress as pea is like pea, and she knows too much for me, I am afraid. However, with this statement of John to back me, I will try, if I can only get a chance to see her."
               "But you must not anticipate too much. I have told you more than I ought, though I could not resist the temptation of seeing you smile again."
               "Dear, kind friend," she said, and my equanimity was entirely upset, when she threw herself on my neck, shedding tears of happiness, and sobbing as if her heart would break.
               To say that I was entirely unmoved would be untrue. I wept myself, without knowing why, and at length feeling that if I stayed much longer I might say something for which I might have to repent in sackcloth and ashes, I placed her gently on a chair, and bidding her be of good cheer, I took my leave, with a heart as light and gay as though I had really achieved something to be proud of.
               That same evening saw me at Mrs. Evarts', and while waiting in the parlor for the ladies to come down, Julia brought in the shade to put over the gas-light which hung over the centre-table.
               "Julia," I said, hastily, "I have a letter to you, from John; will you come to my office in the morning, and get it? He wanted me to give it to you without any one knowing it."
               Her face turned crimson, and she evinced a confusion, which told me too truly of her complicity with him, but I did not give any sign that I observed her.
               "I wonder what he can have to say to me? Yes, I will come."
               "Be there at nine o'clock."
               "I will," she said; and fortunately, the entrance of the ladies at that moment, deprived her of the opportunity of asking any questions. I knew she would come, for I saw that her curiosity was aroused.
               The whole family, including Mr. Barton, were assembled on that evening, and I was in such an unusual flow of spirits, as to attract the notice of all; and Mattie inquired, with what she meant to be a very naïve look, if I had "popped the question yet?" Of course, I answered in the same strain; and when I left the house, all declared they had never passed a more delightful evening.
               "After a calm comes a storm," I said to myself, as I left the house, fully convinced that when I next entered it, it should be in triumph, and with Cora Marvin by my side.
               The next morning, prompt at the hour, Julia kept her promise; and as she entered, hurriedly, as if she had stolen off, she said, throwing up her veil, "Well, Doctor, here I am."
               "I am very glad to see you, Julia," was my reply; and I told the truth, for she could furnish the last link in the chain of evidence to convict her mistress of her infamy.
               Locking the door, as well to prevent her exit, as the intrusion of any other person, I approached her with threatening looks, and holding up John's confession sion, I said sternly, while she looked at me, actually without moving a muscle of her countenance, "Now, Julia, I have no desire to send a fine, smart woman like yourself, to Sing-Sing, but so sure as you do not make a frank and full confession of all you know about Cora Evarts, so sure you will be there in less than a month."
               At the mention of Sing-Sing, she did change color, almost imperceptibly, but recovering instantly her self-possession, she said, with the most wonderful non-chalance—
               "Oh, if that's what you wanted to see me about, Doctor, all I have got to say is, that you have missed your mark. I am ready to go as soon as you choose to send me, and you always know where to find me."
               The impudence—the overpowering assurance of the woman, fairly staggered me; but I knew it was my last chance, and I was determined to lose nothing through my weakness or folly.
               Opening, therefore, the statement which I held in my hand, I approached her, and said, sternly, "Now, Julia, you may put on as many airs as you like, and you may look as innocent as you choose, but I am not to be frightened by one nor deceived by the other, and this paper will send you to Sing-Sing, as sure as you stand there. John, who is, perhaps, dying, has made a full confession of his villainy and lies concerning Mrs. Evarts' daughter. Here is his statement, and he declares that you were not only fully acquainted with every thing, but was his accomplice from first to last, and like him, paid by Mrs. Evarts."
               "That is plain speaking," she said, with a gravity perfectly wonderful; "go on, Doctor."
               "Now, I give you your choice," I said, half-frightened lest I should have been deceived after all, "a full confession or Sing-Sing."
               "I tell you what, Doctor," she said, with flashing eyes, "you are wasting your time with me. If John has chosen to make up a parcel of lies to please you, I shan't help him out, I can tell you—I think too much of myself for that."
               "Well, Julia," I said, determined now to try the coup-de-grâce, "I am so thoroughly convinced of your connection with the plot to drive Cora from her home, I shall not let it drop until you have proved your innocence. I will send for an officer, and we will go to the Tombs together; the magistrate will examine into the matter, and if you are innocent, I will bear the consequences;" and seating myself, I penned a note, as if writing for an officer.
               "You dare not do it," she said, but not so fiercely as before.
               "I will do it, and take all the risks myself."
               "Let me read that paper."
               "I will read it to you; I am rather afraid to trust it in your hands, as John might die, and—"
               "Read it yourself," she said, impetuously interrupting me. And I read it from first to last, not omitting to add that it was attested by two credible witnesses.
               "Now, then, tell me exactly what you want of me."
               "Tell me if that is not every word truth."
               "Suppose I don't choose to, what then?"
               "You have heard what I said before."
               "You want me to sign that paper?"
               "Exactly."
               "Do you believe it is true?"
               "I know it is."
               "Will you pledge yourself to bear me harmless?"
               "On my honor, I will."
               "Then I will sign it, too, for every word is true; but how did you find it out?"
               "That is a matter of no consequence now; you will learn that in good season. You will sign it, then?"
               "I will."
               "Wont there be a precious time," she said, with a low chuckle, while I was writing an acknowledgement at the bottom of the page, for her signature; "no matter—I've kept my word, so far, and I wont go to prison for her or anybody else. Come, Doctor, let me sign it."
               "One moment, Julia," and ringing a bell, I despatched a servant for my neighbor, Mr. J——, who followed close on her heels.
               "Now, Julia, sign that," I said; "and, Mr. J——, please witness her signature, to oblige me."
               Hastily reading what I had written, she signed it without any hesitation, and it was duly witnessed by Mr. J——, whom I thanked for his attention.
               "Now, Julia," said I, when we were alone, "I suppose I need hardly caution you against saying any thing to the family, and I emphasized the word."
               "Trust me for that," she said, with a low laugh—"she'll hear of it soon enough, I'll warrant, without me; I shan't say a word, I promise you; I don't bear her any special love. True, she paid me well enough, but not enough to make up for Sing-Sing."
               "That's all, Julia?"
               "You wont forget your promise to me, Doctor?"
               "Never fear—Mrs. Evarts won't have power to harm any one much longer, and I promise no one else has any desire to. Will Mr. Barton be there, as usual, to-day or to-morrow?"
               "Yes, every day—and all night, too, for all I know," she answered, rather spitefully.
               "Well, that will do, Julia; I am much obliged to you for your candor."
               "You need not be," she said, "I never did it of my own accord; you have been mighty sharp to get ahead of that woman, but I guess you've done it. So good morning, Doctor, and success to you."
               As my evidence was now completed, it was time to open my batteries; and my first care was to request that Mr. Evarts would favor me with a call that evening, on business of importance. Accordingly, I despatched a note to his store, marked private, well knowing that if sent to the house, it would have been opened by his wife, whose suspicions would have been instantly aroused, and who might possibly have thwarted all my plans.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVI.
               FATHER AND DAUGHTER.
               I WAS not deceived in my conviction that Mr. Evarts would comply with my request, for when I reached my office, late in the afternoon, I found him seated there, reading one of my medical works.
               "Well, Doctor, here I am, you see. Now, what is it so private, which requires my attendance on your medical highness?"
               "Keep your seat, Mr. Evarts," I said, for he had risen at my entrance. "Are you prepared to hear—"
               "Good God! is she dead?" he exclaimed, showing at once the current of his thoughts and his anxiety respecting his daughter, and he sprang towards me, almost gasping for breath; then, as if ashamed of having exhibited so much emotion, he sank back into his chair, with a sort of sullen obstinacy, as if determined not to be so moved again.
               "Far from it. She is in the enjoyment of excellent health, and equally good spirits, and, unless I am very much mistaken, in less than an hour from this time you will have her hanging on your neck, shedding tears of joy.
               "Sir—Doctor—do you mean to insult me? Do you know what you are saying? Do you know you are speaking on a forbidden topic?"
               "Perfectly, and that is the reason I took the liberty of sending for you here, where we might converse in private. I have only spoken the truth."
               "Now, Mr. Evarts, curb your temper," I continued, calmly but earnestly, "don't get excited, but listen to me patiently, and when I have done, you may say or do just what you choose."
               "You remember," I proceeded, "that one day you asked me what I thought of your daughter, and I was about to reply that I believed her to be the victim of an infamous plot, when you checked me, and refused to hear any more."
               "I remember," he replied, coldly, as if he did not care to hear it repeated now; "I hope you are not going to—"
               "There you go—impatient before I have begun. Now, Mr. Evarts, you must hear me—I not only wish to repeat it, but to prove it by such incontestible evidence, you dare not disbelieve me if you would."
               "You speak earnestly, Doctor."
               
               "I am very earnest. You met your present wife in Savannah, at a boarding-house?"
               "I did."
               "You knew nothing of her antecedents at all?"
               "I never made any special inquiries. I found her an intelligent, well-informed, polished lady—moving in the same circle with myself and daughter, and as I was satisfied on acquaintance that she would make an excellent wife, and do honor to my name, I married her. I hope, Doctor, you will be careful when you speak of her, and not forget that she is my wife, and has been your friend."
               "Suppose, Mr. Evarts, I prove to you that she is not your wife at all."
               "Sir—sir," and he fairly gasped for breath, "what are you saying? Do you know, Doctor, to whom you are speaking?"
               "Suppose that I prove to you," I continued, without noticing his remark—"mind, Mr. Evarts, I say prove to you, that her first husband is living—is an inmate of a prison, where he has been for seven years, and where he must end his days, for he was sentenced to imprisonment for life for a foul and cruel murder, which was miscalled manslaughter. Suppose I prove that, Mr. Evarts?"
               He could not make any reply. His face was ashy pale, and his lips moved tremulously, but no sound came forth.
               "Suppose I show you that this Barton, this pretended nephew, is no more a relation than I am, but the blind used by her to entrap others into the arms of Mattie?"
               "Go on, Doctor," he found voice to utter, but so feebly I could hardly hear him.
               "Suppose I prove that he is one of the basest and most infamous of villains—that he was married two years ago to a young, innocent, and artless girl, whom he deserted after the most cruel abuse, pretending that his marriage was a sham; and suppose I prove that marriage incontrovertibly."
               "Suppose I prove to you," and as I spoke I took from my pocket the statement acknowledged by John and Julia, "that she suborned two of your servants to perjure themselves against Cora. That every word spoken against that girl was a vile, infamous lie, concocted between Mrs. Evarts, Barton, and Mattie, to drive her from your house, and secure her fortune for themselves?"
               Mr. Evarts made no reply, but holding his face in his hands, groaned aloud.
               "This paper, Mr. Evarts," I continued, "contains the statement of those servants, duly witnessed, and in addition to this, I have enough to overwhelm the whole of them," and I tendered it to him.
               "Read it, Doctor," he said, shaking his head, "I cannot," and I saw indeed that he could not, for his eyes were blinded with fast falling tears.
               Slowly and deliberately I read it through, even to the names of the witnesses, and as I folded it up he said, again laying his face in his hands, the tears forcing themselves through his clasped fingers—"my poor, dear, darling Cora, how have you been abused and slandered? What reparation can I make?"
               "You remember, Mr. Evarts, the morning you called on me with the fifty dollars for your daughter?"
               "I do."
               "Well, your wife had not been out of my office five minutes, when you entered it. She came there to give me her version of the affair, and I made up my mind then, that every word she had told me was a lie—a black-hearted, wilful, malignant lie. I saw Cora that very evening, and having heard from her own lips, the story of her wrongs and yours, I resolved that I would bring the perpetrators to the light.
               "Providence has befriended me, and some of the discoveries I have made have seemed almost miraculous. But I have done it. I am prepared at every point, and am ready, as soon as you say the word, to commence proceedings."
               "You surely don't mean to go to law, Doctor," he said, his face flushing with shame at the bare possibility of such an exposure of his domestic affairs.
               "Oh, no; it won't need the aid of the law to bring her to terms. I mean to make known to her, and her precious partners, the discoveries I have made."
               "Doctor," he said, rising, and grasping my hand, while his noble form actually dilated with emotion, "I do not know, and at present will not inquire how you became possessed of these extraordinary secrets. My heart tells me that every word you utter is truth. I honor and appreciate your motives, and can only say now, from my inmost heart, I am grateful to you. But you are certain—there can be no doubt as to the entire accuracy of all you have learned?"
               "Not a shadow," I said, and I well knew what he meant by the emphasis on all, for he was a proud, but not a haughty man—proud of his name, for it had always been connected with honor and integrity; proud of his character, for it had ranked with the highest and best, and proud of the position he held in society—a position won by a lifetime of patient industry and stern integrity, and what he had heard concerning his wife, was well calculated to wound him in the most tender point
               "One thing more, Mr. Evarts, and I have finished. From first to last, I have been actuated by the sole desire to serve your daughter, with whom, as you have heard, I became acquainted solely through chance, but whom I learned to honor and esteem from the first; and when I had heard her narrative, I determined, not only for her sake, to get at the truth, but for yours; for I could not but perceive how unhappy you were, and I was under too many obligations to you not to desire to serve you, if it were within my power."
               "I have accomplished my end, and I pledge you my word as a gentleman, that after you shall have arranged matters to your satisfaction, I will never by any act or word, give you reason to believe that I hold it in my remembrance. I would not recall any thing which must be so painful to you."
               "That is more, much more kindness than I deserve at your hands. But I must go now; good night. Come around to-morrow evening, Doctor."
               "And where are you going in such haste? I have not told you all, yet."
               "I don't want to hear any more; I have heard quite enough to satisfy me that I have been duped, deceived and betrayed, and that I have been a most unnatural parent. I am going to take my daughter to her own house—too my home; for, thank God, if I really know myself, she has never left my heart."
               "You don't know where to find her, I am afraid, do you?"
               "That is true, Doctor, I quite forgot that, but you will tell me?"
               "Not until you give me your promise to do nothing until I am ready. Why, Mr. Evarts, you would spoil every thing by such precipitancy."
               "But, let me see her. Take me to her, and let me ask her pardon on my knees, for my injustice. Oh, Cora, my own darling, my treasured child, shall I see you again?" and he clasped his hands with an expression of happiness, such as had been a stranger to his face for many a weary month.
               "You promise to do nothing without my assent?"
               "Faithfully, Doctor," he said, grasping my hand; "I am not too old to obey orders, though I am too happy to wish to."
               "And you won't make any attempt to remove her until every thing is prepared?"
               "Prepared! Why, Sir, is it not my house? Is she not my daughter, and is not my house her home? Ah, I forgot," he said, checking himself. "Go on, Doctor, and do with me as you choose. My turn will come in good 
                     tlme
                     time
                  ."
               In another moment we were in the street, and old as was Mr. Evarts, I had difficulty to keep up with him, so eager was he, and so impatient to see his child.
               It did not take us long to reach her residence at the pace led by him, and opening the front door, he exclaimed, as he entered the dirty, uncarpeted hall,"
               "And is this the place for my daughter—for my Cora?"
               As we ascended the stairs leading to the room, I could hear his hard breathing behind me, and I was almost fearful that the excitement would be too much for him.
               As we reached the landing, Mrs. Marvin opened the door, saying at the same time, "Ah, Doctor, is that you? I know your step, walk in," and without waiting to see me, she re-entered her room, standing near the door to give me, her accustomed greeting.
               At the sound of his daughter's voice, Mr. Evarts trembled so excessively, he could scarcely stand, and seizing my arm for support, he suffered me to lead him on.
               "Walk in, Doctor," she said with her wonted smile, still not noticing that I was accompanied, but before I had time to return her salutation, her father pushed me aside, and rushing in, exclaimed, as he opened his arms to embrace her, "Cora—my darling, my treasure—my own dear Cora."
               Gazing wildly at him for an instant, as if doubting her own senses, she uttered a loud scream of joy, and with a spring was on his bosom, her arms clasped around his neck, her tears fairly raining upon his shoulders.
               In strict justice, I ought not to have been present at such a meeting; but I had fairly earned my share of the happiness I had been the means of bestowing, and I was afraid Mr. Evarts, in his impulsiveness, might endanger all my schemes by insisting on taking his daughter at once home. So I was there, and I believe I wept as much as either of them, for I was very happy too.
               "Doctor," said Mrs. Marvin, rising from her father's bosom, and while he held one hand, gazing at her with looks of the deepest love and sorrow, she extended the other to me, which I took, of course, "how can I ever—how can we ever repay you? Can I ever sufficiently thank you?"
               "Yes, Mrs. Marvin, you can," I replied, wiping my own eyes, which were so blinded I could scarcely distinguish even Cora, "by commanding your father to obey me; I see, even now, symptoms of rebellion." And I did, for he was gazing about her poorly furnished and uncomfortable room, with looks of the most intense commiseration.
               "You need not look so, Mr. Evarts; I understand you perfectly, I know what you mean, but she must remain here for to-night, at least."
               "Doctor, may God bless you," was all he could say, for the father's heart was too full for many words; "do with me as you will."
               "Darling," he said to Cora, who was again close by his side, "I have heard marvellous things from our friend to-night; we owe to him more than even our lives could repay; I am sure we will never forget it. I wanted to take you home this very night, but this tyrant is obstinate, and positively forbids it," and he shook his fist at me in a very menacing manner, "but I will pay him off one of these days, and I must go without you; but how can I receive and treat those who have so deeply wronged and injured us?"
               "Mr. Evarts, I have played the hypocrite for many a month in your house and for your sakes; please practice a little patience one night to oblige me, and serve your daughter. But I have a patient near here, who must be seen to-night; I will be back in about an hour."
               Mrs. Marvin thanked me with a look which told me she knew all about my patient, and Mr. Evarts made no objection; so cautioning Cora against being led astray by her father, I left them to their own happiness.
               When I returned, they were deeply engrossed in conversation, and that I had been the subject of at least a portion of it, was evidenced by their rising and extending each a hand to me.
               Cora looked at me an instant with an expression which a life-time will not efface, then snatching her hand from her father, who still held it, she threw herself on my neck, sobbing and weeping as if her heart was surcharged with too much joy.
               It is useless to attempt a detail of the conversation which occurred during the next hour.
               Cora was seated next to me, and her soft blue eyes thanked me so often and so warmly, I almost wished I had it all to do over again.
               
               But every thing must have an end; and when I thought it time for Mr. Evarts to be going, I fairly dragged him off in spite of his remonstrances and vows that he would "pay me off yet."
               As we left the house together, I renewed my earnest request that he would not by word, deed, or manner, give any intimation that he had heard any thing to alter his feelings towards his wife and her family, for, as I remarked, it might put her upon her guard; she might leave the city, and give us an infinity of trouble."
               He promised, of course, to be guarded in every thing, for he had quite as much at stake as myself, and fully coinciding with the truth of that remark, I had no more to urge.
               "It will be a hard task, Doctor," he said, "to pretend respect, much less affection for one who has deceived me so infamously, and brought such shame upon me, but for Cora's sake, I can do almost any thing."
               I left him at his own door, fully persuaded that he would keep his promise, and at once set about making my preparations for the morrow.
               To that end, I called on Dr.D——, and narrated to him the events of the day, at which he seemed almost as much delighted as myself, and with me, anticipated something more than mere pleasure in confronting and denouncing the vile woman, through whose acts such wretchedness and suffering had been entailed.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVII.
               HOME AGAIN.
               DOCTOR D—— and myself met by appointment at an early hour, at the bedside of John, whom we found, as indeed we knew we should, rapidly improving; for having got over his fright, his disease was easily managed.
               The poor fellow had hardly words to express his gratitude to us for our attention, to which, backed by our skill, he attributed his recovery, which we now promised him as certain.
               After congratulating him upon his rapid improvement, I made known to him that Julia had joined him in his confession; and when I told him that I intended on that very day to disclose all I had learned, and reinstate Miss Cora (as he still called her) in her rights, he seemed unaffectedly gratified.
               Having finished our visit there, we returned to Dr. D——'s, where a carriage having been ordered, we took Dinah with us, and proceeded at once to Mrs. Marvins'.
               I left Dr.D—— and Dinah in the coach while I ran up stairs, where I found Mr. Evarts with his daughter, and Clarence occupying his place on his grandfather's knee.
               Both had evidently been weeping, for their eyes were red and swollen; but I well knew they were tears of joy, and I almost envied the happiness which had been theirs after that interview.
               "I have a friend in the carriage at the door," I said, after the first warm greeting, "to whom we are all much indebted; may I bring him up?"
               "Of course," they answered, in the same breath, and going to the window, I raised it, and beckoned for my friend to come up.
               When I introduced him as one to whom, under Providence, I was indebted for the success which had attended my efforts to serve them, and who had constantly aided me with his counsel and friendship, he was received with a warmth flowing from truly grateful hearts, and I could see by the looks of admiration he cast upon Cora, that he was not at all surprised at the interest I had manifested for her.
               "Come, Doctor," said Mr. Evarts, "when is the performance to come off? you are the stage-manager, and the curtain can't rise until you give the order. I must confess, however, that I am getting very impatient."
               "Let me see," I said, very leisurely pulling out my watch, "I told Seaton to be there at ten. You are sure Barton will be at home?"
               "Oh, yes; I told Martha to keep him in the house, as I wanted very much to see him before I went down to the office."
               "I hope that devil, George, won't get there before me," I half muttered.
               "What's that you said?" inquired Cora, placing her hand on my arm; "you said something about devil."
               "Only there will be the devil to pay if he is," I said, mysteriously; for, to tell the truth, I had requested George Seaton (of whom more anon) to be in waiting at ten o'clock, but on no account to enter the house until I came, but I much feared least his impetuosity would get the better of his discretion; for I was well assured, that if he chanced to get a sight of Barton, my recognizances would be forfeited, and Robert Barton would be half murdered.
               I therefore assented to a movement towards Mr.Evarts' house, and conducted the party to the coach.
               Mr.Evarts rather shrunk back as he saw Dinah, but when I remarked that she was a "leading actress," he said no more, and, having taken our seats, the coach was driven off.
               Not a word was spoken on the road to Mr. Evarts, for the heart of each was too full for words at such a time.
               Cora lay upon her father's bosom, his arms incircling her, while Dinah, Dr.D——, and myself occupied the front seat, Clarence being tightly squeezed in between Cora and her father.
               The coach has stopped, and we are at the door. A life-time of anxiety is crowded into those few moments. Every heart beat tumultuously, and as the driver opened the door to permit our egress, I could see that Cora's eyes were filled with tears, while her father, with a pale, stern face, almost dragged her onward.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               BROTHER AND SISTER.
               TURN we now, again, to Julia Seaton and her friend.
               I had, as it will be remembered, given Julia's address to George, and he was not long in finding out her residence. Without hesitation he pushed open the front door, and knocking at the door of the first apartment, inquired for Miss Barton.
               "Up stairs—front room," and before the words were fairly out of the speaker's mouth, he was up stairs, and in the front room.
               Julia and Helen were seated there, and a faint scream betrayed their affright at the sudden apparition of the tall, brawny-looking man who burst in upon them unannounced.
               They had no time for words, however, for with a cry of joy, Julia sprang forward, and in an instant was clasped in a pair of as honest arms as ever protected woman.
               "George—my George—my own dear brother;" and Helen was pacified, for she had already begun to dread some new adventure.
               And after a few tears of joy, and a great many embraces, Julia found time to say, that "this was her own dear brother George," and Helen received him as she ought to have received the brother of her own dear Julia—with a smile, and a hearty shake of the hand, and a cordial welcome.
               What passed there, it is not my business to repeat. The issue will be known in time.
               On the same evening, while seated in leisurely enjoyment of my Havana, George entered unannounced, and throwing his hat on the sofa, advanced towards me with outstretched hands, and a countenance beaming with such joy and happiness, that, notwithstanding my dread of his vice-like grasp, I gave him my own.
               "Doctor," he said, you are a man from clew to earing, and I love and honor you. I see through it all now; and if I ever forget you, or your kindness to Julia——"
               "There, that will do, George," I said, releasing my hands from his grasp, and backing away, lest he should renew it, "I know all you want to say. I hope you found Julia well, and all right."
               
               "All right, Doctor," but if I could only get a few minutes alone with that Barton—"
               "Well, you can't," I said, interrupting him, "for he is under my care; and you should not if he was able to be out, for you might spoil my game. Now listen to me, and answer a few questions:
               "You saw a young woman with your sister?"
               "Well, I did."
               "How did you fancy her? What did you think of her?"
               "I didn't fancy her, because I did not look at her enough to know her again, and I didn't think of her, I was so busy with Julia."
               "I suppose Julia told you something about this Barton?"
               "Not so much as I want to know. She and Helen, as she called her, kept winking and blinking at each other whenever his name was mentioned, so I rather guess there's something behind yet."
               "Did you tell Julia about your meeting with Barton, and the consequences?"
               "Of course I did; and when I mentioned what a pounding I gave him, she laughed and clapped her hands in perfect delight."
               "And Helen?"
               "She did not say any thing; but I could see by the twinkle of her eyes, that she would not have cried if I had given him a little more."
               "Now I am going to tell you something to 
                     suprise
                     surprise
                   you, but I must have your word of honor as a man and a sailor, that you'll not breathe a word or move a step until I give you leave."
               "I promise, faithfully."
               "Barton is the husband of Helen."
               "What!" exclaimed George, springing from his seat, as if he had been propelled from a mortar, though he didn't rise quite so high, "the infernal scoundrel! Say that again."
               "I say that Robert Barton is the husband of Helen Lee that was—now Helen Barton—though he disowns her, and swears his marriage was all a sham."
               "And I suppose he wanted to play the same game with Julia. Oh, Doctor, if I had known that before, I don't think I would have let you bail me out."
               "Remember, George, I have your promise."
               "Oh, of course; it's too late, now. But what are you going to do about it?"
               "First, let me tell you how it was found out," and I narrated the interview of Helen with Barton in Julia's room, to which he listened with eager attention, interrupting me, however, by occasional interjections tions and threats, which, being accompanied by pretty strong sea-language, I do not think it necessary to repeat.
               When I closed, he reiterated his earnest wishes that I would only give him one more chance at Barton, and he promised me that he would give me all the money he had now, which was about eighty dollars, and work out the balance.
               Of course, I forbade that, and he renewed his promise of good behavior.
               "Now, George," I continued, "I must and will find out who married them, for I believe they were really married, and I am the more inclined to that, for the reason that he has kept the certificate which was given on the occasion. Helen was a simple-hearted country girl, and of course trusted him. I want you to help me, in this search."
               "Won't I?" was all he answered.
               "Now, I know that every minister or magistrate, who marries parties here, is obliged to keep a record of names, dates, and ages of the husband and wife, and that is the only chance of discovering whether they were really married or not."
               "Why don't you advertise for the—"
               "Pshaw, George, that would only put Barton on his guard, and he would be out of reach in no time. No, no; it requires care, prudence, and great caution. Indeed, so much, I'm almost afraid to trust you."
               "You needn't feel so; I shan't forget that I'm working to punish a man who wanted to ruin my sister, and I'll keep my tongue as fast inside my teeth, as a dead man."
               After again impressing him with the necessity of extreme caution, I detailed my plan of operations, which was to ascertain the residence of every minister and magistrate in the city, and go myself, or send a proper person to see them.
               "I'll take one-half, and work like a beaver."
               "Only work as quietly, and I will give you all credit. Now, I must go and see Helen, and get from her a description of the man who performed the ceremony, and such other circumstances as she can remember. Do you see me to-morrow; I will step around to Helen's, now; so good night," and with a hearty shake of the hand, and repeating with much earnestness, that I was a man from "clew to earing," he took his leave.
               I found the girls in high spirits. Julia, of course, perfectly happy in the return of her brother, for she now felt that her only natural protector was both able and willing to shield her from the machinations of Barton, while Helen forgot her own sorrows in sympathy for her friend's joy.
               Briefly announcing the nature of my visit, Helen's countenance lighted up with happiness, for if I should succeed in establishing Barton's villainy, and her consequent innocence, she could rejoice the hearts of her dear parents by convincing them how much more she had been sinned against than sinning, and she felt, that if made aware of the terrible punishment which had been visited upon her disobedience to them, they would take her to their hearts again.
               "Now, Helen," I said, with great earnestness, "I want you to tell me all you can remember about the time, place, and circumstances of your marriage. What kind of a looking man was he who married you? Have you any idea where you went, and can you give me any description of the place? Think carefully, and answer me as correctly as you can, for it is very important to you."
               "He was a tall, spare man, dressed in black, That's about all I can remember of his appearance."
               I thought to myself that was a very slender reed on which to lean, as there were a great many tall and spare men in the city, dressed in black.
               "But what street was it in?"
               "Oh dear! I could not remember, even if I had known. I had only been in the city one day, and had not been out of the hotel until he took me to the person who was to marry us."
               "Was he a minister, do you think?"
               "I am sure he was not, because he did not make any prayer. He had a little book in his hand, it is true, but he did not use it, except when the ceremony was over, he put down our names and ages on a blank leaf, and then made out a certificate from that."
               "Do you remember any thing of the room?"
               "I remember now, Doctor, that when we left the hotel we walked up Broadway for a long distance, and then turned to the right. We went in that direction two blocks—not more, I am sure. The room was a small library. There was an oak table in the middle, covered with green leather, and right over the mantel-piece was a beautiful picture of a lady and two children. One of the children had long flaxen hair hanging down her neck in heavy curls, and I remember thinking what a beautiful child she was."
               "Now, then, when was it?" I asked, having carefully treasured up what she had been saying.
               
               "In October, two years ago. On the 13th."
               "That will do—good night. You will hear from me in a few days, and I hope to some purpose," and with many warm thanks for the pains and interest I had taken in a poor friendless girl, I took my leave.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIX.
               MORE GOOD LUCK.
               HAVING ascertained thus much, it was necessary to take further steps, and my first was to procure from the City Hall, a list of the names and residences of the Aldermen for the year in which the ceremony was performed. This obtained, I determined to act alone, and not entrust to George any more of active duty than was absolutely necessary. To this end, I set him at work upon a Directory, hunting up all the Reverends he could find, promising that when he had completed the list we would go to work.
               I had changed my mind about using his personal services, for the reason, that although he was an honest, noble-hearted fellow, and would do any thing in his power to serve me, I feared that his blunt, unpolished manners would rather injure our cause, and so deceived him into a careful perusal of the Directory. I knew, well enough, where to find the names on the instant, but chose this mode, in order to give him occupation; and tedious as was the duty, I felt assured he would perform it faithfully, though he would much rather have been more actively employed.
               My first visit was to the Police Magistrates, who very often perform the marriage ceremony, and they cheerfully referred to their records, but without success, so far as my object was concerned.
               I next commenced on the Aldermen residing in the upper part of the city, for from Helen's description of the route she had taken on leaving the hotel, I was satisfied, that if the ceremony had been performed by any Alderman, it must have been by one representing one of the upper wards.
               I could not devote much time to this search, as my professional duties required pretty constant attention, so I chose the evenings, as being the period when I would be most likely to find the gentlemen at home.
               I had visited four or five, but only one of them had any record of the marriages performed by him; the others, had entered them immediately in the office of the City Inspector, at the City Hall, but I deferred going there until I had completed my round among the Aldermen.
               The third evening of these visits, (and by the way, George had carefully spelled over the Directory by this time, and had made out a list, as he expressed himself, as long as from "here to there and back again,") I started off rather discouraged as to my prospects, but cheering myself with the hope, that Providence would again interpose in behalf of the injured woman.
               This was the last of the up-town Aldermen upon whom I was about to call, and if he failed me, I resolved to employ some active officer to go among the ministers, instead of George, for that would be an interminable task for me, and I felt that George was not exactly the proper person to prosecute this search.
               My ring at the door of the house occupied by Mr. H——, was speedily answered by a servant, who, in answer to my inquiry for Alderman H——, ushered me into a small and appropriately furnished library. My heart beat faster, and my breath came and went quicker, as a passing glance at its contents showed me that Providence had indeed crowned my efforts with success. There was the oaken centre-table, covered with green leather; and there, over the mantel-piece, was the identical picture described by Helen—the lady and two little girls, and one of them with flaxen, curly hair.
               "My dear sir, I am so glad to see you," I said, as the proprietor of the name and of the house entered, and I ran up grasping his hand with all the warmth of an old friend, quite forgetting that we had never met before.
               Mr. H—— smiled at this very remarkable exhibition of pleasure on the part of a stranger, and when I had dropped his hand, he quietly motioned me to take a seat, which I did, and then for the first time I became sensible of the ridiculous figure I had just cut.
               Rising much more hastily than I had seated myself, I said, "Really, Mr. H——, you must pardon my conduct just now, which you must have thought particularly absurd. My name is Dr.——, and my business here is one of great importance to a friend in whom I feel a deep interest. I have been many days engaged in searching for this table and that picture," and I laid one hand on the table, pointing with the other to the picture.
               Mr. H. smiled again, and this time rather incredulously, evidently beginning to think he had a lunatic to deal with, and I noticed that he kept his eyes fixed on my own in true professional style.
               "Come, come, Mr. H., I see you think I am a little touched here," and I tapped my forehead. "Let me tell you why I was so happy to see you, and why I have been searching for this table and that picture, neither of which, I assure you, did I ever before see."
               Mr. H. bowed, but did not smile this time.
               "You were an alderman in 185—?"
               "I was."
               "You sometimes, while holding that office, performed marriage ceremonies?"
               "Never but twice. I was at my store all day, and not so much in the way of such jobs as many of my fellow members."
               "So much the better, Mr. H; it will render my task the easier."
               "Now, I will tell you why I was so glad to see that table and that picture. A young and innocent country girl was inveigled from her home by a specious villain who brought her to this city in October, 185—. I am deeply interested in the girl, and for very particular reasons have an equal, though a very different interest in the scoundrel who has caused so much trouble and distress. After living with her some time as his wife, he basely deserted her, telling her that the marriage was all a sham. I have the best reason in the world for believing that the marriage was real, and that the poor young girl has been most basely deserted by him who is bound by law to protect and provide for her."
               
               "In such a case," said Mr. H——, with warmth, "I am with you, sir, and will lend every aid in my power."
               "Now, as to the table and picture. I questioned the young woman a few nights since as to what she remembered of the person who performed the ceremony, and the house where it took place. All she could tell me was, that the gentleman was a tall, spare man, dressed in black, and that he didn't say any prayer, and that over the fire-place there hung the portrait of a lady and two children, one of them with long, curly, flaxen ringlets, and that there was an oak table in the room, covered with green leather. Here is the table," I continued, laying my hand on it, with very unnecessary vehemence, "and there is the portrait. You are tall, and spare, and I hope in God's name you are the right person."
               "Upon my word, this is very extraordinary," said Mr. H——, who had heard me through with apparent interest. "I am sure I shall be glad if I am the party you are seeking. But the name? I only married two couples during my term of office, and I have them both down in my book."
               "Robert Barton and Helen Lee," I replied.
               Mr. H—— opened a drawer in the oaken table, and produced thence a small book, looking much like a pocket-book, for it was clasped, and handing it for my inspection, I opened it.
               It was composed of some dozen or twenty leaves of heavy Bristol board, to give it the appearance of a book, but in the centre were two pages printed, of a form for the celebration of the rites of matrimony, originating with one of the Mayors, and which was a combination of the civil and ecclesiastical forms. The rest of the book was blank.
               Turning over the blank leaves, I came to some entries, and the first that met my eye was the one I sought, "Robert Barton, aged twenty-five; Helen Lee, aged twenty years—October 13th, 185—."
               "Mr. H——," I said, tendering my hand, "don't think me a fool, but as I entered this room, I was sure that success was to crown my efforts in behalf of a friendless and unhappy woman. There is the entry I have been looking for; and now, only one question—Would you recognize those parties?"
               "Certainly; I remember thinking what a handsome couple they made; the man was really a fine, splendid-looking fellow—the girl a sweet, modest, retiring thing. Remember them! yes, of course I would. I was as much flurried as they were, as it was the first time I had performed the ceremony, and I recollect after they had gone condemning myself for not asking more questions than I did."
               "Were there any witnesses?"
               "My wife and daughter came in, at my 
                     reqnest
                     request
                  ; nobody else was present."
               "Could you spare half an hour to help right a great wrong, Mr. H——?"
               "Yes, a dozen of them."
               "Then please come with me; it won't take you more than an hour;" and hastily summoning his servant, he left word that he would be home in about an hour, and in a moment was hatted and gloved, ready to accompany me.
               "You have taken a great deal of pains in this matter, Dr.——, "he said, as we walked along towards the abode of Helen, for it was there I was conducting him.
               "Not more than the importance of the case demanded. This Barton is mixed up in the affairs of a family in whom I have the deepest interest, and this disclosure is of immense importance to my plans with reference to them; besides, I am anxious to see the young, deserted wife established in her rights."
               "Will she live with him again?"
               "Not for half New-York; her contempt for him is too great to dream of that; but she wants to be put aright with her parents, from whom she eloped with him. They think that she is leading a life of infamy in New-York, while I know that she is a virtuous, industrious, hard-working, and most unhappy woman. Why, the scoundrel was about to perpetrate a similar outrage on a young girl whom I know, and would have succeeded, if his wife had not, by some Providential interference, met her infamous husband in company with her, and to whom of course she made all known."
               "He must be an infamous scoundrel."
               "He is precisely that, and nothing else, without one redeeming trait."
               In a few moments we reached the house occupied by Julia and Helen, and ascended to the room of the latter, when, after knocking unsuccessfully two or three times, I proceeded to Julia's apartment, where my summons was answered by Julia's "come in," and we entered.
               As I supposed, we found the girls together, and as Helen caught sight of Mr. H——, she started forward with a cry of joy, for she had recognized him on the instant.
               He turned to me, with a smile of satisfaction, and said, "Doctor, the recognition is mutual; that is the girl I married to Robert Barton, though she is paler and thinner now."
               "She has had enough to drive the color from her cheeks and to take the flesh from her bones, since you saw her. Helen, this is the gentleman, Alderman H——, who married you."
               "Then I was really married?"
               "As surely, Madam, and as strongly as all the priests in the world could have done it; I remember you distinctly," said Mr. H——, earnestly.
               "Thank God—thank God!" she exclaimed, springing forward; and seizing the Alderman's unresisting hand, she bathed it with her tears.
               "And next, dear Doctor," and she approached me with streaming eyes, extending her hand, but before I could reach her own, she threw herself upon my neck, and sobbed as if her heart would break. She had no room for words, nor had I, and I made no attempt to speak.
               Mr. H—— had stood a silent, but not unmoved spectator of this scene, for his own eyes were moist with tears.
               How long this might have continued I know not, but it was interrupted by the sudden and unannounced entrance of George Seaton, who bounced into the room uttering one of his sea phrases, but who stood as still as though he had been turned into a statue, as he observed the position of things.
               "Well, I suppose this means something," he said, "but you may make a marine of me if I know what it means."
               "It means, George," I replied, "that I have got the weather-
                     guage
                     gauge
                   of you; that while you have been spelling out the Directory, I have found the man."
               "God bless you, old fellow," he said, taking in my meaning at once, and grasping Mr. H——'s hand, "so you're the man that spliced them. Hurra, Doctor, hurra," and going up to Julia, he seized her in his brawny arms, and almost squeezed the breath out of her body; and not content with that, he paid Helen the same compliment, to which she made no resistance, for she knew that the impulse which prompted him, sprang from a noble, generous heart.
               "Doctor, you've headed me off, I see, but I haven't a word to say. Steer your own course, and I'll follow you."
               "Mr. H——," said I, "this is the brother of Julia, and a hard customer, as you see, but his heart is in the right place. So don't mind him."
               "But I do mind him. I love an honest man wherever I meet him, and I'll swear he is honest. Give us your hand again, my friend," and he extended tended his hand to the ready grasp of the happy sailor.
               But I won't prolong this scene. I had succeeded to the very extent of my expectations, and from my heart thanked the over-ruling Providence which had guided me in my efforts to expose and defeat the villainy sought to be practised.
               As we left the house, that is the alderman and myself, for George chose to remain, to have some fun as he termed it, with the girls, I said to Mr. H——,
               "I have one more favor to ask of you; I want you to see Barton, and if you recognize him, every thing is known which I can require. Would you do me that favor?"
               "Do it—why, Doctor, you have given me an hour of such real happiness, as I have not known in many a day. Would I do it? I'd go to New Orleans to see him."
               "You need not do that, Mr. H——. He is in this city. Just now he does not show himself by daylight, for he received a tremendous pounding the other day, at the hands of George Seaton, that young giant whom you saw there. Seaton chanced to overhear him use his sister's name disrespectfully, and he gave him such a thrashing as he won't forget for many a day."
               "Good, I like him for that. He's a rough customer to deal with, I should think."
               "You would be very sure of it, if you saw Barton's face."
               "Oh, then, you know this Barton?"
               "I'll tell you all about it, in good time. Now, I thank you for your kindness in this matter, and perhaps you will find your reward when you know how much you have contributed to the happiness of others. Mr. H——, you may have to be made a party to a very disagreeable affair. You won't object?"
               "Not if I can serve that unfortunate girl, and aid to punish the scoundrel who deceived her."
               "That's only part of it; I will let you know more hereafter. May I rely upon you?"
               "With all my heart and soul," he said, earnestly, as he clasped my hand, and we parted.
               Early in the following week, having put Mr. Barin presentable condition, I called on the Alderman, and inviting him to a restaurant down town, asked him to remain a few minutes, while I went for the party whom I trusted he would recognize.
               Proceeding to the store where Barton was employed, I made some business excuse for being in that part of the city at such an unusual hour of the day, and he gladly accepted the invitation to join me in a glass of wine and some oysters.
               I took him of course to the restaurant where the Alderman was in waiting, and as we entered he nodded his head to me, as if to say, "that is the man," and without noticing him, we partook of our refreshments.
               "Is that the man?" I asked, when Barton had left, for he had to hurry back to the store.
               "As sure as my name is—"
               "Then, alderman, all I have to say is, that from my heart I thank you, for you have enabled me to confound vice and treachery, and to save the character of an injured woman."
               "Call on me at any time, if you want any further evidence," he said, shaking my hand warmly, for, without knowing more than I had chosen to mention, he had surmised that there was some other villainy on foot, which I was trying to thwart.
               Thanking him for his proffered kindness, and with mutual expressions of regard, we parted.
               I proceeded at once to see Helen Lee, or Helen Barton, as she was now fully entitled to call herself, and her joy at the full realization of her hopes, was unbounded; for now, said she, with streaming eyes, "I can write to my dear parents, that wrongfully and wickedly as I acted, I have not disgraced them, except cept," she added, "by bearing the name of one so unworthy the love of a virtuous woman."
               Having thus completed these important discoveries, it became necessary that I should admit George into my further confidence, but I did not do so until he gave me his word, as a man and a sailor, that he would do nothing contrary to my directions, and that if I commanded, he would even refrain from thrashing Barton again, if he had the opportunity; and this latter promise, I assured him, if faithfully kept, would save me three hundred dollars.
               "Faith," he said, with glistening eyes, "I wish I had three hundred dollars, I think I'd give it for a fair chance at that scoundrel. But no matter, Doctor, I have given you my word, and I won't break it."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XX.
               HOME AGAIN.
               AS we descended from the carriage, I saw George standing near the stoop of the house, evidently waiting for me. I gave him a nod, as much as to say, "Follow me," and buttoning up his coat, as if to prepare for action, he followed our party into the house.
               Mr. Evarts and his daughter led the way, arm in arm. Dr. D—— and myself brought up the rear, while, in obedience to my commands hastily whispered, George and Dinah remained in the hall, awaiting my summons.
               In this position we entered the parlor, where we found Mrs. Evarts, Mattie, and Barton, engrossed in interesting and evidently amusing conversation, for they were laughing excessively as we made our appearance.
               At the first glance they all arose, and it was evident that Mrs. Evarts did not recognize Cora, for she was dressed in deep morning, and had probably changed much since she had been seen in that apartment.
               An instant sufficed to tell the wily woman who she was, and advancing with outstretched arms, Mrs. Evarts exclaimed, "my dear, my darling Cora, do I see you again?"
               Before, however, she had measured half the distance which separated them, Mr. Evarts, dropping his daughter's arm, and stepping forward to intercept her further progress, stretched out his hand, and in a voice whose tones could not be soon forgotten, said, "Off viper—do not dare to pollute my daughter with your unholy touch."
               "Mr. Evarts," said his wife, shrinking back, and looking, as indeed she well might be, unutterably astonished, "What does this mean? Surely, that language was not intended for me, your wife."
               "Oh, pa," chimed in Mattie, advancing and laying her hand upon Mr. Evarts' arm, but he shrank from her touch, as from contact with some loathsome reptile, while she stood aghast at the look of ineffable contempt which he cast upon her.
               "Pardon me, Miss Martha," he said, with a look of the most supreme scorn, "I do not desire to claim the honor you accord to me; your father would, doubtless, be proud of the honor of hailing you by that title; I have no such ambition. I am sorry he cannot be here to claim you."
               At these words, Mrs. Evarts and her daughter turned deadly pale; but that might be attributable to the extraordinary position in which they found themselves thus suddenly placed.
               Mrs. Evarts was excessively agitated, but assuming an air of defiance, she swung her dress around so as to admit her readier progress, and advancing close to her husband, placed her hand upon her hips, and with the most unblushing effrontery, said, "I should like to know very much, Mr. Evarts, what all this mummery means. How dare you use such language to my daughter? and how dare you, sir," (and she emphasized the word most sensibly), "bring that woman into our presence?" and she pointed to Cora, who stood hanging upon her father's arm, pale, mute, but determined, for she knew she had friends beside her. "What does this mean, sir?" she repeated, with flashing eyes, and a countenance fairly crimsoned with rage.
               "It means simply this," he replied, with a composure almost theatrical, so perfect was it, showing that he had completely mastered the terrible excitement under which he had labored as he entered the house, "that I have brought my daughter to preside in my own house, from which, when I was mean and base enough to believe your lies, I drove her. It means, Madam, that I know you—that I have discovered your vileness and unworthiness, and it means, moreover, that she is henceforth the mistress of this establishment. Is that plain enough for you?"
               "I shall be happy to know," she said, with a supercilious air, "that she is worthy of the honor you have done her, but until I am convinced," (and she drew herself up with an expression which even Cleopatra might have copied), "you cannot expect that my daughter or myself can consent to associate with her; I can never consent that my daughter's morals shall be contaminated by contact with——"
               "Silence, Madam," he said, in a voice almost of thunder, "nor dare to utter one single word against my child; she is too pure to be named in the same breath with such polluted beings as yourselves."
               But as he spoke, he turned to me, and caught such an appealing look from me not to hasten the denouement, that checking himself, he said, calmly, "I had not, Madam, the most remote idea of placing you in such a contingency. I am perfectly aware that it would be disagreeable to you to live under the same roof with her, and I therefore advise you to make preparations for your instant removal;" and although he commenced in a calm, sober tone of voice, he wound up with a tone of perfect fierceness.
               "Nay, Madam," he continued, seeing that she was about to speak, "you need not waste your breath; it is not only my intention, but my deliberate purpose, and my determined resolution, that you shall not reside under the same roof another day. You may make your preparations for leaving as soon as you choose."
               "Sir! Mr. Evarts—this to me—your wife, your daughter?" she exclaimed, advancing towards him, half-imploringly, "you cannot mean this; do you know that you are speaking to your wife, and that I am entitled to——?"
               "Wife! Madam, I disown you. How dare you use that sacred name in my presence, and to me? Your husband, Madam, would be glad to hear from you, and so would your father, Miss Martha," he added, with a contemptuous sneer.
               "Mr. Evarts," said the undaunted woman, bristling up to him with flashing eyes, "I want to know what all this means? I am your lawful wife, and you cannot thus discard me—you shall not, for by——"
               "Madam, you are not my wife, and well you know it," he said very calmly. "Your husband is now where you would be, if I could so disgrace myself as to expose you. Be content that I am merciful, and do not urge me too far."
               "I defy you, sir—I defy you," she fairly screamed, "you have invented a parcel of lies to——"
               "Doctor, call her up," he said, turning to me with a coolness which I could not too much honor; and as I turned to obey his directions, she continued, with a voice trembling with emotion, for she saw the ground on which she had so long and in such security stood, trembling beneath her—the foundation on which she had built her hopes, crumbling beneath her feet—"you have made grave and dreadful charges against a woman whom you have sworn to love and cherish, but whom you are seeking now, for some purpose which I cannot divine, to destroy; you bring dreadful charges against an innocent and unoffending girl, who has been taught to look upon you as her friend, her benefactor, her father. You know them to be groundless, but you have trumped them up for some vile purpose of your own; and to the latest hour of your life, you will repent your present conduct. You cannot—I defy you to throw a shadow upon my character, which you now assail, and the infamous manner in which you dare to speak of"—
               "Sarah Horton," said Mr. Evarts, with the most imperturbable composure. "I know you, and if I did not, here is one who does," and he pointed to Dinah, who entered the room at that moment, followed by myself.
               "I do not know what you mean. My name is not, and never was, Sarah Horton," she said, boldly "I am Sarah Evarts, and I defy the world to disprove it."
               At that moment Dinah advanced towards the light, and as Mrs. Evarts caught a view of her, she faltered, but only for an instant.
               "Yes, sir; I defy you to deny or disprove it?"
               "Doctor," said Mr. Evarts, turning to me, with a smile, "this woman is a regular lawyer, she denies every thing, and insists upon proof. Dinah, come here," and, in obedience to the summons, Dinah advanced into the full glare of the light.
               Mrs. Evarts now scrutinized her very closely, and from the expression of her countenance I could see that she recognized her, but turning to her husband with a look of ineffable scorn, she said, "And is this your proof? Is this your witness, on whose evidence you seek to condemn and disgrace your own wife? What has this woman to do with me?"
               "Do you not know her, Madam?"
               "Know her! Yes; as a vicious, lying slave, who ran away from me years ago, and who deserves as good a horsewhipping as I would give her if I had her in Alabama."
               "Now, Dinah, tell your story; perhaps she will believe you can tell the truth after all, if you are a negro."
               It would be worse than folly to undertake to follow Dinah in her narrative. The vials of her long-pent wrath were now uncorked, and such a torrent of truth and abuse, of narrative and invective, I never heard before or since.
               She commenced from her earliest acquaintance with Mrs. Evarts, and traced her career from that hour until she became the wife of one of the most notorious villains in the Southern country—a man who was at that very hour in the State Prison of Louisiana for a foul murder, he having escaped hanging only by the obstinacy of one friend who was on the jury.
               As Dinah, with impassioned gestures, went on with her narrative, Mrs. Evarts gradually receded from her, until at length, completely overwhelmed and condemned beyond the possibility of denial, she sank mute and motionless upon the sofa, by the side of Martha, who had, with Robert Barton, remained a passive, but not an uninterested listener.
               Nor did Martha pass unscathed, for after closing with the mother, Dinah narrated some passages in the earlier life of the daughter, which, had she not been struck dumb, and almost senseless, by the suddenness of the blow just inflicted, would have called the blush even to her cheek.
               "There, Massa Doctor, that's all I got to say," she said, turning to me, when she had ended, and she flirted out of the room with an air of offended dignity, for the idea of a horsewhipping had aroused all the vindictiveness of her character, and possibly may have led her to color some portions of her narrative pretty highly.
               "That's a very pretty story," said Barton, turning to Mrs. Evarts, who was beside him on the sofa.
               "Hold your tongue, you fool," was all the reply she vouchsafed.
               "Now, Madam," said Mr. Evarts, "you have heard thus much, do you wish for more? I have abundant evidence here of your vile plot to ruin my daughter and destroy my peace for the sake of my fortune. Shame on you! Shame on womanhood!"
               "Not a word, Mr. Evarts. I do not wish to hear another word from you," she said, haughtily, and rising from the sofa. "If you can stoop so low as to arraign your wife—your faithful, devoted wife, upon such charges and on such evidence, I cannot so far degrade myself as to reply to them. I cannot condescend to put my word on a par with that of a negress and a prost—"
               "Hold, Madam; do not finish that word, or you may dearly repent it."
               "And you, Doctor—I suppose, from your appearance here," she continued, turning to me, and without seeming to notice Mr. Evarts, "that I may safely conclude you have some agency in this most reputable transaction. I can imagine now, why I found you in attendance on my servant."
               I bowed, and said, "it was my good fortune to have lent some aid in the matter, but as John's name had not been mentioned as yet by any one, I begged to ask what he had to do with it?"
               She was fairly caught there, and for an instant seemed cowed, but recovering her self-possession as quickly, she said, "of course not, but I presume now that you were there to tutor him as to the lies he was to tell upon this occasion. Had you not better produce him, too?"
               "Here they are, Madam; here are the lies I have instructed him to tell," I said, "under his own hand," handing to Mr. Evarts the joint statement of John and Julia; "and even Julia has been also tutored, for she too condemns you, and exposes your entire conduct."
               "Well, I think it's time for me to leave," said Mr. Barton, rising; "I will bid you a very good morning, as I don't care to be a party to any further family quarrels."
               "You had better not go just yet, Mr. Barton," I said, very coolly; "George Seaton is at the door, and perhaps he may not have forgotten you yet;" and as I spoke, he sank back into his seat, trembling at the sound of that name, the perspiration starting at every pore, for he had not forgotten the young giant who had left such terrible marks upon him before, and whose name he knew well enough at the time, though he had concealed it from me.
               "I have a few words to say to you, Sir, too, before you do go."
               "Doctor, call George, will you," and in a moment George was in the room. His piercing eye caught sight of Barton on the instant, and he made a movement of advancing towards him with clenched fists and flashing eyes, but a word from me checked him.
               "I wish every one here to know, and you especially, Miss Horton," and I turned to Mattie, "for you may be most deeply interested, that this honorable gentleman has a wife living now in this city."
               "It's a lie—a wicked lie, Sir, and I dare you to prove it."
               "Oh, certainly; I came prepared for that. I have found out the Alderman who married you to Helen Lee. Perhaps you remember the day when we went to the eating-house together; he was there then, and recognized you; and more than that, I have his certificate of your marriage. It would hardly be safe for you, Sir, to try another wife, in this city at least. And now you, Miss Mattie, are warned; you can do as you choose."
               "One word more, Sir," I said, seeing that he was about to interrupt me, "a warrant will be out for your arrest, on a charge of abandonment, before the day is out, and if you are found here within twenty-four hours, you may find some difficulty in obtaining bail, unless Mr. Evarts will go your surety."
               
               "You are a meddling puppy, Sir, and you shall hear from me for this."
               "No, I won't; as soon as you leave this house, you will make the best of your way out of New-York; you are too fond of yourself to run the risk of being sent to the Tombs. That's all, Sir; you can go now, if you wish. No, George, no violence," I said, seeing George looking at me imploringly, as if asking permission to give him a little taste of his quality; and true to his promise, the young sailor restrained himself.
               Mr. Barton walked leisurely up to Mr. Evarts, and with a look which he meant for contempt, said, "You old fool; ten days more and I would have had you fast—you have had a narrow escape, thanks to that puppy there," meaning me.
               "And you will have to thank that puppy for a lucky escape yourself, unless you keep a more civil tongue, for George there looks very anxious."
               Without deigning any reply, he was about leaving the room, without even saying farewell to his partners in iniquity, when Mattie sprang forward, and seizing his arm, exclaimed, "Oh, Robert, surely you don't mean to leave us now?"
               "You may all go to the——together for all I care. You have brought all this on yourselves, and you may get out of it the best way you can;" and shaking her off, he left the room, followed with longing eyes by George, but unnoticed by either of my party.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXI.
               DRAWING TO A CLOSE.
               "NOW, Mrs. Horton, I presume I need not point out the only course left for you to pursue," said Mr. Evarts, turning to the cowed and amazed woman, who remained still seated on the sofa.
               "My name, Sir, is Evarts—Sarah Evarts. The law has given me a title to that name, and to my rights as your wife, and the law alone shall compel me to yield them," she said, recovering some of her self-possession.
               "As you please, Madam—take what course you please in regard to that. But in one thing I must have my way, and that immediately. This is my house—this is my daughter; I need not say, both of you cannot remain under the same roof, and I choose that my daughter shall. So far as regards any rights you may claim as my reputed wife, perhaps you will do well to think before you act; for my part I am quite willing to spare you, and would gladly spare myself the deep mortification which an exposure of your wickedness and my folly must entail. Do therefore as you choose, but remember that I am fully prepared to substantiate every thing I have said."
               "Now, Madam," he continued, deliberately pulling out his watch, "it is nearly eleven o'clock. By four o'clock this house must be rid of your presence, and that of your daughter, or I shall invoke the aid of the law to compel it."
               "Every article belonging to you, take with you, and do not leave any thing which can remind me of your baseness and my weakness. Such as you cannot take to-day shall be sent to-morrow, to any address you may direct."
               This was spoken in such a calm, imperturbable tone, as left no room for hope that he would relent, and now Mrs. Evarts for the first time fully realized that her day of power had passed indeed.
               For an instant she stood glaring at him, with fury in her eyes, and then unable longer to restrain or keep down the terrible passion raging within her, she commenced a tirade of the lowest and most vulgar abuse I ever heard from any human lips.
               It was so low, so vile, so infamous in its character, the womanhood of Cora, who had throughout maintained a silence broken only on her part by her sobs, would not permit her to listen, and she left the room.
               Mr. Evarts uttered not one word; he made no effort to stop her. He did not seem discomposed or even astonished, but stood calmly, coldly listening, and when she had concluded, and thrown herself upon the sofa in an agony of bitter tears of rage and disappointment, he said, quite coolly,
               "There is one thing I had forgotten. When it was my misfortune to marry you, I settled twenty thousand dollars upon you. The marriage being illegal, that settlement fails, but I will not see you suffer, vile as you are, and much as you have deserved it; but, it will be on the sole condition that you instantly leave this city, and that you never dare to mention my name in connection with your own; Do you accept those terms?"
               Mrs. Evarts caught a ray of hope at these words, and drying her tears, hastily said—
               "Heaven knows, sir, it was none of my desire to become your wife, or to be honored," she sneered, "by bearing your name."
               "Then, I suppose, we may consider that settled?"
               "For the present—yes, sir. Come, Martha," she said, turning to the astounded girl, "your precious father has might on his side now, but he will regret it and repent this to the latest hour of his life. And as for that paragon of purity and innocence, I shall take good care, sir, that if you are determined not to believe what I know to be true of her, the world shall," and she sailed towards the door with an air of a tragedy queen.
               As she uttered this threat, Mr. Evarts actually stood aghast, for he well knew how reckless and vindictive was the woman with whom he had to deal, and she, foreseeing the effect which her words had on him, paused, and said—
               "I will make the city ring with her shame, sir; I will make her repent to the last hour of her life, that she ever crossed my path, and then we will see who will triumph," and she gazed at him with a look of malignant pleasure, for she knew how to wound him in the most tender spot.
               "Madam—devil!" said Mr. Evarts, with vehemence, advancing towards her, "if I ever hear that my daughter's name is polluted by your lips or those of your well-matched child, the heaviest vengeance the law can inflict shall be visited on you. Remember ber, Madam, it is only to my mercy you owe your present liberty; if I were to mete out justice to you, you would share your precious husband's fate, and become the inmate of a prison. Beware; you know me well enough to feel that I am in earnest. These are my last words to you, and remember them."
               "Where is Cora?" he said, turning to me, and going into the hall, I found her there sitting on a chair, weeping bitterly.
               Leading her up to her father, he embraced her with all the warmth of his earliest love, and taking both her hands, he said, "my child, this is your home, your house—and thank God, I am spared to say that I am again your father. May God grant you all the happiness you deserve, and all a father's love would cheerfully bestow upon you."
               Mrs. Evarts did not venture another word, but left the room, followed by her weeping and subdued daughter, and I saw no more of them.
               "Doctor," said Mr. Evarts, turning to me, "there is no use in my trying to thank you; I have not words to do it. You know my feelings. And you, Dr. D——, I thank too from my heart. Our good friend here has told me of the kindly aid you have rendered, and I shall not forget it. You will both dine with us to-day? By the way, where is that rascal, Clarence?"
               "Oh, he is safe," I said; "I saw him with Dinah as I went into the hall. He is happy enough, now; he is not old enough to share our present happiness; leave him where he is."
               That however did not suit, and Master Clarence must be brought up, and after a tremendous hugging from his mother and Mr. Evarts, was permitted to escape, and find his own pleasure in tumbling about the room.
               A few minutes, it seemed to us, were passed in commenting upon the past occurrences, though we had really been conversing more than an hour, when the parlor door was opened, and Mrs. Evarts, dressed and hatted, entered, followed by Martha.
               "Day—day, good folks," she said with the most provoking impudence, "you shall hear from us soon. Mattie, dear, go and kiss your Pa good-bye; it may be a long time before you meet again," but Mattie wisely shrunk from the allotted task. "There is my address," she said, throwing her card on the floor. "You can send my things as soon as you choose. Have we your permission to go now, Sir?"
               Mr. Evarts looked at me with a smile of such deep meaning, I readily interpreted it, and stepping forward, I took up her card, and said, "Mr. Evarts authorizes me to say that your things shall be sent immediately."
               "Oh, yes—he authorizes you; I dare say you will have a good deal of authority here, yet; I shouldn't wonder if you had found Madam Innocence there as kind as Mr. Barton did," and with a scornful laugh, she left the room, just escaping an explosion from her insulted and injured husband.
            
            
               CONCLUSION.
               I SUPPOSE the reader would like to know what became of the parties with whom he has become acquainted in the preceding chapters, and I shall tell that in the exact words of the Doctor.
               "As for Helen Lee, for she absolutely refused to be called Barton, I wrote to her parents in Otsego county, detailing the circumstances with which I had become acquainted.
               "A few days brought a letter, full of love and forgiveness, begging her to come back and bless their old age with her presence. This was an appeal she could not resist, and she is there now, for all I know to the contrary.
               "Julia Seaton married a young carpenter, who was set up in business by Mr. Evarts, and he is now doing a thriving business.
               "George was well cared for by Mr. Evarts, and he now commands a brig trading hence to Havana." 
               "But Mrs. Marvin?" I inquired.
               "Oh, yes; I nearly forgot her: I married her myself. You see, her husband was lost in a gale of wind off Cape Horn, and sooner than allow her to end her days alone, I made her my wife; and she rather thinks her second marriage is likely to turn out better than her father's. At all events, he thinks so, and I know so."
