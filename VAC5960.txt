            THE SEA-KING
            
               CHAPTER I.
               MANY years ago there stood upon the banks of the Schuylkill a mansion, at that
                  time much admired for the beauty and chastity of its construction. It was one of
                  those old-fashioned tenements that may be seen even now in some cities of Virginia
                  and Maryland. It consisted of a main building and two smaller wings; a huge flight
                  of marble steps conducted to the main entrance, and the upper stories were lighted
                  by oriel windows; in front, a long gravelled avenue interspersed with Lombardy
                  poplars, and terminating with an arched gateway at the road side, afforded a
                  passage through the domain; and in the rear at the foot of the ascent, upon the
                  summit of which stood the dwelling, were situated the barn, stables, and
                  carriage-houses. The grounds in the vicinity were laid out in flower-beds,
                  redolent with all the roses of America, and long arched arbours of blushing grapes
                  flanked the garden on either hand; to the right of the mansion a beautiful
                  summer-house rose from the pinnacle of a steep rock, and round and about its
                  slender columns bloomed the white jessamine, the yellow marigold, and the azure
                  violet; the ivy, too, wound around this fairy bower, as if to assert its native
                  right over the elegant intruders; and hero and there a wild rose bloomed in
                  elegant contrast with those that had been transplanted to beautify the
                  locality.
               From this site the view was magnificent. On the right, far as the eye could reach,
                  were seen the blue waters of the Delaware stretching away to seaward, broken here
                  and there by headlands, and dotted in many parts of its surface by vessels passing
                  to and from Philadelphia; on the left and in front, on the further side of the
                  further river, were seen the green fields and forests of New Jersey; immediately
                  under your feet flowed the glassy waters of the Schuylkill, and between the two
                  streams rose the city itself, like some vast panorama set in a frame of glittering
                  silver. It was a sunny morning in the loveliest month of the year; a gentle breeze came sweeping along laden
                  with the fragrance of every flower it passed, rippling the waters of the river,
                  and showering its perfume and freshness amid the streets of the city; the grass
                  was yet moist, and the big dew-drops still sparkled upon the odorous lilac; the
                  carol of a thousand birds swelled in the glad air, and the lowing of cattle and
                  bleating of flocks imparted an animation to the rurality of the scene which was
                  enchanting. All nature seemed alive with joy: the beautiful Schuylkill murmured
                  with a happy sound, as it rushed along its rocky bed, embracing each water lily in
                  its course, and the green leaves of the forest rustled in lively confusion against
                  each other; the earth smiled in its gorgeous carpeting; the waters sparkled in
                  their beauty; the sun dazzled with superior brilliancy, and not one cloud frowned
                  in all the broad blue of Heaven.
               A single individual sat gazing upon the scene from one of the parlours of the
                  mansion, but its harmony seemed to mock him, for there was a deep frown upon his
                  brow, and his eye glowed with rage as it roamed with more than the insipidity of
                  satiety over the face of Nature. The age of the stranger was nearly half a
                  century; his countenance had evidently been at one time handsome, but fierce and
                  unconquerable passions had planted lines there that left but few traces of former
                  beauty. Increasing years seemed to affect him differently from other men; there
                  was none of the mildness of old age in his countenance, and it would even be
                  difficult to imagine that those stern forbidding features could ever soften into a
                  smile; time, instead of weakening his vehement energies, had added to them new
                  strength, and the violent impulses of that man were more indomitable at fifty than
                  they had been at fifteen. Though he had already lived to nearly the number of
                  years allotted to man, all his experience had failed in teaching him humility. The
                  sorrows and cares of life, while they affected him perhaps more keenly than other
                  men, had not upon his disposition the same salutary influence that they exercised
                  over every one beside; and like the mountain torrent, his passions gathered
                  strength and fierceness as they rushed onwards to that ocean that would soon close
                  over them in peace and quietude.
               It was evident, from the frequent and impatient glances he cast towards the door,
                  that he was in waiting for some one; twice he reached for the bell-string, but as
                  often paused on hearing a noise without; at length, however, when his patience had
                  become well nigh exhausted, the door opened, and a youth of sixteen entered the
                  apartment.
               For a moment they mutually observed each other in silence, the father scowling
                  with wrath and the son looking him calmly but not disrespectfully in the eye.
                  Harry Sutherland had viewed the angry cloud upon his parent's brow too often in
                  his life to be awed by the storm it betokened, and he stood up before him
                  collected almost to indifference.
               "Did you wish to see me, pa?" asked the boy, with a composure that irritated his
                  sire more than perhaps the offence for which he was arraigned.
               "Wish to see you, sir!" repeated the father in a loud, angry, and sarcastic tone;
                  "no, sir, I never wished to see you—never; I would be glad, sir, if you were
                  removed to some remote corner of the earth, where your presence could never offend
                  my eyes, and where reports of your disobedience and bad conduct could never reach
                  my ears."
               The son made no reply; for words from him, he well knew, could not assuage the
                  wrath of his exasperated father.
               "You are notorious for discreditable actions, sir," resumed the angry parent;
                  "your very name is a synonome with infamy, you are a disgrace to both yourself and
                  me."
               "But, father, I have not disobeyed you in this matter; you accuse me wrongfully
                  this time, for I will convince you, if you will do me the favour to listen
                  dispassionately for a moment, that I am totally innocent."
               "I cannot believe you, sir," replied the parent, hastily; "I cannot believe
                  you—no, sir, no, you are guilty, guilty of that affence and a thousand others.
                  Innocence never was with you an attribute; your whole career has been one of
                  insubordination and irregularity."
               "But, father, though I may have committed many faults, I may yet be innocent of
                  one," said Harry.
               "Don't attempt to reason with me, sir!" exclaimed the sire. "And hark ye, young
                  man, in after years, when your profligacy shall have involved you in difficulty
                  and disgrace, tell it not that I caused your ruin; recollect, sir, that I have
                  taken with you all the pains a father could bestow upon the most obedient child;
                  and what has been the result—how have you repaid me?"
               "But, father, let me explain—"
               "Don't father me, sir," interrupted the parent, "you are no son of mine—no son of
                  mine; from henceforth I disclaim you—I disown you—I denounce you; there runs not a
                  drop of my blood in your veins—not a drop, not one drop;" and as he concluded, he
                  sprang from his chair and commenced pacing the apartment, muttering incoherent
                  invectives at every stride.
               Harry Sutherland had at first borne the angry tempest of his father's wrath with
                  composure and meekness; but when the sire, inflamed by passion, rejected and
                  denied him, his face turned as pale as death, and he trembled in every limb from
                  excessive agitation, his features twitched convulsively, and the big tears started
                  in his beautiful blue eyes; but with one powerful struggle he mastered his
                  feelings, and, though his countenance settled in repose, it was a dreadful stillness, that chased
                  away the colour from his cheek until long after that painful interview.
               The distress of the son was unperceived at first by the father, who still
                  continued pacing the apartment, and whose spleen had by this time well nigh vented
                  itself; and when he raised his eyes and discovered the emotion which his harsh
                  words had aroused in the breast of his child, he stopped suddenly, and his
                  features waxed into a milder but still repulsive expression. Whether it was that
                  he was softened by an appearance of what he thought penitence, an appearance which
                  his wayward boy had never evinced on any former occasion of the kind, or whether
                  it was that his heart rebuked him for his unnecessary and unfeeling violence, is
                  an enigma that none but he could have solved; but certain it was, that one or the
                  other asserted a powerful and immediate influence over him at the moment.
               "You were saying," said he, in a lower tone than he had previously exercised,
                  "that you could explain away your offence of last night; I hope you will be
                  competent to the task—go on, sir."
               "I am sorry I cannot oblige you," said the son, with apparent mildness.
               "How, sir! did I not understand you to say that you could clear up the matter in a
                  satisfactory manner?"
               "I could have done so, had you permitted me when I first proposed it; it would be
                  supererogatory to attempt it now."
               "Why so, sir?" demanded the father, sharply; "if it was then in your power, is it
                  not equally so now?"
               "It is, sir," replied the son.
               "Then why not make the explanation?"
               "It is too late now, sir."
               "Do you not dread my anger, young man?"
               "Very much, when it is justly conceived," replied Harry.
               "Convince me then that I have been mistaken."
               "It matters not, now, sir. I have been rebuked for the offence—it would be
                  unnecessary at this time."
               "And you will not undeceive me?"
               "No, sir."
               The father hesitated a moment, as if in doubt as to the proper course to be
                  pursued. At first, he was disposed to become again enraged; but when he met the
                  calm, bold, blue eye of his high-spirited son, he became at once convinced that
                  such a measure could be productive of no good consequences.
               "Stubborn boy!" said he, at length, biting his lips with vexation, which he in
                  vain endeavoured to conceal; "explain but that matter, and I tender you my sincere
                  forgiveness."
               "Forgiveness!" exclaimed the youth, with a cold, ghastly smile upon his lips;
                  "forgiveness, and for what, sir?"
               The father could not at that moment have replied to that calm, though withering
                  interrogatory, had his life been dependent upon a response; he was confounded,
                  dispossessed, and the colour even came to that cheek, hardened as it had been by
                  the winds of fifty winters. A minute elapsed, and that painful silence was still
                  reigning—he could not break it—twice he strove, but the words froze upon his lips,
                  and the proud, the haughty, the imperious, this iron-hearted
                  parent was humbled by his own injured son.
               Harry saw the anguish of his sire; he felt his own triumph too; and, though it was
                  a proud moment for him, he was too generous to take advantage of his mastery. He
                  could not injure the feelings of a father, though that father had never spared
                  his; he was touched, and in mercy he resumed.
               "After the acknowledgments you have to-day made, I can no longer remain an inmate
                  of your house. The obligations I am under to you are infinite, and shall never be
                  forgotten, though they can never be repaid. I am not wanting in gratitude, sir,
                  though I may have been in rectitude; and that my unfortunate, though involuntary
                  errors, may not in future disturb your equanimity, I shall perpetrate them in
                  another sphere. It has been my misfortune to offend you, sir, never my fault; I
                  endeavoured to please you. I would have ultimately done better; it has long been
                  my study, sir, and if I have often failed, it is not that I am unwilling to
                  succeed; the events of to-day, however, render it unnecessary for me to persist in
                  trying to gratify you. I can have no further claims upon your affection; every tie
                  but the simple feeling that binds one man to another, you have dissolved between
                  us. Farewell, sir!" and as he concluded he suddenly withdrew from the apartment,
                  leaving his father motionless with amazement.
               "Come back, my Harry, come back!" exclaimed the miserable parent, when surprise at
                  length permitted him to speak; but no reply broke the dead silence that succeeded.
                  Where were now the violent passions of that proud man? he turned pale, trembled,
                  and a tear moistened his eye; he tottered to the window, raised the sash, and was
                  just in time to obtain a parting glance of his offended boy, as he descended a
                  knoll on his way to the city.
               Though Harry Sutherland was but a youth in years and experience, he was a man in
                  feeling and character; his qualities had all been fully developed, and though age
                  might, perhaps, confirm them, it could not change their general character in any
                  other manner. Like all persons who have a restraint imposed upon them, he was wild
                  and irregular when freed from the immediate influence of that thraldom, and had of
                  late indulged in a series of frolicsome and mischievous pranks, one of which gave
                  rise to the scene we have just detailed, and one, too, of which Harry was entirely
                  innocent. But these erratic practices were more the momentary caprice of a sanguine and happy
                  temperament than the exercise of vitiated and corrupt impulses; and had he been
                  left unchecked in his mad career, he would soon have become tired and satiated
                  with it, and would in all probability have returned with increased avidity to a
                  more exemplary course of life. He had indulged too freely not to have had an
                  eventual surfeit, which must have effected in his habits a complete and entire
                  revolution. His feelings were ardent, and their impulses consequently quick and
                  powerful; and persons of this temperament require something more than the
                  monotonous excitement of every-day life to sustain them. He was not one to be
                  entertained by the insipid enjoyments that gratified the multitude; his taste was
                  of a higher and more fastidious cast, and pursuits or pleasures that were common
                  to all, ceased to be pleasing to him. In fact, there were so many contradictions
                  in the character of Harry Sutherland, that it required a long acquaintance and
                  some penetration to understand him. Though often restless in habits and
                  disposition, there were times when he was settled, thoughtful, and studious; and
                  when he saw or read anything that involved a difficulty, the subject was not
                  thrown aside until every part of it was thoroughly and perfectly understood. It
                  would naturally be supposed that a youth of irregular inclinations would be
                  habitually social and communicative, but with him it was almost the very reverse;
                  he avoided companionship with all, indulged in long and solitary rambles, and was
                  remarkable for taciturnity; nor was he, as would naturally be inferred from these
                  circumstances, selfish, vain, or cold-hearted, for there never existed a more
                  generous, disinterested, or affectionate being, when events transpired to call
                  those virtues into action. If he associated with none, it was not that he was
                  wanting in those feelings of social partiality that endear men to each other, but
                  because he encountered none whose disposition and pursuits harmonized with his
                  own; if he conversed but little, it was not from a dislike to such communion, but
                  rather from a preference to intercourse with his own thoughts; and if he avoided
                  society, it was not that he despised it, but that solitude had more to interest
                  and less to disturb. These may be called nice distinctions; but who that knows
                  aught of human nature will say they do not exist? In short, to sum up this
                  character, he was an anomaly whom none understood, and whom none could, at first,
                  properly appreciate.
               Though Harry Sutherland delivered his valedictory speech with an appearance of
                  calmness, it was an assumption of feeling that he was far from experiencing. Even
                  then the volcano was raging within, and, in a very few moments after he had
                  quitted the presence of his father, it burst forth with additional fury, in
                  consequence of being for a time restrained.
               But that overwhelming storm of passion, though heart-rending and violent while it
                  continued, was of short duration: like the whirlwind, it rose loud, violent, and
                  prostrating, but, like the whirlwind, it lasted but a few brief instants, and then
                  subsided in calm.
               Sad, silent, and sorrowful, he pursued his way, nor turned he once to gaze upon
                  his paternal walls until he had arrived at the opposite bank of the Schuylkill:
                  then, indeed, he paused and looked back, long and wistfully, and when he again
                  turned to resume his uncertain course, he sighed, for though his home had been no
                  home to him, he left it with some such feelings, though with far different
                  inclinations, than our first forefather experienced when ejected from the bowers
                  of Eden.
               Ah! to how many pleasing reflections does that one word, Home, give existence!
                  Though it may be humble—though grand—it is still connected with the sweetest
                  associations of our life. It is indeed one of the few things that, amidst the
                  revolutions of life, we still remember with joy, and one of the only things whose
                  memory becomes more and more endeared to us, as time increases the separation
                  between it and ourselves. The valley we first roamed in—the tree that first shaded
                  us—the brook we first loved, and the landscape that first greeted us; all make
                  their impress upon us, before our affections become contaminated by selfish
                  intercourse with the world, in colours too bright and pleasing to be ever
                  afterwards erased. Often, often, O how often, we pause in the highway of life, and
                  look back to that blessed place, where we were innocent, young, and happy! It is
                  the earliest affection to be received, the very last to leave us; man, though he
                  be traitor to all the rest, is still faithful there; and when he has acted his
                  part in the game of life, though he may have been successful beyond anticipation,
                  fortunate beyond desire,—though he may have won the admiration of the world, the
                  applause of himself, the smiles of beauty—still looks back, and finds no place so
                  like a paradise as his first home, and no moments so productive of happiness as
                  those he spent within its sacred walls.
               And Harry Sutherland was about to leave that home for ever, to renounce those
                  sweets that flowed Lethe like, obliviating its bitterness; to alienate himself
                  from endearments that he would never find on earth again; and to shiver asunder
                  one of the most sacred obligations of the human race—the sympathy between the
                  father and the child. From all these he was rushing to commence a new and a
                  doubtful career, to embark his hopes upon that wild sea where man knows nor feels
                  no mutual sensibility with his fellow man: where all is uncertainty—where all is
                  selfishness—where all is deceit.
               But though that strange youth sallied forth alone, he went not
                  unaided; he was determined, persevering, and ambitious; and these are qualities that befriend us to the last,
                  and that often prove far more successful than personal influence, for the latter
                  but points out the road to fame, while the former, like a faithful guide,
                  accompanies you on to the very goal. He was proud, too, not of anything he
                  possessed in himself over the rest of mankind, but proud of their opinions—proud
                  that his impulses were all honourable—proud, that he never had been guilty of
                  anything for which he should feel self-abased. And now he beheld himself thrown
                  entirely upon his own resources, and this in itself inspired him with feelings he
                  had been a stranger to before. He was gratified that it was so; he was conscious
                  that his abilities were more than adequate to the task; the broad world was all
                  before him, and he at liberty to choose his own way through it—to fashion out his
                  own destiny—to emblazon his own name with decorations of honour; he was confident
                  in his energies, and that confidence is the pilot that often guides us half way
                  into the sea of good fortune. It was long after sunset; the pale crescent, and her
                  beautiful, attendant, were bright in the west; but Harry Sutherland still threaded
                  the streets of the city, but it was with the manner of one who walks that he may
                  the better commune with his own fancies; he was alone in that crowd—solitary
                  amidst a multitude.
               As he pursued his course, building fancies of hope for the future, a sudden
                  brightness illuminated the sky in a distant quarter of the city, and then followed
                  the startling cry of "Fire!" faint and far off, at first; but gradually swelling
                  and disseminating until the alarm had penetrated the most distant streets and
                  avenues of the town; presently, the wild, solemn peals of one large bell roused
                  the citizens from their slumbers, and warned them that the fierce element was at
                  its work of ravage; then the ponderous engines were heard rattling over the hard
                  pavements, while those who lent their energies to the task of dragging them
                  encouraged each other in long, loud, and reiterated shouts; instantly, the streets
                  before deserted became thronged with people, torches flashed in every direction,
                  and wild excitement prevailed where lassitude slept but a few minutes
                  previous.
               Meanwhile the atmosphere from a deep lurid became brightly red, and as the
                  conflagration increased, huge misshapen masses of black smoke piled itself
                  upwards, studded with sparks that shone like so many glittering stars through a
                  storm-cloud; domes, steeples, and chimney-tops glowed in light, and terror even
                  seemed to lend some beauty to that wild, that haggard scene. The fire first broke
                  forth in the lower apartments of a dwelling-house, and spread in a very brief
                  space with such fearful rapidity that the inmates had scarcely time to save
                  themselves from destruction. The devouring element had raged
                  for some time undiscovered, and when it at last burst from the lower windows of
                  the house, it had taken so great a hold within that all efforts to preserve the
                  moveables were regarded as ineffective.
               While the multitude were yet preparing to extinguish the conflagration, their
                  attention was suddenly and powerfully arrested by a shriek, so wild, so powerful,
                  and so expressive of excruciating agony, that all voices were hushed, and all
                  operations suspended as if by magic. That fearful cry sent the life-blood
                  thrilling through the veins of all who heard it, and hushed to deathly silence the
                  hoarse murmur that rose but a moment before, as loud and as angry as the roar of
                  the ocean when chafed by the rude blast of the China seas; again that freezing
                  exclamation rose upon the startled air, and a female voice shrieked out, in
                  accents that when once heard haunt us ever after, "Save, oh, save my child! save
                  her for the love of God! quick, quick, or she will perish!"
               An awful pause succeeded this passionate invocation, but it lasted only until men
                  could collect their feelings from the stagnation imparted to them by that rude
                  shock, and then arose a confusion as wild and tumultuous as the calm that preceded
                  was still and terrible. All the lower apartments of the house were now filled with
                  smoke and flame, and the latter was observed mounting upward and spreading in
                  every direction, so that in an incredible space from the breaking out it had
                  extended to every part of the house, and the whole interior, from the roof to the
                  base, was glowing like an over-heated oven, the element roaring the while with a
                  noise that not even the confused hum of the multitude could drown. To ascend to
                  the room which the distracted mother pointed out as the sleeping apartment of her
                  child by the stairways was an utter impossibility, as they were completely
                  enveloped in flame. None had the hardihood to attempt it; but when ladders were
                  brought and placed against the walls, more than twenty intrepid firemen sprang
                  forward to the rescue of the unfortunate little girl; but when they had gained the
                  windows, they found it impossible to enter, as the smoke was gushing in clouds so
                  thick, so black, and so suffocating, that they deemed it as impossible to exist
                  one moment within the apartment, as it was to recognise objects through the opaque
                  atmosphere. Those who failed in the first attempt were succeeded by others, though
                  with no better success; and the multitude were about relinquishing all hope of the
                  child's salvation, when a youth of slender proportions was seen ascending the
                  ladder, with an air of determination that seemed to inspire the crowd with new
                  hope, for all eyes were turned upon him, and a shout of encouragement rose
                  simultaneously around; in a moment he gained the window, turned for one instant to
                  avoid a column of smoke that just then puffed out, and inhaling
                  a mouthful of fresh air, he leaped into the apartment; another and a louder shout attested the increased hope of
                  the spectators, and all became silent again, for men were too much wrought up in
                  dread excitement to attend to anything but their own varying emotions. He remained
                  within the chamber but a very short time, and yet it seemed to those below a long,
                  long while—the pain, the suspense, the hopes, the fears of an age were crowded in
                  that brief moment. At last he reappeared—but alone. He was unsuccessful, and
                  blinded by smoke, and weakened by strangulation, he became dispirited, and could
                  persist no longer in an attempt that appeared like madness, even to those who
                  hoped that his endeavours might have been blessed with success. An exclamation of
                  disappointment ran through the crowd; but before it had died away, another youth,
                  of nearly the same age and size, sprang upon a second ladder, and commenced
                  ascending to the window. The stranger was Harry Sutherland; he had just arrived at
                  the scene of action, and was learning the cause of the deep excitement, when a
                  beautiful female, whose dress was disordered, and whose hair hung dishevelled down
                  her back, seized him suddenly by the arm, and implored him in accents of agony to
                  save her child. The frantic mother had appealed in the same manner to fifty
                  others, but they recoiled from a task that experience had proved impossible, and
                  that reason warned as fraught with danger. "Will you rescue my child?" asked the
                  mother; and observing that Harry hesitated, she bounded wildly forward, and seized
                  the rounds with the intention of mounting herself; but the youth caught her as
                  suddenly, and pushing her aside, he rushed up, and leaped into the glowing
                  apartment. Despair had however by this time driven hope from the field, and the
                  spectators, though as anxious as ever for the child's preservation, were far less
                  sanguine. Expectation once baffled doubts ever after, and the fire had increased
                  so rapidly that they thought all chance of success improbable; but the increase of
                  the element, instead of building up an obstacle to the rescue of the child, served
                  rather to render it more easy, inasmuch as it destroyed the smoke, which had
                  proved the greater impediment of the two, and to add to the hopes of the young
                  adventurer, a fresh current of air came streaming in the windows, cooling the
                  atmosphere and enabling him to prosecute his search with additional chances of
                  success.
               There succeeded a dead silence, and then a tremendous crash announced that some
                  part of the interior had given way; but the fears of the multitude were in a
                  moment quieted, on perceiving that the floor of the upper apartments was still
                  entire. Another moment elapsed, and then arose one of the longest, loudest, and
                  most exulting shouts that ever yet rang upon the ears of created man; again that
                  wild burst of delight reverberated rated on the night air, and again, and again,
                  until the very city trembled beneath the universal jubilation.
               The mother, frantic with delight, took her child from the arms of her deliverer,
                  and after gazing for a moment in its beautiful eyes, she clasped the darling to
                  her bosom, and covered its sweet countenance with kisses. After the first violent
                  burst of joy, the enraptured parent cast her eyes upward, and though she uttered
                  not even a whisper, it was evident from the devotion of her manner that she was
                  breathing forth a prayer of silent eloquence to that Just and Omnipotent Being,
                  whose divine will is the prompter of all human agency, and who sometimes, in the
                  profundity of his wisdom, visits us with misfortunes, that we may be better
                  enabled to appreciate the blessings he has often prodigally heaped upon us.
               That was the happiest moment of Harry Sutherland's life. He felt then, as he gazed
                  upon the cherub he had snatched from destruction, and the mother he had saved from
                  misery, that it was not in the province of man to enjoy raptures of bliss more
                  divine than those that at that moment thrilled in his veins but few of the
                  millions who have passed from the cradle to the grave, ever experienced that
                  exquisite sensation of delight—he was himself a stranger to it for ever after.
               And there was but one in all that vast assemblage of human beings that envied him
                  the happiness of that moment; and that one stood gazing on him with a scowling
                  brow, and an eye flashing with deadly rage. He hated him for his success, and,
                  from the bottom of his soul, wished that the child had perished in the flames
                  rather than Harry Sutherland should have rescued her—and this person was but a
                  boy, young, inexperienced, and handsome; but one whose manner at that time
                  betrayed the fiercest passions of hardened old age. He was Harry's rival in the
                  attempt to rescue the child, and was now his enemy for ever.
               It was not until the transports of the mother had subsided into a calmer current,
                  that she once thought of him who had rescued her child; then, indeed, the thought
                  that he had been so long neglected rushed painfully upon her mind, and depositing
                  her precious burthen in the arms of one of her household, she took him by the
                  hand, but not finding words to express her gratitude, she fell upon his neck and
                  burst into a flood of tears. "Brave, noble, generous youth!" sobbed she, "it will
                  never be in my power to reward you, but my blessing, a mother's blessing shall
                  attend you wherever you go, and a mother's prayer shall nightly be offered up for
                  you to Him who only can recompense the disinterested act you have just
                  performed."
               Harry Sutherland was distressed, and yet he was happy. Tears were in his eyes, but
                  joy was at his heart; and, glad at length to escape from observation, he sought
                  his way out of the crowd, and towards
                  another and a more silent quarter of the city. But he was followed by a second
                  person: the strange youth who had also endeavoured to save the child, pursued him
                  through every street and lane he traversed for nearly a quarter of an hour. At
                  length the latter hastened his pace, and touching Harry upon the shoulder, the two
                  were confronted face to face.
               The stranger, though he had sought an interview, remained silent, as if he
                  expected the other to address him, and Harry, surprised at length that he spoke
                  not, demanded what he required of him.
               "Nothing," replied the strange youth.
               "Then why have you stopped me?" asked our hero, somewhat angrily.
               "To tell you," replied the other, "that you have robbed me."
               "Robbed you! of what, pray?"
               "Of the gratification of rescuing that child."
               "Are you mad?"
               "No, sir."
               "Then what is your meaning? I don't understand you. Your language to me is all an
                  enigma."
               "You have received approbation to-night which should have been bestowed upon me. I
                  was on the very eve of distinguishing myself, and you came and blasted my
                  hopes."
               "Fool!" exclaimed Harry, nettled at the other's inconsistency, "you had abandoned
                  the project in despair before I attempted it."
               "I would have tried it again; I would have ultimately succeeded," said the
                  stranger.
               "Perhaps so," replied Harry, "but since the child has been saved, what matters it
                  to you?"
               "What matters it to me!" said the other, repeating his companion's words in
                  undisguised astonishment.
               "Yes."
               The stranger spoke not another word, but turning upon his heel, he walked off,
                  leaving Harry Sutherland to resume his way and muse in mute astonishment over that
                  encounter.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               IT was evening again upon the shores of the Delaware; the last rosy bar of light
                  had sunk down the western heaven, and the young moon was gliding along the sky
                  like a silver bark upon some sleeping ocean; the light airs that stirred the
                  atmosphere, though strong enough to bear over the sweets from the Jersey shore,
                  were far too feeble to ruffle the waters of the river, and the beautiful stream
                  flowed through its channel, as calmly, and as tranquilly, as the current of life
                  through the canals of the human system.
               A solitary being, prompted by his own innate love of loneliness and meditation,
                  had sallied out to enjoy the balmy night air, and indulge in the hopes and fears
                  of his wild fevered fancy, and now stood upon a small wharf that jutted into the
                  Delaware, some distance below the city. Here, quieting an imagination too busy
                  before to permit his attention to serve anything but itself, he commenced
                  surveying every object within the range of his vision. The shore beyond, the broad
                  bold river, the shipping above, the silent city, all these he gazed at until at
                  last his eye fell upon a beautiful ship that rode at single anchor not two hundred
                  yards from the platform on which he was standing.
               Never before had he seen anything so beautiful; and, as his eye roamed over each
                  harmonious feature, more than one exclamation of admiration almost involuntarily
                  escaped his lips. Though the moon shed but a feeble light over the scene, it was
                  not so obscure but that he could trace her complete outline, and though he could
                  discern but little beside her long straight hull, her tall tapering masts and her
                  square black yards were sufficiently relieved against the sky to enable him to
                  form an accurate idea of her appearance.
               In those days it was not unusual to see whole squadrons of beautiful vessels in
                  all the harbours of the United States, it being then late in the year eighteen
                  hundred and twelve, a period when our seamen, emboldened by the success of the
                  frigate Constitution over her opponent the Guerriere, had commenced fitting out
                  privateers to scour every sea upon the habitable globe; but a more symmetrical and
                  graceful ship than the one that lay upon the water before him, our hero thought he
                  had never seen. Whilst he was yet gazing upon this beautiful specimen of naval
                  architecture, he heard a slight rustle beside him, and on turning to ascertain its
                  cause, he discovered that he was not alone. A tall figure enveloped in the folds
                  of a Spanish cloak, stood beside him.
               "We have a lovely night, sir," exclaimed the stranger, with the easy manner of one who has communed much with
                  the world, and whose address has profited by long experience.
               "Charming, indeed, sir," replied Harry Sutherland, taking the stranger's form with
                  a glance. "The mildness of our autumn almost repays us for the severity of our
                  winters."
               "I suppose so," said the stranger, "though it is some time since I have spent a
                  winter in this climate; I generally run down between the tropics or south of the
                  Equinox, when your cold season sets in, since I find it always uncomfortable upon
                  the American coast, except when the sun is in his northern declination."
               "And more so to you than to myself," remarked our hero, "since you have
                  unaccustomed yourself to its severity."
               "Exactly so," said the stranger. "Our comfort depends altogether upon acclimation.
                  An African would freeze in an atmosphere that would roast a Norwegian. But, sir, I
                  think you have a constitution admirably adapted to a warmer climate than
                  this."
               "Why so?" asked Harry, somewhat astonished at the asseveration, coming as it did
                  from one whom he had not known nor seen before.
               "You bore the heat last night with apparent composure," replied the stranger with
                  a smile, while our hero was somewhat surprised at being recognised.
               "Were you not looking at yon clipper-built ship when I came up?" asked the former,
                  after a pause, during which Harry Sutherland had more than once observed his
                  companion, hoping to detect in him some acquaintance.
               "I was indeed admiring her when you arrived."
               "And think her pretty?"
               "Beautiful beyond all rivalry; never have I seen a vessel so perfectly symmetrical
                  in every part," said the youth, turning his eyes once more towards the object in
                  question.
               "You can form but an imperfect idea of her beauties at this distance, with so
                  little light to aid you," said the stranger; "but if you have a curiosity to
                  examine her more closely, it will make me happy to offer you the opportunity. I
                  command that ship; my boat will be here in a moment—see, she comes even now—and I
                  will be glad of your company on board."
               "Thanks to you, sir, but I am afraid I should put you to some inconvenience."
               "Don't deceive yourself, sir," replied the other, "you can not oblige me more than
                  by your company this evening; it is early yet, and you will have an opportunity of
                  seeng her interior, and of returning home long before the hour of retiring."
               "It would be impolite in me now to refuse," said our hero, as he stepped into the
                  stern sheets of the boat, and seated himself beside the stranger.
               The latter smiled, gave the order to shove off, and in another moment the boat was
                  sweeping rapidly towards the ship. Nothing further passed between them until their
                  arrival alongside, Harry Sutherland being too much engaged in admiring the
                  delicate beauty of the little vessel, and her commander being too much gratified
                  with that admiration to be for one moment the cause of its interruption. A few
                  strokes of the oar brought the boat under her quarter, when, for the first time,
                  our hero perceived that not a gun was visible along her black sides, although her
                  construction was in every respect that of a man-of-war, and that no sign of a port
                  hole was perceptible upon her bulwarks either forward or abaft; before he could
                  express his astonishment, however, the cutter glided to the side ladder and he was
                  bidden to ascend. Gaining the deck, his surprise was still greater, for upon
                  looking round for the battery which he supposed might have been concealed from
                  without, neither cannon, musket, cutlass, nor pistol, met his eye; but, on the
                  contrary, every part of her internal arrangement displayed the peaceful regulation
                  of an ordinary merchant vessel. The bulwarks, it was true, were higher and
                  stronger than was necessary to a ship constructed solely for the purpose of
                  transporting merchandise; but this our hero thought the particular fancy of the
                  builder, as neither embrasure nor ringbolt could be seen in any part of it. The
                  deck, too, was almost deserted: but two forms were visible forward; and from the
                  deep and unbroken stillness that prevailed throughout her interior, he was induced
                  to believe that he saw the sole occupants of the vessel.
               "You appear somewhat astonished, sir," said the captain, after a brief interval of
                  silence on the part of either, and during which he had been assiduously studying
                  the expression of the youth's countenance, as if to learn the thoughts that were
                  passing in his mind. "But I suppose you have not frequently seen a ship in such
                  excellent order; merchant vessels generally have so few hands, that they are
                  obliged to neglect the appearance of their decks for the accomplishment of their
                  more essential and important duties."
               "You mistake my surprise, sir," said the youth, "I was until now under the
                  impression that this was an armed ship. I thought her a privateer."
               "And why so?" asked the commander.
               "Because her outward appearance every way betokens it; she is evidently
                  constructed for fleetness, and much too sharp built to be a profitable trader;
                  besides, sir, merchant vessels seldom carry such ponderous spars aloft."
               
               "Have you ever been on blue water, Mr. —— I have forgotten the name."
               "Sutherland."
               "Have you ever been so far from the land as to be unable to see it, Mr.
                  Sutherland?" asked the stranger, with somewhat more interest than he had before
                  betrayed in the dialogue.
               "Twice," responded the youth. "I went from here to Boston, and returned by way of
                  the Atlantic."
               "Then you are mariner enough to know the utility of this ship's appearance,"
                  replied the commander. "The largest frigate in the king's navy would scarcely run
                  within gun-shot of us without having her matches lighted and her crew at their
                  quarters; and as to her being too contracted to stow a rich cargo, I have only to
                  add that she would carry more bullion than Guatimosin ever possessed, and silks
                  and laces enough to enrich you and me to independence. But walk below, sir; the
                  night air is somewhat chilly, and you will find the cabin much more
                  comfortable."
               And as he finished speaking, he ushered our hero into an apartment whose
                  magnificent decorations astonished him even more than the ship's deceitful
                  exterior. The most superb saloon he had ever beheld on shore was far below
                  comparison with this small but splendid chamber; and as he gazed about him in
                  surprise, all the gilded fancies he had formed of the thrones and palaces of
                  emperors and kings rushed upon his imagination as if they were realized in the
                  place he now occupied.
               The pannelling of the room was cut from the richest timber of Brazil, and bore a
                  polish almost as bright and beautiful as that of the ocean after a long-continued
                  calm; the curtains that hung in rich festoons between the forward and after cabin,
                  were of the most costly damask, with heavy tasselated fringes of gold, the soft,
                  heavy carpet was from the looms of Turkey, the dark blue veined table slabs from
                  the quarries of Egypt, the mirrors from the foundries of Venice, and the
                  elaborately wrought chandelier that swung from the carlines, of a strictly foreign
                  manufacture: every article in that chamber, whether formed for use or ornament,
                  bore a shape suited to the taste of a more voluptuous people than the plain
                  republicans of the United States; and it appeared to Harry Sutherland, as he
                  roamed over the beauties of the place, that extravagance alone was consulted in
                  the decorations around. Satisfied at length with his observation, he turned to his
                  host, who had put aside his cloak and hat, and was seated upon the sofa, running
                  his fingers lightly over the strings of a guitar; and now for the first time he
                  found an opportunity of viewing a countenance which the partial obscurity of the
                  night had previously prevented him from closely examining.
               The stranger was perhaps forty years of age, certainly not more, and probably much
                  less; for his was one of those faces so furrowed by thought and hardship, that it
                  baffled all judgment. The settled expression of his features was a deep
                  melancholy, and that particular cast, too, which men sometimes possess without
                  being themselves aware of it; a dull, languid manifestation of sorrow, like to
                  nothing but the fixed, lifeless expression of a statue. He had been handsome, and
                  here and there a partial beauty developed itself, amidst the wreck time had made
                  of his features, like the still gilded remains of some ruined temple, glittering
                  through the decay around. His eye still glowed with the fire of youth, but it was
                  the only lineament that the ruthless destroyer had left untouched, as if indeed it
                  were cruelly preserved to indicate the destruction of all the rest.
               "Will you please be seated, Mr. Sutherland?" said the commander, when he perceived
                  that his guest had completely noticed each fixture of the apartment; "a little
                  rest is often grateful after an evening stroll." This urbane request was complied
                  with by our hero, and his companion, touching a bell string, gave some orders in a
                  foreign language, to a servant who entered at the summons.
               "You said you had twice navigated the Atlantic, sir," remarked the stranger.
               "But a very small portion of it," answered Harry. "I was but three weeks out
                  altogether."
               "Time enough," retorted the other, smiling as he spoke, "to perceive more reality
                  than romance in our naval life; you were tired enough when you made your
                  port?"
               "Not so, sir; on the contrary I was more pleased than ever with it."
               "Then yours must indeed be a singular taste; I had thought before, that another
                  than myself did not exist, to whom the long passage, the continued calm, or the
                  fierce tempest was a source of pleasure rather than disgust."
               "And are these indeed agreeable to you?" asked our hero.
               "They are, Mr. Sutherland; and could they be combined in one grand evil, that evil
                  would be far more tolerable to me upon the ocean, than a life of ease and
                  indulgence on the shore."
               "Ah!" exclaimed the youth, "it is you then who are particular in your fancy, and
                  not I."
               "Perhaps so. But tell me, Mr. Sutherland, would you like to go a cruise with me? I
                  dislike entire solitude as heartily as any one, and should be happy if you would
                  become my messmate for a while; you can then have an opportunity of gratifying
                  your propensity to become a sailor, without having any of his duties to
                  perform."
               "Many thanks for your kind intention," said our hero, "which I cannot however take
                  advantage of. Much as I am inclined to
                  the sea, the career I would pursue on board of your ship offers but a small share
                  of inducement to gratify that yearning."
               "And why so, Mr. Sutherland? There floats not a vessel upon the broad blue ocean
                  that possesses the combined advantages of this ship; never in all my cruising have
                  I met one that could hold her way with her; and as to elegance and convenience,
                  you have already seen enough to convince you that her equal in these respects can
                  nowhere be found. All the luxuries of life here wait upon you, and Italy, India,
                  and America are alike our cruising ground."
               "All these are no temptations to me," replied the youth.
               "Ah! Mr. Sutherland," said the stranger, after a pause, "I think I understand you;
                  the duties of a merchant ship suit you not—you disdain the traffic that we drive
                  from port to port—your ambition inspires you to something nobler than the petty
                  transactions of commerce—in short, sir, you would follow the sea in another
                  capacity than that of an ordinary merchant sailor."
               Harry Sutherland, though somewhat surprised at the speech of his companion, was
                  too candid to deny his assertions; and though made in a spirit of interrogation,
                  he assented to them with a grave inclination of the head, as if, indeed, he
                  disdained to even soften with words facts that he thought must have sounded harsh
                  upon the feelings of his host: not that he was devoid of that exquisite sense we
                  should entertain for the sensibilities of others, but that he deemed truth too
                  sacred to be profaned by the slightest tinge of false colouring.
               "Sir," resumed the commander, after a silence of some moments, during which it was
                  evident he was communing with his own thoughts, though in a spirit that the
                  dubious expression of his countenance failed to convey. "I honour your
                  determination—I glory in your ardour—I rejoice in the ideas that must influence
                  your future destiny. They were mine, sir, at your age—they are mine now, and they
                  will be mine as long as I have strength to wield a cutlass. You, young and
                  inexperienced as you are, detest the man that could waste his prowess, his time,
                  and his energies in avaricious pursuits, when America has sent out her cruisers
                  upon the seas, in as just a cause as ever yet prompted one nation to war with
                  another; and so do I, from the bottom of my soul."
               Here the stranger rose from his seat, and commenced pacing the narrow limits of
                  the apartment in wild and sudden excitement; not a word was spoken for some
                  minutes, our hero being at a loss how to reply to a speech so inconsistent with
                  the apparent vocation of his companion, and he himself abstracted from other
                  things in occupation with his own fervid thoughts.
               "Mr. Sutherland, think me not one of those base spirits that for the sake of gain,
                  would rob their country of their services; for mercy's sake lay that charge not to
                  me. I do not deserve it—I have not deserved it. On the contrary, I was the first
                  to do battle in her cause. With my single ship I spread terror all along the coast
                  of Great Britain. I entered their harbours by night—fired their shipping while
                  riding at the wharves—prevented their outward-bound vessels from putting to sea,
                  and captured and destroyed their returning merchantmen. In vain their cruisers
                  pursued me—in vain they scoured the channel in squadrons: the Sea-King was too
                  fleet of wing for them, and when they returned dispirited and unsuccessful to
                  port, I ran in and issued my proclamation declaring their whole coast in a state
                  of blockade."
               Surprise for a moment kept our hero silent; he had heard of the daring exploits of
                  the privateer his companion had just mentioned, but he had not known before that
                  he was then in converse with the famous individual who had so gloriously directed
                  and prosecuted her movements; a feeling of respect almost amounting to awe came
                  over him, and he gazed upon the working brow of the commander with an admiration
                  that for a long time admitted of no other expression. At length, however, his
                  silence grew painful to himself; he felt that he should be the first to speak, and
                  he obeyed the impulse, rather from a sense of duty than of inclination.
               "I am happy indeed," said he, "that circumstances should have to-night acquainted
                  me with one who has distinguished himself with so much gallantry in the cause of
                  his country as has Captain Manly; and I might add, with more justice than
                  flattery, that a few more such men would teach the English king that America
                  cannot be insulted with impunity, even though it be upon the ocean."
               "Mr. Sutherland," replied the other, stopping short in his promenade, while his
                  chest heaved, and his voice grew low and troubled. "I am unworthy of the praise
                  you have just bestowed, at least of part of it: it was not patriotism alone that
                  prompted my actions, nor was it an unholy thirst for gold. No, no, young man, it
                  was a deep-rooted desire for revenge—revenge upon the proud nation that—that—but
                  no matter," added he, as if suddenly recollecting he was about to betray something
                  which should be kept to himself. "No matter, it is all foolish—foolish, too
                  foolish for repetition."
               "May I ask Captain Manly where his gallant ship is at present?" said our hero,
                  anxious to turn the conversation from a subject which he saw would be painful to
                  his host.
               "You may, sir. We are on board of her."
               
               "I have reference to the privateer, sir. She that is called the Sea-King."
               The commander made no reply; but smiling, he motioned our hero to follow him, and
                  they both ascended to the upper deck.
               But imagine the astonishment of Harry Sutherland, when, on emerging into the open
                  air, he found himself in the presence of a hundred ferocious-looking men, armed
                  with cutlasses, pistols, and boarding-pikes, who had ranged themselves along the
                  bulwarks, and were standing as motionless and as silent as if they were so many
                  petrified warriors. From these he, after a cursory glance, turned to the huge
                  pieces of cannon, that thrust their black muzzles out upon the water, rendered
                  terribly conspicuous by the glare of twenty battle lanterns, until, confounded, at
                  length he looked up to his companion, as if to demand an explanation of the
                  singular and somewhat startling metamorphosis.
               "Be not fearful, Mr. Sutherland," said the commander. "I am not the renowned
                  Vanderdecken, nor is this ship the phantom Dutchman, but a veritable Yankee
                  privateer that sometimes exhibits the fancy of the English churchman, who wore the
                  corslet beneath the cowl."
               "Sir, you mistake my astonishment," replied our hero, with a smile; "but truly the
                  change that a few moments have wrought upon the deck of this ship seems rather the
                  effect of supernatural than human agency."
               "It has been my salvation more than once, young gentleman," resumed Captain Manly.
                  "I have passed through a squadron of twenty men-of-war without suspicion, although
                  at the time they were in pursuit of me. Nor have you yet seen my most complete
                  disguise; in a case of emergency, I could send down my after yards, sway aloft a
                  gaff topsail, cover my white streak, and otherwise so alter her appearance, as to
                  defy the most practised observer from discovering the identity."
               "It is indeed wonderful!" exclaimed Harry Sutherland, gazing once more upon the
                  heavy armament, and the wild forms that crowded about it; and even as he stood
                  looking upon the martial parade, he saw the heavy guns detached from the bulwarks,
                  and transported to that part of the deck between the fore and main masts. When
                  they had all been collected in that spot, a large black cloth was drawn over them,
                  as if it were a launch under cover; the outer ports were let down, false ports
                  were inserted inboard, the battle lanterns were unshipped fore and aft, the
                  cutlassses, pistols, pikes, and axes, sent below, and in a few moments the deck
                  was deserted by all save our hero and his companion, while it again presented the
                  pacific appearance it had discovered when he had first come on board. To render
                  this scene still more imposing, it was conducted in profound silence: not a word
                  was exchanged by the actors, and every disposition position was made with an
                  alacrity and regularity that indicated on the part of each man a thorough
                  consciousness of his particular duty, as well as long and continued experience in
                  its performance.
               "And now, Mr. Sutherland," resumed the commander, "I hope your objections to
                  accompanying me have all been removed?"
               "They have."
               "And you will join me?"
               "I will. When will you put to sea?"
               "On the day that follows the morrow, the wind and tide serving."
               "By that time I shall be ready," said our hero; "and as it is now growing late, I
                  will return to the city."
               "Certainly, sir, a boat waits upon you when you are ready; but before you go I
                  must request that you will say nothing of what has come under your observation
                  whilst you have been on board this ship. My safety, you must know, depends in a
                  measure upon the secrecy of her internal arrangements."
               Our hero promised to divulge nothing he had witnessed or heard, and bidding his
                  host good night, he mounted the gangway and descended into the boat, and a
                  powerful arm pushed her far from the vessel's side ladder, and six athletic seamen
                  swept her in silence to the shore. When she rounded to alongside of the wharf, he
                  sprang upon the platform, and the boat returned to the ship, leaving him to muse
                  in solitude upon the strange events that had that night transpired.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER III.
               ANOTHER day's reflection found Harry Sutherland troubled and doubtful with respect
                  to the course he should pursue. He had quitted his father's house with a firm
                  determination to enter it no more; but that resolution was formed in a moment of
                  indignant excitement, and now, when it had all died away, he became convinced that
                  his feelings would not support him in the measure. There is, after all, no
                  reasoner so powerful as time, and no argument so effective as reflection; and had
                  it not been for the indomitable pride of the youth, or had he consulted his own
                  inclinations without reference to that spirit which is too often false and
                  unreasonable, he would have at once returned to his parental abode, although
                  confident that he would be happier and better when far away from it. But whatever
                  yearning he might cherish in that way, could not, under the present circumstances,
                  be gratified without a sacrifice which he was far from being prepared to make. He
                  had expressed, or, at least, implied a resolve to leave his home and seek his own
                  fortunes elsewhere, and he could not go back of his word; added to this, he had
                  pledged himself to the commander of the privateer, and here was another formidable
                  obstacle, insuperable indeed, and imperative in demand of its fulfilment.
               At length, however, his determination was formed; the vain spirit that lost Heaven
                  to the Angel, lost him his home; and abjuring it altogether, he directed his steps
                  towards the environs of the city, in order to comply with the promise exacted of
                  him by the captain of the privateer. But when he had arrived at the wharf, the
                  ship was nowhere to be seen; the station she had occupied was deserted, and he
                  looked in vain above and below for her tall raking masts and wide spreading
                  yards.
               Another individual occupied the wharf, and to him our hero directed himself. The
                  stranger was attired in the garb of a common mariner, a black silk kerchief was
                  knotted loosely about his neck, and a tarpaulin set carelessly upon one side of
                  his head. He was, perhaps, twenty-five, or at the furthest, not more than thirty
                  years of age.
               "When did the privateer go to sea?" asked Harry Sutherland.
               The sailor turned sharply about, and eyeing the questioner distrustfully, he
                  exclaimed, "What privateer?"
               "She that rode at anchor off here day before yesterday."
               "Your eyes must have been in an eclipse when you made that ship out a
                  privateer."
               "True, true," rejoined Harry, recollecting his promise to the captain, "I was
                  mistaken. The merchant vessel, I mean, that swung at anchor here two days
                  since."
               "If you have reference to a rakish-rigged black ship, she dropped down yesterday
                  in the afternoon."
               "That is very strange!" exclaimed Harry, in communion with his own thoughts.
               "I don't think so," replied the sailor; "she had a leading breeze and plenty of
                  it; the tide was at ebb, too, and there was every indication of fine weather. She
                  couldn't have picked a better time to sheet home and hoist away, if she had waited
                  here a twel'month; so you see, young man, we differ on that point."
               "You misunderstand me altogether," said our hero.
               "May be so, may be not," said the sailor, with a significant smile, and at the
                  same time producing a packet from his bosom, he asked the youth if he knew the
                  person to whom it was directed.
               "It is intended for no other than myself," said our hero, glancing at the
                  superscription and breaking the seal.
               "Sir—when you receive this epistle, I shall be perhaps beyond the capes of the
                  Delaware. Be not surprised at my sudden departure; after the covenant that was
                  made between us you may consider me unfaithful; it was at first my wish to enlist
                  you in my service, but reflection has since convinced me that you may be better
                  employed elsewhere. I am too much interested in your welfare, Mr. Sutherland, to
                  insist upon the compliance which was indeed partly extorted from you, and the
                  fulfilment of which would serve me but little; not that I mean to disparage your
                  abilities, but that a single arm, however powerful, would count but little in the
                  game I am about to pursue. You are young, fearless, and ambitious; you would be a
                  sailor; the Navy then, is your future field; enter it, and you will yet do honour
                  to your country.
               "If you are wanting in influence to procure an appointment, deliver the enveloped
                  letter to the person to whom it is directed. He will do everything to assist you,
                  and but few men in the United States have more authority at the department.
                  Farewell, we may meet again, or we may not; but whether or not, believe me
                  sincerely your very best friend."
               Such were the contents of the letter addressed to himself; the other was sealed
                  and directed to William Hamilton, Esq., M—— street, Philadelphia.
               Harry Sutherland, after a second perusal of this strange epistle, raised his eyes
                  from the paper to question the bearer, but he had left the wharf unobserved, and
                  our hero was alone. The contents of the
                  epistle, however, determined him to pursue the course they advised, and putting
                  away the document he commenced his return to the city. A half hour's walk brought
                  him to the residence in M—— street, and upon inquiry he found that Mr. Hamilton
                  was at home and would see him.
               On entering the parlour, he found himself in the presence of a gentleman of
                  perhaps forty years of age, and one whose appearance was noble and dignified, and
                  whose manners were graceful and easy; upon ascertaining that he was the person
                  whom he sought, he presented the letter, which the gentleman took with a graceful
                  inclination of the body, requesting our hero at the same time to be seated, while
                  he made himself acquainted with its contents. Harry Sutherland observed that he
                  perused the letter with unusual interest; his brow worked, but not with anger, and
                  he seemed evidently troubled with the perusal.
               "Mr. Sutherland," said he, when he had finished, and at the same time extending
                  his hand in confirmation of what he was about to speak; "it will afford me
                  pleasure to aid you in this matter, but first inform me candidly if you know the
                  person who gave you this letter."
               "Certainly, sir," responded Harry, astonished at the question, "I could not have
                  obtained a letter of the kind from an utter stranger; my acquaintance, to be sure,
                  was very lately made, and has been of very short duration, but it was sufficient
                  to obtain the confidence of Captain Manly."
               At this reply the countenance of Mr. Hamilton at once brightened up.
               "Enough, enough, sir," replied he; "your wish in this matter shall he gratified; I
                  will write to the Secretary this very evening in your behalf. How long, Mr.
                  Sutherland, if I may ask you, have you known Captain Manly?"
               "But three days ago we were strangers to one another," replied our hero, and he
                  then related all that had passed between him and the commander of the
                  privateer.
               With this narrative Mr. Hamilton was evidently gratified; it appeared to remove a
                  mountain of apprehension from his mind, and when our hero informed him that the
                  ship had put to sea the day before, he evinced still greater satisfaction.
               The calm, frank manner of the youth won at once the heart of the other; he was
                  highly pleased with the simplicity and beauty of his address, and after numerous
                  protestations of assistance and friendship, he invited him to remain at his house
                  until his appointment was received; this favour our hero at first strenuously
                  declined, but his objections were at length overruled by the earnest solicitations
                  of his new friend, and he finally consented, though with evident repugnance.
               "Were I not fearful of offending you, Mr. Hamilton," said he, "I would still
                  refuse your courtesy in this matter. I have already presumed too much in claiming
                  your services by delivering that letter. I come before you an utter stranger,
                  without friends and without recommendation, and without another claim than that to
                  which that letter entitles me, if indeed its writer has any upon you, which is
                  itself a matter wherein I am ignorant."
               "He has! he has! Mr. Sutherland; be at ease upon that subject. He has the most
                  sacred claims upon my services; and even had he not, or had you come unrecommended
                  by any one, I should have befriended you."
               "Thank you, sir,—thank you a thousand times!" said our hero, grateful for the
                  generous sentiment expressed by his companion; "and now, since you have been so
                  kind, I will tell you the circumstances that drove me to seek the assistance of
                  strangers; circumstances which I had before determined to reveal to none."
               "Then pray disclose them not to me," interrupted the elder; "let not your
                  generosity get the better of your discretion. I had rather be ignorant upon a
                  subject you had once thought it best to conceal."
               "I must tell you, Mr. Hamilton, the relation we at present stand in to each other
                  renders it necessary; it would savour of distrust were I not to make you a
                  confidant in my present situation."
               And Harry Sutherland related all that had passed between him and his father, but
                  taking care the while to lessen the injustice of his parent as much as possible;
                  he was too proud of his own feelings to acknowledge all he had suffered, and
                  respected his father too much to indulge in the least censure towards him. So that
                  when he had concluded the narration, its substance led to the belief that he
                  himself had deserved all the blame; but Mr. Hamilton was too much a man of the
                  world, not to perceive the delicacy of the son; and while he respected the
                  nobleness of his motives in glossing over his sire's conduct, he drew a different
                  inference from the detail than that which it was intended to convey. The most
                  perfect confidence suddenly sprung up between the two. Our hero admired his new
                  friend for his disinterested generosity, and Mr. Hamilton was charmed with his new
                  acquaintance for a thousand little sparks which he discovered in his composition.
                  The detail the youth had just made, had developed more of his character than a
                  year's companionship would have done; his feelings and principles were discovered
                  in the recital, and they were such as to command admiration from his companion,
                  who being naturally a shrewd observer of human nature, was too acute not to have
                  acquired a perfect knowledge of the character of one, whose ideas and impulses
                  were made apparent during that passionate
                  relation of personal circumstances.
               Whilst they were yet conversing, the door opened, and a creature in the flower of
                  girlhood entered the apartment. On perceiving a stranger she hesitated, but a
                  smile and a word from the father brought her to his side.
               "Anna, this is Mr. Sutherland," said the host; "he is a friend of mine, and will
                  remain with us awhile. You must make his time pass as agreeably as possible."
               "I will endeavour to do so," said the little girl, courtseying to our hero, and
                  blushing beneath his ardent gaze; for her singular beauty had so fascinated him
                  that he continued to look steadfastly upon her a longer time than was altogether
                  consistent with the rules of propriety.
               "And, Mr. Sutherland, you will find my daughter an amusing companion, provided
                  that she will take the pleasure in entertaining you that she does in pleasing me.
                  She is a gay little thing, a little fretful sometimes, but generally good-natured;
                  like the rest of her sex, she must be humoured somewhat or she ceases to be
                  agreeable."
               "Oh father, how can you say so!" said the daughter playfully.
               "The fact is," said Mr. Hamilton, kissing her pretty lips, "she has been spoiled
                  by some deceitful persons, who have deluded her into the belief that she is
                  handsome; her mirror, I am sorry to say, is consulted with more frequency and
                  attention than her books."
               "Now, pa, you know that you do not really think so!" exclaimed the daughter; "and
                  Mr. Sutherland, I hope you will believe he is only jesting, for, to be candid with
                  you, I am sure he takes delight in teasing me before strangers."
               "Come, Anna, no appeals to Mr. Sutherland's gallantry! That is unfair, altogether
                  unfair."
               "I have made none, father; but were I to do so, I am certain he would be more kind
                  and liberal than you. Is it not strange that men become so cold and disobliging
                  with age, particularly when they have been so gallant and courteous in their
                  youth, Mr. Sutherland? now, for example, here is pa, who they say was one of the
                  most devoted beaux of his time—"
               "Hush, you saucy fairy!" said the father, interrupting the daughter with a
                  kiss.
               "Then a truce to your teasing, sir!" exclaimed she, tossing her head in smiling
                  triumph, and gazing upon our hero with a look that filled him with pleasure.
               The few days that our hero spent under the roof of Mr. Hamilton rolled away in
                  ineffable delight, and when his appointment came, he took it with a sadness that
                  he could but ill conceal; during ing that time he seldom quitted the house, but
                  devoted his whole time and attention to the society of the beautiful daughter of
                  his friendly host. If he was captivated upon first acquaintance, he was trebly
                  enchanted when that acquaintance had become matured; for every day he beheld the
                  development of some new grace or beauty in her character, for in truth it
                  resembled the ever-varying kaleidoscope, that discovers fresh elegancies at every
                  successive view.
               She was an only child, and having lost her mother at an early age, was
                  consequently allowed those licenses, by an indulgent father, which might have
                  spoiled another child, but which only tended in her to strengthen and mature her
                  mind, so that Anna Hamilton, though a girl in years, was almost a woman in
                  character. She was frank without being familiar, and modest without that girlish
                  coyness which is too often ridiculous and inconsistant. Her politeness was not
                  that acquired polish of a boarding school, that sits stiff and incongruous upon
                  the person, but the finished grace of nature, that charms with its ease, and
                  enchants with its softness, and it seemed that it would be as difficult for her to
                  exhibit a want of beauty in any movement, as for the most vulgar to perform with
                  proper grace and manner the usages of refined and fashionable life. She was indeed
                  a lady from birth and not from education.
               Her features were all strikingly regular; her hair was of a deep auburn, and was
                  worn at all times smooth upon her brow; her mouth small, beautifully chiselled,
                  and wearing the sweetest imaginable expression; her teeth small, uniform, and
                  dazzling, and her hazel eyes so brilliant, that one might suppose the very soul
                  had established its capital in their flashing depths. In shape she was as lovely
                  as in feature; Nature had not deviated from a single rule in her formation; she
                  was embodied perfection, and though she had not yet developed into the fulness of
                  womanhood, she exhibited all the maturer graces of that season, with the most
                  delicate faultlessness.
               No wonder, then, that our hero was enchanted with this fair young being; he walked
                  with her, he conversed with her, he listened to her sweet low voice when she sang,
                  and gazed upon her beautiful little fingers when she played; he dreamed of her by
                  night, he thought of nothing else by day. He beheld with rapture the smile that
                  waked her countenance into exuberant animation; he was himself young,
                  enthusiastic, passionate, and with those dark eyes beaming upon him half the time,
                  how could he refrain from loving her?—a stoic could not have done otherwise.
               Mr. Hamilton could not be insensible to the attachment that was growing between
                  his daughter and protegé. It was too evident to be mistaken; he discovered it in
                  the bud and marked its blowing with
                  pleasure; and even then he looked forward to the time when that affection,
                  strengthened by years, and confirmed by experience, should be productive of their
                  union, with something like a prophetic impression. He smiled approval upon their
                  partial intimacy, for he perceived in Harry Sutherland the germs of a noble mind;
                  and apart from this, there were powerful worldly considerations in favour of our
                  hero, but whether these influenced the feelings of the father or not, others must
                  decide; no doubt however, but that they threw some weight in the balance.
               The peculiar originality of Harry Sutherland's character excited the admiration of
                  Mr. Hamilton, who, being somewhat of a speculator in human nature, thought that he
                  perceived in its composition everything above the generality of mankind; its
                  singularity dazzled him, and, indeed, there was a mystery in it that would fix the
                  attention of the most superficial, and invite them to its examination: an observer
                  might, at first, think him lethargic in disposition, but the thoughtful brow, and
                  the intellectual fire of his wild blue eye, exhibited too striking a contradiction
                  for any one to be deluded long with this impression. The expression of his
                  countenance might be supposed again to have been the effect of sorrow, but that
                  every feature betrayed the utmost calmness and placidity; he spoke but little, and
                  even in his happy communion with the beautiful daughter of his host, he was
                  generally the communicant, she the speaker, but when her conversation would
                  sometimes become exhausted, he would fill up the silence with some brilliant
                  remark, that fascinated the more that his observations were unfrequent, and that
                  indicated an imagination of the most sparkling order. In conversation he was never
                  the intruder; his words were drawn forth, not emitted voluntarily, and when they
                  were uttered, they charmed for their rarity, as well as for their beauty and
                  correctness. His natural taciturnity gave to his mind time and opportunity to form
                  and fashion his thoughts, so that nothing foolish or trivial escaped his lips, and
                  though he was by no means slow of reply, every idea was well weighed before it was
                  expressed. Those who talk a great deal think but little; the powers of speech and
                  imagination cannot be exercised at the same moment, and we generally find
                  immoderate talkers, at best, but shallow reasoners; profundity is the effect of
                  the mind's research, not of extravagant declamation; and the man who would be
                  superior to his fellows, must find more pleasure in communion with himself than
                  with the rest of his species.
               Seven days dawned and closed, and Harry Sutherland was still the guest of Mr.
                  Hamilton. Twice he had resolved to proceed to New York, where he was ordered to
                  join the ship for which he had been drafted; but when the appointed moment came,
                  his heart failed him, and he procrastinated the event until another and another
                  day. He was spell-bound, he was enchanted, and the thought that he must leave her,
                  for years perhaps, whose momentary absence rendered him unhappy, was miserable; he
                  could not dwell upon it with equanimity. Sometimes he thought of resigning the
                  appointment, which the kindness of his friend had obtained for him; but a moment's
                  reflection taught him the absurdity of such a measure, and he as often, again
                  rejected it.
               Sentiments of filial affection also conspired to render him unhappy; he could not
                  reconcile himself to the idea of embarking in his new profession without seeing
                  his father once more. The naval life was then one beset with peril, and he might,
                  before his return, become the victim of some one of its many casualties; or,
                  perhaps, his sire might be called on to pay the debt of nature, for his
                  constitution was suffering a rapid decay, brought on, as our hero thought, solely
                  by the irritability of his temperament. But, however strong his desires might be
                  in this case, his pride was still superior, and one of the dearest wishes of his
                  heart was crushed by its indomitable spirit.
               Meanwhile that father, gloomy and obdurate as he seemed to be, suffered the most
                  acute pangs of remorse at the absence of his son. It was not indeed until then
                  that he learned to estimate him properly; that he acknowledged in him those
                  shining qualities which he before had passed by with cold indifference. The
                  treasure is never so dear as when lost to us; and the old man felt now that he
                  would sacrifice everything to regain the love and duty of his child. Not a day
                  passed but that he despatched persons to search and inquire for him, but they
                  always returned unsuccessful; and after repeated disappointments, the father
                  finally abandoned himself to the resignation of despair.
               The time was rapidly approaching when Harry Sutherland must tear himself away from
                  her, whose beauty had already caused him to procrastinate his departure longer
                  than was consistent with his duty to himself and his host; he must leave her; he
                  acknowledged the necessity, and he resolved to go at once.
               They sat upon the portico. It was evening, and the last flush of a beautiful day
                  had deepened into the darker hues of night; the lights of heaven were twinkling in
                  their spheres, and the breeze blew cool and fragrant upon the check.
               "Anna," said our hero, breaking a silence that had existed for some moments
                  between them, "I must leave you, to-morrow."
               "To-morrow!" replied she sadly: "Oh! no! not to-morrow, Henry, not to-morrow."
               "I must, Anna," said our hero bitterly; "a further delay would ruin me!"
               For some time there was a pause; the imagination of both was busy with the future, and beside, there was an
                  almost unconquerable restraint upon the conversation.
               "I am sorry that you must go to-morrow," said Anna, mournfully.
               The youth looked up at that soft, sad speech, and he saw it confirmed with a tear,
                  and that tear made him happy, O how happy! And yet he was not selfish; he could
                  have shed multitudes of them himself, but pride was then the master, feeling but
                  the slave. Some of our impulses cannot be gratified in the presence of others; a
                  man is best himself in solitude; after boyhood has passed, we become underlings to
                  the opinions of the world.
               "I trust we shall meet again, Anna."
               "We will!"
               "But when I am absent you will forget me!"
               "Oh! never," said she; "you, I fear, will forget, not I."
               "Anna, if you knew my feelings for you, you would not say so Anna, I—"
               He hesitated; he could proceed no further; he trembled; his manliness had all
                  deserted him. That little form had inspired him with an awe that completely
                  unnerved him. He sighed, but left the sentence unfinished.
               On the following morning, Harry Sutherland set out for New York; he would not
                  consent to see his father, although urged to do so by Mr. Hamilton, and he left
                  with a heart aching from more than one cause.
               At last Mr. Sutherland learned that his son was about to put to sea in a vessel of
                  war, and no sooner had he obtained the information, than he set out for New York;
                  but again he was doomed to disappointment, the vessel had weighed her anchor, and
                  he arrived just in time to see her, like his own hopes, fade and sink before his
                  vision.
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               IT is not necessary to the order of our narrative that we should follow minutely
                  the incidents that were connected with the career of Harry Sutherland. His
                  services were particularly beneficial to the interests of his country, and a short
                  time before the commissioners were despatched to negotiate the treaty that put a
                  final end to the differences between Great Britain and America, he was advanced to
                  the rank of Post-Captain in the Navy.
               Nearly two years had elapsed since his departure from New York, before he again
                  returned to his native city, but to him the events of twenty seemed to crowd
                  themselves in that brief space. Though yet very young, the honourable and
                  important station he filled, and the heavy responsibility that rested upon him,
                  gave a decision and gravity to his character, that not often was found in persons
                  of greater experience in years or action. Other circumstances also contributed to
                  mature a mind naturally precocious, the cares and attentions of a hazardous
                  profession had called his noblest energies into action, and during that eventful
                  period, there was not an officer in the service of the States whose career had
                  more deservedly merited the approbation of his countrymen.
               He had been almost constantly afloat from the date of his entry until his
                  promotion, and had on several occasions distinguished himself in common with those
                  heroes, who, sallying out with their scanty fleets to oppose the armadas of a
                  powerful maritime nation, flushed with the recollection of a thousand victories,
                  and confident in future-success, yet taught them as completely as Miltiades at
                  Marathon, that victory was not always to the strong, and that a sacred cause is
                  sometimes more effective than a host of men in arms.
               When we look back to the events of our last war, we cannot but admire the
                  devotion, the bravery, and the energy, of those men who conducted it to so
                  glorious a close; their high-spirited daring in engaging an enemy long
                  acknowledged the Mistress of the Waters, and the intrepidity which they displayed
                  throughout the contest, surprised even their own sanguine countrymen. Men could
                  not credit their senses when intimation was first given that an English vessel of
                  war had hauled down her colours, after an action of thirty minutes with an
                  American ship of the same class. They could not for a moment imagine that the
                  haughty flag that had been borne in triumph over all the oceans of the world, and
                  that had been, since the days of the mighty Alfred, the very talisman of victory, had at length been torn from its eminence
                  by a nation whose birth was but yesterday, and whose existence was even unknown to
                  more than one dominion of the earth. But so it was; nor was the first glorious
                  precedent without example; another and another, and still another British frigate
                  struck before the thunders of America, until Britania, at length humbled and
                  dispirited, sought through negotiation what she could not compel by force of arms.
                  It was an illustrious epoch for our country, and a memorable lesson to the nations
                  of the world. Not even Rome could boast a nobler glory, when she fashioned herself
                  a fleet from the wrecked galley of Carthage, and taught the haughty African that
                  the ocean, over which he boasted before to preside invincibly, could not shield
                  him from her vengeance.
               And Harry Sutherland had contributed to this glorious result; he that but a little
                  while before wandered from his parental abode, a mere boy, almost friendless and
                  unknown, had now returned with the laurel on his brow, to the shores of that
                  country he so ably defended against her enemies. He had come back to live with
                  those in whose memories he was cherished with honour, and in whose affections he
                  was remembered with gratitude; he had braved the terrors of the battle and the
                  wrath of the tempest, that his native land might be blessed with liberty and
                  peace, and those blessings secured; he had returned to partake of them in common
                  with his countrymen.
               It was late in an evening in September when he arrived in Philadelphia. His coming
                  was unexpected, and consequently there were none to receive him. What a contrast
                  with his debarkation at New York but one week before! then the huzzas of a
                  multitude had welcomed him; but now the spot where he was about to land was
                  deserted. He wished it thus; he liked not the vociferous gratulation, however
                  sincere it might be; he chose rather the applause of the heart than that of the
                  tongue; he was satiated if not tired of the boisterous praise that had been
                  lavished upon him; his was not a mind to delight in such manifestations of
                  approbation, however ably they might have been merited. He stepped upon the wharf
                  amidst a multitude of emotions; all the actions of his past life, all his hopes
                  and fears, all the fancies that his imagination had pictured for years, rushed
                  upon his mind, creating an excitement that grew painful with its intensity. In
                  vain he endeavoured to compose his feelings; for a while his thoughts would dwell
                  upon matters of the moment, but in an instant they would revert to the chaos of
                  ideas that, if they were more distressing, bore, at the same time, a hundred fold
                  more interest. How varied were the reflections of his imagination, how evanescent,
                  and yet how perfect while they lasted! He thought of the words that had driven him
                  an exile from his father's house, but he thought not of them with bitterness; he
                  was too old and experienced now; he saw things through a correct medium; he was a
                  man in mind, though scarcely one in years, and he thought of them but to convince
                  himself of his earlier follies. Often, often, he had almost wept at the
                  recollection of that scene; he despised himself when he recurred to it; it was a
                  drawback upon his happiness for ever, and he thought of his own career in the
                  service; he mused upon its mishaps and fortunes, and what had appeared
                  common-place in enactment, was romantically interesting in retrospection; he mused
                  upon what had taken place, and speculated upon that which was yet to come; but in
                  this mine of thought there was one bright vein that was visible in all, one dream
                  that never vacated imagination; one hope more bright, more beautiful, and more
                  cherished than the rest, and one that had dazzled and exalted in all the perils,
                  and in all the trials he had overcome. Oh! when afar, how he longed for the moment
                  when he should again behold the fair being that had filled his youthful heart with
                  a rapture that was but increased by time and absence—her whose image was before
                  him in every clime, and in every sea, and her to whom his love had never for one
                  weak moment proved disloyal, though the smiles and blandishments of superior
                  beauty had not been wanting to shake his allegiance. That moment had now almost
                  arrived, and his pulse beat quicker, and his heart heaved rapturously at the
                  thought. How will she receive me? asked he of himself; but conjecture was puzzled
                  for a reply. She was now a woman, he a man, they had not seen each other for
                  years, and time makes sad alterations in feelings and affections; she may have
                  already bestowed her love upon another; but, no, no, hope forbade so cruel a
                  belief; he banished the thought. Will she be as beautiful and as kind as when we
                  first met. As beautiful, certainly, more beautiful, perhaps; but ah! she cannot
                  have preserved the manners she wore then, she cannot be as affectionate, as
                  confiding, as artless; the jealous regulations that society prescribes her
                  votaries must hide, if they have not crushed those impulses; she was then the
                  child of feeling, but now its mistress, and all the most enchanting qualities of
                  her nature, the subordinates of heartless custom.
               Such were his musings as he passed rapidly through the streets of the city, nor
                  was he recalled from them, until the waters of the Schuylkill flashed before him;
                  then the contiguity of his early home brought other thoughts, and other
                  recollections; every spot of ground reminded him of some feat or frolic to his
                  boyhood, every feature of the scene gave birth to some familiar reminiscence of
                  other, and he thought, of happier days. He crossed the river, the moonlit river,
                  he ascended the further bank, and the mansion of his father broke full upon his
                  eyes: the same picturesque turesque
                  walls—the same venerable trees—the same imposing exterior that had so often
                  greeted his boyhood with a home.
               Entering the gate, he passed along the gravelled avenue with a pace somewhat
                  moderated. At the foot of the steps a huge Newfoundland dog was reposing upon a
                  mat—it was his old play-fellow—the companion of all his juvenile expeditions; he
                  called to him, he patted him, but the animal growled at his caresses; he had
                  forgotten the hand that once fed him, and our hero sighed at the circumstance, and
                  ascended the platform.
               Without waiting to be admitted, he opened the door, and turning to the right he
                  entered the sitting room. A solitary individual occupied a chair in front of the
                  fire, and was seemingly lost in revery, for he moved not at the interruption; yet
                  he could not mistake the contour of that form, although his face was turned away;
                  it was his sire.
               "Father!" exclaimed Harry Sutherland, stretching forth his hand.
               The old man started at the sound, rose from his seat, a beam of joy irradiated his
                  countenance, and in another moment he was in the arms of his long-lost boy.
               There are periods in our existence when we, pause as it were, and look back upon
                  the incidents of other years, as the traveller who stops in the highway, to study
                  out and reflect upon things that he scarcely noticed in his passage; and the few
                  days that our hero spent beneath the roof of his paternal domain, was to him that
                  season of life.
               He was now exonerated from the responsibilities of his profession, and being once
                  more established in the affection and friendship of his father, his mind was at
                  ease, and he had ample leisure to examine the circumstances of his past life. But
                  there was nothing in the retrospection to create remorse; on the other hand there
                  was much to gratify, and the only sighs produced by the reflection were regrets
                  that the many hours of pleasure he had experienced might never occur again.
               What an intangible quality is happiness after all! our life, our fame, our
                  fortune, is spent in its pursuit—we chase it from life's starting-point to the
                  tomb, and never know that we have once caught it until it is too late to enjoy it;
                  its attainment is imperceptible, and we only become aware of having possessed it
                  after it has passed away; we then grieve over the pleasures that, unlike
                  everything beside in nature, grow plainer to our sight with increasing distance;
                  we then perceive the beauties that we could not appreciate when we called them our
                  own; like the boy who grasps the butterfly, but sees not its gaudy colouring,
                  until he suffers it to escape him. Oh! if man would only learn to enjoy the
                  present, without vain hopes for the future, or vainer regrets for the past, how
                  many happier hours might he call his own! But this can never be; the philosopher
                  has never yet existed who lived in that indulgence; such a one would be an anomaly
                  in human nature, for he would exist as the friend of his own happiness, and show
                  us the being replete with human passions and human prejudices, who has ever yet
                  been any other than an enemy to himself. 
                     
                        "Cuan presto se va el placer,
                        Como despues de acordado,
                        Da dolor!
                        Como a nuestro parecer,
                        Cualquiera tiempo passado,
                        Fue mejor!"
                     
                  
               
               In the peaceful retirement of his home Harry Sutherland learned to commune with
                  his own thoughts, and in a spirit, too, better suited to contemplation; for his
                  feelings sympathized with the calmness of everything around him, giving to his
                  mental powers a store of additional profundity, as well as a greater degree of
                  application; so that in a little time he relapsed into that meditative and
                  solitary mood that his wild and exciting profession had for a season partially
                  quenched, but never totally extinguished. Old associations brought back early
                  habits; every remembered tree, hill, or stream, exercised its former influence
                  upon his disposition, and in a little time the inveterate characteristics of his
                  boyhood began to be perceptible in all the actions of his life. The solitary
                  ramble, the deep and long-continued revery, the disinclination to society, and, in
                  short, all the peculiarities of his youth, seemed to return with additional
                  strength, for having been for a season suspended.
               But there was one circumstance that at times threw a shade of sadness over his
                  brow, and plunged him into an abyss of distressing reflections, and that was the
                  deep, though silent and somewhat stern grief of his father. The same morbid
                  melancholy that he remembered him to indulge in, still existed in his disposition;
                  and though it was not now attended with the violent bursts of passion that he had
                  so often witnessed when a boy, there was a settled sorrow about it, that rendered
                  him even a more eligible object for commiseration.
               The son knew not to what cause this effect could be attributed. His father
                  laboured under no embarrassments with respect to fortune; he was opulent to
                  independence; his health, though not the best, was far from being delicate; he was
                  not ambitious, nor proud, nor avaricious; nor was he really a misanthrope; and to
                  study out the cause of this particularity was often the employment of our hero's
                  thoughts. Could it be the loss of his wife that affected him? but, no! his mother
                  had been dead seventeen years, and the edge of grief, however keen at first, must
                  be dulled long before half that time could expire. There were evidences, however, that seemed to add
                  strength, if not conviction, to the latter belief. Harry Sutherland had more than
                  once observed his father betray the fiercest emotions when some allusion had been
                  made to his mother, and he recollected that her portrait was by his order
                  concealed beneath a curtain; the door of what had been her sleeping apartment was
                  always fastened, and everything that could possibly remind him of her was
                  concealed with a studied scrupulousness, too significant to be mistaken. The
                  father himself never spoke of her, and the son avoided the subject upon all
                  occasions, having had more than one proof that it would be a distressing one; so
                  that all that Harry Sutherland knew of his mother, was that she had been
                  celebrated for beauty and accomplishments, and had eloped to marry his father; but
                  to believe that this lasting grief, this wasting melancholy, and those tempests of
                  rage, were the result of a bereavement of such long standing was, on the other
                  hand, inconsistent with reason. He knew it was not in the nature of man to exhibit
                  such emotions under such circumstances; and from continually tracing and forming
                  causes, he became at last puzzled, confounded, gloomy, and sometimes even
                  irritable.
               Often he thought his father betrayed a want of confidence in him, by not imparting
                  the cause of all this evident unhappiness. He considered himself now sufficiently
                  experienced to be a confidant if not a sympathizer or adviser in the sorrows of
                  his sire, and had more than once resolved to question him upon a subject which he
                  treated with so much secrecy and distrust; there were times, too, when he was
                  induced to believe that his father courted interrogation with regard to the
                  matter, and that he only awaited the moment when an explanation would be
                  solicited, to enter into a full and explicit detail of his grievances; but this
                  supposition, like every other he based upon the subject, was again overturned by
                  appearances too contradictory to suffer it to become firmly established in his
                  mind.
               At length he could tolerate the anxiety produced by these causes no longer, and he
                  resolved to broach the subject, at every hazard of consequences.
               It was a dull, disagreeable day, the sky was darkened with heavy clouds; and the
                  big drops of rain pattered dismally against the windows. The father and son were
                  the only occupants of the parlour, the former sitting with a gloomy brow gazing
                  abstractedly in the fire, and the latter melancholy and restless from the feverish
                  desire that had of late so unceasingly invaded his imagination.
               There had been a long pause; one of those solemn interruptions of silence that
                  sometimes occur when our spirits are depressed, and when thought flits about as it
                  were to find a resting-place; neither had spoken for many minutes, and each seemed
                  to fear the sound of his own voice.
               "Father," said the son, at last, pained at the long-continued stillness, "are you
                  unhappy?"
               "Unhappy, Henry!" exclaimed the father, in a hollow voice, while he was evidently
                  startled at the question; "yes, my son, I am indeed unhappy, most
                  unhappy—miserable—miserable beyond human suffering!"
               "May I ask you, father, what has produced this state of feeling?"
               The old man made no reply; he seemed suddenly to be absorbed in reflections that
                  gathered cloud after cloud upon his brow; his eye grew bright with sparks of rage,
                  and his lips were compressed with a desperate firmness, as if indeed he was
                  fearful that he would utter something that would betray knowledge he had long
                  concealed.
               Harry Sutherland marked the tempest that was brooding in the breast of his father;
                  but he had gone too far for retreat; he had passed the Rubicon, and was determined
                  to invest the capital.
               "You will not," continued he, "do me the injustice to attribute my inquiry to an
                  idle sense of curiosity. Nothing but the hope that I might be able to soothe, or
                  perhaps partake, in your sorrows, would have induced me to offer a subject which I
                  know to be distressing by more than one evidence."
               "Harry," exclaimed the father, grasping the arm of his son with desperate
                  wildness, "it is enough that one of us is miserable;" he stopped suddenly, rose
                  from his seat, paced the apartment for a while, and bursting into tears, left his
                  son alone, in mingled grief and astonishment.
               Our hero did not see his sire again that evening. He had sought the privacy of his
                  chamber to give vent to those storms of grief that so often clouded his hours; and
                  the son, agitated and disheartened, pursued in solitude a series of reflections,
                  as wild and as violent, if not as distressing, as those that prevailed in the
                  breast of his father.
               All hopes of ever discovering the cause of his parent's sorrow by his own agency,
                  were now at an end; and though the words of his father had raised curiosity to a
                  higher degree, he felt that he must leave to time and accident the longed for
                  eclaircissement.
               The winds had abated—the rain had ceased—and the vast cloud that had one hour
                  before spanned the whole arch of heaven, had been shattered into ten thousand
                  fragments, through which the pale moon was struggling, brightening and darkening
                  in her march like the fire-fly upon the wing; at one moment she would sail out in
                  some clear spot, and her beams would come down upon the world beautifully bright,
                  and the world seemed to smile upon her
                  splendour; but in the next, some envious cloud would rear up its shaggy
                  battlements to oppose her way, and the silver queen would gather in her rays, like
                  the gallant ship that folds up her wings for contact with the sweeping storm.
               "How like the life of man is her career!" mused Harry Sutherland, as he gazed
                  upward from the balcony. "He struggles on through all the ills that rise between
                  his birth and death with the same obstinacy, and often with the same success,
                  through disease, penury, public prejudice, disappointment, and misery, rising at
                  one instant superior to them all, and glittering in the power of his genius, but
                  sinking in the next, until regenerating his resources he once more triumphs for an
                  hour; and thus continues, until his course is done, when like her he sinks down in
                  utter darkness, leaving no vestige behind, except, perhaps, the short-lived
                  twilight that attends the death-bed of Fame."
               Our hero sighed as these reflections were awakened in his mind; they made him
                  still more unhappy; they were mockeries to human life, to human enjoyment; they
                  tore the painted mask from the features of pleasure, and discovered to him the
                  haggardness it concealed; they were horrid truths that it is well for us all are
                  not often forced upon us.
               Indulging in these musings, he passed along the avenue, traversed its extent, and
                  was in a few moments walking the high road leading towards the city; suddenly the
                  figure of a man stood beside him, and Harry Sutherland recognised the features of
                  one whom he had not seen for a long time, but of whom he often thought, and for
                  whom he had as often inquired.
               "Captain Manly, if I mistake not?" exclaimed our hero, grasping the proffered hand
                  with a pleasant eagerness.
               "Your memory has not deceived you, Captain Sutherland," replied the stranger.
               "I hope it never may, when I meet my friends, sir," said Harry; "particularly
                  those to whom I am under obligations, and whom it would be ungrateful to
                  forget."
               "To have ever conferred a favour upon Captain Sutherland, must be considered an
                  honour; I hope, sir, you may be always my debtor."
               Our hero bowed, and wishing to change the subject, remarked that it was a long
                  time since they had seen each other.
               "It is, Captain Sutherland, if you measure time by events," replied the stranger;
                  "you have achieved in that short period more than thousands of others could have
                  accomplished in a lifetime; our country has just reason to be proud of you and of
                  all the gallant fellows that man her navy. By heaven! were they not sons of the
                  sea, I would be envious of their well-earned reputation!"
               "You are pleased to compliment us beyond what we deserve," said our hero; "the
                  distinguished Captain Manly could find many, and amongst the rest myself, who
                  would gladly exchange laurels with him; I question if. America does not owe to him
                  a heavier debt of gratitude than to any of her commanders; why, sir, your exploits
                  in the British Channel resembled more the ravages of some invincible spirit of
                  destruction, than the achievements of a human being; a glance at your little ship
                  would strike terror to the souls of our friends across the water, and your name
                  was to them as terribly familiar as was that of John Paul Jones, some years
                  before."
               The stranger replied not, and as the moonbeams fell upon his features, they
                  discovered a grim smile upon his lips and a fire in his eye that seemed to have
                  been kindled by some exciting recollection.
               "My God!" exclaimed he, at length, giving vent to his feelings, and accompanying
                  his words with a passionate gesture, "how I gloried in that strife! how I
                  delighted in spreading death and dismay amongst the Englishmen! it was the most
                  delightful excitement of my life. And oh! how I deprecated that cursed treaty; we
                  should not have made it, Captain Sutherland; we should have refused all
                  reconciliation; we should have swept their ships from the surface of the ocean, or
                  rather hurled them down into its depths; we should not have left a single stick at
                  sea for their rag to float from; we should have visited them with the vengeance of
                  the Roman Titus. One night, Captain Sutherland, one dark memorable night, I
                  descried a British frigate off the Irish coast; she had separated from a squadron
                  and was burning signals; I double-shotted my guns, ran down under her quarter, and
                  poured in a broadside; it was a terrible discharge! all three of her masts went by
                  the board, and that night a gale of wind coming on, she was driven ashore and
                  nearly all hands perished."
               Our hero turned to the stranger as he finished, and was startled at the unnatural
                  fierceness of his countenance; it seemed indeed as if he feasted upon the
                  recollection of that terrible scene, as if he remembered it with nothing but
                  pleasure, as if he looked back to it with regret that such a one could not
                  retranspire; and Captain Sutherland experienced a sensation approaching to disgust
                  towards the man beside him. Neither spoke for many seconds; and when at last our
                  hero broke the silence, it was with a forced effort.
               "And where?" asked he, "have you been cruising since the declaration of peace?
                  methinks you have had but an idle time of it."
               "A miserable time, Captain Sutherland. I want excitement. I have lived upon it all
                  my life, and it is absolutely necessary to the sustenance of the few years that
                  yet remain to me. I will seek it in some
                  foreign service, since it is denied me at home; nor care I much whether it be
                  beneath the crescent of the Turks, or the lily of the French."
               "America would regret the loss of your services, Captain Manly. There are few men
                  to whom she is more indebted for the peace she enjoys than yourself."
               "I shall not test her gratitude, sir," replied the stranger. "We are quits. I ask
                  nothing of her. I have offended, but I have served her also. We are even, now, and
                  there is not a single demand that I would urge, except, perhaps, that she might
                  pardon; but no, it matters not; I cannot live in her atmosphere, and heed but
                  little the indulgence of her laws."
               There was a hidden meaning in this speech that our hero, from motives of delicacy,
                  declined inquiring into, and yet he could not wholly govern that curiosity which
                  this mysterious declamation had awakened in his bosom.
               "It must, indeed, be a request involving immense obligations that would be refused
                  you, Captain Manly," said our hero. "The gratitude she owes you, combined with the
                  influence of one so popular and powerful as your friend, Mr. Hamilton, would, I
                  think, secure to you the most important favours."
               The stranger replied not immediately, but turning his dark glowing eyes full upon
                  the face of his companion, he seemed to study the expression of his features, with
                  a scrutiny at once distrustful and severe; but there was nothing in the calm
                  countenance of Captain Sutherland that added fuel to his suspicion, and satisfied,
                  at length, that his ideas, whatever they might have been, were unfounded, he
                  turned his gaze slowly away.
               "Have you visited Washington since your return," asked he.
               "No; duty to my father rendered my stay with him for a while imperative."
               "You will doubtless go there before long."
               "Such is my intention at present."
               "And will, of course, see William."
               "Who?"
               "Mr. Hamilton, our mutual friend."
               "Certainly, and shall be happy to be the bearer of any message you may have to
                  transmit."
               "Thanks! thanks!" replied the stranger. "I have little to say; nothing, in fact
                  nothing; you need not even mention the fact of having seen me. I would have him
                  ignorant on the subject. He is impressed with the belief that I am sojourning in
                  another country, and it is better that he be not deceived. Farewell, Captain
                  Sutherland, it is growing late, and I have yet much to transact before morning;"
                  and turning abruptly away, even before our hero had time to reply to his
                  valedictory, he passed swiftly from his presence, and was soon lost in the gloom
                  of the night.
               There was a mystery about the character of the stranger that had long before
                  awakened the interest of Harry Sutherland. He had often recurred to his first
                  interview with the renowned privateersman, but that mystery was never before so
                  exciting as at the present moment. His conversation—his manner—his
                  unsettledness—everything was indicative of some imperative control beneath which
                  his bold spirit lashed, and foamed, and fretted, like the angry wave against the
                  firm-set rock; but that restraint, whatever it might be, was not discovered until
                  long afterwards.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER V.
               IN the confliction of political events that characterized the struggle for
                  individual popularity and party ascendancy during the administration of James
                  Madison, the efforts of no one man, at that period in public life, were so
                  completely successful as were those of William Hamilton.
               Amongst the variety of theories and opinions, the currents and counter currents of
                  popular spirit, the successes and failures of measures, his course had been one so
                  judiciously marked out, as to avoid the evil consequences of every unfortunate
                  manœuvre, while he received a full share of the approbation elicited from the
                  public by the success of every popular enterprise. During no previous period of
                  our history had the sea of politics been more agitated by petty dissensions; but
                  he, like a skilful mariner, had kept his eye upon every cloud that rose in the
                  horizon, trimming his sail, and disposing his rudder, so as to avoid its effects,
                  long before the storm it portended had burst around him.
               There were few of the statesmen of that day more eminently qualified to attain
                  favour with the people. Distinguished as a barrister long before his entry into
                  public life, he had been regarded as a fit star for the political zodiac; admired
                  for the profundity of his learning, the beauty and power of his eloquence; alike
                  invincible and irresistible in argument, courteous in debate, an elegant
                  gentleman, a sincere friend, and a generous enemy, he could not have been other
                  than an object of admiration with a discerning and grateful people.
               But it was in his own home, surrounded by his family circle, where those lesser
                  virtues, that in truth indicate the character of the man, were most apparent. In
                  the performance of great duties, we regulate our actions to suit the opinions of
                  men; we act not for ourselves, but for those by whom we are surrounded; in trivial
                  matters our conduct is the result of voluntary impulses, and it is in the private
                  walks of life where man alone is undisguised.
               William Hamilton was possessed of immense wealth, and having both the means and
                  the will, he failed not to dispense the most elegant hospitalities. His house was
                  the resort for all the talent of the land; it was indeed the very temple of
                  fashion, the depot of taste and accomplishment, where the young and the old, the
                  grave and the gay, the giddy and the profound could be alike entertained and
                  amused, the more advanced in life by the master of the mansion himself, and the
                  less experienced by his beautiful and highly gifted daughter.
               Anna Hamilton was now a woman: a young woman truly in years, but a matron in
                  manner and mind, as perfect a being as man in his wildest dream of beauty could
                  conceive, and as captivating in conversation and address as one could be, who
                  possessed grace, loveliness, talent, and virtue. She was indeed endowed with all
                  the qualities that adorn the female character, without one of the follies that so
                  often rob it of a partial lustre. There was in it everything to enchant, and not
                  one single feature to displease; and the envious eye that sought to detect a
                  single unharmonious quality in its composition must turn disappointed and
                  dissatisfied away.
               She had that fortunate tact of making her attentions general when she wished it.
                  Exclusive devotion is intolerable to all except those upon whom it is lavished,
                  and offence is often taken where none was meant, by those neglected, supposing
                  such indifference a fault, when it was really a misfortune; but when Anna Hamilton
                  parted with her company, it was with the flattering impression on their part, that
                  she had been particularly attentive to each of them. Nor was this an affectation
                  of manner calculated for popularity: it was perfectly natural, with nothing
                  studied or forced about it, as was indeed manifested by the perfect ease and
                  self-possession with which she conducted herself during such interviews.
               Conscious of her superiority as she must have been, she had the address to hide
                  that consciousness, or rather, the good sense to refrain from exerting herself to
                  display qualities that were too striking to be unnoticed without another aid than
                  their own eloquence. She envied no one, perhaps that she could find no reason so
                  to do, for that vice is too often the product of conscious inferiority; and never
                  withheld praise or admiration when and where it was due.
               After all, manner is the life of beauty, and though the latter may enslave us with
                  a glance, it requires the former to render admiration consistent and permanent;
                  the one appeals forcibly to the senses, but the other fixes itself immediately
                  upon the heart. By manner we must be understood to have reference to the mind, for
                  the one is the light of the other, and they possess not in themselves a separate
                  existence. Beauty, it is true, may engender love; but it is mind alone that can
                  build up those feelings and affections that, like the refractive atmosphere, often
                  preserve the image when the object itself has passed away.
               And Anna Hamilton was not less beautiful in mind than in person, if, indeed,
                  comparisons may be instituted between apparent and intangible qualities; and cold
                  indeed must have been the heart of him who, possessing the passions and affections
                     of man, could yet look upon her
                  without experiencing some sensation of tenderness, some feeling of adoration, of
                  love, or at least of friendship.
               A stranger might have thought that interesting creature in a degree insensible,
                  but in the supposition he would exist in error. The impartiality of her demeanour
                  and the apparently indivisible nature of her attentions were more the effect of
                  politeness, than the impulse of voluntary inclination; and her extreme
                  courteousness and affability to the most uninteresting was perhaps the greatest,
                  and certainly one of the most commendable features of her character; in its
                  exercise she was unexampled. How easy was it then, to mistake motives too rarely
                  put in action to be universally familiar. But the intimate acquaintance thought
                  far better of her: he was enabled to judge and to appreciate, and saw nothing in
                  her dignified self-possession, and sweet, engaging, and yet general freedom, but a
                  disposition to render the time of her visiters as agreeable as possible. Nor was
                  this the assumed deportment of the accomplished coquette; as yet she had sought
                  the love of no man, she but endeavoured to preserve the esteem so essential to our
                  happiness in society, and if she won a heart in this pursuit, it was on her part
                  unintentional. She was beautiful but she was honourable.
               Perhaps some who read these pages, may find an objection in the character of one
                  who could render herself alike courteous to all; they will say, no doubt, that,
                  like us all, she must have had her prejudices, and to conceal them as she did, was
                  an act of refined dissimulation. And such an assertion would indeed be bright with
                  truth; but there are times when hypocrisy becomes a virtue, and when candour
                  swells almost into a crime; when an exhibition of the latter would cruelly
                  persecute, while a show of the former might mercifully soothe and encourage. It
                  would not be well to tell another that he was disagreeable; it would be cruel, and
                  the very artifice we exercise in pleasing those about us, is not only excusable,
                  but is essential to the address of the well-bred man or the accomplished
                  woman.
               It was evening, and the lights had just begun to glimmer along the streets and
                  avenues of the capital city, as Captain Sutherland, accompanied by a single
                  servant, drove up and dismounted at the door of the principal hotel. Entering his
                  name upon the book, he desired to be shown his apartments. The bell rang; the
                  servant who acted in the capacity of usher made his appearance, and bowing our
                  hero up two pair of stairs, an elevation he by no means desired, the polite
                  functionary gratified him with a view of his chambers.
               "Supper, sir?" said the waiter. "Supper," was the laconic response; and in ten
                  minutes from that period the gallant Captain Sutherland was engaged in consuming
                  sundry substances of animal mal and vegetable matter, with an earnestness that
                  would have befitted the first gastronomist of these United States.
               Having satisfied his appetite, he rang for his servant, made his toilet, and
                  sallied forth in search of the dwelling of Mr. Hamilton. With something like
                  instinct he discovered the domicil; ascending the steps he summoned a servant,
                  who, to his inquiry if the owner of the mansion was within, responded in the
                  affirmative. He had not been long seated before Mr. Hamilton made his appearance.
                  "My dear Harry," said he, clasping both his hands, "the joy I feel in this meeting
                  is greater than I have known before for a long, long time! Sit down,
                  Harry—Heavens! how you have changed! why, you are a man before your time: I would
                  not have recognised you had it not been for the card: what an entire revolution!
                  have you been always well?"
               Captain Sutherland replied to these multifarious queries, and propounded by way of
                  return perhaps quite as many; when these little civilities, we must name them,
                  were ended, our hero, asked for one in whom he was more interested than any other
                  at that particular moment, and learned to his disappointment that she had just
                  gone to a ball at the house of the French Minister. "We will go, Harry," said the
                  old gentleman, taking at the same time his gold-headed cane; and as Captain
                  Sutherland was attired in a becoming manner, he made no objection to this
                  determination.
               A few minutes walk brought them to the house, and giving in their names, they were
                  ushered into the apartments crowded with all the wit, beauty, and talent of
                  Washington. Making their way through a crowd of native fair ones and mustachoed
                  foreigners, our hero was presented to the illustrious representative of his most
                  Christian Majesty, who inquired of his health with as much seeming sincerity and
                  interest as if indeed his own life was dependent upon that of his guest. After a
                  few moments' conversation, made up principally of questions in regard to the
                  strength and discipline of the Navy, interspersed here and there with compliments
                  upon the various achievements of our hero and vague speculations upon the
                  proceedings of the last Congress, the Gallie diplomatist turned to receive a tall
                  pale man in green spectacles, when our hero, taking advantage of the circumstance,
                  glided off, leaving even his cicerone of the evening.
               In vain he looked upon the fair beings that stood up in the different quadrilles.
                  There many a pair of bright eyes met his glance, but they were not those he
                  sought, and he had almost given up the hope of finding her, when a musical voice
                  fell upon his ear with an intonation that thrilled him with pleasure: it was the
                  melody of other years, too sweet then to be forgotten now; a sound, that when once
                  admitted never afterwards becomes an alien. He turned, and beheld a beautiful
                  creature in earnest and animated
                  conversation with a tall, handsome young man, of about his own age, one of the
                  most prepossessing fellows, as he then thought, that he had ever beheld. As yet he
                  was unobserved by them, and for more than a minute he stood silently gazing upon
                  the face of her, of whom he had dreamed a thousand times, and with whom he had
                  coupled all his fancies of ambition and happiness; for whom he had striven for
                  success, and abstained from temptation, and without whom he deemed his life almost
                  valueless.
               There she stood, the same lovely being that had enchained his affections years
                  before, and it seemed that those years had blessed her with additional loveliness,
                  and that Time had brightened her eye and coloured her cheek with the lustre and
                  the bloom he had stolen from the rest.
               Captain Sutherland was in love, already in love—could it be otherwise? He adored
                  her as a boy, as a wild, imaginative, enthusiastic boy; he could have worshipped
                  her with the ardour of a fanatic; she was to his young but brilliant imagination
                  the very embodiment of virtue and purity, the personification of everything that
                  was perfect, the prototype of all that was immaculate. Yielding to the mandates of
                  duty, he left her, but his thoughts wandered back, and tended to her, as
                  faithfully as the needle that guided him pointed to the Northern Star. Amid the
                  terrors of the tempest, when the wild winds whistled through the cordage, and the
                  angry ocean threatened to ingulph all that tossed upon its surface, her image rose
                  in his imagination, and that wild scene, with all its horrors, was forgotten. He
                  paced the halls of beauty, when voluptuous music ravished the ear, and the charms
                  of woman delighted the eye; but his heart withstood all these allurements, and if
                  he smiled, it was at the recollection of one whose loveliness, were she there,
                  would dim the charms of all around, even as the moon's superior brightness hides
                  the feebler light of the most beautiful stars that spangle the immensity of
                  heaven. Day and night, in peril or in pleasure, no hour passed unsanctified by her
                  remembrance; all that was enchanting in nature recalled her to his imagination,
                  and nothing that was terrible or repulsive caused him to forget her; she was the
                  sweet spirit of his dreams, the bright goddess of every shrine he constructed in
                  his imagining. He loved her, and loved her as no other man on earth could have
                  loved. His was not a passion conceived and nourished by beauty alone, a feeling
                  that time and absence could effectually destroy, and that another's charms might
                  weaken at any moment, but an affection strengthened by reflection, pure as the
                  love the father bears the child, with nothing sensual, and but little selfish in
                  its composition; a love born but for one and transferable to none other; in a
                  word, it was that wild adoration that is but once experienced in the longest
                  lifetime, that is but known in the fervour of youth, and that gradually diminishes
                  as age and experience steal away the brightest parts of our existence; but which,
                  with him, had been so fondly nurtured in the solitude of his thoughts, so kindly
                  cherished with the fancies of a warm imagination, and so flattered by the
                  anticipations of the future, that it had even increased with absence and with
                  years.
               Perhaps he was, in this respect, too much an enthusiast. Perhaps you may think his
                  feelings should have been under more restraint, his impulses less ardent, his
                  devotion less sincere. Well! had he been educated amidst the heartless customs of
                  society, subjected to its dissimulations, initiated in its vices; had he learned
                  to feign the devotion he could not feel, to inspire with love the heart he could
                  not value; to blast the affections he dared to raise but for amusement, or to
                  betray the trembling confidence of the poor deluded girl—had he learned these
                  things, he might have tempered his feelings, he might have been much less
                  sanguine, he might have measured all that was generous in his composition, and
                  dealt it out as the apothecary his simples. But as yet he was uninstructed in the
                  mysteries of this sacred school. He had not learned to smile and murder too; his
                  feelings were all natural, free, and unshackled; his home for years had been the
                  quarter deck; his companions there were heroes, men who were neither capable of
                  giving or receiving lessons in duplicity; and it was amongst such men, and under
                  such circumstances, and with impulses as impetuous and unsuppressed as the winds
                  that fanned his own native ocean, that he mused upon the sweet being that
                  captivated his boyish heart until his love became too ardent ever to be
                  eradicated. Had he ceased to remember her at their parting, the passion might
                  never have been revived; but he listened to every whisper of hope, and indulged in
                  every suggestion of fancy until it became almost a principle of his existence. The
                  tender plant may be blighted by the slightest frost, the young sapling prostrated
                  by the gentlest gale; but the lofty oak will rear up its green branches in
                  defiance of the rudest storm.
               There she stood: he beheld her, a divinity in beauty, but, for the life of him, he
                  could not advance. A thousand tumultuous emotions agitated him—a thousand fears
                  rushed upon him, and hope, the enchantress that had buoyed him up for years,
                  deserted him at last. A moment more elapsed, and he was still unobserved. He felt
                  that his happiness rested entirely upon his reception. A smile, a word, a look
                  would decide everything; and Captain Sutherland, who had braved the wrath of the
                  tempest, and the terrors of the battle, hesitated before the glance of a woman.
                  Another moment's reflection convinced him of his weakness; and blushing to have
                  felt it, he advanced. She raised her
                  eyes; those hazel eyes, beaming with graciousness, met his own; and though they
                  sparkled with pleasure, and though she greeted him with the kindliest attention,
                  there was something in her manner that chilled him to the heart. She was easy and
                  dignified, and, though vivaciously courteous, she seemed studiously calm; and he,
                  who had never yet been taught to restrain an impulse, deemed her cold and
                  unfeeling, when, indeed, she was at heart the very child of sensation. Scarcely
                  had the first compliments of meeting passed between them, before she acquainted
                  him with the gentleman beside her; and though this was a necessary politeness,
                  Sutherland foolishly deemed, that, under the existing circumstances, this ceremony
                  should have been forgotten, or at least for a little while postponed. Another
                  circumstance also contributed to strengthen his unfounded suspicion: she had,
                  previous to his arrival, engaged herself for every quadrille that she would remain
                  to dance; and though she acknowledged this with pain, regretted it extremely, and
                  told him that she would have infinite pleasure in dancing with him, he had not the
                  generosity to appreciate her motives, nor the magnanimity to forgive them.
                  Jealousy had at that moment made him what he would have blushed to have thought
                  himself before—a selfish man. The music broke forth, the quadrille began, and
                  Captain Sutherland turned away disappointed and miserable. At that moment he could
                  have wept tears of bitterness, for his heart was bursting with emotion. "And is
                  this," said he, "the woman I have so loved, so adored, so idolized? is this the
                  creature for whom I have denied myself every pleasure that makes life tolerable;
                  for whom I have garnered up more affection than created man ever yet bestowed upon
                  woman; for whom I would have willingly died were it necessary, and on whom all my
                  hopes of happiness were centered, to treat me thus?—unfeelingly, by heavens!
                  unfeelingly! oh, it is too cruel, too cruel!" and he turned to the open window,
                  but though the night breeze cooled his moistened brow, it could not check his
                  agitation.
               Ah! Harry Sutherland, you may be skilled in many things, but are you not the
                  veriest tyro in one? Could you but read the gentle thoughts, the tender
                  sentiments, the soft regrets that pervade one fair bosom, you would be the
                  happiest fellow in the world, instead of which you are now fancying yourself the
                  most miserable creature in existence. I am afraid, Harry, that your sincerity will
                  prove no excuse for your foolishness.
               Our hero had not perceived that he was an object of general attention, so wrapt up
                  was he in communion with his own thoughts; and the bright glances, the sweet
                  smiles, and the whispered inquiries that followed his appearance, were all lost to
                  him.
               "I wonder who it is?" ejaculated Miss Araminta Lovesick. "Cousin Hervey, do
                  ascertain something about him, for I am absolutely expiring with curiosity."
               "Beloved fair one," replied the beau, "if you can possibly protract your demise
                  for a few moments, I think that I shall be enabled to prevent a catastrophe that
                  would, in all probability, bathe the world in tears of unutterable woe."
               "Then speed thee, my Mercury; let thy transit be as the lightnings, and thy return
                  even more brief; and recollect, Hervey, my hero, the advice of the Spartan mother
                  to her warrior boy, 'Come back successful or come not at all.'"
               "My life on my fortune!" exclaimed the dandy. "Oh! adored Araminta, knowest thou
                  not thy Hervey sufficiently to feel assured that he would rather undergo the most
                  excruciating torture than face thee without obtaining the desired information.
                  Light of my eyes, thou hast wronged me in thy suspicions;" and herewith Mr. Hervey
                  Fitsbooby, for such was his aristocratic cognomen, departed on his mission
                  extraordinary.
               "Minton, can you inform me who it was that came in with Mr. Hamilton to-night?"
                  asked he, addressing an individual attired in the most elaborate style, perfumed
                  with the most delicate essences, and ornamented with the most costly jewelry.
               "Dear fellow, no," replied the exquisite, thrusting his small white hand through
                  his moppy hair; "the fact is, my acquaintance is now so extensive that I have
                  absolutely determined on making a tour in Europe, in order to forget two-thirds of
                  my friends on return—devilish vulgar to be bowing and nodding to everybody you
                  meet; besides, it disarranges one's dress so."
               "Ah! Mr. Hamilton, the very person of all the world that I am most happy to meet;"
                  the statesman bowed stiffly, having an inveterate antipathy to all coxcombs.
               "Pray tell me, my dear sir, who that young fellow is that accompanied you hither
                  this evening?"
               "Fellow, Mr. Fitzbooby!" ejaculated Mr. Hamilton. "I believe, sir, that I have
                  always been very select in the choice of companions."
               "Young gentleman, I should have said, sir. No offence, I hope. I would not offend,
                  sir, upon any consideration—a lapsus, sir—a lapsus, I assure you."
               "The person to whom you allude, Mr. Fitzbooby," said the statesman, with a little
                  emphasis and more irony, "is Captain Sutherland, of the United States Navy—you
                  have heard of him, no doubt."
               Captain Sutherland—the—devil—it—is," ejaculated the dandy, honouring our hero with
                  some such a stare as a mouse would be supposed to bestow upon a lion: "Captain
                  Sutherland, eh!" and off he darted to lay the information at the feet of Miss
                  Araminta Lovesick.
               
               "The puppy!" exclaimed the old gentleman with honest indignation; "the ignorant
                  dolt! I wonder that the pressure of the external atmosphere don't crush in his
                  brainless noddle."
               "Minton, that's Sutherland," said Fitzbooby, as he hurried along, big with the
                  important news.
               "Sutherland—what Sutherland?"
               "Why, Sutherland of the Navy, to be sure."
               "You jest, Fitz."
               "Fact, by all that's immaculate—Hamilton just informed me."
               "I'll ask Hamilton to present me," thought the elegant and exclusive Theodoric
                  Minton, Esq.
               "Why, what the deuce ails thee, Harry? here are half the pretty women present
                  annoying me with importunities to introduce you, and you standing here the while,
                  looking as disconsolate and as forlorn as an ancient Briton in the palaces of
                  Rome.—Come, sir, I must make amends for my neglect this evening; but the fact is,
                  that my evil genius, Dr. Humbug, seized me by the button, and I found it
                  impossible to extricate myself until I had listened to a very minute dissertation
                  upon the antiquities of Mexico—"
               "Ah, Mr. Hamilton, glad to see you—well, sir?"
               "Very well, I thank you," a pause—the dandy discomfited—the statesman unusually
                  grave—dandy resolved to hazard a subterfuge, in consequence of discovering that he
                  had involved himself in one of those little difficulties, classed under the head
                  of unpleasing situations.
               "By the by, sir, I yesterday received a letter from my father, in which he desired
                  to you his best wishes."
               "Your father is a very excellent man, sir—I esteem him. Mr. Minton, let me
                  introduce Captain Sutherland, of the Navy."
               "Captain Sutherland!" exclaimed the exquisite, putting on a look of pleased
                  surprise, and thrusting forward his ungloved right hand. "Really, sir, I am proud
                  of making the acquaintance of so distinguished a gentleman as Captain Sutherland."
                  Our hero bowed. "How long will you remain in Washington, sir?"
               "Perhaps a month, perhaps longer; circumstances may lessen or increase my
                  stay."
               "Sir, I hope the latter. I shall be very happy to show you some attention whilst
                  you are with us. Allow me to present my card, sir. No.—,Pennsylvania Avenue, where
                  Captain Sutherland will always be very welcome."
               "You are very polite, Mr. Minton. I am at —— Hotel, where you will oblige me by
                  dropping in occasionally."
               "Why, Harry, my boy, how are you? Give me your fist, my lad. On my soul, how
                  you've grown! A veritable salt-water plant, Mr. Hamilton, when first he came on
                  board of my ship he wasn't higher than a match-tub—were you, Harry? Well, I'm glad
                  to see you, my boy. Dine with me to-morrow, dine with me, Mr. Hamilton. Mr.
                  Minton, I shall be very happy to have your company at dinner to-morrow—a medium
                  dinner, gentlemen—nothing extra and nothing ordinary—good wine—recommend that. How
                  is your father, Harry?"
               "Thank you, commodore, he is well. You, I suppose, have enjoyed your usual good
                  health?
               "Yes, my boy, toujours bien—constitution like a horse—digest a brickbat in fifteen
                  minutes—less time, if necessary. Here comes that d——d old rubbish-hunter;" and the
                  trio was augmented by the arrival of a bald-headed little man, in a threadbare
                  coat and small-clothes. To this specimen of the human race was our hero also
                  presented.
               "Desirable profession yours, Captain Sutherland," remarked he.
               "There are many who like it, doctor, and I amongst that number."
               "I should have supposed so—I should have supposed so. Many very great advantages a
                  man has who travels. I have travelled myself, sir—enlarges one's views—multiplies
                  his ideas—robs him in a great measure of national prejudices—enables him to
                  observe things through a proper medium—initiates, and even attaches him to
                  peculiarities that at first sight appear absurd in the extreme—fits him for any
                  society—for any society, sir. Are you an antiquary, Captain Sutherland?"
               "I am ashamed to confess that I am not," replied our hero; "and I am surprised,
                  too, that I have never turned my attention that way, since there is no study that
                  interests me so much."
               "Are you fond of history, Captain Sutherland?" asked the doctor, edging up, whilst
                  his face brightened like the morning sun after the dispersion of a November
                  fog.
               "Very; it is one of my favourite studies."
               "I thought so—I thought so. Antiquarianism and history are so intimately
                  connected, that we cannot conceive a passion for the one without acquiring a
                  partiality for the other. I am very fond of history, sir; I have read all the
                  histories of the world, sir; I have read from Herodotus, who flourished according
                  to Littlebury—nobody gainsays Littlebury—four hundred and thirteen years before
                  Christ, down to David Ramsay—Yes, sir, I have read a great deal of history—a great
                  deal of history, Captain Sutherland."
               "I have heard as much before," replied our hero; "and although until to-night I
                  have not had the pleasure of a personal introduction to Doctor Humbug, we have
                  long been acquainted; and more than once have I been gratified, whilst abroad, at
                  hearing the authority of one of my own countrymen brought forward as conclusive and indubitable evidence in matters
                  of antiquarianism."
               The little gentleman looked round in triumph, took a pinch of snuff, and
                  good-naturedly offered his box to each of the party.
               "The fact is, and I won't pretend to deny it," said the doctor, "the fact is, I
                  have taken some pains, to say nothing of expense and all that sort of thing, in
                  order to elucidate subjects upon which Grenoville is totally silent—between
                  ourselves, gentlemen, Grenoville is far from being a veritable narrator—have you
                  read Grenoville, Captain Sutherland?—read Grenoville, by all means, for, although
                  he is not to be depended upon in minute matters, his general delineations may be
                  considered correct. I am now engaged upon a work in four quarto volumes, to be
                  entitled "A General and Comprehensive View of the Remains of Mexican Antiquities,
                  with marginal notes and references." These volumes, Captain Sutherland, are
                  intended to convey an impartial and correct account of everything of importance,
                  and at the same time to supply the deficiencies of Grenoville, who, by the bye—I
                  must be candid in this matter—had no facilities whatever—I don't wish to disparage
                  Grenoville, gentlemen—far be it from me to assail the reputation of any man, but
                  really he is unpardonably incorrect in many of his statements; now, for instance,
                  he says that the base of the pyramid of Cholula is fourteen hundred feet in
                  length—gentlemen, to my certain knowledge, it is but thirteen hundred and
                  ninety-nine feet two inches and seven eighths. I measured it twenty-three
                  different times, to satisfy myself of its precise length, took the mean of the
                  measurements, and arrived at this conclusion. Then again, speaking of those
                  celebrated ruins, recently discovered in the province of Tabasco"—here the doctor
                  paused, and thrusting his hand in his coat pocket, produced a dozen sheets of
                  closely written foolscap. "Speaking of those ruins," continued he, "Grenoville
                  says that, judging from the extraordinary height of each particular stone forming
                  the grand stairway of the palace"—
               The antiquarian, much to his discomfiture, was here interrupted by the arrival of
                  the host, who joined the party in company with Mrs. Amelia St. Clair.
               "Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Hamilton, I cannot find words to express my disapprobation of
                  your conduct, to be absent from me for a full half hour, after swearing eternal
                  constancy, eternal devotion—O, fie upon you—out upon your gallantry—you modern
                  Theseus!"
               "I pray you mercy, sweet madam," replied the statesman, impugn not my motives
                  until you have heard my excuse; and, Oh! if there is one spark of pity in your
                  composition, liken me not to that unfaithful lover. Believe, rather, that, like
                  the Grecian Ulysses, I have encountered obstacles the most insuperable to the
                  completion of my wishes. Be in pity, then, a Penelope."
               "Your appeal is irresistible," said the beauty, extending her jewelled hand; "you
                  are forgiven—think you the daughter of Icarus was half as amiable as I?"
               "I am certain she was not; and now, Mrs. St. Clair, allow me to present my
                  particular friend, Captain Sutherland, with a request that you will take him under
                  your protection for the evening."
               "I shall have pleasure in giving my services to Captain Sutherland," replied the
                  lady, curtesying most gracefully, and bestowing on him a glance that at one time
                  might have saved Ilion.
               "Your kindness, madam, overpowers me with gratitude;" and Harry bowed never so
                  gracefully. "I dared not hope to be so honoured," and his arm was offered with the
                  easiest imaginable inclination of the body; "and least of all, by one who is so
                  universally admired as Mrs. St. Clair."
               "Well, Captain Sutherland, I vow you are the most consummate courtier I have met
                  for a year and a day." The party moved on; the doctor put up his manuscript; and
                  the diplomatist, accompanied by the commodore and Mr. Hamilton, adjourned to form
                  a table at écarte.
               "And now, my dear captain, having volunteered as your chaperone, it devolves upon
                  me, like the man in the show, to explain the genus and species of the animals
                  around us; but before I begin you must do me the favour to tell me fairly and
                  candidly if that thing you denominate your heart is perfectly unscathed by the
                  arrows of the little boy with the wings."
               Harry Sutherland sighed: for his life he could not have suppressed that sigh, and
                  for a while he was even pensive.
               "Admirably done!" exclaimed the lady; "a more feeling groan could not have
                  emanated from an expiring pair of bellows—pray, sir, did you practise with those
                  instruments?—and the countenance too—so melancholy—so softly sad—do you ever read
                  the Sorrows of Werter?"
               "Yes, lady, and sometimes feel them."
               "No doubt of it—even now I can fancy you, in my imagination, seated upon a rock,
                  by moonlight, whistling Love's Young Dream, and looking most ineffably forlorn.
                  Don't you think Miss Hamilton a charming girl?"
               "Very," responded Sutherland, with a heavy heart.
               "She is my particular friend, my most especial favourite."
               "And the gentleman who is now dancing with her——"
               "Is John Montgomery—the idol of our sex, and the envy of his own—one of the most promising young men in
                  Washington, yourself exclusive, my gallant captain."
               "And is he attentive to Miss Hamilton?" asked Sutherland, somewhat earnestly.
               "Devoted to her," said she; and tapping a gentleman who stood in their way
                  familiarly upon the shoulder, she introduced our hero to Mr. St. Clair.
               "This is the individual," added the lady, "who calls himself my husband."
               "Only when you are present, my dear—in your absence I am always unmarried,"
                  replied Mr. St. Clair, good-humouredly. "Captain Sutherland, accept my sincere
                  thanks for taking this lady off of my hands; I was just fearing that she would be
                  unable to find a beau, in which event she would have most probably defeated a
                  little flirtation which I have in view."
               "Off of your hands!" exclaimed the beauty; "did ever woman listen to such
                  impudence! but I'll be revenged. I'll make Captain Sutherland shoot you, and marry
                  me afterwards; so, sir, make your will at once."
               "I shall, my love, and to my mortal enemy I will bequeath you, a legacy, ha, ha,
                  ha!" and bowing to Sutherland the husband passed on, thinking he made a favourable
                  impression by saying what he deemed an excellent thing.
               "Let me congratulate Mrs. Sinclair upon the possession of so handsome and so
                  amiable a lord——."
               "Do, my dear captain," interrupted the lady, "do, for really he is the most
                  considerate person in existence; he is so devoted and so studiously attentive to
                  my comfort, that he intrudes his presence about once a week, at least once a week,
                  and then he entertains so nice a regard for my feelings, so kind of him, to
                  endeavour by every possible means to make me forget that I have pledged myself to
                  love, honour, and obey him."
               There was something so sarcastic in this reply, uttered as it was in a tone of
                  extreme bitterness, and in a vein totally at variance with her former manner, that
                  Sutherland could not for a moment but believe that truth dictated what pride was
                  struggling to conceal. Could any man on earth, asked he of himself, be indifferent
                  to so lovely a woman? It seemed impossible; and yet it must be the case in the
                  present instance. She was evidently unhappy, and her words were surely an allusion
                  to the cause of her distress, too significant to be mistaken. There succeeded then
                  a silence unusually prolonged; Mrs. St. Clair seemed to struggle hard with an
                  agitation she wished to suppress, a tear started in her beautiful blue eyes, and
                  her countenance lost in sadness the animation that had before distinguished it.
                  One of those secret griefs that had long lain dormant in her breast had escaped
                  all mastery, and for a moment she was swept away in its current, like the leaf on
                  the resistless tide of the mountain torrent.
               O how often! how very often, does an appearance of gayety conceal the desolation
                  that reigns within, how often is the smile driven to the lip when the heart is
                  breaking with suppressed anguish! And how often, and how truly, and how devotedly
                  does woman struggle to hide from the world the feelings that are day by day, and
                  hour by hour, undermining both health and happiness, and all for the affection she
                  bears him, who won her young love, and vowed at the altar of God to protect and
                  cherish her, and who redeems his pledge, by ruining her hopes for ever, without
                  one single sigh of remorse, or one little thought of penitence. And one who often
                  returns her gentle reproach with abuse, views her silent tears with indifference,
                  and looks upon her melancholy countenance and attenuated form with barbarian
                  callousness, when a single smile, a single embrace would purchase redemption for
                  past faithlessness, and restore to her sorrowing heart the joy that had long been
                  a stranger to its portals; when a kind word would brighten the faded brow of hope,
                  and bring back to the faded cheek the bloom and the beauty that haggard misery had
                  chased away, and when returning constancy would make her even happier than she had
                  ever been before.
               Mrs. St. Clair had betrayed a secret she had confided to none. Sutherland knew
                  this, and under these circumstances durst not offer a word of consolation; his
                  sympathy was not solicited, and he felt that it would be insulting to proffer it
                  to one too proud to let the world into the knowledge of her unhappiness but who,
                  like the Spartan boy, choose rather to screen the monster that was gnawing at her
                  vitals. Luckily, however, for Sutherland, at the very moment he was about to
                  hazard a remark which must have been painful, as Mrs. St. Clair could not but
                  observe that it was intended to turn a subject which he knew to be disagreeable,
                  and which she must have hoped he had not understood to its fullest extent—luckily
                  for him, at this juncture he was spoken to, and on turning he beheld the
                  benevolent bald head of the antiquarian.
               "Pardon this little intrusion," began the doctor; "I will claim your attention, to
                  ask if you will do me the favour to drop in and see me to-morrow, or the next day,
                  or at your earliest convenience. The fact is, Captain Sutherland, I wish to prove
                  to you the flagrant inaccuracy of Grenoville's statement, in relation not only to
                  the ruins of Paleski, but also in regard to the sacrificial stone of the city of
                  Mexico: in his description of this extraordinary relic of antiquity, he says
                  nothing of the canal which is cut through it, for the purpose of carrying off the
                  blood of the victims. Now, there are but two opinions to be inferred from his
                  silence upon the subject, I may say upon this very important subject; the first of which is, that he had never
                  himself seen the stone, and the second, that if he had examined it, he from sheer
                  neglect or carelessness failed to make mention of it; in either case he was highly
                  culpable; now, in this treatise,"—and he reproduced the half quire of foolscap—"in
                  these few remarks, which I will not at present intrude upon your attention, I have
                  not only pointed out the inacuracies of Grenoville in his descriptions of the
                  ruins of Tabasco, but I have also exposed to the public many of his errors—which
                  were absolutely wilful—absolutely wilful, Captain Sutherland; recollect, I do not
                  mean to disparage Monsieur Le Compte de Grenoville, he is undoubtedly a man of
                  genius—of surprising genius—but inter nos"—and the little man put his right
                  forefinger against the dexter abutment of his nasal organ—"I don't envy his
                  reputation. Ah, my dear sir, poor Goldsmith never said a truer thing, than—but I
                  see I am trespassing upon your patience—good night, don't fail to visit me—always
                  at home;" and making a hasty bow, the erudite doctor was, in a moment afterwards,
                  swallowed up in the crowd.
               "What an amusing thing it is!" said Mrs. St. Clair, with a languid smile, and our
                  hero was rejoiced to observe that she had recovered her equanimity if not her
                  vivacity. "Come," continued she, "the quadrille is ended, and I will now seize the
                  opportunity of introducing you to all the witty and beautiful women present;" and
                  Captain Sutherland was accordingly presented to a host of Houris, as lovely and as
                  captivating as ever yet enchanted an oriental paradise. There were present also
                  some old ladies, but of them we will say nothing; they, too, were Houris once,
                  although old ladies now; to them our hero was not wanting in attention, perhaps he
                  forgot what they were, in the remembrance of what they had been.
               "Do you know Captain Sutherland, Mr. Minton?" asked a young lady who had just
                  emanated from a boarding school, with a head full of romance, and a heart as
                  susceptible of inflammation as a piece of tinder.
               "Sutherland," drawled out the elegant Mr. Minton; "O, yes, we are intimate, very
                  intimate, he is one of the few naval officers that I can at all tolerate, those
                  fellows are generally so very unrefined in their manners; I recollect of seeing
                  one of them devour, at a single sitting, eleven pounds of the most odious sausages
                  I ever beheld."
               "Horrible!" exclaimed the lady, for, to her enthusiastic imagination, a sausage
                  was the most unromantic thing in the world.
               "O, despicable!" rejoined Mr. Minton.
               "But then, Captain Sutherland appears to be all gentility, all politeness. Really,
                  I am in love with him. Now don't tell him, Mr. Minton, I would not have him know
                  it for the world; so handsome some, too, and such a hero! I never look at him
                  without thinking of Lord Nelson."
               "Ah! Nelson was a devilish clever fellow; I never have met a man I had a greater
                  attachment for than Nelson."
               "Were you acquainted with Lord Nelson?" asked the astonished Miss Arabella Fitz
                  Eustis.
               "O, very well, very well," replied Mr. Minton, with the utmost nonchalance; "at
                  Naples we played billiards together, every day for a fortnight."
               "Played billiards! why, Mr. Minton, didn't he lose an arm somewhere?"
               "An arm!" replied the exquisite; "oh no, not exactly an arm, it was a leg—he lost
                  a leg somewhere—I used to joke him at times about that leg. Devilish good thing I
                  said to him once, in allusion to that leg—long time ago though—forgotten it
                  now."
               "Truant, where have you been wandering?" spoke a sweet voice; and on turning,
                  Captain Sutherland beheld Miss Hamilton leaning on the arm of Montgomery. "Cousin,
                  you must resign this gentleman to me for a while, I have a great deal to say to
                  him; we are old acquaintances, you know, and not having seen each other for a long
                  long time, we have to talk over all that has happened since our separation; come,
                  coz, no denial!"
               Even as the first ray of the glorious sun melts the frigid snow on the mountain
                  top, so the soft glance that accompanied the words of Anna Hamilton dissolved the
                  unfavourable impressions that our hero in a moment of unreasonable resentment had
                  conceived of her; his eyes sparkled with gratitude, a smile of peculiar beauty
                  played upon his lips, and the gloom that a moment before clouded his brow,
                  vanished as the darkness of the night disappears before the brilliant glare of
                  day.
               "Denial, my sweet friend!" responded Mrs. St. Clair, "I never had one for you; on
                  the contrary, I have long been wishing for an opportunity to serve you at a
                  sacrifice to myself; that moment is now at hand, and I transfer to you one of the
                  most agreeable young gentlemen I have ever encountered."
               "Could I be made conscious that I deserve so sweet a compliment from Mrs. St.
                  Clair, I should become the vainest mortal in Christendom," replied Sutherland.
               The short half hour that he spent in conversing with Miss Hamilton was the
                  sweetest period of his life. She was never more beautiful, never more kind; and he
                  was never more susceptible of her influence. Every circumstance of interest that
                  had transpired during his absence was related with accuracy and animation; nothing
                  was omitted; a hundred questions were answered in the softest and most melodious
                  voice in the world, and as many more might have been propounded had their
                  conversation undergone no interruption; but, unfortunately, at the very moment when the lady was engaged in a
                  glowing detail of some important event, Count Sawmynoshoff, the Russian Minister,
                  stepped up, bowed, and reminded her that she had been so obliging as to promise
                  him this quadrille with her.
               Gentle reader—all readers are gentle until they become critics—have you ever been
                  interrupted in a tête-à-tête with the woman you love? If such a misfortune has
                  once fallen to your lot, you can appreciate the feelings of Harry Sutherland. He
                  turned away with that emotion of loneliness that sometimes steals over us when
                  surrounded by hundreds, hummed a favourite opera, and, as a last resource from
                  ennui or something worse, joined a party that were listening to an animated
                  discourse upon the beneficial effects of flannel shirts.
               Not being prepared, or rather feeling himself incompetent, to enter into a
                  discussion upon so important and grave a subject, he suffered himself to wander to
                  an adjacent quarter of the apartment, where he had the good fortune to become
                  acquainted with Captain Stanhope, of the Royal Navy.
               "I think we have met before," observed that gentleman; "it appears to me that I
                  had the pleasure of meeting you at Port Royal, when I commanded the Thunderer,
                  some six months since, or thereabout."
               "I suspect you mistake me for some other person," retorted Sutherland. "I never
                  have been at Port Royal, nor do I recollect ever having had the pleasure of seeing
                  you before."
               "Not been at Port Royal? then it must have been at Portsmouth. I recollect
                  pointing you out one day to the admiral. Yes, it was at Portsmouth. I recollect
                  the circumstance now perfectly well. It was just a week or so after the Thunderer
                  was paid off."
               Captain Sutherland smiled, but was silent; the other was so positive that he could
                  not find it in his heart to contradict him. A man dislikes being made conscious of
                  his error, when he wishes to be in the wrong.
               "A d——d fine ship was the Thunderer!" resumed the Englishman; "d——d fine ship; got
                  fourteen two out of her once, on a taut bowline; told his Majesty of it; Majesty
                  shook his head, laughed, and said, Ah, Stanhope, you are a sad dog! Didn't believe
                  me; invited him on board; got under way; nice to' gallant breeze, and by the Lord
                  she went off at the rate of fifteen four."
               "Fifteen four!"
               "Yes, sir, fifteen four! wouldn't believe it, would you? Well, said I to his
                  Majesty, who, by the bye, was perfectly delighted,—a d——d clever fellow was his
                  Majesty—said I to him, Say nothing to Spencer about this, and I'll win a wager of
                  him. Spencer first lord, you know—owed him a grudge—d——d wag was Spencer—sent me
                  to the East Indies once to procure a pair of harp-shells for Lady Jane
                  Talbot."
               Sutherland could not refrain a laugh.
               "Fact, sir, by all the gods celestial—circumstances were these; Lady Jane Talbot,
                  Spencer, and myself, eating sandwiches with the Countess of Cloudesley,
                  conversation turned upon conchology; asked Lady Jane if she had ever seen the lyra
                  or harp-shell; replied she had not; described it to her; Lady Jane in ecstasies
                  with the description; enceinte at the time; vowed she'd never rest contented until
                  she procured a pair of them; despatched agents all over England to obtain them;
                  sent to France, none there; informed her ladyship of my ill success; swore at the
                  same time that I would willingly go to India to obtain them for her; first lord
                  heard of it; next day received orders to proceed thither in the Tremendous; amount
                  of my instructions to obtain a pair of shells for Lady Jane Talbot; d——d good
                  joke; never forgive him for it, though. A great wag was Spencer."
               At a late hour the assemblage began to dissolve; party after party retired;
                  carriage after carriage whirled from the door; light after light was extinguished;
                  until at last silence composed herself upon the scene where gayety had been
                  exuberant in display, and where mirth ran so wild that her antics cheated even
                  sorrow into forgetfulness.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VI.
               WHEN Captain Sutherland awoke, the rays of the morning sun were playing through
                  the blinds of the window-shutters, and the noise of vehicles passing and repassing
                  in the streets below afforded a noisy indication of the advance of the day.
                  Springing from his bed with the celerity of one who discovers he has overslept his
                  proposed time, he went about arranging and preparing himself for the business of
                  the day. A sailor's toilet is soon made, and his breakfast as soon despatched; and
                  in a period of space much less than an exquisite of the present day would occupy
                  in tying his cravat, our hero had finished both of those duties, and sallied out
                  into the open air.
               After transacting some official duties with the public departments, he proceeded
                  to the dwelling of Mr. Hamilton. Anna was not alone—as he had expected, Mr.
                  Montgomery was with her. She was as beautiful as ever; as gay, as witty, and as
                  interesting, and he even thought she displayed an unusual flow of spirits. But it
                  was something akin to jealousy that whispered this. She sustained the greater part
                  of the conversation, it was true; but merely because Montgomery and Sutherland
                  evinced a decided disposition towards taciturnity. The former had been talking in
                  a very animated strain until the entrance of the latter, when he ceased almost
                  altogether. There was a restraint upon Sutherland, too, that he could not shake
                  off; and although he endeavoured once or twice to become interested and eloquent,
                  he felt at the time inadequate, and so gave it up.
               "D——n that fellow, Montgomery!" secretly ejaculated he, as he returned to his
                  hotel, in no very excellent humour with himself or anybody else. And even while he
                  muttered this splenetic sentence, the same benevolent denunciation was as
                  earnestly reciprocated by Mr. John Montgomery.
               At half-past three our hero repaired to the quarters of Commodore Transom, where
                  he found at least a dozen of his own species, who had there assembled for the
                  laudable purpose of destroying manifold substances, both animal and vegetable.
                  There was the French Minister, and the English Minister, the Russian Envoy
                  Sawmynoshoff, and the noble Polish exile, Count Pintowhiskey. There was also
                  Major-General Thunderbolt, commander-in-chief of the Army, and Captain St. George
                  St. John St. Vincent Stanhope, of the Royal Navy. Dr. Humbug was also there, but
                  busily engaged in one corner with another fat little gentleman, whom he detained
                  by a button-hole. Mr. St. Clair and Mr. Hamilton entered immediately after
                  Sutherland; and the last guest at length arrived in the person of Mr. Fitzbooby,
                  who had stationed a servant in the street to observe when all had assembled, that
                  he might avoid the unfashionable crime of arriving before any one else.
               "Ah, commodore," exclaimed he, apparently out of breath, while he wiped his brow
                  with a handkerchief that dispensed the odours of Araby about the apartment. "Last,
                  as usual—can't help it though—can't help it, your honour—misfortune—great
                  misfortune—inveterate habit—devilish bad habit, too—hope, commodore I have not
                  been the cause of any delay."
               "By no means, Mr. Fitzbooby, by no means; dinner has not been announced, and you
                  have yet time to rest from the fatigue you have evidently experienced."
               "Ah! glad to hear it—really very glad to hear it; 'pon honour should feel
                  miserable under the consciousness of having been the cause of inconvenience to a
                  friend; fatigued, you say? Yes, quite fatigued—drove with the utmost
                  rapidity—overset one venerable apple-woman, and threw a multitude of dogs and
                  other animals into a fearful state of consternation."
               "Something similar to a drive I once took along the Corso, at Rome," remarked
                  Captain Stanhope, who came up in time to hear Fitzbooby's last speech. "I and Lord
                  George Drinkwater, a cousin of mine, and a d—d rum chap, by the bye, fond of a
                  lark, and all that sort o' thing, got into a vehicle for the purpose of visiting
                  an acquaintance at the Villa Borghese, when the horses took fright at a red
                  petticoat which a wench was hanging out to dry, and dashed down the Corso at full
                  speed, killing and wounding forty-two children, sixteen lazaroni, and twenty-one
                  of the most respectable citizens of Sicily."
               "Good heavens!" exclaimed the horror-struck exquisite; "and how did you
                  escape?"
               "By the Lord, it was terrible," resumed the captain, continuing his narration in
                  order to gain time for a reply to Fitzbooby's question. "All Rome was in tears for
                  a month afterward, and the holy father told me since, that upwards of six thousand
                  seven hundred masses had been said for those who were crushed to death by our
                  horses; poor Drinkwater was thrown out and killed instantaneously, and I only
                  escaped by being tossed up twenty feet into a verandah."
               "Great God, how shocking!" interrupted the exquisite.
               "So shocking, Mr. Fitzbooby, so truly terrifying, and at the same time so
                  strikingly terrible, that the celebrated artist Bernardo Tinto, perceiving in it a
                  fit field for the exercise of his extraordinary talent, painted it on one thousand
                  square feet of canvass, and disposed of the production to the Duke of Modena for
                  the sum of three hundred thousand piastres."
               
               "Dinner, gentleman!" roared out the major domo.
               "Dinner, gentlemen!" responded the commodore, while, at the same time, the folding
                  doors were thrown open, exposing to view the table with all its paraphernalia of
                  covers, castors, coolers, glasses, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
               The fare was excellent—how could it have been indifferent when cooked under the
                  immediate superintendence, if not with the personal assistance of Monsieur Pierre
                  Fricassee—Monsieur Pierre Fricassee, that prince of the kitchen, that unrivalled
                  master in the art of viand dressing, that distinguished scullion, whose arrival in
                  the United States of America created such extraordinary and tumultuous excitement
                  amongst the gastronomi of the land. It was said that one hundred and fifty of the
                  fat men of New York repaired on board of the ship in order to secure his services,
                  but were disappointed, he having been previously engaged by the Marquis of Bouille
                  for the accommodation of the commodore; one Southerner, not succeeding by bribery,
                  attempted to carry off Monsieur by force, but an individual from Boston, who was
                  in the secret, fearing that the States of the South would obtain by the measure a
                  reputation for cookery, at the expense of their more northern neighbours, informed
                  the commodore of the design, in consequence of which, the plan of the planter
                  proved an entire failure. It would have been well if the matter had ceased here,
                  but not so; the commodore, exasperated by the insidious intentions of the
                  Southerner, publicly proclaimed him "a contemptible scoundrel."
               A duel resulted, and the planter fell. Many were the bon vivants that sighed for
                  the possession of Monsieur Pierre de la Roche Fricassee, but the fate of the
                  Southerner deterred them from any attempt to seduce him from his acknowledged
                  allegiance, and the commodore was left in undisputed, if not in unenvied retention
                  of this Knight of the Smoke Jack.
               After soup had been taken, the conversation became animated and general; some
                  faint flashes of wit illuminated the table, but many dull sayings and stale jokes
                  were laughed at out of compliment.
               "Will Captain Stanhope do me the favour to drink wine with me?" asked Dr. Humbug,
                  peeping through an incision he had made in a haunch of venison, like a sentinel
                  through an embrasure.
               "Ah! doctor, you have anticipated me. I was just about to solicit the honour of
                  you—certainly—fill up, sir."
               "May I ask Captain Stanhope how long it is since you were in Mexico? I believe you
                  told me that you had visited that country."
               "You are right, doctor—perfectly right; I accompanied Sir George Blunderbuss, when
                  he went out on his mission extraordinary nary. Let me see—it has been about three
                  years—yes, about three years ago—certainly not less—I may say three years."
               "Do you agree with Grenoville, in the belief that the ancient Mexicans were of a
                  more gigantic formation than their descendants of the present day?" asked Dr.
                  Humbug, clearing his throat and establishing himself with more comfort upon his
                  chair.
               "I do," replied the Englishman; "in fact, I know such to have been the case."
               "Do you speak from opinion, captain, or have you discovered the proof in the
                  magnitude of their architectural remains? Grenoville, in his work, states the fact
                  merely from the extraordinary altitude of the stepping stones at the base of the
                  temple of Cholula; but I cannot think this sufficient authority for the inference.
                  Grenoville has in many instances admitted doubtful evidences."
               "But, doctor, I have had irrefragable illustrations of the fact; and have now, in
                  England, more undeniable proofs of it. Lord Henry Fitz Clarence has in his
                  possession a pipe, picked up by me, in, or near Tampico, which he uses as a
                  warming pan. And the Countess of Cloudesley makes use of a Mexican thimble I
                  presented her as a water goblet."
               "A water goblet!" exclaimed the enlightened Humbug.
               "Ay, a water goblet," replied Captain Stanhope. "But, if that astonishes you, what
                  will you say when I tell you that my boat's crew, in digging for sand, discovered
                  a billiard table, one hundred feet long by thirty-five broad."
               "You jest!" exclaimed Humbug;, as if he would not willingly believe what he
                  nevertheless thought the truth.
               "Fact, by my hopes of an earldom," resumed the captain; "the balls we could not
                  find, but I towed the cues alongside, and made of them an excellent set of
                  topgallant-studding-sail-booms."
               Doctor Humbug made no reply, but, noting the circumstance in his tablets, he came
                  to the disagreeable conclusion, that Grenoville was right in regard to the
                  physical organization of the aborigines of Mexico.
               Perhaps too much patience has been exacted of you who are now perusing these
                  pages, and too much time has been wasted by me in the composition of matter
                  irrelevant to the true routine of this narrative. Had that probability occurred to
                  me before arriving thus far, chapter the sixth would most certainly have been
                  devoted to another and perhaps a more interesting purpose. But as I have almost
                  unwittingly dashed into an improper path, I must e'en make the best of my way out
                  of it; and as the reader has in all probability become somewhat curious as to the
                  cause of this digression, I will avail myself of the following critiques extracted
                  from the leading journals of the day, to convince him that if I scribbled at random, I had at least a
                  motive to palliate, if not to justify the trespass perpetrated upon his
                  forbearance.
               
                  From the American Monthly Mercury.
                  Messrs. Blake & Bottlewasher have just issued from their press Doctor
                     Humbug's long expected work on Mexico, and we are gratified to add that public
                     expectation has not been deceived in regard to this admirable production. The
                     erudite author of this literary desideratum, although a scholar of vast
                     research, and attainments the most profound, has not, like many historians of
                     the day, advanced opinions, or constructed hypotheses, without regard to, and
                     even in total variance with the systems and ideas of all others.
                  In the compilation of these volumes, Doctor Humbug has evinced a jealousy of
                     his own fallibility which is ever the distinction of a veritable and impartial
                     writer. All authorities upon the subject in question have been assiduously
                     consulted by him. All information that could be gleaned from the periodicals of
                     the times, has been carefully collected and noted. No effort has been left
                     unmade by which he might become perfectly acquainted with the arduous and
                     complicated duty he had undertaken. The pioneer of antiquity, he laboured with
                     an indefatigability that is in itself enough to heap imperishable honours upon
                     his brow, even had it not been attended with such brilliant effects—even had
                     his triumph not been so magnificently complete.
                  The notes of many of the most distinguished travellers of modern years have
                     been most generously tendered him, and many men of genius have even assisted in
                     the more direct arrangement of the work; amongst the latter, it would be
                     ungrateful were we to omit the name of Captain St. George St. John St. Vincent
                     Stanhope, of the Royal Navy, a gentleman whose knowledge of Mexican antiquities
                     was obtained by the most persevering researches, during a residence of three
                     years in the country, two-thirds of which time he spent in the exploration of
                     the various ruins with which it abounds.
                  With talents of the highest order, with a zeal well strengthened by
                     difficulties, and an energy too sanguine to be borne down by opposition—with
                     gifts so remarkable as these, combined with all the advantages of the
                     experience of others, Doctor Humbug could not well have written another than a
                     superior work; and whether we consider it as a beautiful specimen of literary
                     composition, or as a faithful history of monumental remains, it is alike
                     entitled to our warmest commendation. And we dare affirm there will be not one
                     dissenting opinion, when we add that while the gifted Humbug was
                     philanthropically enlightening and edifying his fellow creatures, he was also
                     engaged in constructing a temple to his memory, that will exist in splendour
                     when the most boasted obelisk of Egypt shall have crumbled into dust.
               
               
                  From the American Quarterly Messenger.
                  Humbug's Mexico has at length made its appearance. Never perhaps in the annals
                     of literature has any work of this kind been looked for with so much avidity.
                     The abilities of its learned author to produce a history of the kind are too
                     well known to the American public to require eulogium from us; at all events,
                     no surer indication of their entire confidence in his talents could be given,
                     than the eagerness they manifested on the morning of its announcement. Nearly
                     five hundred persons had collected about the doors of Messrs. Blake &
                     Bottlewasher, one hour after it was generally known that the work was in the
                     hands of the bookseller; and in less than two days from the time of its
                     publication, the whole edition was disposed of.
                  Never, perhaps, has such brilliant success attended any publication on this
                     side of the Atlantic; and we may with safety add, that our European friends can
                     boast no event so complimentary to their men of letters. And yet this success
                     is merited; even had its reception been more flattering, it could not have
                     repaid the anxious care, the continued assiduity, the almost superhuman
                     exertion, with which these volumes were compiled. The reward of one who has
                     conferred so signal a benefit upon the human race, is not to be found in the
                     breath of its fame, or the glitter of its metal; it is in the hearts of his
                     fellow men that Doctor Humbug must seek the only recompense that can repay his
                     labours; and if he find not there that gratitude which is due so great a
                     benefactor, then have we egregiously mistaken the spirit of the American
                     people.
                  To Captain St. George St. John St. Vincent Stanhope, of the Royal Navy, the
                     Doctor is particularly indebted for much information of a character highly
                     essential to the form of his work. This gentleman having been attached to the
                     British Legation in Mexico, had ample opportunities to prosecute his researches
                     in that quarter; and antiquarianism being with him a favourite study, it may be
                     supposed that no pains were spared to add to the store of his information. All
                     that he knew upon the subject was freely communicated to Doctor Humbug; which,
                     combined with the experience of many other travellers of distinction, together
                     with his own knowledge of the subject, has produced a work that will fill a
                     niche long vacant in the gallery of our literature.
                  All the dailies, weeklies, monthlies, quarterlies, and semi-annuals annuals of the land, without a single
                     exception, united in bestowing the most ardent praise upon the new production.
                     Nothing was thought of or spoken of but Humbug's Mexico. All ages, sexes, and
                     classes of people, were seized with a most violent desire to become acquainted
                     with its contents. The school-boy neglected his juvenile pastime to peruse it;
                     and the boarding-school miss for awhile ceased to explore the fascinating pages
                     of Ann Radcliffe and Jane Porter. The man of law threw aside his briefs, to
                     gather information of a country he till then was almost ignorant of; and the
                     artisan suffered his hammer to repose in silence, whilst he devoured chapter
                     after chapter of that all-absorbing production. The first, the second, the
                     third, and a part of the fourth edition, was expended in the short space of two
                     months: its contents were then condensed in one small volume, and designed for
                     the use of schools. Blake & Bottlewasher extended their business, admitted
                     a third partner in the concern, and opened another house. Doctor Humbug
                     discarded his ancient raiment, and purchased an entire new suit of black,
                     together with an elegant gold-headed cane. The wonderful success of his Mexico,
                     however, though it rendered him opulent, changed not in the least his native
                     demeanour: in the full tide of his prosperity he was still the same unassuming,
                     benevolent little fat man; and if his eyes sometimes sparkled, and his chest
                     heaved with conscious dignity, when he beheld himself the object of so much
                     attention, it was a triumph so modest, that even the most envious could not
                     scruple to forgive it.
               
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               THERE was in the city of Washington one individual who might have worn the
                  brightest chaplet that genius ever yet wrested from the grasp of fame, had his
                  energies been properly directed, or rather had not circumstances operated to crush
                  an ambition naturally as impetuous as the swiftest river of his land.
               The very darling of nature, she seemed to have lavished upon him all her most
                  brilliant attributes; but, unhappily, her gifts were of that fervid formation that
                  receives every impulse with a wild alacrity, but that seems to wither and die
                  beneath the force of vexation or disappointment, like the silver stream of the
                  mountain that rushes on, sparkling in sunshine, and casting myriads of diamonds
                  upon everything in its course, leaping madly from rock to rock, varying its dyes
                  at every pass, and laughing for very joy, until precipitated into the pent-up
                  ravine, when its beauties all decay, its song is all hushed, and its waters creep
                  silently and sluggishly along, or, perhaps, remain motionless altogether.
               The pale broad brow of that young man, for scarce had he numbered twenty-three
                  years of time, was the very empire of thought; and it seemed as if the shadow of
                  each brilliant image of his mind could be traced upon it, as plainly as the
                  passing clouds upon the surface of the beautiful moon. His eye was always glowing
                  with expression, deep settled-expression, the result of long and profound
                  self-communion; his cheeks were pale, the pallor not of disease, the wilder hue of
                  mental excitement; and his features austere, always austere, a smile could not rob
                  them of that character, though it might for an instant vary their appearance, even
                  as a ray of the sun will light up the stern rugged rock, without changing its rude
                  shape or altering its adamantine formation.
               Although his was that time of life when man seeks the communion of his fellow men,
                  and pursues with avidity all the pleasures of social intercourse, attaching
                  himself to those gayeties that become the young but are absurd in the more
                  advanced; with him such impulses seemed not to exist. Silent and solitary he stood
                  apart from the mass, wrapping himself up in his own deep thoughts, checking
                  familiarity by characteristic haughtiness, and avoiding the haunts of his fellow
                  creatures with a perseverance as assiduous as it was unaccountable. And yet he was
                  ambitious, and yet the happiness of none rested so entirely upon the opinions of
                  the world, of that world he attempted to despise—of that world from which he stood aloof in the pride of a
                  mistaken spirit, and of which he in truth, brilliant as were his talents, powerful
                  as was his genius, constituted so inconsiderable a particle.
               To win praises from the mouths of men, to extort their adulation, to rise superior
                  in their estimation, had been his study and his task for years. For this he toiled
                  day and night, for this he called forth the treasures of his golden imagination,
                  for this he pondered by his midnight lamp, for this the comforts and luxuries of
                  life were rejected, and even health prejudiced. And in this he was successful; the
                  powerful evidences of his magnificent mind broke forth in everything he wrote; a
                  fancy more sparkling, more varied, and yet more true to nature, never illuminated
                  imagination. His verses seemed the very embodiment of feeling, and in this
                  consisted their charm; not a word, not a line of them all but came home to the
                  heart as its own dictation, and that dictation, harmonized as it was by metaphors
                  the most beautiful, and consecrated by ideas the most sublime, could not but carry
                  captive the minds that received its impression.
               And yet, though the darling passion of his heart was gratified, though all men
                  bore testimony to the superiority of his genius, though all admired, though all
                  courted, he was unhappy. His was that diseased mind that covets everything and
                  finds no pleasure in the object when obtained; that morbid, restless spirit to
                  which life seems an interminable ocean, without one single spot of sunny earth on
                  which to rest its pinions. Despising the gay pursuits of his own class, he even
                  neglected advantages that his immense wealth might have commanded; living in
                  solitude, avoiding ostentation, and seemingly better pleased with the silent
                  communion of his own thoughts than with social intercourse or worldly connexion.
                  Or, if he sought out the ideas of men, it was through the medium of books; there,
                  indeed, he had studied human nature, but alas! he learned its frailties by theory,
                  and refused the belief of its virtues, when he might have acquired it by
                  practice.
               It was a strange sight to see that man, in the splendour of his genius, in the
                  pride of his beauty, and in the very bloom of his youth, withdrawing himself from
                  that society he was born to adorn, depriving himself of its blessings, and
                  indulging in the dark dreams that belong but to disappointed old age, or confirmed
                  misanthropy. It was a strange sight—it was prostituting a holy shrine to an
                  infernal purpose.
               For a long time no temptation could induce that singular being to join in those
                  festivities that are the property of the young, nor could any allurement draw him
                  into the usages of fashionable life; civilities from all were politely
                  acknowledged, and as urbanely refused. All he wanted was their admiration; for
                  this he would have sacrificed even their good opinion, for this he would have
                  experienced their obloquy.
               But the day was yet to come when he was to learn how dependent he was upon others
                  for happiness. And it came at last; he acknowledged the error but would not repair
                  it. The stubborn pride that had so long dictated to feeling, though it yielded one
                  point, withheld all the rest, although the single concession refuted the doctrine
                  he had adopted, in defiance of reason and of right.
               It was the beauty of a woman that taught the dreamer the fallacy of his life, and
                  that woman was Anna Hamilton. He loved her beyond all that is told of love; he
                  loved her as one who had no other sympathy with his race to weaken the devotion,
                  but who concentrated all the gentler affections of his soul in that one cherished
                  passion.
               It was a wild, deep devotion, the love of that lonely man: it glowed with the
                  volcano's ardour, and was as irresistible, as masterless as the hurricane.
                  Conceived in the depth of a heart before barren to all such feelings, and nurtured
                  in the solitude of a gloomy but a grand imagination, it resembled the melancholy
                  flower that blooms in the inhospitable wastes of the cold but starry north.
               The partiality of Anna Hamilton for Sutherland filled him with rage. It was not
                  the first time that he had come between him and his hopes; and though it was by
                  the weak and uncertain light of a street lamp, that Montgomery had years before,
                  beheld the features of Sutherland, he had never forgotten them: an incident of an
                  exciting and singular nature had stamped them indelibly upon his memory. That
                  incident has already been given to the reader.
               Whenever they met, and their encounters were not unfrequent, a restraint was
                  visible in the manner of each to the other. Sutherland had often endeavoured to
                  shake it off, but the task was an impossibility. With Montgomery, however, the
                  effort was unmade; he sought not intimacy with those who had been reared with him
                  from boyhood; and his feelings towards his rival were too full of bitter
                  resentment, to permit a display of even the cold courtesy of formal intercourse.
                  They seemed by a tacit agreement studiously to avoid each other's company; yet,
                  when this could not possibly be effected, their communion betrayed none of the
                  feelings that actuated their aversion: they met as men whose variance was still
                  mingled with respect; who, if they hated each other on one hand, were mutually
                  feared on the other.
               Captain Sutherland could not but acknowledge the advantages of Montgomery. As
                  beautiful as man could be, and possessing that order of beauty that captivates at
                  a glance, that stern, dignified, yet
                  regular cast of feature that we fancy in our dreams of perfection to belong to the
                  superior beings of a brighter world; with a mind too, brilliant with genius of the
                  highest order, and a taste cultivated by all that was refined in literature,
                  master of all the accomplishments that adorn, and all the graces that embellish,
                  he could not indeed be regarded but as a powerful antagonist in the game of love.
                  His singular mode of life, his austere manner, his lonely inclinations, were all
                  calculated to dazzle the imagination of the softer sex; they sympathized with his
                  apparent unhappiness; they acknowledged and admired his eccentricities; they
                  lingered in raptures over his verses, and many sighed in secret for his love.
               No wonder, then, that Sutherland regarded him with jealousy; no wonder that he at
                  times even thought that competition with such a one would be time wasted, and
                  affection thrown away.
               But such were not the impressions of Anna Hamilton. She became convinced of
                  Montgomery's attachment with the most profound regret; she esteemed him, she
                  admired him, but she could not love him; she would be his sister, but she could
                  not be his wife. She worshipped him for the superiority of his intellect; but it
                  was with those true and disinterested feelings that spring up in our bosoms when
                  we gaze on some beautiful object of an order of nature that admits of no sympathy
                  with our own—some substance whose loveliness appeals to the eye, but never reaches
                  the heart.
               And there was not, perhaps, another woman in the capital city, that would have
                  refused alliance with John Montgomery; not another one, but she whom he alone
                  adored. Nor was it her indifference that piqued him into love; nor was it his love
                  that gave birth to her indifference. The feelings of each were prompted by the
                  innate impulses of the heart; neither wounded pride nor vanity influenced their
                  formation, or combined a part of their composition. Anna Hamilton was too noble to
                  be the plaything of inane caprice, or selfishness; and Montgomery too proud to be
                  governed by any motive that might direct the actions of his fellow men.
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               ANOTHER month rolled away, and its progress was almost unobserved by Sutherland;
                  for when love gilds our moments, pleasure lends them her pinions. He was happy; no
                  longer the trembling suitor of her he adored, for her smiles had chased away the
                  shades of doubt as the warm sunbeam dispels the mist of the mountain; no longer
                  the jealous lover, for her blushing, half-whispered confession had proved to him
                  how ardently she reciprocated his affection. Experience, too, had shown the
                  fallacy of impressions that once filled him with pain: he a little month before
                  thought her a cold-hearted, unfeeling woman; she to be set down as such, she, the
                  very child of sensation, the very slave of feeling, O! how he wronged her, O how
                  unable he was to appreciate the soft emotions that crowded in that snowy bosom! He
                  could not penetrate the veil that the customs of the world threw over the heart;
                  he did not or would not remember that to yield to every impulse was to sin against
                  the dictates of society. He forgot that the ice on the loftiest peak that ever
                  aspired to heaven, concealed but killed not the verdure that still bloomed
                  beneath.
               Nor was it the surpassing beauty of Anna Hamilton that alone captivated him,
                  although such loveliness might well obscure all imperfections, as the dazzling
                  brilliancy of the noonday sun conceals the blemishes upon its surface. It was not
                  that enchantment, for he had gazed coldly upon the most fascinating women of a
                  land where all are beautiful, and where love is the very essence of being. But it
                  was her gentleness, her kindness, her generosity, her rectitude; she never uttered
                  a sentiment that was ignoble, nor conceived an idea that was incorrect; her mind
                  was the fount of chastity, from whence her thoughts flowed pure as the rill of the
                  valley. And to be loved by such a one—O, it was a bliss that the sweetest vision
                  of his dreamy youth had never, never anticipated.
               Yes, she loved him—she, the brightest star in the constellation of beauty; she,
                  the connecting link between humanity and divinity; she, whose smile was a
                  blessing, whose affection a consecration, and with a passion, too, as pure as the
                  ray that sparkles from the fresh-fallen dew-drop; and he was proud of that love,
                  and looked out upon the world, and exultingly thought that amongst the myriads and
                  myriads that peopled it, no one of all was happier than he.
               There was a gay assemblage at Mrs. St. Clair's; it was one of her anniversary balls, but whether of her birth
                  or her marriage, I have forgotten. The parlours were crowded to excess, for her
                  circle of acquaintance was extensive, and she was one who feared not to infringe
                  those rules of exclusion so rigidly adhered to by many whose claims to
                  aristocratic distinctions were far less powerful. Her personal beauty, varied
                  accomplishments, and immense wealth entitled her to more than ordinary
                  consideration in the ranks of society, even if these advantages were not aided by
                  a mind so refined, and a manner so captivating. But, combining as she did both wit
                  and loveliness, none could dispute her right to select about her whomsoever she
                  pleased.
               "A mob, by all that is immaculate!" exclaimed Fitzbooby, gazing with an
                  astonishment he intended for observation; "Eh! Minton?"
               The second elegant looked about for a moment, but made no reply; he wasted but few
                  words upon Fitz, whom he considered a most unmigitated ass, but whose society he
                  tolerated for two reasons—Fitzbooby was rich, and Fitzbooby thought Minton the
                  most elegant fellow that he had ever seen.
               "Now if there is any one situation that displeases me more than another, it is
                  being coerced into an assemblage of this kind. A gentleman may be dancing in the
                  same set with his own tailor or shoemaker.—How d'ye do, Stanhope, quite a hundred
                  years since we have seen each other—been well?"
               "Bad cold, not very; who is that sylph-like creature dancing vis-a-vis with
                  Sawmynoshoff."
               "That? oh that's Miss Hamilton."
               "Miss Hamilton! d—n it, so it is; didn't recognize her at first; charming wench
                  that Miss Hamilton—resembles a cousin of mine very much—Lady Mary Howard, lovely
                  woman, eight of the most illustrious young nobleman of Great Britain died broken
                  hearted on her account—so extremely beautiful that her father insisted on her
                  using a close-carriage in order to prevent everybody from falling in love with
                  her."
               "Gad! how I should have liked to see her! is she still unmarried?"
               "No; Duchess of Tremaine now—gave her away myself; splendid affair that wedding,
                  nutmegs expended on the occasion, came to exactly one thousand pounds
                  sterling."
               "How much I regret that our acquaintance had never commenced earlier!" These words
                  were addressed to Captain Sutherland. "It is strange, but yet true, that the
                  consciousness of having passed a pleasure by unenjoyed, fills us with pain, even
                  though we should look back to it after the lapse of years."
               The speaker was a young widow of exceeding beauty, and one whose diplomacies in
                  the Court of Love had attached to her person son more admirers than sighed at the
                  feet of any other woman in Washington. The few years that had rolled by since her
                  debut upon the theatre of Fashion had beheld her the conqueror in a hundred
                  conflicts of the heart. She was indeed an accomplished coquette, the master
                  passion of whose soul was the desire to render all subject to her away; and her
                  blandishments too well seconded her imperious wishes; many a crushed hope, and
                  many a blighted affection marked the path she trod; for she had abused the
                  loveliness that was given to bless, and had rendered those charms a curse, those
                  charms that seemed to all the very attributes of superhuman perfection.
               Like all women of surpassing beauty she had married young, and like most of them
                  unhappily. Her vanity, not her affection, was consulted in the choice; and one was
                  selected whose riches alone gave him recommendation. This union, as might be
                  expected, was productive of mutual discontent. The lady grew regardless of her
                  husband; he beheld it—O! what change, however slight, cannot jealousy perceive!—he
                  reproached her with her mercenary motives; she grew angry, wept, fainted,
                  threatened to desert him, but amended not in one particular; and he, at length,
                  when he found remonstrance useless, and when he awoke to the damning truth, that
                  he was despised by her whom he adored, fell sick, lingered, and died of unrequited
                  affection.
               Mistress of a large fortune, still beautiful, and still young, she again became
                  the idol of the other sex. But, though she smiled on all, encouraged their
                  advances, and returned their protestations, she withheld her hand, and still
                  maintained her influence.
               And she was one every way calculated to lead captive the senses of her admirers.
                  She had, it is true, lost the primeval freshness of early youth, but silks and
                  jewels were substituted to cheat the eye; and I question if the bloom and
                  simplicity of girlhood was half so intoxicating to the imagination, as the artful
                  mien and dazzling costume of that proud and experienced woman.
               She had not met with Captain Sutherland before this evening, and had resolved,
                  even before seeing him, to add him to her train. She had more than one motive for
                  this resolve: she was jealous of the attention lavished upon Anna Hamilton; they
                  were rivals, and Mrs. Trevor was too covetous of homage to share it with one even
                  so beautiful as her younger and fairer companion. "Oh, if I could but obtain a
                  transfer of his affection, what a triumph it would be! I will attempt it," thought
                  she; "yes, and succeed, cost what it may;" and she, in accordance with this
                  determination, proceeded to undermine and annihilate the holiest attachment that
                  ever sprung from the heart of man.
               
               Sutherland bowed low on receiving her flattering speech, and replied to her
                  philosophical speculation, by observing that it was the nature of man to mourn for
                  every pleasure he did not, or could not enjoy; and that happiness could only exist
                  where we are ignorant of those joys we are forbidden.
               "Think you, Captain Sutherland, that true happiness has ever yet existed in the
                  breast of a single representative of the human family?"
               "Why, to be candid, Mrs. Trevor, I do not think it has. Real happiness is a
                  nonenity; for the most contented have still some hope ungratified, some fear
                  unallayed; but I believe that there are a few who are more satisfied with
                  existence than the many, and who bear the ills of life with more cheerfulness, and
                  its evils with greater resignation."
               "True, I grant you," returned the lady; "but yet I think I can point out one in
                  this assembly who is, or rather who should be truly happy."
               "Mrs. Trevor speaks of herself."
               "Oh, no, sir; accuse me of anything but egotism—I allude to Miss Hamilton."
               "Miss Hamilton!" resumed Sutherland, somewhat seriously; "she, indeed, deserves
                  all the blessings of life. If beauty, virtue, and innocence prove any security
                  against misfortune, she is, and will be always contented; qualities like these
                  could rear a paradise in a desert."
               "You speak feelingly, Captain Sutherland, and yet with becoming gallantry."
               "It is a subject, madam, that should not be treated with levity, and as to the
                  gallantry of my speech, I have only to add, that I should be extremely sorry if
                  the virtues of my countrywomen were only told by the tinsel tongue of
                  flattery."
               "Thank you—thank you a thousand times!" ejaculated Mrs. Trevor, in that soft
                  thrilling half-whisper, that she never assumed without effect, and bestowing at
                  the same time a glance upon Sutherland, that intoxicated almost to love. "O, my
                  friend, I owe you much for that kind, that generous sentiment!"
               And Sutherland took her small white hand, and there was a slight pressure, and
                  their eyes again met, and Anna Hamilton was for a moment forgotten. Then followed
                  a conversation pursued in low and measured tones; the gentleman's manner was
                  apparently suasive and sincere, he seemed to unheed every one in the interest he
                  betrayed in his companion, while she at times averted her head, then again turned
                  her large eyes beaming with tenderness upon him, then spoke for moment with
                  unwanted animation, then hesitated, blushed, sighed, smiled, and resumed again.
                  The siren had triumphed; and when at last they parted, it was resolved that
                  Sutherland should see her early on the following lowing day. But there was a
                  spectator who felt as much interest in that scene, as those more immediately
                  engaged in it. A fair young creature, exhausted with the exertion of dancing, had
                  undesignedly seated herself within a few feet, and upon the sofa opposite to that
                  occupied by Mrs. Trevor. She raised her eyes, she gazed a moment in something like
                  wonder, and then her countenance became as pale as the lily; she faltered a few
                  words to the gentleman who attended her, and left the saloon for the remainder of
                  the evening.
               Oh, if there is one pang more poignant than another, it is that which jealousy
                  inflicts on the heart that beats with love! We can submit to the reverses of
                  fortune; we can be patient under disappointment; we can bear the world's
                  persecution; we can listen to the voice of censure; we can behold the desertion of
                  friends in whom we have long confided; we can buffet all these evils with
                  something like indifference; but we cannot but weep, when the dearest object of
                  affection turns traitor to our hopes.
               When Sutherland quitted Mrs. Trevor, his eyes roamed in search of Anna, but she
                  was not to be seen. He passed into another and another apartment, but she was
                  nowhere visible; and a feeling of loneliness came over him, that not even the
                  bright eyes of the beautiful widow could have dispelled.
               There was something of reproach, too, in his thoughts, as he remembered that he
                  had that night suffered his heart to disclaim the fond allegiance it had so
                  ardently professed before. But it was the first inconstancy of love; and his
                  affections again flowed back to their wonted course, as the rivulet, whose waters
                  have been dashed up the shore by the force of some counter current, returns with
                  redoubled force to its proper channel.
               "The dove has flown, Captain Sutherland," said Mrs. St. Clair, who guessed, from
                  his abstracted manner, the sensations of his mind. "Nor will she return with the
                  branch of olive."
               "And why not?" asked he, with a smile.
               "Ask your heart, traitor, if it has not beat for another within the last
                  hour."
               "Nay, but, Mrs. St. Clair, the needle sometimes strays from the star it worships,
                  and yet is not distrusted."
               "True, sir, but in love we make no allowance for variation."
               "Then I must infer that Anna is no stranger to my—what shall I name it?"
               "Faithlessness, or something worse—folly, if you like it better."
               "Well, then, call it folly."
               "Captain Sutherland, love may be blind, but jealousy is Argus-eyed."
               "But I may be yet forgiven; one error cannot surely exclude me from all
                  favour."
               
               "She may excuse your inconstancy; but how can I ever pardon your bad taste? Oh!
                  sir, to desert, even for one moment, such a one for such another one! fie upon
                  you! I thought you an adept."
               The lady passed on, and Sutherland sighed, as a comparison between Mrs. Trevor and
                  Anna Hamilton was thus forced upon his mind. The reader can well imagine in whose
                  favour it resulted.
               At an early hour he sought his lodgings; for the events of the evening, trifling
                  and unimportant as they seemed to be, were of a nature too dispiriting to permit
                  him to enjoy the gayety that reigned around.
               On the following day he called, but found Miss Hamilton not at home. "Strange!"
                  muttered he, and in a spirit of pique, he turned his horse's head towards the
                  dwelling-place of Mrs. Trevor.
               Seated on the sofa, in the voluptuous light that streamed through the damask
                  curtains from the half-closed windows, sat the lady of the mansion. Never before
                  looked she so enchanting; she had studied to captivate, and her smile, her
                  posture, her array, her voice, were so many irresistible subservients to her
                  wishes.
               "Oh! I am so happy," said she, taking the hand of her visiter, "so happy that you
                  have not disappointed me! I was indeed afraid that you would have forgotten to
                  come."
               "Then would I have foolishly denied myself a world of pleasure. But, truly, the
                  society of Mrs. Trevor must be too eagerly courted, for her to doubt an instant
                  that any who might enjoy it would let the golden opportunity slip unseized."
               "Nay, but you know, Captain Sutherland, that the strongest fears surround our
                  brightest hopes. But sit you down; I have much to say to you, and old Time, when I
                  feel gratified, filches from me half my true allotment of moments."
               And then the lady assumed that confidential and affectionate manner, that, in a
                  pretty woman, never fails to enslave. Her voice grew low, soft, and thrilling; her
                  smile sweet and dazzling; her eyes sparkled with love; and her sigh seemed but the
                  breathing of happiness. That visit was protracted far beyond the time sanctioned
                  by custom; and when Sutherland took his leave, his ideas were all bewildered, his
                  senses intoxicated, and his mind infatuated, by the blandishments of that too
                  lovely Circe. One thought, one unbidden thought of another, crossed him as he left
                  the threshold, and a pang of reproach he had never known before darted through his
                  bosom. He leapt into his vehicle, and drove on as if he would fain leave
                  conscience and all behind. With a flushed brow he alighted, threw the reins to his
                  servant, and ascended to his own apartment. Here he paced to and fro, giving vent
                  to his feverish thoughts in detached and sententious exclamations. "Great God!"
                  muttered he, "what has possessed me? Have I indeed deserted that fair, virtuous
                  innocent for another? Has my heart turned traitor to my happiness? Am I the man I
                  was, and will I still persist in this faithlessness? No, no! I will tell Anna
                  to-morrow—to-night—I will throw myself at her feet, and confess that I have been
                  dazzled for a moment by the charms of another, but that the illusion is over—that
                  it has vanished—that I adore her even more than over."
               The night came, and he proceeded to put his design in execution. Anna was at home,
                  but the halls were filled with visiters, and he could not obtain the opportunity.
                  She was paler than usual, but no other change was observable. "She is not aware of
                  what has transpired," thought he, "and why should I make it known to her? Such a
                  measure might give her much pain, and be in the end unprofitable to myself. It
                  would be highly indiscreet. I'll not do it." And he returned home with a firm
                  resolve to tear the image of Mrs. Trevor from the place it had usurped in his
                  bosom. "She is not so beautiful as Anna," muttered he, "nor as amiable, nor as
                  unsophisticated, and yet she is more fascinating. And can this be? Have my senses
                  wandered into infatuation, or is she really as enchanting to all, as to me? It
                  must be so. The love I bore Anna, even when away, fortified me against the
                  blandishments of all other women. And here, even here, almost in her very
                  presence, the greater part of that affection is shared with another. This must
                  cease. Honour, reputation, everything, demands it. I will see her but once more,
                  and then we shall be strangers for ever."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IX.
               MISS HAMILTON was alone in her chamber when the servant informed her that
                  Montgomery was in waiting below. The intimation was received with a blush; but
                  subduing at the instant everything like excitement, she descended to receive
                  him.
               "After what has transpired between us," said he, when the compliments of meeting
                  had been interchanged, "this visit cannot, on my part, be but unwelcome. I should
                  have spared it you, and would have done so, but that I am the most abject slave of
                  a passion that I yet believe utterly hopeless."
               "Nay, Mr. Montgomery, you do me infinite injustice in supposing that your visits
                  are disagreeable. I shall always be very happy to see you; and when I tell you so,
                  it is not in the language of hollow courtesy—to my society you will be ever most
                  welcome."
               "Thank you, Miss Hamilton, thank you, a thousand times! I expected this from your
                  goodness—but oh! cannot, dare not, remain with you a day longer. In justice to
                  yourself, I must say, Miss Hamilton, that there has been nothing in our
                  intercourse that could have led me to presume that I was for a moment beloved by
                  you; this is the conclusion I have obtained after cool and dispassionate
                  reflection. We have known each other long and well; we have grown up in years
                  together, and we have been friends, and are, and will be always; and I mistook
                  that friendship for another feeling; but the delusion exists no longer; it is over
                  now, and the truth is painful upon me. To say that I love you—nay, Miss Hamilton,
                  hear me out; it is perhaps the last and only favour you can do me—to say that I
                  love you would be to attempt to convey by the feeble eloquence of words a passion
                  too intense for any one's imagination to conceive. I was perhaps infatuated; but
                  oh! it was a sweet delusion, and I hugged it to the last. Heavens! what rapturous
                  scenes I was wont to dream over! what fairy-like pictures of happiness! But alas!
                  they were all as the reflections upon the bubble!—they have vanished—vanished all,
                  and the little world upon which I had set my heart and soul has crumbled away for
                  ever! Nay, don't weep, Miss Hamilton. I did not intend to afflict you, or to
                  censure you. Oh! no, no! I exonerate you from every participation in my
                  unhappiness. It is my own wild, sweeping passion that has made me what I
                  am—feelings that I would not conquer when I could, nor cannot restrain when I
                  would. Oh! calm your grief—calm it, lady, for I would rather die than dim your eye
                  with a tear. But I have been cruel—too cruel! I will cease. I will go no further!
                  Farewell! live and be happy!" And with a heart breaking with anguish, he arose,
                  opened the door, took one last look, and left the apartment.
               Never before had Anna Hamilton reproached herself as being the cause of woe to
                  another; and though innocent as an angel in the present case, she could not bring
                  her conscience to her acquittal, but sat pale and miserable, weeping the while, as
                  if every tear sprung from the conviction of some deep sin upon her soul. But
                  virtue is ever too prone to attach blame to itself, while guilt seeks to criminate
                  every one beside. While labouring under this state of feeling, Sutherland called,
                  but she could not see him, nor did she excuse herself under the plea of
                  indisposition. She had never deceived any one by even that petty artifice, and she
                  thought that her lover knew her well enough to make her excuse in his bosom; but
                  he had seen Montgomery quit the house, and being ignorant of what had transpired,
                  attributed her retiracy to another than its true cause. It was enough; he was
                  jealous, and resolved at once to forget her in the society of Mrs. Trevor.
               Thither he hastened: she was alone, always alone to him: with a smile she met
                  him—it was a sweet smile; and yet there was a melancholy in it that he had not
                  seen there before. Alas! for the frailty of a woman's heart! she that had always
                  been the dictatress of passion, had become at last its slave. Yes, she, the proud,
                  the lovely, the courted Mrs. Trevor, adored the man whose affections she had at
                  first thought to tamper with; and he, warmed by the confidence, and enchanted by
                  the devotedness she openly displayed, was led, step by step, from the pure shrine
                  of his love's first offering.
               The hours fled, and he still tarried; theirs was a dream of joy, and the full moon
                  was high in the heavens when he at last tore himself from her presence. His brow
                  was hot, his pulse was quick and hard, and he strode the avenues of the city,
                  unconscious of the path he was taking. Still on he sped, his own fervid thoughts
                  rendering him insensible to everything else. Passion, in its wild sweep, had left
                  him reflection; and when he recurred to Anna Hamilton, his heart sank, as if hope
                  had deserted him for ever.
               "Stop, Captain Sutherland," exclaimed a human voice, and on looking up, he
                  confronted Montgomery. "Stop, sir," said he; and his tone was solemn, low, and
                  passionate. Without a reply, Sutherland stood still, and there was a silence of
                  some time, during which it was evident Montgomery was preparing his thoughts for
                  the words that were to follow.
               "Years ago," said he, "when I was yet a boy, chance gave me an opportunity of
                  gratifying the darling passion of my soul; and I had almost attained the pinnacle of success, when another passed me and
                  snatched the golden prize from before my very vision. To me at present such a
                  disappointment would be but little; our aims are changed with the increase of
                  time, and the brightest exploit of youth would often be deemed unworthy the
                  attention of manhood. Nevertheless, I have not for a moment ceased to brood over
                  that adventure, and though I do not cherish the same bitter feelings towards him
                  that was successful that I then did, I still must remember that it was a hope
                  blasted by his agency, an aspiration shattered by his rivalry. A long, long time
                  elapsed, and we did not meet again; our careers in the world were widely
                  dissimilar, and we might have lived our lifetimes out without being again brought
                  together; but my unlucky star prevailed; he returned, and returned to ingratiate
                  himself in the affections of the only woman I have ever loved. You are that man,
                  Captain Sutherland!"
               Often had our hero thought that he had met Montgomery, before his introduction to
                  him by Miss Hamilton; but he strove in vain to recollect when and where; the
                  countenance was familiar to him, but he could bring to mind no event that might
                  serve to place it in position; but now he at once remembered him as the youth who
                  had been his rival in attempting to rescue the child.
               "That I have opposed you in both the instances you cite," said Sutherland, "I do
                  not pretend to deny; but, Mr. Montgomery, you must certainly be convinced that
                  that opposition was the effect of chance, not of preconcerted resolve. You cannot
                  suppose me so studiously hostile to your welfare as to wish for a moment to
                  frustrate your intentions."
               "To your thoughts, Captain Sutherland, I am a stranger—ignorant alike of your
                  desires and your impulses; I but look at circumstances as they exist. Man is not
                  accountable to his fellow for his feelings, be they of any nature; it is alone his
                  actions that incur responsibility. You have injured me, sir, deeply injured me,
                  and must fight me!"
               "Fight you!" ejaculated Sutherland, in marked astonishment.
               "Ay, sir, fight me! here are weapons, and we have both place and opportunity.
                  Between men of honour, assistants may be dispensed with."
               "Are you mad, Montgomery?"
               "Captain Sutherland, it is useless to bandy words. I am neither mad nor drunk; you
                  have wronged me, and I demand the only satisfaction that you have in your power to
                  give. Do you understand me?"
               "Perfectly, sir; give me the pistol."
               "Choose."
               "Now name your distance."
               "That, sir, is your prerogative."
               "I know it; but in this instance I will forego its exercise."
               "What think you of ten paces?"
               "Be it ten paces."
               Montgomery wheeled and stepped off the distance.
               "Will you give the word, Captain Sutherland?"
               "Do you give it, sir."
               "Are you ready?"
               "Ready," responded our hero, placing himself in position.
               "Fire! One—two—three."
               The pistols went off simultaneously, and Montgomery fell.
               "You have triumphed," said the fallen man; "fate has declared against me."
               Sutherland stooped and examined the wound; it was not mortal; the ball had passed
                  through the hip without coming in contact with the bone. Tearing off his cravat,
                  he bound the limb tightly above the wound, and requesting the sufferer to remain
                  still for a few minutes, he flew to the city for further assistance. Having
                  procured it, he returned; but Montgomery was not to be found; some unknown hand
                  had borne him away: a carriage had passed them on the road, and Sutherland
                  concluded that the wounded man had been discovered by its inmates and taken to the
                  city.
               In a state of feverish excitement he returned to his lodgings. The events of the
                  evening were of so opposite and yet so agitating a nature that it was impossible
                  for him to recover anything like equanimity, although he several times attempted
                  to reason himself into calmness. Upon his table was a letter; hurriedly he broke
                  it open; it was from his father's physician, demanding his presence at home
                  immediately, as his only surviving parent was on the very verge of death. In an
                  instant his orders were given, and in less than a half hour he was driving
                  furiously towards Philadelphia.
               How much had happened during his sojourn in Washington; how much of interest, of
                  excitement, of importance to himself! He entered it a contented, if not a happy
                  man, and he quitted it almost miserable. And then he thought of his love for Anna
                  Hamilton—how pure, how devoted it once was; and he tried to convince himself that
                  it was still the same, that the charms of another had not weakened it. But it was
                  in vain; man may delude the feelings of the world, but how can he deceive his own
                  still-tongued monitor? That early sentiment of the heart, that high-wrought
                  adoration that he had once cherished towards her had ebbed away, and though he
                  still loved her, it was not with the wild, passionate, but holy feeling. "And I
                  have left her without a word at parting," murmured he, "she that was but a month
                  ago the very idol of my soul; she whose presence was then enough to clothe the
                  cold world in the garb of Paradise; she whose smile I once thought would have more than rewarded the
                  toils of Alexander after the conquest of the world! And I have quitted her thus;
                  oh! it is too bad! And why this change? is she less lovely than she was? is she
                  less amiable? less charitable? less pure? Oh no, no, no, she is the same; the very
                  same, and it is I who am in fault!" And he whipped his horses, urging them madly
                  on, as if he would have them keep pace with his own sweeping train of thought.
               When Captain Sutherland drove up the avenue leading to his paternal door, his
                  horses were covered with foam, and his person and vehicle bespattered with mire.
                  Leaping out, he inquired of his father's state, and was told that he had partially
                  recovered, and was then in a deep slumber. Instantly he repaired to the
                  sick-chamber; and there, seating himself beside the bed, he settled himself to
                  await the moment when his father should awake.
               At length the sleep of the invalid was broken. He opened his eyes, and discovered
                  his son leaning anxiously over him; and something like a smile played upon his
                  colourless lips, as he stretched forth his hand to greet him.
               "Are you better, father?"
               "Much better, Harry, much better. But sit you down, my son; I have many things to
                  say to you; many, many things; and I fear there is but little time left me."
               "Oh, father, I pray you, cherish not such presentiments! There are many, many
                  years before you yet; years of health, and happiness, I hope."
               The old man shook his head mournfully. "My son," said he, "if such is indeed your
                  belief, you deceive yourself most egregiously. I cannot live much longer; nor do I
                  wish a life which has been miserable, prolonged. Death, when he comes, shall bring
                  no terrors to me; I shall welcome him."
               "Father, do not speak thus—do not, I conjure you!"
               "Nay, Harry; why should I shut my eyes to the truth?—But this is idle; lock the
                  door; I have something to relate, and would not be interrupted—there, now resume
                  your seat." The son obeyed in silence; and after a pause the invalid resumed.
               "They tell me, you have engaged yourself in marriage with the daughter of
                  Hamilton; does report speak true, or is it but the unfounded rumour of idle
                  society? You yourself have never informed me of any such circumstance."
               The son blushed deeply. Nor was all the abashment he felt caused by the reproof of
                  his father; he was, at that moment, shamed from other recollections.
               "Father, you have been correctly informed. We are betrothed, and only await your
                  sanction to consummate the ceremony."
               "Harry!" said the old man; and he raised himself in the bed, and his lips grew yet
                  paler, and his eyes glowed with fierce excitement. "Harry—my son—my only son; much
                  as I love you—and God, who reads the hearts of all men, knows that I have never
                  loved human being half as intensely—much as I honour you, anxious as I am for your
                  happiness, yet would I rather see you struck down a livid corpse where you stand,
                  than behold you connected in marriage with that woman!" As he finished, he fell
                  back in the bed; that burst of passion was too great a task upon his energies. It
                  completely enfeebled him; and he lay for a moment as powerless as a sick
                  child.
               There was a silence—an awful silence; deep as the unbroken stillness upon the
                  solitude of waters; horrible as the dreadful peace that pervades the Egyptian
                  catacombs. So unexpectedly came that wild declaration; so unprepared was the son
                  for its reception; that the cold sweat started from his brow, and his strength
                  gave way, even as a battalion when attacked by some overwhelming force from some
                  unguarded quarter. It completely staggered him; mind, body and all; and it was
                  long before he was enabled to collect his scattered senses. Slowly they returned,
                  one by one; even as realities steal upon us, after some terrible dream.
               "In God's name, my father, tell me your reason! How could such an angel so
                  mortally offend? Speak further, I implore you!"
               "Be still, be still! You shall hear all—everything! I had hoped that the grave
                  would close over my sorrows. I never wished to entail my miseries upon you; but
                  circumstances demand that all should be told you. You ask me how the daughter of
                  Hamilton has offended; the blame is not with her, but with a relative;
                  nevertheless, you cannot take her to your bosom; you will not—you dare not. Did
                  you, the memory of my wrongs, of my sufferings, would blast your happiness for
                  ever. When at college, I became very much attached to a fellow student of about my
                  own age. He was affable, handsome, and witty. After graduating, we were thrown
                  together in society; he was poor; I was rich, and I befriended him. 'Twas he who
                  introduced me to your mother; I saw her, loved her, and at last addressed her. She
                  accepted me, but her parents refused their consent; they wished her to wed
                  another. After much entreaty, she agreed to elope with me; everything was arranged
                  by him, and we were married. For more than one year, during which time this man
                  had been a constant visiter at my house, we lived together in harmony and
                  happiness. Your mother was gay, fond of society, and was what may be called a
                  fashionable woman; but she was young, very young, and these propensities are the
                  foibles of youth; I never reproved them. After marriage, I shrunk from the
                  dissipations of society. I found greater pleasure sure in communion with my books, than in its
                  heartless display; this friend, then, was her companion, at all balls, routs, and
                  operas. After a time, business demanded my presence in the south. Thither I went;
                  and when I returned, expecting to clasp my wife to my bosom—but why linger over my
                  disgrace—when I returned, I found she had gone off—eloped with my black-hearted
                  friend, the brother of Senator Hamilton; the uncle of the woman you would have
                  made your wife!"
               "God of heaven, support me!" exclaimed the son; and his voice was the speech of
                  anguish. "Oh father, father! is this true; or is it some horrible stratagem you
                  have invented to prevent a marriage that will not meet your approval? Oh tell me,
                  tell me, it is not true! Tell me that you have jested with me!"
               The sick man shook his head mournfully. "Think you, my son," said he—and his voice
                  was weaker than it yet had been—"think you, that standing as I do upon the very
                  brink of eternity, my lips at such a moment would be stained with a lie?"
               "Then it is true, all true?"
               "Yes, my boy; true as the words spoken by that Being you have just invoked."
               "Then heaven pity me!" exclaimed Harry Sutherland; and his honours, and his fame,
                  and his pride, were lost to him for ever. He saw them break, separate, and vanish,
                  like clouds below the horizon.
               "And does the fiend still live?" whispered he.
               "He does, but under a feigned name. In a drunken brawl, he added the crime of
                  murder to the black catalogue of his misdeeds; and was obliged to fly his country
                  to escape the vengeance of her laws."
               "His name, father?"
               "Hamilton."
               "That which he has adopted?"
               "Manly."
               The horrid truth at once flashed upon the mind of the son; twenty circumstances
                  rushed to his memory to attest the correctness of his suspicions. More than once
                  had he thought that some intimate connexion subsisted between the senator and the
                  privateersman; but, as there was an evident aim at secrecy in the relationship, he
                  had always in delicacy foreborne to penetrate the mystery. But now all was plain;
                  the letter given him by Manly, the perturbation with which it was first received
                  by the father of Anna, and his subsequent satisfaction when he discovered that
                  Sutherland was not aware of the real name of the captain; the wish expressed by
                  the latter that the senator should remain in ignorance of his presence in the
                  United States, and the studied silence maintained by the senator in regard to
                  Manly himself, served to corroborate the testimony of the invalid, and convince
                  him beyond all doubt, that they were brothers in blood, if not in principles and
                  practice.
               "For long years," resumed the sick man, "for long, long years I have concealed
                  from every one the bitter cause of my despondency. After that event, the
                  death-blow to my hopes and happiness, I removed hither, and here have I dwelt, an
                  alien from my species, and an exile from the sunny spot that gave me birth; but my
                  pilgrimage is nearly ended, and I shall soon enjoy, in another world, that peace
                  that I have vainly looked for in this. Harry, my son, give me your hand. If, my
                  boy, I have ever treated you with undue harshness, you will forgive me."
               "Father, father, I have nothing to forgive. You have been ever kind; and 'tis I
                  who should ask pardon for a thousand offences of my wayward youth."
               "God bless you, Harry—God bless you, my son. And now I have but one favour to ask;
                  bring me hither the portrait of your mother; you will find the key of her chamber
                  in my escrutoire; quick, quick, Harry, quick; boy, I'm dying!"
               The son left the room, and in a moment returned with the likeness, which he placed
                  at the foot of the bed; the sick man made an impatient gesture with his hand, and
                  he withdrew the curtain which had always screened it. Long and steadfastly did
                  both father and son gaze upon that picture; and when, after the silence had been
                  painfully prolonged, the latter turned, he was struck with the vacant expression
                  and the unearthly colour of the invalid's countenance. He drew nearer, he bent
                  over him, he whispered "Father!" no answer was returned; he took his hand, it was
                  colder than marble; he kissed his pale forehead, but the death sweat was on it.
                  His career on earth was done for ever, and the spirit that lingered there for
                  years had winged its way to God in Heaven.
               The son spoke not, moved not, wept not; the rude shock that broke his heart
                  swallowed up the fountain of tears; and he stood gazing upon the features of the
                  dead man with the horrid calmness of unutterable despair. Years of multiplied
                  bliss could not have repaid that moment of misery. He saw his sire and his honour
                  swept away by one rude current, and he felt as desolate as though he stood alone
                  upon a world a thousand times more extended than this. At length that revery was
                  ended; he awoke from it, but awoke an altered man. It was long before he again
                  drank the sweet draught of happiness.
               About a week after the interment of his father, Harry Sutherland was sitting alone
                  in his chamber; but how different in appearance from what he had been but a short
                  time before! His cheeks were pale and haggard, his eye sunken, his brow
                     contracted tracted, and his dress
                  disordered. He looked out upon the scene, but his gaze was wild, stern, and
                  unmeaning; it conveyed nothing to the imagination, for thought, intense thought,
                  had absorbed every other faculty.
               "And I have lived," said he, in monologue, "up to the age of manhood, to find
                  myself degraded in the end; yes, even when I was treading in the paths of virtue,
                  and obeying the directions of honour, the foul stigma was upon me, but I knew it
                  not, and I was happy. At first all was prosperous; my little bark set sail, the
                  winds were fair, the skies were clear, hope took the helm, and fortune rewarded
                  the venture. But a storm has arisen; the tempest is fierce in its wrath, and she
                  drives before it now, a helpless wreck."
               When he again resumed—and it was not until minutes after—his thoughts flowed in
                  another channel, his eye was milder, his brow gave up its frown, and his whole
                  countenance was expressive of sadness.
               "Anna, Anna!" exclaimed he, "will you not consider me a perjured wretch; one who
                  has basely won your young affections, and then most dishonourably deserted them
                  and you? Yes, you will, you must, and it is mine to suffer under that imputation.
                  I dare not attempt to explain all. I cannot point out the impassable gulf that
                  rolls between us. I would rather be criminal in her opinion than she should be
                  aware of my hereditary disgrace. O! Merciful God, is there no solace for a soul so
                  injured as mine—must I hence live without the hope of happiness—must I drag out a
                  cheerless existence, while my fellow men are revelling in enjoyments—must I be the
                  proscribed of contentment, while perhaps some successful villain basks in her
                  sunshine?" He paused; a new and terrible thought possessed him; he rose from his
                  seat, he paced the apartment; reflection confirmed him in it; and with a firm hand
                  he unlocked a drawer and drew forth a pistol. With a steady hand he charged it,
                  primed it, cocked it; a knock was at the door, he returned the instrument, and
                  closed the drawer.
               "Come in," said he; and a servant entered with a packet. It was a communication
                  from the Secretary of the Navy, requiring him to take immediate command of the
                  sloop-of-war Sparrow Hawk, as the commander who had been appointed to her was
                  dangerously ill, and it was necessary that she should proceed immediately upon her
                  destination. In an instant his mind was made up. Other motives than the desire of
                  serving his country urged him to accept the appointment: he wanted excitement, he
                  wanted occupation; and he fondly hoped, too, that he might sometimes forget the
                  darker passages of his life, even though that oblivion should be found in the
                  terrors of the tempest, or the ardour of the battle.
               His arrangements were soon effected; to an agent of tried integrity he left the
                  management of his estate, and bidding adieu to the solitary halls of his paternal
                  abode, he quitted them for the ruder home of his adoption. In a very few days
                  after, he was welcomed on board the Sparrow Hawk; and, as all things were in
                  readiness for sea, the ship was got under weigh, and had progressed so far on her
                  course by sunset, that the Highlands of Neversink were no longer seen along the
                  horizon.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER X.
               THE reader must now follow us along the shores of the New World, as far as the
                  twenty-third degree of south latitude. In or about that parallel, a beautiful ship
                  was resting almost motionless upon the water; the sea breeze that had prevailed
                  during the day was dying away as the sun descended, and although she was under a
                  press of canvass, scarcely a ripple was perceptible about her bows. The scene that
                  presented itself from her decks was enchanting. In one quarter the blue ocean
                  stretched as far as the eye could wander, beautifully unruffled; and in the other,
                  the mountains of Brazil, crimsoned by the sunset glow of expiring day, reared
                  themselves up as lovely as though they were the battlements of Heaven; high over
                  their glittering summits, the dim crescent floated through the ambient air; and at
                  their base a single sail dotted the surface of a sea that fancy might believe was
                  melted by the tropic heat from the golden mines of that opulent region. Upon the
                  after part of the quarter-deck stood a solitary individual, gazing out
                  abstractedly upon the scene. He was apparently lost in thought, and his clouded
                  brow and dejected mien but too well told that his meditation was of a deep and
                  painful nature. On the opposite side of the deck, the officer of the watch leaned
                  in a musing attitude against the bulwarks; and forward of the mainmast the ship's
                  company were seen, some pacing to and fro, and some reclining upon the guns, or
                  about the boom covers, but all engaged in low and earnest conversation with one
                  another. From the frequent glances cast by them upon the tall upright form of the
                  person who occupied the starboard side of the quarter-deck, it was evident that he
                  was the subject of their discourse; and from their unusual solemnity of demeanour,
                  one might properly suppose that something was about to transpire of a serious and
                  inordinate nature; there was a gloom upon every countenance, and the gay jest and
                  merry laugh were all unheard; not a smile was seen upon the lips of any, and the
                  bustle that almost always prevails upon a ship's deck was hushed in respectful and
                  imposing stillness.
               "Frederick," said Captain Manly, for it was that visionary man, and the vessel was
                  the renowned Sea-King. "I will leave you here; the wind has all died away, and you
                  will not get the land breeze until morning. The mouth of the harbour is not more
                  than seven miles distant, and we can pull thither in less than two hours. You may
                  send the men aft, sir." The officer of the deck touched his hat respectfully; the
                  orders necessary were given, and in a few moments the crew had all assembled about
                  the mizen mast. While they were collecting themselves, the commander continued
                  walking the quarter-deck, as if to calm an agitation he could scarcely suppress;
                  and even after they had all assembled, he paced to and fro in evident and painful
                  excitement. At length he stopped; his brow was contracted, but it was with that
                  frown that men put on to check the tear that is ready to start to the eye, that
                  unnatural sternness that aids us to keep down the weaknesses of the heart. "My
                  lads!" said he, "my gallant lads! I have called you together for the purpose of
                  bidding you farewell; never, in the whole course of my life, and it has been one
                  fraught with sorrowful events, has a sadder duty devolved upon me. Had our country
                  persisted in the struggle she so ably maintained, this separation should not yet
                  have taken place, but even then, a time would come when we should part: death
                  perhaps would have torn me from you, but would have at least spared me the pangs I
                  new experience. We have been long together, we have been companions in the triumph
                  of victory, and we have stood by one another in the hour of peril. I trusted you
                  in trials of danger, and you nobly repaid my confidence; and when defeat
                  frustrated my schemes, you made not a murmur, but cheerfully went about repairing
                  the errors I had fallen into. Such devotedness may be conceived in the wild
                  dreamings of the enthusiast, but is seldom found in the mutual relations of
                  mankind. I am grateful to you for it; cold indeed must be the heart that would not
                  acknowledge such virtue with gratitude. Would to Heaven that circumstances would
                  permit me to return with you to our happy country! but no, this cannot be, 'twere
                  bootless to tell you why; here I must leave you, and leave you for ever. The
                  exile, when he quits his native shore, yet looks forward to the day when he shall
                  again behold it, but in quitting you I have no such hope to cheer me; in a few
                  short months you will be scattered through the four quarters of the globe, and
                  though destiny may bring some two or three of us together, she never will restore
                  the gallant phalanx again." The speaker turned away; his emotion was almost
                  masterless; and he abruptly finished a discourse he fain would have prolonged, as
                  he had left many thoughts he wished to communicate, unexpressed.
               Then, for a full half-hour he paced the deck, in earnest conversation with the
                  officer of the watch; to him he delegated his authority, instructing him to return
                  to New York, distribute the prize-money equally amongst the crew, and make what
                  disposition he pleased of the ship. When his latest wish had been made known to
                  his successor, a boat was lowered and manned by eight stout rowers; his trunks
                  were then conveyed into it, after which he himself descended and seated himself in
                  the stern sheets. The coxswain gave the order to shove off, and in the next moment the bows of the cutter were
                  rippling the surface of the sleeping ocean.
               When nearly a half-mile distant, the rowers suddenly ceased their labour, and the
                  exile stood up to take a last look at his gallant vessel. Long and steadfastly he
                  gazed; but sighing at length, he reseated himself, and the cutter again commenced
                  moving through the water. Two hours afterwards she swept past the Castle of Santa
                  Cruz, into the harbour of Rio Janeiro, and at early daylight she was once more
                  alongside of the Sea-King.
               Whatever motive induced that singular man to select that particular country as an
                  asylum was known to none other than himself. Perhaps he thought that the example
                  of the United States of North America would soon be followed by the colonies of
                  the south, and that he might again distinguish himself in the cause of liberty; it
                  may be, that he even then perceived the seeds of that revolution that has since
                  agitated every section of Southern America, and only awaited the hour of its
                  outbreak to take up arms in its support; but whether it was a hatred of
                  oppression, or the love of freedom, or a craving for excitement, that impelled him
                  to so wild and errant a life, is alike a mystery. After he quitted the privateer,
                  but little was ever heard of him by his own comrades; and the only event of
                  importance in any way connected with his name, was the fact, that his ship, after
                  the war was at an end, became a lawless plunderer upon the deep; the wild spirits
                  that he had tutored in a thousand desperate conflicts, could not reconcile
                  themselves to a life of quietude, and they determined, one and all, to hoist the
                  red flag, and oppose every other, but that of their own country. Outlaws as they
                  were, they could not turn their arms against the banner that had floated over them
                  in a hundred victories, even were it not the emblem of their home; and true to
                  this resolve, protection was extended to the ships of the United States, by men
                  who were the very terror of the tropic seas.
            
            
               CHAPTER XI.
               IN one of the most delightful provinces of Mexico, there winds a valley of
                  surpassing beauty, from the shores of the Atlantic on one side, to those of the
                  Pacific on the other; from its most northern boundary to Yucatan there is no spot
                  of earth more lovely, although a hundred thousand scenes of enchantment diversify
                  that romantic region. He who has stood upon the elevation that is the present site
                  of Tampico de Tamaulipas, may travel far and gaze upon no fairer scene. It is even
                  before me now; memory, ever faithful to beauty, waves her fairy wand, and the
                  picture springs forth, as imposingly as when it first burst upon my enraptured
                  vision. But a short twelve months since, I clambered to the summit of that hill;
                  beneath me rolled the placid Tamigua, before me rose the majestic peaks that stand
                  like outposts of the mighty Cordilleras, the first glittering like a stream of
                  liquid silver, the latter deepening in the darkness of azure, or brightening with
                  all the most beautiful colouring of the iris. The day was nearly ended, and its
                  light, growing richer and richer as it expired, imparted a feature to the scene
                  that brought to mind the fanciful paradise of the Mahometan infidel; for the
                  foliage and fruits of the trees seemed to bud, bloom, and blossom in gold.
               Those who compose works of fiction too often clothe their localities with the hues
                  of their imagination; fancy supplies the place of truth, and a scene is portrayed
                  that rather describes the dream of the enthusiast, than the reality of nature.
                  They think that such deceptions are essential to the interest of their narrations,
                  and they ransack the storehouse of the mind, to plunder and misapply its beauties.
                  Of this transgression I am guiltless; and should any who shall peruse these pages
                  ever wander through the vales of Mexico, when he looks upon this gorgeous scene,
                  he cannot but bear witness to its pre-eminent loveliness.
               A solitary individual looked from that eminence upon the scene below; and within a
                  few feet of him his charger pawed the ground, and champed the bit, as if chiding
                  his master for his unnecessary delay.
               The stranger was richly dressed; but apart from this, there was that in his mien
                  that bespoke him one of the higher order of mankind. His brow was gloomy, but the
                  cloud that rested upon it could not conceal the light of genius that flashed from
                  his large dark eye. He was handsome, too, and his features were as soft and as effeminate as those of a woman,
                  although, with a view perhaps to alter their expression, he wore the moustache,
                  and let his hair grow to an inordinate length. No costume could be better suited
                  to display his perfect shape, than that which he appeared in. A round jacket of
                  bright blue cloth trimmed with silver, and turned up with scarlet, formed his
                  nether garment; a black kerchief was knotted about his neck, and his shirt collar
                  was open at the throat; his breeches were of embroidered velveteen, and around his
                  legs, as high as the knee, he wore deer-skin wrappers gartered with silken cord;
                  beneath these leggings, an immense pair of silver spurs with steel rowels jutted
                  out; around his waist was wound a scarlet sash, and his head was protected by a
                  broad-brimmed hat, banded with silver cord, and fastened at each end with a clasp,
                  on which was worn the glittering device of Mexico. The caparison of his steed was
                  even more gorgeous than his own attire. The bit was of solid silver; the stirrups
                  were shaped like coronets inverted, and were composed of the same precious metal;
                  the saddle reposed upon a square of blue cloth, embroidered with gold; and the
                  bridle, the girth, the martingale, and, in short, all the trappings were mounted
                  and ornamented with plates of the purest silver; at the crupper of the saddle, was
                  confined the long lasso, and from its pommel depended a pair of holsters.
               Still he looked out upon that fair scene; but as he gazed, his eye settled on
                  vacancy, and his countenance underwent a complete change of expression. Thought,
                  the Pilgrim, wandered to distant shores, and the reminiscences of other days came
                  sadly upon him. At length a tear trickled down his cheek; it awoke him, he dashed
                  it sternly away, and vaulting in his saddle, gallopped wildly down the
                  declivity.
               Five minutes ride, and he reined up in front of his dwelling. It was a low square
                  building, with a small court in the centre, and surrounded on all sides by orange
                  trees; throwing the reins upon the neck of his steed, he dismounted, and entering
                  the house, suffered the well-trained animal to proceed unattended to the
                  stable.
               The stranger was John Montgomery. After his encounter with Sutherland, he was
                  borne from the field by an acquaintance whom chance directed that way, and in the
                  course of a few weeks his wound was healed, and his health perfectly restored. But
                  he arose from his couch sick at heart; no drugs, no medicines, could bring
                  tranquillity to his mind; its peace had departed for ever; and he sought the balm
                  that might soothe, if not cure its disease, in a land that was foreign to his own,
                  and amongst a race that were aliens in language, in blood, and in affection.
               Here, then he dwelt, a solitary man, undisturbed in his seclusion, and enjoying an
                  external quiet that was a mockery to the feelings of his bosom. With his books,
                  his music, and his meerschaum, he whiled away the hours; only varying these
                  pursuits by an occasional expedition in the interior, or a ride along the white
                  sands of the sea-shore. But at such times he was always alone; the stern recluse
                  permitted none to intrude upon his privacy, and many an urbane overture of
                  fellowship was repulsed by the haughty frown of that isolated stranger.
               The singular mode of life adopted by El Hermoso Ermitaño, as he was designated by
                  the people of the place, was well calculated to excite public curiosity; but,
                  however great their desires might have been to become acquainted with his history,
                  they never prompted them to pursue their observations beyond the bounds of strict
                  propriety. This statement will no doubt be discredited by many venerable ladies of
                  our own country, as a feature entirely inconsistent with the female character; but
                  I assure them one and all that this thirst for knowledge is not possessed by the
                  Spanish dames; and for corroboration of this testimony, I refer them to Professor
                  Bamboozle, who wrote a pamphlet of sixty pages upon the manners and customs of
                  Spain, and who avers that the women of that country always attend to their own
                  affairs first, and by that process arrive at the conviction, that they have not
                  leisure to direct their attention to the affairs of others.
               In this state of seclusion had Montgomery existed for nearly six months from the
                  date of his first settlement in the country, when his retiracy was one morning
                  disturbed by the entrance of a stranger. The recluse shut the book he had been
                  perusing, and rising with a scowl on his brow, haughtily responded to his
                  visiter's salutation; the intruder was the Governor of Tampico.
               "May I ask what business has honoured me with a visit from Don Manuel de
                  Silva?"
               "It is not business that brought me hither, Don Juan de Hautville" (for such was
                  the name the exile had adopted), responded the new comer; "but a desire to become
                  acquainted with one whom I respect for his nation's sake, and whom I would
                  willingly serve for his own."
               "In the name of my country I thank you," coldly replied Montgomery, "and for your
                  proffers of assistance, I am also grateful; when I need it, I shall perhaps apply
                  to you."
               The governor was partially disconcerted by the frigid manner of his companion, and
                  there was a slight pause of evident uneasiness before he again resumed.
               "I am afraid," said he, "that you have mistaken my motive in seeking this
                  interview. I come not here, impelled by idle curiosity, to pry into your affairs;
                  nor is it a custom with me to thrust my acquaintance upon any one. My object was
                  of a nature far more magnanimous; but as my visit has been so unfavourably favourably received, I will withdraw;
                  hoping, however, that you may not continue to misconstrue my intention in making
                  it.—Adios."
               "Stop, Don Manuel, I crave your pardon—I was hasty—I was wrong—I was rude, but
                  when I explain—"
               "Nay, Don Juan," interrupted the governor, "no apology is necessary; the
                  acknowledgments you have just made amply excuse the past. I have forgotten
                  it!"
               Don Manuel de Silva was a man who added to the brightest intellectual qualities,
                  personal accomplishments of the most refined order. Educated in one of the most
                  polished courts of Europe, with a mind improved by travel, and a disposition that
                  appropriated with avidity every advantage that was offered, he became one of the
                  most elegant caballeros of the day. No wonder then that Montgomery was enchanted
                  with his conversation: that interview was of long duration; and when it was ended,
                  so complete was the influence of the visiter, that he consented to comply with his
                  invitation to spend the day at his mansion.
               They crossed the river, and in a short time arrived at the governor's residence.
                  Here he was presented to the wife and daughter of his host: the former a stately
                  dame of thirty-five, and the latter a beautiful, black-eyed señorita of seventeen.
                  So pleased was he with their companionship, that he tarried until a late hour; and
                  strange to say, from that time the visits of Montgomery became more and more
                  frequent at the house of Don Manuel.
               For the governor he entertained the strictest friendship. His feelings towards
                  Donna Ava were much the same; but for the daughter, La Señorita Carlotta, he
                  conceived at first an affection almost paternal. He taught her English; he
                  fashioned her taste for the love of poetry; he became her instructor in the art of
                  painting; he awakened in her a passion for knowledge; and from his own library he
                  supplied her with books of the most instructive and enlightening character.
               The devotion she paid to her studies; the gratitude she evinced towards her
                  preceptor for directing them; her youth, her beauty, her artlessness, captivated
                  by degrees his admiration: until at last he found, in an analysis of his feelings,
                  that he loved her.
               There are some men to whom love is a constitutional necessity; they are miserable
                  unless their affections be fixed upon another of the opposite sex. Such a one was
                  Montgomery; his feelings all tended to the beautiful, and his heart was only at
                  rest when these yearnings were gratified. He had loved once, deeply, devotedly;
                  but that did not incapacitate him from loving again. I am no believer in the
                  theory of first and only love; nor can I cease to think that we may adore the
                  memory of one, whilst we worship at the shrine of another; still I must
                  acknowledge that there is a charm breathing around our first passion that we never
                  feel again; but what is it, and why is it? There are none so ignorant, but they
                  may answer these queries; and yet there are none who will do it. We are so prone
                  to superstition, or rather we are so fond of deceiving ourselves by a belief in
                  causes and effects beyond our comprehension, that we willingly ascribe that
                  influence to something divine, when it is a consequence perfectly natural to us
                  all. Our first victory in arms; our first triumph in literature; our earliest
                  success of any kind, is to us by far the most gratifying; and though in after
                  years increasing glory should eclipse our first humble essay, yet is it remembered
                  with feelings we never accord to any subsequent good fortune.
               And Montgomery loved again. Not with the romance of his first attachment; but with
                  a passion as powerful, though not as poetic. All the most splendid and delicate
                  feelings of his youth had been lavished upon Anna Hamilton, but the sterner
                  sentiments of his nature still remained; even as the broad, rapid river rolls on,
                  though forsaken by the sunbeams that gilded it at morn. He loved as fervently, but
                  not as beautifully as before; for the freshness of youthful passion once blossoms,
                  and never blooms again. But he thought, in the wildness of his imagination, that
                  all the happy hopes of his first passion could be transferred to the second; and
                  that the bright anticipations that had once faded, would again relume in an iris
                  of hope, like that which love erst hung out in her heaven, so fair that it left
                  for ever the impress of enchantment; though it dazzled but a moment, and vanished
                  then away.
               The feelings of Carlotta towards Montgomery were of a far different nature. She
                  admired him for his brilliant qualities; his immense erudition had captivated her
                  youthful fancy; she even loved him; but there was so much of awe in that passion,
                  so much deep-toned respect for his indubitable superiority, that it might be
                  likened more to adoration than to any other sentiment. She often had wished in the
                  secrecy of her heart that he was less talented; and as often she sighed with pain,
                  when some brilliant burst of eloquence from his lips taught her the immeasurable
                  distinction that subsisted between them. She thought with sadness that one so
                  highly gifted could not bestow his affections upon one who, in point of intellect,
                  could compete no more than the faint sparkle of the glow-worm with the bright
                  effulgence of the noonday sun; and the reflection, while it made her unhappy, but
                  added to the awe which his qualities had inspired in her bosom. Montgomery, unlike
                  Sutherland, had not the tact of concealing the beauties of his mind when it was
                  his desire to do so; but upon every subject of conversation that might be
                  introduced, his native genius developed itself when he himself self was unaware of the display. He could not be
                  commonplace; he had suffered and studied too much for that: and, added to this,
                  his weakest impulses were almost ungovernable.
               "Will you go upon the water, Carlotta?"
               "Si, señor," answered the maiden.
               "Will the excursion be more agreeable than any other pursuit just now?"
               "Si, señor."
               And Montgomery, accompanied by his fair companion, proceeded to the river, and
                  they were soon floating upon its placid surface.
               "How beautiful!" exclaimed he, paying a just tribute to the scene around him.
               "Beautiful!" responded Carlotta.
               And indeed so it was. The sun was just sinking through a transparent mass of
                  purple clouds in the far west, and his light had faded into loveliness; it was
                  mild, soft, and sad, like the hectic flush upon the cheek of expiring beauty. The
                  air was balmy and delicious; silence, too, lent a charm to the place, and solitude
                  was there—for, save one large bird of splendid plumage that rested his wing upon a
                  leafless bough, no living thing was visible.
               "How glorious is yon luminary, Carlotta! Look! it sinks, it sinks! and like our
                  hopes, is even more lovely as it vanishes before us." "But ah!" resumed he, when
                  he had indulged in a moment's thought, "it will rise again on the morrow, whilst
                  they set to disappear for ever."
               "And does Don Juan speak so feelingly from experience?" asked the artless girl.
                  "Methinks he could have had little to disappoint him."
               "Why, Carlotta?"
               "Because every one would be glad to contribute to his happiness. There are none
                  who would have refused a wish of Don Juan."
               "Carlotta, why do you think so?"
               "Excuse me, señor, if I do not answer you."
               "Certainly, Carlotta! But in this you are sadly mistaken. There are few men who go
                  down to the grave with more sorrows at their heart than I have had."
               "Than you, señor?"
               "Yes, than I! But you seem surprised, Carlotta!"
               "I am, señor."
               "Are you at liberty to tell me why?"
               The maiden hesitated a moment, blushed, sighed, and, observing that Montgomery
                  still waited a reply, whispered, "Every one must love you, Don Juan!"
               "God bless you, Carlotta!" whispered he; and he took her small white hand, and a
                  smile of boyish beauty curled his lip; a cloud seemed to pass from his brow, and
                  the memory of the past was all forgotten. "God bless you, and preserve you through
                  life, as pure and unsullied as you are at this moment!"
               The maiden listened with rapture, but she dared not raise her eyes to his, and he
                  tenderly bent down, and kissed their long black lashes.
               "Carlotta," said he, and his voice was subdued with affection, "you are dearer to
                  me than life; for without you, existence would be as the blasted oak when stripped
                  of the green glory that wreathed it with enchantment. The memory of the mother
                  that gave me birth is sweet to me, but sweeter yet are all my dreams of you; the
                  recollections of my home are pleasing, too, but thy home is dearer still; the sigh
                  of the summer breeze is grateful to me, but thy low-breathed respiration glads me
                  a hundredfold more; music is delightful to my senses, but it thrills not as the
                  melody of thy voice; and thy smile is dearer to me than was ever a beam of the sun
                  to the tempest-tossed mariner."
               The lover ceased—the maiden spoke not. It was a silence of sweet emotions—a
                  silence of eloquent tenderness—the lifetime of a happy dream.
               "Carlotta, dearest Carlotta, will you be mine?"
               The maiden blushed still deeper, but her lips gave forth no murmur.
               "Answer me, Carlotta; dearest Carlotta, say that I may call you my own one! Say
                  that I may not sigh in vain for the possession of those beauties that have filled
                  my soul with tenderness and love; or, if you think me too presumptuous in suing
                  for charms that almost invest you with divinity, tell me that I may be your slave;
                  and I swear I will be as true to you as the moon to the earth, or the magnet to
                  its northern axis!"
               "If Don Juan is sincere," murmured the maiden, and she again hesitated.
               "Sincere, Carlotta! Can you then doubt me? Oh, is it possible that you can
                  distrust him who would rather deceive an angel from heaven than yourself?"
               "No, no, Don Juan, I do not distrust you. I believe you. I cannot doubt your
                  truth, Don Juan. I but distrust my own happiness."
               "And you will be mine, Carlotta?"
               "I will, Don Juan."
               "Then, indeed, am I supremely blest!" and he kissed the sweet lips whose accents
                  had made him happy. "Yes, Carlotta,
                  then indeed shall the star of my destiny burst in brilliancy through the clouds
                  that have so long robbed it of its beams."
               The boat touched the river bank, and the lovers returned to their homes; one to
                  listen to the thousand sweet whispers of Hope, and the other to indulge in the
                  wild but delightful dreams of an enthusiastic imagination, fired by the dearest
                  passion to which man's heart can be susceptible.
            
            
               CHAPTER XII.
               ALL hail to thee, thou dark blue Ocean! Once more I sweep along thy flashing
                  waters; once more I gaze upon thy broad expanse, whence the eye can turn to naught
                  but heaven, as if indeed there were nothing beneath it, whose sublimity could not
                  rival thine. Nor is there! Of all nature's terrestial wonders, thou art the most
                  stupendous, the most imposing, the most beautiful, the most terrible! I have stood
                  upon the loftiest mountains of the earth, and from the eternal snows that cap
                  their summits, have looked down upon the green hills and fertile valleys that
                  spread smiling in the sunshine below me; and my soul bowed down in acknowledgment
                  of the unwonted loveliness of the scene. Then as I gazed, dense clouds gathered
                  around me, and all below was shut out from my vision. A broad curtain of
                  impenetrable haze, through which the lightning was flashing, and along which the
                  thunder was rolling, was alone before me; and as I stood above all this, like some
                  solitary being in the infinity of space, I trembled, for it was fearfully
                  magnificent. Again, I have looked from the shores of the most beautiful river of
                  my native land. Before me swept the richly freighted argosies, spreading their
                  white wings on high, curling the crystal waters around their prows, and sending
                  their gay banners aloft, to coquet with the summer breeze; behind me, rose the
                  tall spires and glittering domes of a proud, a glorious city; and far as the eye
                  could reach, spread fields of golden grain, tall forests, and grassy plains; while
                  on every hill were reared the snow-white walls of a brave and happy people. It was
                  to me a scene of peculiar enchantment, for it was the birth-place of my hopes, the
                  theatre of my boyhood. And I have gazed upon that mighty marvel of Niagara, where
                  the simple red man listened to the voice of Manitou, and looked in wonder upon his
                  bow of hope; and I too have felt the awe it inspires; but never, oh, Ocean! have I
                  seen thy peer nor thy equal. Thou hast no rival—mighty, illimitable
                  element! Thou art indeed the fittest type of HIM who holds thy "many waters" in
                  the hollow of his hand!
               Such were the musings of Captain Sutherland, as he paced the quarter-deck of the
                  Sparrow Hawk. But hold! good reader, while I "prate of our whereabout." Know,
                  then, that you are on board of an American sloop-of-war, and that you are even now
                  running along to the eastward of the Bahamas, heading to the southward, the wind
                  right aft, and steering-sails set alow and aloft.
               
               "Fine night," said Mr. Topblock, who was officer of the deck, addressing Captain
                  Sutherland. He was in the habit of saying that it was a fine night; it was his
                  preface to conversation, and he invariably broke the ice with some such
                  hammer.
               "Very," responded the commander. Sutherland was to his officers the very essence
                  of politeness.
               "Fine run to-day, sir," rejoined Mr. Topblock, increasing the angular distance of
                  his legs, putting the trumpet under his left arm, and thrusting both hands in his
                  breeches pockets.
               "Yes; I believe we have a degree and a half on the slate, since meridian."
               "Fine breeze, too," remarked the lieutenant.
               "Yes; truly, we have been favoured by old Æolus of late."
               Mr. Topblock made no immediate reply, but he wondered who the d—l Æolus might be.
                  Mr. Topblock could not be called a heathen mythologist; but he was a discreet man,
                  and determined not to agitate a subject upon which he was so totally ignorant.
               Before he had time, however, to start another topic, the cry of 'sail ho!' rose
                  from the forecastle, and died away to leeward, on the wings of the breeze.
               "Whereaway?" inquired Mr. Topblock, through the trumpet.
               "Broad on the larboard bow," responded the look-out; and Sutherland, on turning to
                  the indicated direction, beheld a pile of canvass looming through the gloom of the
                  night.
               "The glass, quartermaster!" exclaimed Mr. Topblock; and that gentleman sent his
                  glance through an inverted telescope.
               "Can you distinguish her?" asked Captain Sutherland.
               "Perfectly."
               "What do you make her out?"
               "A ship on the starboard tack, running with the wind free; small ship, sir;
                  Frenchman, perhaps, bound to the Spanish. Main; fine ships, those Frenchmen,
                  sir."
               "Haul up a point," said Sutherland; "we will speak her."
               "Ay, ay, sir; quartermaster, bring her to, a point, and let me know when she's her
                  course."
               "Course now, sir," said the man at the wheel.
               "Very well; keep her so."
               In the mean time, Sutherland had been scanning the stranger, who was now drawing
                  nearer and nearer every moment. The stars gave but a dim light, yet there was a
                  sufficient brightness abroad, to afford him a view of her spars and hull, even at
                  the distance of a mile. Another half hour, however, brought both ships within
                  hail, and the stranger then took in his steering-sails, furled his royals, and
                  hauled up his courses. Nearly at the same time, the like manœuvre was performed on
                  board of the Sparrow Hawk, and the bows of either ship deviated a little, when
                  they commenced dashing ahead, upon the same point of the compass.
               At this moment a tall figure sprang into the mizzen rigging of the new comer, and
                  applying a huge lee-gangway trumpet to his mouth, sang out, in a clear and
                  powerful voice, the customary "Ship ahoy!"
               "Fine voice," muttered Mr. Topblock, as he gave forth a well-turned "hilloa!"
               "What ship is that?" inquired the stranger.
               Mr. Topblock looked at Sutherland; Sutherland made an affirmative gesture, and the
                  former answered: "The United States sloop-of-war Sparrow Hawk; and what ship is
                  that, pray?—and where bound?—and how long out?—and where from?"
               It was a good while before the stranger replied; but the interrogatories of Mr.
                  Topblock were so multifarious, that it required an unusual time to arrange their
                  respective answers. At length, however, there came: "The Royal Alfred, from
                  London, bound to Vera Cruz, thirty days out."
               Then the courses and royals of the stranger fell from the yards; the after sails
                  were braced sharp up on the larboard tack; the spanker hauled out, the flying-jib
                  run up, the head yards trimmed on a parallel with those in the rear, and all sail
                  made by the wind.
               "The fellow dislikes our company, and is about to take an unceremonious leave,"
                  remarked Sutherland. "The late conflict has soured John's temper, and he will
                  never look upon us with anything like complacency again."
               "Queer, that English merchants should hire Yankee skippers," muttered an old tar,
                  who stood looking at the stranger, with his hands thrust in the breast of his
                  pea-jacket; "but may-hap these seamen have thrown up the marlinspike for the
                  musket, a thing about as likely as that I, Jack Jeer, should one day turn
                  diwine."
               Sutherland listened attentively to the bo'son's-mate's soliloquy, for he himself
                  thought it singular that she should haul close upon the wind, instead of steering
                  the more direct course for her place of destination.
               "Do you think the man that hailed us, an American, Jeer?"
               "Ay, sir," responded the tar, "and a Nantucketer, at that, or I'm a green-horn. I
                  could detect the woice o' one o' them fellows, if he was to bellow a half a knot
                  through a stove-pipe."
               The stranger, though dashing rapidly through the water, was yet within hail, when
                  Sutherland, seizing a trumpet, sprang upon a gun, and desired him to heave to, and
                  send a boat alongside. The tall figure again leaped into the mizzen rigging, and
                  replied, that all his boats but the launch had been stove in a gale of wind, off
                  the Island of Madeira.
               
               "Brace your main-topsail aback, then, and I will send a boat to you," rejoined
                  Sutherland.
               The chase, however, took no notice of the remark, but singing out a "good night,"
                  through the trumpet, descended to the deck.
               "Loose the royals; man the fore and main tacks and sheets; clear away the
                  flying-jib; man the spanker out-haul!" The men obeyed with excited alacrity, and
                  in a few moments the Sparrow Hawk was surging ahead, in hot pursuit.
               "Clear away the long gun!—beat to quarters!" was the next order that issued from
                  abaft; and then the deck of the American presented a scene of wild though not
                  unusual excitement. The shrill, measured notes of the fife, blended with the loud
                  rolling of the drum; the confused hum of the men, as they hurried up with their
                  hammocks; the clashing of cutlasses, as they were thrown from the arm-chests, all
                  mingled in rude disorder. But these noises soon subsided; the men took their
                  places at the guns; the officers repaired to their respective stations; and when
                  the drum had ceased to beat, nothing was heard, save the wash of the waves, as
                  they swept along the dark counter of the vessel.
               The two ships were now running along at a rapid rate; but it was soon observable
                  that the stranger was ranging ahead. As soon as Sutherland perceived this, he
                  ordered a shot to be thrown across the fore-foot of the chase. The match was
                  applied, the report rang upon the air, and the ball ploughed the water up under
                  her lee quarter; but the stranger still held his way, and in another minute, three
                  small sky-sails fluttered aloft, and were spread out above his royals.
               "Throw another among his canvass!" exclaimed Sutherland, angrily.
               "Very fine!" exclaimed Mr. Topblock, as the spanker-gaff of the stranger was
                  shattered by the ball into a thousand fragments—"very fine!" But even as he spoke,
                  the bows of the chase swept gracefully to starboard, and the roar of eight pieces
                  of artillery burst from his sides, and enveloped his hull and courses in a dense
                  bank of smoke. The iron rattled through the rigging and spars of the Sparrow Hawk,
                  cutting and splintering everything in its path, but passing to leeward, without
                  injuring anything that would lessen the speed of the vessel.
               Sutherland cast his eyes aloft, for a moment, and turning to the man at the wheel,
                  ordered him to put the helm a-port. The obedient ship fell off, and when she had
                  brought her entire broadside to bear upon her antagonist, the deafening thunder of
                  her carronades rang upon the startled air, with a peal that sent its echo up to
                  the very heavens; and when the eyes of those on board of the Sparrow Hawk were
                  turned once more to the chase, they beheld her mizzen-top-gallant-mast dangling
                  from aloft, and her fore and main royals flapping in the wind; but men were seen
                  the next instant clambering up the rigging, and before the guns of the American
                  were reloaded, the wreck was cleared, and the clews of the fluttering canvass
                  extended to the extremities of the yards. When these dispositions had been
                  effected, another volley of iron darted across the water, crashing through the
                  bulwarks of the American, dismounting two carronades, and killing or wounding the
                  crew of the dismantled guns.
               "That broadside was well directed," muttered Sutherland, as a dark spot settled
                  like a cloud upon his brow; "and those fellows work like magicians. Mr. Topblock,
                  what is your opinion of that ship?"
               "Why, sir, I should say that she is some West India pirate, cruising about to
                  intercept some homeward-bound Don. Who knows but it may be 'Diablito' himself? They say his ship is handled like the Flying Dutchman, and
                  that she outsails the very wind."
               "Then we must capture her, at every sacrifice! Let them load and fire all the guns
                  that will bear, in the order of succession, and let some hands go aloft and
                  overhaul damages."
               A running fight was now kept up between the pursuer and the pursued, for another
                  two hours, during which little or no advantage was gained on either side. But at
                  the expiration of that time, the stranger, by his superior sailing, had placed
                  himself beyond the range of the Sparrow Hawk's carronades, and the battle was then
                  maintained with the two long guns, the chase, after this, not firing a single shot
                  in return. Sutherland's only hope of capturing his antagonist, was by disabling
                  her; and to effect this, he kept up an unceasing fire from the eighteens, although
                  it retarded the progress of his ship, and thereby rendered a decided advantage to
                  the retreating vessel. During the remainder of the night, the chase was hotly
                  continued, the stranger gradually gaining a greater distance; and when the first
                  flush of morning streaked the horizon, she was hull-down to windward, and the long
                  guns of the American were of no further service. The breeze, too, began to die
                  away; and when the sun rose, it fell a dead calm.
               Although Sutherland had been on deck throughout all the watches of the night, he
                  requested that Mr. Topblock and the rest of the officers should go below and seek
                  some repose. The men were also sent to their hammocks, and in a little time he
                  stood alone upon the blood-stained and shattered deck of the Sparrow Hawk. Long
                  after the sun rose, he continued to pace the narrow limits between the taffrail
                  and mizzen-mast, in deep and unbroken revery. There was something in the view
                  around him, that harmonized with his own melancholy meditations.
               
               It was high noon; yet still no breath of air ruffled the surface of the burnished
                  wave, nor was there a single cloud in the blue arch above. The sea, too, had gone
                  to rest, and all was silent—all was calm.
               At length, the loud, shrill whistle of the boatswain awoke the crew from their
                  slumbers, and the decks of the Sparrow Hawk were again enlivened by the gay jest
                  and hearty laugh of the reckless tar. Gangs were set about repairing the
                  destruction of the night; new lifts and braces were rove; yards were fished,
                  shattered spars sent down, spare top-gallant-masts fidded, sails mended or
                  replaced, dismounted guns re-shipped, and new breechings substituted; so that by
                  sunset, the Sparrow Hawk was amply prepared for another engagement.
               The night passed languidly away. Morning came again, but the calm was as profound
                  as it had been during the previous day. At last, when even expectation slumbered,
                  the gratifying cry of "A breeze, a breeze!" burst simultaneously from a hundred
                  lips. "All hands make sail!" exclaimed the officer of the watch. Up flew the
                  nimble topmen; and in a little time, the Sparrow Hawk was dashing bravely ahead.
                  The stranger, too, had spread abroad all his canvass, and was going off on a "taut
                  bowline," it being evidently his fastest point of sailing.
               "Would to heaven the wind had come out from the westward!" said Sutherland; "I
                  think if we could obtain the weather-gauge, we might yet overhaul the rascal; as
                  it is, our only chance is to keep him in sight, until we have a shift of the
                  breeze."
               "I think with you, exactly," said Topblock, surveying the chase through a
                  telescope: "but hilloa! what the d—l does the fellow mean? Here it is as clear as
                  a bell, and, by the gods! he's taking in everything! Why, if he expected a
                  hurricane in five minutes, he couldn't be more expeditious. Whew!—up courses, in
                  royals and to gallant sails, down jib and flying-jib, up spanker!—what
                     does he mean? There go his topsail halliards, too; by my life! not
                  a rag left aloft!" The lieutenant passed the glass to Sutherland, who, with equal
                  astonishment, surveyed the naked spars of the stranger.
               "He's hoisting away his fore storm-stay-sail!" said he; and as he yet gazed, he
                  beheld her careen, until her lower-yards nearly touched the water. Like lightning
                  the truth flashed upon him. He dropped the telescope, seized a deck-trumpet, and
                  raised it to his lips. But it was too late! The fury of the gust burst over him,
                  and his voice was drowned in the crash of falling spars, and the thunder of the
                  rent canvass. The three topmasts, jib, and flying jib-booms, fell over the side,
                  and the Sparrow Hawk was a helpless wreck.
               "Cut!" shouted Sutherland, when he could at length be heard; "cut there,
                  for'ard!—cut for your lives!—cut away everything thing!" The ready seamen leaped
                  into the gangways, and in a moment every piece of standing or running rigging that
                  confined the wrecked masts to the hull of the ship, was severed.
               "Hard up your helm! quartermaster—hard up!"
               "Does she go off?"
               "No, sir!" shouted the man at the wheel.
               There succeeded a few moments of breathless anxiety. The ship was now in a
                  situation that threatened her immediate destruction. Her whole broadside was
                  exposed to the hurricane, and her only hope of salvation was in getting at once
                  before it. The sea, too, was pouring like a cataract over her lee hammock-cloths,
                  and the starboard gangway was afloat with water.
               "Is she going off at all?" inquired Sutherland.
               "No, sir; she don't budge an inch!" was the response.
               "Come aft here, carpenters; cut away the mizzen-mast!"
               The lanyards of the weather rigging were severed, and after a few strokes of the
                  axe, the mast fell, with a heavy plunge, into the sea.
               "She's going off!" shouted the quartermaster, almost at the same instant.
               "Very well; stand by to meet her with the helm!"—and the bows of the shattered
                  ship tended gracefully to leeward, and recovering her gravity with one deep roll,
                  she began to drive furiously through the boiling ocean.
               Until then, not a word had been spoken by any but Sutherland. The attention of
                  every one was riveted upon his own impending danger; but when that terror had been
                  allayed, a universal buzz of admiration burst from the crew, as they beheld the
                  strange ship, with all her yards and masts aloft, sweeping beautifully before the
                  gale, under a close-reefed foresail.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIII.
               NOT many days after the events of the last chapter had taken place, the Sparrow
                  Hawk swept by the Moro Castle under jury masts, and cast anchor in the harbour of
                  Havana. Here she underwent all necessary repairs, and in less than a fortnight she
                  was again ready to proceed on her cruise.
               It was noon; the sun showered down his light in dazzling brilliancy, but the
                  breeze from the sea cooled the ardour of his rays, and rendered the temperature
                  delightful; the air was balmy, as it is always between the tropics, and the clear
                  blue sky smiled away the belief that a cloud had ever darkened its surface.
               Mr. Topblock was officer of the deck; and at the time we write was listening with
                  the most profound attention to the first lieutenant, who was relating some
                  extraordinary circumstance that happened under his immediate observation, whilst
                  he was in Germany. Now Mr. Yarnall was a gentleman who nurtured a most inveterate
                  propensity to the marvellous; it seemed, indeed, that he had monopolized the
                  knowledge of all the wonderful events that had happened since the age of miracles.
                  No man could relate a more singular incident than he; and, strange to add, his
                  stories were as numerous and as diversified as they were anomalous. It was not
                  often that Mr. Yarnall detailed any event in which he himself had not been a
                  participator; but such was now the case, for he was informing Topblock of the
                  circumstance of a child having been born with a string of beads about its
                  neck.
               "A string of beads!" exclaimed Topblock.
               "String of beads," reiterated Yarnall.
               "How surprising, extraordinary!" ejaculated Topblock, with a credulous shake of
                  the head, and a look of well-feigned astonishment; for he well knew that to doubt
                  any asseveration coming from Yarnall, was to insult him mortally. Yarnall was
                  besides a regular fire-eater; and he had, on one occasion, shot three Frenchmen,
                  before breakfast, for refusing to believe that he had seen a flying-fish perch
                  upon the main yard, and, whilst there, had heard it imitate all the most beautiful
                  notes of the mocking-bird.
               "Not at all extraordinary," rejoined Yarnall; "not at all extraordinary—you've
                  heard of the remarkable birth at Greenwich, I suppose?"
               "No, I have not," returned Topblock; "event of a similar nature?"
               "Somewhat so," replied Yarnall. "The child, a fine healthy boy, was brought forth
                  with a wooden leg."
               Nothing but a thorough knowledge of the irritability of Mr. Yarnall's disposition
                  prevented Mr. Topblock from laughing outright; as it was, he did not give way to
                  his mirth, but merely remarked that it was "most shocking extraor'nary."
               "Very much so—very much so," rejoined the narrator. "The mother, you see, whilst
                  walking out, one day, was suddenly startled by observing an old tar dancing the
                  sailor's hornpipe, upon a timber toe—which incident, by the bye, most
                  satisfactorily accounts for this extraordinary lusus
                     naturæ.
               
               "And did the child live?" asked Topblock.
               "O! yes," replied Yarnall. "A curious old admiral took a fancy to him, and adopted
                  him. At an early age he placed him on board of a British frigate, in the capacity
                  of a midshipman, and in less than five years from that date he was made a
                  post-captain. But, alas!"—and Mr. Yarnall heaved a sigh of the most profound
                  nature—"Alas! poor Singleton is no more. I knew him well, Topblock—excellent
                  fellow—had but one fault, and that his friends always excused; would put too much
                  sweetening in his rum toddies."
               "He is then dead, I presume?"
               "Yes," returned Yarnall. "The poor fellow sailed from Malta, and was never
                  afterwards heard of. Some suppose that his ship foundered at sea, and that all
                  hands perished; others again think that she was wrecked upon the coast of Barbary,
                  and that her people were murdered by the Arabs. I myself am inclined to the latter
                  opinion; for Baron Von Klopstein-snoffellgrosen, the late eminent traveller,
                  states that he found a tenpenny nail in the tent of an old Bedouin—proof positive,
                  almost, of such being the case."
               Here the conversation of these two worthies was interrupted by the quarter-master,
                  who, touching his hat, informed Mr. Topblock that a Spanish barque was standing up
                  for the anchorage. Yarnall, at this juncture, went below, and Topblock continued
                  his promenade, wondering the while whether the practice of lying proceeded from an
                  innate propensity; or whether it was not acquired by early and continued habit.
                  "One thing," said he, soliloquizing, "is certain. Yarnall is either a d—d fool
                  himself, or he considers me one. Well! he may entertain his opinion, and I'll
                  enjoy mine."
               Meanwhile the strange barque arrived at the anchorage, clewed up her topsails,
                  hauled down her jib, hauled out her spanker, and came to, within a cable's length
                  of the Sparrow Hawk. It was at this moment that Sutherland came upon deck. He
                  looked at the strange vessel, and as he scanned her admirable proportions, his
                  gaze became more and more intense; he took up the telescope scope, and when it was withdrawn from his eye, his
                  face was deadly pale, and his whole countenance was expressive of the wildest
                  agitation. Some harrowing recollection aroused his fiercer passions, and a scowl
                  of terrible malignity gathered upon his brow. Years had passed away since he had
                  last seen that little vessel, but he could not have forgotten her. She was stamped
                  upon his memory in characters of fire. "Mr. Topblock, have my boat manned," said
                  he, and turning quickly upon his heel, he descended to his cabin.
               "The boat is ready, sir," said the officer of the deck, as he reappeared with his
                  side-arms; and Sutherland, responding to his subordinate's salutation, passed over
                  the gangway and seated himself in the boat. "Give way!" said he sternly to the
                  crew; and while his blue eye glowed with frenzy, he muttered in a lower tone, "D—d
                  villain, I have ye at last! murderer of my father, your hour is at hand!"
               In a very few moments the gig darted alongside of the barque, and Sutherland,
                  seizing the man-ropes, ascended to her deck. He cast one desultory glance around
                  him; there could be no mistake; he was on board of the Sea-King. Her armament was
                  disguised, and her ports closed up, but he observed that the boat-cover was hauled
                  over with a nicety that did not accord with the confusion everywhere else
                  apparent. Before much time was given him for uninterrupted observation, a young
                  man attired in the ordinary habiliments of a mariner advanced to receive him.
               "I would speak a moment with the commander," said Sutherland.
               "Walk below, sir," replied the stranger; and they both descended to the forward
                  cabin. The captain of the Sparrow Hawk gazed for one moment around him; and,
                  although the furniture and hangings were concealed, he knew it to be the apartment
                  he had once been in before.
               "You wish to speak with me?" commenced the stranger, motioning his visiter to a
                  seat, and drawing another to himself.
               "No, sir," replied Sutherland. "My business is with the commander."
               "Then 'tis with me you wish to speak," returned the stranger. "I am master,
                  here."
               "You, sir!"
               The stranger bowed an assent, and Sutherland for a moment seemed lost in thought.
                  "Where then," at length asked he, "is Captain Manly?"
               "I am unacquainted with the person you refer to," replied the addressed; but
                  though he answered the query with promptitude, he could not help exhibiting some
                  uneasiness as well as surprise at the interrogatory.
               "Look ye, sir!" rejoined Sutherland; "you may strike your yards, put in your false
                  ports, screen your battery, and secrete your men; but all these precautions will
                  not deceive me. How call you this ship?"
               "La Santa Maria."
               "Otherwise, the Sea-King!" continued Sutherland, looking sternly into the eye of
                  his companion.
               "Otherwise, the Sea-King," repeated the stranger, convinced that deception for the
                  further was useless.
               "And Captain Manly?—"
               "Is in South America," returned the stranger. "But in what part of it I know not;
                  he left us at Rio de Janeiro."
               Sutherland heaved a sigh—a sigh of disappointed revenge.
               "And now, sir, since I have been explicit with you, I have a right to expect that
                  you will deal in the same manner with me. How knew you this ship?"
               "It would benefit you nothing to know how I obtained the information," said
                  Sutherland. "You must be convinced that I am better acquainted with her, than you
                  perhaps might wish me to be."
               "Sir, you mistake!" replied the stranger. "It is to me a matter of no importance,
                  whether you are, or you are not ignorant of the internal arrangements of this
                  ship. I believe I have a right to make what dispositions I think proper and
                  suitable on board here."
               "True, sir, true!" rejoined Sutherland. "And upon that principle, you have
                  substituted the banner of Old Spain for the flag of your own country."
               The countenance of the stranger reddened at this remark, and for a moment he was
                  at a loss for a reply. But recovering his self-possession, he said, that his
                  country had at least no cause to complain of the change.
               "That may or may not be," returned Sutherland. "But as there is a mystery hanging
                  about the character of this ship, I feel it my duty to investigate it. Where have
                  you been since the proclamation of peace?"
               "As I question your right to make that demand," said the stranger, "I do not
                  consider myself bound to give you a definite reply. I may have been trading to
                  Europe; I may have been slaving on the coast of Africa; I may have been smuggling
                  upon the coast of China—"
               "Or you may have been plundering in the Caribbean," interrupted Sutherland.
               "Take care, sir!" exclaimed the stranger, with a deep frown upon his brow; "take
                  care, sir, you are on board of my ship now! Be discreet in your language, or you
                  may never quit her; you are my guest,
                  too, sir. I would have you also recollect what is due to the forbearance of a
                  host."
               "I never suffer my private relations to interfere with the discharge of my duty,"
                  said Sutherland; "and as regards your threat, you must, when you uttered it, have
                  forgotten that you were under the guns of an American ship of war."
               The stranger's lip curled with a smile of significance at this remark, but he made
                  no immediate reply.
               "I am here," continued Sutherland, "to protect the commercial interests of the
                  United States. If, then, you are disposed to clear up the character of this ship,
                  I am now at leisure to examine your papers. During the war, this vessel was
                  engaged in the privateer service; but since its termination, I suspect the duties
                  she has performed have been of a very different nature. I may wrong you in this
                  suspicion, but it is in your power, if I am in error, to correct me."
               "Many thanks, sir, many thanks! but as regards your suspicions, you are at perfect
                  liberty to enjoy any opinion you may form of this ship; for, be assured, I shall
                  not make the slightest endeavour to alter it."
               "Enough, sir," said Sutherland, rising from his seat; "were we at sea, I would
                  capture you upon my own responsibility; but as it is, I will be obliged to
                  denounce you to the governor."
               "Stop one moment," said the stranger, with a smile, half-sarcastic and
                  half-mirthful, "you are so very kind that I will not permit you to take even that
                  trouble. Read that, sir."
               Sutherland took the parchment, and read with astonishment a protection, signed by
                  the governor of Havana.
               "In other words," said Sutherland, folding and returning it, "a commission to
                  commit rapine and murder, whenever and wherever an opportunity may present."
               The stranger smiled again, but was silent. Sutherland sought his boat, and in a
                  few minutes regained the deck of the Sparrow Hawk. Informing Yarnall of the
                  suspicious character of the barque, he desired him to have a strict watch kept on
                  her movements; and furthermore, to heave short, and have everything ready for
                  getting under way at a moment's warning. Agreeably to these instructions, the
                  messenger was passed, the cable shortened in, the cat and fish falls rove, the
                  foot-ropes let down, the running rigging and steering-sail gear sent aloft, and
                  all the machinery of the ship so disposed to facilitate and expedite her
                  movements, that no more time than five minutes would be required to heave up the
                  ponderous instrument that kept her in station, and spread her snowy wings to the
                  influence of the breeze.
               Sutherland threw himself upon the cabin ottoman with a gloomy and sullen brow. He
                  had been frustrated in the commission mission of a crime he had firmly resolved to
                  perpetrate. And high-minded and generous as he was, he vented more than one
                  imprecation upon fate for the disappointment. To take the life of Manly was no
                  consideration of murder with him: the deed he deemed would be but the execution of
                  the fiat of justice; he lived but in the hope of its consummation. He could not
                  for one moment suppose, that to exterminate the man who had blotted the fair fame
                  of the being that gave him birth; who brought down the gray hairs of his father in
                  sorrow to the grave, and who had blighted and blasted all the hopes of his
                  boyhood, and all the achievements of his manhood; he could not think that to
                  exterminate such a one would be the slightest infraction of the social law; his
                  wrongs were mighty, and they had blinded him. Then, again, the past rose up before
                  him; he dreamed over his life anew. Thoughts that he had long suppressed, or at
                  least strove never to dwell upon, started in his mind, and held their place there;
                  for he was not now disposed to banish them. As tears sometimes relieve, so
                  reflections the most miserable often alleviate.
               There was a knock for admission at the cabin door. Sutherland started to his feet,
                  and Mr. Yarnall entered, and informed him that the barque was heaving up her
                  anchor.
               "I'm glad of it; he shall be ours the sooner. Is everything ready for getting
                  under way?"
               "Everything."
               "Very well! let him clear the Moro, and then we'll follow him."
               The two then ascended to the deck; but the barque was already moving through the
                  water, having nothing set, however, save her jib and spanker; under this sail she
                  stood along for some time, and then, contrary to Sutherland's wishes or
                  expectations, she hauled down her jib, and again let go her anchor. Shortly
                  afterwards, men were seen at work upon her yards, and in a little time her courses
                  and topsails were unbent, and every apparent preparation made for a protracted
                  stay in port. This movement at once altered the plan Sutherland had resolved to
                  pursue. It was his primary intention to wait until the stranger had put to sea,
                  and then endeavour to capture her. As it was not in those days an inordinate
                  circumstance for officers high in authority to be connected with piratical
                  cruisers, he did not for one moment doubt but that the governor was interested in
                  the fortunes of the Sea-King, and therefore, at first, thought it unnecessary to
                  make any report to him on the subject; but, upon second reflection, he saw that it
                  was the only recourse he had. The protection shown him by the commander of the
                  barque might possibly be a forgery. He knew many such licenses had been granted to
                  the buccaneers of the West Indies, and it was not at all unreasonable to suppose that others might have
                  substituted false passports, to protect them from the cruisers of Spain. Whether
                  this was or was not the case, he however resolved to wait upon the governor in
                  person, and demand, in the name of the United States, that the character of the
                  barque should be thoroughly investigated.
               "Mr. Yarnall," said Sutherland, "I have concluded to inform the governor of my
                  suspicions as regards that barque. It is to effect this purpose that I am now
                  going on shore. Her commander knows very well that I would follow him were he to
                  put to sea, and may have unbent sails for no other purpose than to deceive us; it
                  is my wish, then, that you keep a strict watch upon his movements, and if you
                  perceive the slightest indication on his part to clear out, you will show three
                  lanterns at the peak; it is not probable, however, that he will attempt anything
                  of the kind until after dark."
               "Your orders shall be attended to," returned Yarnall. "And as to this manœuvre, I
                  am inclined to believe with you that it is all a ruse de guerre. I once knew a
                  Spanish pirate to send down lower and topsail yards, house topmast, rig sheers and
                  hoist out his lower masts, to deceive an English frigate. It had the desired
                  effect, too, sir; John Bull became incautious, and the Don that night up sticks
                  and put out. Happened in this very harbour, sir; this very harbour."
               Sutherland seated himself in the boat, and was soon swept to the shore. On getting
                  out at the mole, he desired the coxswain to be at that particular place at nine
                  o'clock, and proceeded at once to the quarters of the governor. It was sunset when
                  he arrived there; and though long beyond the hours set aside for official
                  transactions, he was received by that functionary with all the characteristic
                  courtesy of his nation.
               "I am sorry," said Sutherland, "to have intruded myself upon your excellency's
                  attention at this unseasonable hour, but the business I am on is of a nature that
                  will not admit of the least delay."
               "Nay, Señor Captain, no apologies, for I assure you that the honour of a visit
                  from you is to me most acceptable at any time. I am very happy to see you."
               "Your excellency is very kind," returned Sutherland; "and if your excellency will
                  permit me, I will state the business that has brought me hither."
               "I am at your service, Señor Captain."
               "Your excellency," resumed Sutherland, "is no doubt aware of the numerous
                  depredations that have been committed upon the commerce of all nations by the
                  piratical cruisers which for years have infested these seas."
               "I am, indeed," returned the governor;" and, Señor Captain, have for a long time
                  used every exertion in my power to free the ocean of these scourges, but, alas!
                  without avail. I have kept the cruisers of Spain continually on the alert; and
                  though this has operated as a partial check upon their proceedings, it has not
                  totally prevented their lawless outrages."
               "I am aware," rejoined Sutherland, "that your excellency has exerted every
                  possible means to bring these offenders to justice; and I am also aware of the
                  difficulties your excellency has had to struggle with in the execution of such
                  enterprises."
               "They have been many, Señor Captain, very many," resumed the governor,
                  impressively. "So many, that at times I have almost given up in despair; for, like
                  the heads of the fabled Hydra, a dozen appears to spring up where one has been
                  exterminated."
               "Your excellency states that which has been proved a melancholy truth," returned
                  Sutherland. "I fear that nothing but a general crusade of the powers of Spain,
                  France, England, and America will effect the object you have so much at heart.
                  They have all interests at stake in this quarter, and should at once combine to
                  preserve them from violation."
               "They should, indeed, Señor Captain."
               "But sir," resumed Sutherland, "I am intruding upon your time and patience; the
                  object of this visit is to inform your excellency that there is now within the
                  harbour of Havana a vessel of suspicious character. I myself have been on board of
                  her, and can say with certainty that she is no fair trader upon the waters. They
                  call her the Santa Maria."
               A close observer might have noticed a slight change in the countenance of the
                  governor, but like a flash it passed all away.
               "And has the picaroon had the impudence to pull inside of the Moro?"
               "Your excellency might have seen her before sunset with the banner of Old Spain
                  waving from her spanker-gaff; she had unbent sails before I left the Sparrow Hawk,
                  and by this time has no doubt moored ship; for by her movements I should suppose
                  that she was preparing to make a long stay in port."
               "Now, by San Pedro, he shall make a longer stay than he himself had anticipated;
                  if you will excuse me one moment, Señor Captain, I will write an order for the
                  immediate arrest of her commander and crew."
               Sutherland bowed, and the governor scribbled a few sentences, then folded, sealed,
                  and delivered the document to an officer on guard, with instructions to send it at
                  once to the person indicated by the superscription.
               After this, his excellency became extremely communicative. Various subjects were
                  in turn discussed, and the hour-hand of the clock pointed past ten, when
                  Sutherland rose to depart. The night
                  was unusually dark, and a light, drizzling rain rendered the light of the
                  street-lamps dim almost to obscurity. Sutherland passed hastily to the mole; a
                  crowd of boats surrounded it on every side, and the night was so obscure that it
                  was sometime before he could ascertain the precise place that he had appointed for
                  his gig. At length, singling her out, he descended the stairs.
               "Sparrow Hawk!" said he.
               "Here you are, sir," responded a gruff voice; and Sutherland stepping lightly in
                  the boat, threw his sword upon the stern-sheets, and took his seat.
               "Shove off!" exclaimed he. The oars fell with a common splash; and the gig
                  commenced dashing through the water. Ten minutes rowing brought them alongside.
                  "Way enough," exclaimed the coxwain: the oars were tossed, and the boat checked
                  beside the accommodation ladder. Sutherland seized the man-ropes, and ascended to
                  the gangway: but his astonishment may well be imagined, when, upon gaining the
                  deck, he found himself on board the Sea-King.
               "Drop the boat and hook her on," exclaimed a voice from the quarter-deck.
               "Stop;" said Sutherland, "here is some mistake."
               "No mistake whatever, sir," said the commander of the barque, coming forward, and
                  passing to Sutherland the salutation of the deck.
               "What mean you, sir?—this is not my ship."
               "No, sir; but you must, for a little time, content yourself on board of her."
               The eyes of Sutherland flashed fire at this remark. "No—never—not for one moment,"
                  exclaimed he; and stepping back a pace, he felt for his sword hilt, but found that
                  it had been abstracted from the scabbard. "Hell and fury!" muttered he, "and have
                  my own gig's crew aided in betraying me?"
               "Captain Sutherland," said the commander of the barque, "it is useless to agitate
                  yourself further; my own safety and the preservation of my ship and crew obliged
                  me to practise this deception upon you. But harm is not intended you; and you are
                  as safe on board here, as if you stood upon the quarter-deck of the Sparrow Hawk.
                  I was well assured you would follow me if I attempted to go to sea; and though I
                  have every confidence in the superiority of the Santa Maria as a sailer, still I
                  thought it better to incur no hazard; and therefore have adopted the only
                  expedient that can prevent your ship from getting under way at the same time. I am
                  very sorry that circumstances should have rendered this necessary; but the
                  obligations I am under to the gallant fellows I command must, with me, be
                  paramount to every other consideration. Captain Sutherland, I think I am not
                  mistaken in believing that your generosity will excuse me."
               The manner of the commander of the barque was respectful and suasive, and a little
                  reflection restored the calmness that Sutherland but seldom forgot. "You perhaps
                  are justifiable in the step you have taken to secure your own safety, although at
                  this moment I am ignorant of what it may be; you prevailed upon my boat's crew to
                  deliver me into your hands, but for what purpose I know not."
               "Captain Sutherland, you deceive yourself," replied the stranger; "it was one of
                  my boats that brought you alongside, and your own gig has been at the stern davits
                  of the Sparrow Hawk longer than an hour."
               This added yet more to Sutherland's surprise; and now for the first time, he
                  comprehended the full extent of the stratagem. The governor's pretended order for
                  the arrest of the commander of the Sea-King was, he supposed, an intimation of
                  what had passed between them in conversation, and a desire that the Santa Maria
                  should put to sea immediately. This Sutherland implicitly believed, for he
                  remembered the governor's eagerness to detain him until late, and he attributed
                  this show of extreme courtesy to a wish on the part of his excellency to gain
                  time, in order that her commander should have space and opportunity to mature his
                  plans.
               "And my object in effecting this measure," resumed the commander of the barque,
                  "is to detain you on board until we have cleared the harbour and secured an
                  offing. The Sparrow Hawk cannot, I am certain, get under way without an order from
                  Captain Sutherland."
               "How long then am I to remain your prisoner?"
               "But a few hours; there is a fine breeze blowing now, and I hope before morning to
                  put miles of blue water between my ship and the Island of Cuba. When we have
                  cleared the port, I will send you on board of some entering vessel, and if there
                  should be none without, I will give you my stern boat, and you can come in with
                  the sea breeze to-morrow."
               "An excellent arrangement, truly!" returned Sutherland, with sarcastic bitterness,
                  and he turned from the speaker, and folding his arms, stood in a remote corner of
                  the quarter-deck. The commander of the barque strode fore and aft awhile,
                  apparently absorbed in thought; at length he paused directly in front of the
                  other, and renewing his salutation, he said, in a voice that seemed to betray no
                  offence at the abrupt movement of his companion.
               "Captain Sutherland, it is not my wish, whatever may be my duty, to put you to the
                  slightest inconvenience. Believe me, I regret, as much as yourself, the
                  necessities of this case; but, sir,
                  there remains a condition, which if you promise to adhere to, will liberate you at
                  once."
               "Name it," said Sutherland.
               "Promise me, upon the honour of an American naval officer, that you will not leave
                  the harbour of Havana for thirty-six hours, and I will at once send you on board
                  of the Sparrow Hawk."
               Sutherland hesitated for a moment, but conceiving no other alternative, he
                  replied, "I promise; but at the expiration of that time I shall get under way, and
                  proceed in search of you; and whenever I meet you upon the ocean, if I should be
                  so fortunate, remember, I shall take forcible possession of your ship: and
                  furthermore, I shall leave no means untried to find you out."
               "As you please," replied the stranger, thoughtfully; "I would rather not encounter
                  you; but if I am so unlucky as to fall in with your ship, I shall most certainly
                  do everything in my power to defend my own."
               "It will be a waste of blood to no purpose," returned Sutherland. "The Sparrow
                  Hawk is twice your superior in efficiency."
               "Admitted," said the stranger; "but, notwithstanding this, the Santa Maria has
                  engaged her with success."
               "When and where," demanded Sutherland, in astonishment; and even then, a vague
                  suspicion of the circumstance rushed upon him.
               "Within the present month—off the Bahamas," replied the stranger.
               "It was you, then, who hailed us that night?"
               "It was."
               "We parted in a squall."
               "We did."
               Sutherland said no more, and the commander of the barque walked forward, and
                  ordered one of the cutters to be lowered and manned. This was but the work of a
                  few minutes; and when it had been accomplished, he again returned to the place
                  occupied by Sutherland.
               "The boat is ready for you, sir, and you will find your sword in the stern-sheets.
                  I hope we part without any feelings of personal enmity?"
               "We do," replied Sutherland; for the candour and generosity displayed by the
                  stranger, had caused him more than once to distrust or rather forget the suspicion
                  that hung around his character. He passed into the boat, seated himself, and was
                  rapidly swept alongside of the Sparrow Hawk. For a half-hour longer, Sutherland
                  paced the deck, musing upon the singularity of the incidents in which he had been
                  an actor, varying, however, his meditations with an occasional glance at the
                  barque; during this time no visible preparation had been made by the stranger for
                  getting under way; but she swung at her anchor as silently and as motionless as
                  though she had been there moored for eternity. This inaction, however, endured but
                  a little time further, for men were now seen ascending her rigging, and spreading
                  themselves upon all the yards; then the heavy topsails and courses were swayed
                  slowly aloft, and bent to their respective jack-stays; the cable was then
                  shortened in with a deck tackle, and so silently was this manœuvre performed, that
                  an observer would have been at a loss to guess what they were at, unless, indeed,
                  he could perceive her motion through the water, as she neared her anchor by
                  heaving in. The topsails were now sheeted home, the yards mast-headed, the
                  ponderous iron fastening hove up to the bows, and the jib run up to its full
                  extent. When these dispositions were at an end, the barque commenced gliding
                  through the water, in a direction that brought her within a few yards of the
                  Sparrow Hawk. As she passed, Sutherland recognised the tall form of her commander
                  in the mizzen-rigging. His hat was off, and he was waving it towards the Sparrow
                  Hawk. Sutherland sprang upon a carronade, and responded to the salutation.
               "Farewell!" said he; "in thirty-six hours I shall follow you."
               "Thirty-six hours, and a fair breeze will put more than one hundred miles of salt
                  water between us. You must spread out all your canvass if you would overtake La
                  Santa Maria!"
               A parting wave of the hand was then given; the barque swept by, and Sutherland
                  retired to his cabin, venting in his descent more than one imprecation upon the
                  duplicity of the governor.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIV.
               WHEN the time allotted the Sea-King for escape had expired, the Sparrow Hawk's
                  anchor was hove up, and she stood out of the harbour of Havana under a press of
                  canvass. As it was Sutherland's avowed intention to search for her in every port
                  of the West Indies, he shaped his course for the Windward Islands, and touched at
                  them all in succession; but his expedient was ineffective, and the last one of all
                  the group sunk again in the blue waters of the Carribean without his having
                  obtained any tidings of the vessel in question. Dispirited at such ill success, he
                  put his helm up, and again returned to leeward. For three days the weather
                  continued favourable, the breeze blew fresh and fair, and the sky was without a
                  cloud; but the morning of the fourth dawned loweringly upon the ocean; a fine wind
                  had swept the Sparrow Hawk along through the night watches, but with the first
                  indications of dawn it died away and fell a dead calm, and the air became
                  oppressively hot, and difficult of respiration; cloud after cloud, too, piled upon
                  one another, and the entire mass grew blacker and blacker, until night seemed to
                  triumph over the coming day, and again resume her ebon throne in the concave realm
                  above.
               Sutherland came on deck with a countenance unusually anxious. "Mr. Topblock," said
                  he, "give me the trumpet—I fear we've a hurricane brewing about us—the barometer
                  has fallen rapidly within the last half hour, and it still continues to descend."
                  As soon as he finished this remark, he commenced issuing the necessary orders for
                  reducing sail; the topsails were close reefed, and the fore and mizzen afterwards
                  securely furled, the topgallant masts, mizzen topmast, and mizzen topsail yard,
                  were then sent on deck, the mainsail was snugly furled, and the foresail close
                  reefed; the flying jib-boom was also rigged in, the jib hauled down, and the
                  fore-storm staysail set with both sheets trimmed flat aft. While these
                  dispositions were going on aloft, the carpenters on deck were battening down the
                  hatches, and rigging the pump gear; men were setting up the boats' gripes, the
                  quarter-gunners housing and securing the battery, and all hands, in a word,
                  employed in getting the ship ready to buffet for mastery with those awful blasts,
                  that still at times sweep over the Eden-like islands of the Carribees, hurling
                  their smiling towns and villas into terrific ruin, and carrying desolation abroad
                  upon their waters, as if they bore indeed upon their wings the curse of an
                  offended Deity. Still, with untiring alacrity, the crew of the Sparrow Hawk
                  continued their labours; but few orders came from the quarter-deck; every man
                  present knew what was to be done in such an emergency, and each of them sprang to
                  execute whatever service had not been commenced by another. The sky yet continued
                  to darken, and the lightning now gave out the only brightness that guided the work
                  of the mariners, and as its livid rays darted along the deck of the ship, the
                  countenances of all on board glowed with a ghastly hue, and they seemed more as
                  demons then as men. The thunder, which at first was but heard in low growls about
                  the horizon, now seemed to have rolled up to the zenith, and there it commenced
                  crashing in awful and rapid explosions.
               Still it was calm; not a breath of wind stirred abroad, and the anxious mariner
                  elevated his palm in vain to ascertain the direction of the expected wind. The
                  Sparrow Hawk had not moved a yard in advance during the space of an hour, and her
                  only motion was a wild roll as she obeyed the heave of a sea that seemed to
                  respire in fearful suspense as it awaited the approach of the coming storm.
               "Mr. Yarnall, this is terrible!" said Sutherland, turning to his first
                  lieutenant.
               "Terrible, indeed!" replied Yarnall; but in that moment none of his characteristic
                  remarks followed the exclamation.
               "Do you perceive anything that I have left undone in getting the ship snug?"
               "Nothing," responded the first lieutenant.
               The lightning now continued to flash incessantly, the whole heavens were
                  illuminated by one extended sheet of electricity, the sea too seemed an ocean of
                  liquid fire, and the thunder crashed with a violence that caused the Sparrow Hawk
                  to tremble in every timber; peal succeeded peal in quick succession, and each
                  seemed nearer than its precursor, as if a hundred thousand bars of iron had been
                  launched from the highest pinnacle of heaven upon the surface of the world below.
                  It was in truth such a convulsion as the poet in the power of his fancy might have
                  connected with the ejectment of Lucifer from the sacred places of paradise. This
                  was nature's last and mightiest effort: the thunder died suddenly away, the
                  lightning gathered itself within the bosom of the clouds, and partial obscurity
                  again fell upon the bosom of the trembling deep.
               Still no flaw of wind came from the quarters of heaven; the air was hot to
                  suffocation, and the difficulty of respiration seemed to increase more and more,
                  at each, moment; the men fairly gasped for breath, and the perspiration rolled
                  thick and fast from their foreheads.
               "Look!" exclaimed Yarnall, seizing Sutherland's arm with one of those powerful
                  grasps that an excited man is apt to use when directing the attention of another to some object of more than ordinary
                  interest. The latter was for an instant startled by so rude and unceremonious an
                  appeal, but turning to the indicated direction he beheld the clouds lifting
                  themselves rapidly from the horizon, and exposing a sky of a bright brazen tinge
                  beyond; then a flood of sickly light poured in upon the waters, and the air became
                  suddenly as cold as the atmosphere of a high northern latitude. "'Tis coming,"
                  said Sutherland; and he had scarcely time to seize hold of the mizzen rigging,
                  before the hurricane, in all its wrath, was upon them. Instantly the Sparrow Hawk
                  commenced driving through the ocean with a velocity that piled the waters about
                  her bow like a bank of snow, and sent them roaring in foamy furrows astern; the
                  wind howled through the rigging and spars, and so deafening was the chaos, that
                  Heaven's artillery would have been all unheard amidst it.
               Sutherland put the bell of the trumpet close to the quartermaster's car; "Keep her
                  dead before it," shouted he at the top of his voice; the quartermaster nodded
                  assent, and cast his eyes aloft to make the course of the wind-vane.
               The power of the hurricane had kept down the sea, and the motion of the Sparrow
                  Hawk was graceful and easy, although the waters swept by her with a rapidity that
                  was truly fearful; so great indeed was the force of the gale that the fore and
                  main topmasts buckled forward, and threatened at every moment to snap the
                  back-stays that supported them.
               "The foresail and main-topsail cannot stand it much longer," shouted Yarnall.
                  Sutherland acknowledged the truth of the remark with a nod, but he knew it would
                  be useless to attempt handing them, as the united force of the whole crew would be
                  insufficient to clew up either of the sails after the sheets had been started. In
                  another moment the fears of the first lieutenant were all verified; the
                  main-topsail was blown out of the bolt-rope, and whirled away by the force of the
                  tempest, and the foresail burst from its confinement, and lashed and flapped
                  itself to fragments immediately afterwards; but the fore-storm staysail was still
                  entire, as it was so situated as to prevent the gale from acting upon its surface.
                  The speed of the Sparrow Hawk was greatly diminished by the accident; but though
                  she opposed nothing but her naked spars to the wind, she still dashed ahead with
                  terrible rapidity.
               The hurricane was at the very height of its power, and when Sutherland again
                  looked abroad upon the ocean, he saw it covered with foam, so that it appeared
                  more like a vast prairie, after the prevalence of a snow storm, than the wild,
                  unstable world of waters that it really was.
               At this moment an exclamation of surprise burst from his lips, for his gaze fell
                  suddenly upon a ship, not more than half a mile distant, driving like the, Sparrow
                  Hawk, before the hurricane under bare poles. He needed not a second glance to
                  assure him that it was the Sea-King; he knew her well, and a gleam of satisfaction
                  lighted his countenance, as his eyes took in her dark hull and naked spars, for he
                  now thought that nothing short of the treachery of the elements could prevent her
                  from falling into his hands.
               "She shall not escape us this time, Yarnall," said Sutherland; but the lieutenant
                  shook his head with a doubtful signification. "She has her three topsails in snug
                  furls aloft, sir, and we've none but the fore; and as soon as the wind abates a
                  little she'll sheet home and be off."
               "But we can bend ours, Mr. Yarnall."
               "Not with the same breeze that she can spread hers."
               Sutherland in silence acknowledged the truth of his subordinate's remark.
               For two hours longer both ships continued dashing madly through the water, but it
                  was now observed that the hurricane was gradually losing its power; the clouds
                  overhead began to break and separate, and the clear blue of the firmament was in
                  many places visible; the sea too commenced rising as the wind abated, and the
                  Sparrow Hawk pitched and tossed with unwonted violence.
               "Set the foresail, Yarnall, that fellow is ranging rapidly ahead."
               Up flew the topmen; the gaskets were cleared away, the clewlines started, and the
                  sheets hauled home; but scarcely had it been extended a minute when it split from
                  head to foot, and like the foresail lashed itself to fragments.
               Sutherland threw down the trumpet with sheer vexation, for with the exception of
                  the mainsail, which was of little or no use in the present case, there was not a
                  square sail aloft. "Mr. Yarnall," said he, "let the sailmaker get up the new fore
                  and main topsails, and foresail—we'll send them aloft as soon as the weather will
                  permit us."
               These orders were obeyed with accustomed promptitude; the spare canvass was ranged
                  along the deck; but the gale, although it moderated in a great degree, was still
                  too powerful to suffer it to be bent. This gave rise to much uneasiness in the
                  mind of Sutherland, as he feared that the Sea-King would embrace the earliest
                  opportunity of spreading her sails to the breeze; nor was he mistaken, for, on
                  turning to the stranger, he beheld the clews of her main-topsail stretching
                  themselves towards the extremities of the yard, while, at the same time, the
                  foresail fell, bellied out for a moment, and then extended itself to the
                  forecastle; in another instant the inequality of the speed of the two vessels was at once perceptible, for
                  the Sea-King commenced driving ahead at a rate that promised to put her hull down
                  before the expiration of another watch.
               Sutherland's brow grew black with rage, and after muttering a fierce invective
                  through his clenched teeth, he ordered the larboard bow chaser to be cleared away,
                  and a shot to be thrown into her hull; the gun rang upon the breeze, but the ball
                  passed harmlessly over her.
               "She rolls too much to fire with anything like precision," said Yarnall.
               "Yes," replied the commander, "we have no alternative but to permit her
                  escape—this is the third time she has been under our battery with impunity."
               Two hours more passed away, and the sun shone brilliantly from his high place in
                  the heavens; the storm-spirit had vanished, and Peace again smiled upon a scene
                  that, but a little while before, might have led one to imagine that she had
                  quitted it for ever. The Sparrow Hawk was now sweeping through the ocean under a
                  broad spread of canvass, but a wide waste of water intervened between her and the
                  Sea-King, for the dim outline of the latter was just perceptible on the farthest
                  verge of the horizon.
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               IT was evening in Tampico; the air was as balmy as the breath of a cherub, for the
                  richest, and rarest, and sweetest flowers of the earth were sending up their
                  incense to the God of their creation. The full moon looked down from the zenith in
                  all the splendour of unsullied brightness, and the light she showered upon the
                  scene was indeed the illumination of loveliness. Tranquillity, too, allured
                  thither by its enchantment, stretched herself to repose; and happiness, if she
                  ever yet sought a human home, would have fixed it for ever in that valley, for the
                  scene was indeed lovely beyond all; it was as beautiful as a dream.
               And there were two beings who looked out upon its splendour with unusual rapture,
                  for they were lovers, and to the imagination refined by that passion, nature seems
                  ever the most beautiful. None were there save themselves; her soft, fairy-like
                  hand was clasped in his, her head reclined upon him with all the confidence of an
                  artless Spanish girl, and his arm delicately encircled her sylphide form.
                  Montgomery was then happy, happier than he had ever been, and the dreamer forgot
                  his hatred to man, forgot his misfortunes, forgot the past entirely, and thought
                  the world a paradise. But could the veil that enshrouded futurity have been then
                  drawn aside, how different would have been his feelings; it was a blissful hour
                  for him, but it was the last one he was destined to experience; his heart never
                  afterwards beat with the pulse of joy. It grew late; one kiss, and they parted; he
                  sought the river-bank, his boat awaited him, and he was swept to the opposite
                  shore, dreaming a thousand hopes that were but to be blasted in the end.
               When Montgomery awoke on the following morning, he was informed by his servant
                  that an American sloop-of-war was at anchor off the mouth of the river. With a
                  gloomy brow he received the information, for he had in his exile studiously
                  avoided his own countrymen, and more than once, on the arrival of their ships, he
                  was known to quit the sea-board for the interior, until such time as they had
                  departed.
               It was noon, when a barge, gayly decorated, and bearing the flag of the United
                  States at her stern, passed swiftly up the river, and landed at the city of
                  Tampico; and in less than an hour afterwards, Montgomery received a note from the
                  governor, soliciting his company at dinner, and informing him at the same time
                  that he would meet with Captain Sutherland, of his country's naval service.
               
               At that name the cheek of the exile grew ashy pale, and staggering to a seat, for
                  an unconquerable weakness came over him. He summoned Antonio, and bade him saddle
                  his horse immediately; this done, he wrote a reply to the governor, stating that
                  it would be impossible for him to accept his invitation, as business of importance
                  called him at once into the interior. The note being sent, he mounted his steed,
                  and was the next moment gallopping over the plains like a madman.
               Sutherland and Yarnall were well received and hospitably entertained by the
                  governor; every attention was paid them, and every courtesy lavished upon them.
                  The dinner, too, was excellent, and the company all in fine spirits. Doña Carlotta
                  was at first a little saddened, perhaps, that Montgomery was absent; but that soon
                  wore away, and her dark eyes sparkled with their usual lustre, and the smiles of
                  sweetness came again to her lips. More than once she encountered the gaze of
                  Sutherland fixed admiringly upon her, for, with one exception, he thought her the
                  most beautiful creature he had ever seen. Yarnall in the meantime was entertaining
                  the host with a multitude of strange stories, and amongst others he told of an
                  eccentric old uncle who was in the habit of assembling at his table, acquaintances
                  whose names would always afford some ludicrous combination. "I went by
                  invitation," continued Yarnall, "to spend three or four days with him, and on my
                  arrival, he told me that he expected the beasts to dinner. I of course asked for
                  an explanation; but the old gentleman smiled, shook his head, but said nothing.
                  The dinner hour at length came: the guests were all assembled, utter strangers to
                  one another, all of them; my uncle then rose and went through the ceremony of
                  introduction: 'Mr. Lyon,' said he to a person on his right, 'let me make you
                  acquainted with Mr. Lamb; Mr. Lamb, Mr. Hare; Mr. Hare, Mr. Bull, Mr. Hogg; Mr.
                  Yoe, Mr. Buck; Mr. Buck, Mr. Fawn; take your seats, gentlemen.' The guests all
                  were confounded, you may be sure, but my uncle looked as grave as a stoic, and
                  they, one and all, thought it a most marvellous coincidence. Two or three days
                  afterwards, the old gentleman slapped me familiarly on the back, and remarked that
                  we would have the colours to dine. The guests arrived, and my uncle again
                  performed the ceremony of presentation. 'Mr. White,' said he, 'do you know Mr.
                  Green? Mr. Green, Mr. Gray; Mr. Gray, Mr. Black; Mr. Black, Mr. Brown.' Then the
                  old fellow gave what he called a geological entertainment. The visiters were Mr.
                  Hill, Mr. Brooke, Mr. Bush, Mr. Rock, Mr. Mountain, Mr. Forrest, and Mr. Dale.
                  After this he told me that he intended inviting the birds to dine with him; they
                  came, and he introduced them thus; 'Mr. Nightingale, let me present my friend Mr.
                  Wren; Mr. Wren, Mr. Robin; Mr. Robin, Mr. Raven; Mr. Raven, Mr. Hawke; Mr. Hawke,
                  Mr. Swan; Mr. Swan, Mr. Crane; Mr. Crane, Mr. Martin.'"
               After dinner the party adjourned to the piazza, and Carlotta there informed
                  Sutherland that her mother had issued cards of invitation for a bayle that
                  evening, and that he would then have an opportunity of seeing all the beauty of
                  Tampico; "and if the señor chooses," added she, "he can select from amongst them a
                  wife; the señor, I presume, is not married?"
               "No, thank heaven!" replied Sutherland.
               "And why thank heaven?" continued the maiden; "the married state is surely the
                  happiest!"
               "It may be, but indeed were I now married I should regret it."
               "Why, señor?"
               "Because I have seen Doña Carlotta De Silva!"
               "Señor, I am sorry to believe you a flatterer."
               "Then banish your regret, for I assure you that you are in error," said
                  Sutherland.
               "Then, señor, I must thank you for the compliment." The maiden courtesied
                  gracefully, and Sutherland felt half inclined to love her.
               Evening came, and when Yarnall and Sutherland descended to the ball-room, they
                  found the company had all assembled.
               "Heavens! how many beautiful women!" exclaimed the latter, paying a just tribute
                  to the loveliness of the fairy-like creatures that crowded the apartment;
                  "Yarnall, did you ever behold such an assemblage of enchantresses?" But that
                  gentleman was not an admirer of the sex; and muttering a complimentary negative,
                  he moved over and stationed his personage beside a large punchbowl that was reared
                  upon a pedestal in one of the anterooms.
               "So, señor Captain, you have come at last," said Carlotta, playfully, "is it the
                  custom in your country to delay your appearance until so late an hour?"
               "A hundred thousand apologies, my fair friend—but really my time has passed so
                  pleasantly since I have been here, that I am at a loss to keep account of the
                  hours."
               "A lame excuse, señor, but I suppose I must admit it; and now tell me what opinion
                  you have formed of the ladies of Tampico."
               "That they are the most beautiful, the most graceful, and the most captivating
                  creatures beneath the sun; and that they are better suited to the bowers of
                  Paradise than the vales of Mexico!"
               "Señor, you are extravagant."
               "Then 'tis the witchery of your sex that has made me so."
               "O, you are incorrigible!" exclaimed Carlotta. "But hark! the music has commenced,
                  and I believe I have promised you this cotillion."
               
               In a moment the sets were formed, and then Sutherland had an opportunity of
                  observing the superior gracefulness of his fair partner. There was an ease in all
                  her movements that he had never seen surpassed; and more than one involuntary
                  tribute of admiration burst from his lips as he gazed upon her fairy form, gliding
                  through the mazes of the dance.
               After the cotillion was ended, Carlotta proposed that they should search for Mr.
                  Yarnall. The gentleman was found after some little difficulty; but found with a
                  punch-ladle in his hand, in earnest conversation with a fat officer of the
                  governor's suite, who seemed to devour every word that he uttered with an
                  eagerness that at once convinced Sutherland and his fair companion that the
                  lieutenant was recounting some extraordinary transaction.
               "We'll not interrupt them," said Carlotta, and they returned to the dancing
                  room.
               It was gray dawn when the dancing ceased; the guests retired, and Sutherland slept
                  a few hours away in dreams of the beautiful Carlotta. When he awoke, he heard the
                  winds howling in their wrath, and through the casement he saw the sky black with
                  heavy masses of dense clouds. On descending, he was informed by the governor that
                  the Sparrow Hawk had slipped and put to sea. One or two exclamations of regret
                  escaped him, but smiling at length, he remarked that he supposed there was no
                  alternative but to wait until she should return.
               The city of Tampico does not afford the protection of a harbour to large vessels;
                  small coasters may cross the bar and anchor in the river, but ships of any size
                  are obliged to come-to in the open roadstead, where they are completely exposed to
                  the fury of the Northers; these winds blow with inordinate violence, and as they
                  give no notice of their approach, but come upon you, to use a nautical phrase,
                  "butt and foremast," no time is left to heave up the anchor, and ships are
                  compelled to slip their cables, and stand out into the gulf until the gale dies
                  away; such was now the case of the Sparrow Hawk.
               "And so, señor captain, you do not leave us as early as you anticipated?" said
                  Carlotta, when she again met with Sutherland.
               "Señorita, no; the elements have conceded to me a pleasure that my duty would have
                  prevented me from enjoying."
               "Blessed be the norther!" playfully ejaculated the maiden.
               "Amen!" responded Sutherland.
               "You forgot to add, with all your heart, señor captain."
               "With all—"
               "Stop, señor," said Carlotta, interrupting him with as sweet a smile as ever woke
                  to light and love upon the lips of woman, "you've already many peccadilloes for
                  the next confessional—don't, I pray you, increase them."
               "Nay, señorita, I must protest against your decision. You would make of me a most
                  confirmed sinner."
               "Not at all, señor; on the other hand, if it were not beyond all human agency, I
                  would create you a saint, and give you a fitting place in the calendar."
               "Methinks, Carlotta, it were easier to transform you into an angel."
               "Or a mermaid!" continued the maiden, glancing at him archly through the long
                  black silken fringes that shaded her beautiful eyes.
               When Sutherland learned that the lovely daughter of his host was betrothed, a pang
                  of regret agitated him for a moment, although he had not previously wished for
                  more than her friendship. But it is always thus with man; there is a selfishness
                  in his composition that never fails to disturb him, when any object of superior
                  loveliness is bestowed upon another, even though his own hopes were centered in a
                  different quarter.
               Now that an insuperable barrier was raised between their affections, he felt that
                  he really loved her, and acknowledged with a sigh the necessity of conquering his
                  feelings, and demeaning himself towards her with even more formality than he had
                  hitherto used. The remembrance of Anna Hamilton, although his love for her was a
                  passion all blasted in its hopes, had heretofore prevented him from cherishing the
                  heart's fondness for woman; but, in the present instance, the spell was broken;
                  for what revolutions will not time, absence, and man's waywardness create?
               Seven days passed away, the storm still raged, and the Sparrow Hawk was yet
                  buffeting the angry billows of the Mexican Gulf.
               Sutherland's endeavours to assume towards Carlotta an air of courtesy, unmixed
                  with feelings that should appear as anything but those of friendship, were a total
                  failure; not a sentence he spoke but let fall some golden grain of affection; and,
                  though he strove to hide the sentiments that took up their abode in his bosom, and
                  was himself ignorant when they escaped him, she perceived them at once; for what
                  is nicer than the perception of a woman, when she covets the admiration of the man
                  she loves? and that she did love Sutherland was a truth she could no longer save
                  herself from acknowledging.
               Reader, if you are tempted to exclaim, "O, fickleness, thy name is woman!"
                  recollect that the affection Carlotta once nourished for Montgomery was of a far
                  different nature from the passion she now cherished towards Sutherland. The first
                  was engendered by her admiration of his genius, and was more a feeling of profound
                  respect, and blended awe, than of voluntary love. It was his brilliant attributes
                  that dazzled and captivated her young
                  and ardent imagination. But Sutherland she loved for himself alone; and would have
                  loved if fortune had but ranked him with the meanest peasant of her native
                  land.
               Carlotta grew melancholy, but her parents ascribed it solely to the absence of De
                  Hautville, and Sutherland also attributed it to the like cause. At times her
                  mother would essay to cheer her, with the assurance that her lover would soon
                  return. But such words, instead of whispering comfort to her heart, only agitated
                  her the more. Sutherland, too, became every day more and more pensive. A passion
                  that he knew he must conquer was consuming him; he felt himself in honour bound to
                  secrete it, and he more than once wished that the Sparrow Hawk would return, that
                  he might fly the scene of his enchantment. But she, poor girl, had the severest
                  pangs to suffer. She adored Sutherland, but she was the promised wife of De
                  Hautville. Her own lips had sealed the contract, her parents had approved it, and
                  she shuddered in tears as she felt that she must give her hand to one, while her
                  heart was unalterably fixed upon another. This was indeed heart-rending to the
                  sensibilities of Carlotta, and she felt it the more because she was well aware
                  that Sutherland was profoundly attached to her.
               At length the norther died away, and in a few days afterwards the Sparrow Hawk was
                  telegraphed off the mouth of the river. Carlotta's heart sank within her when she
                  received the information, and the feelings of Sutherland were perhaps as
                  agitating.
               The hour of separation came. Sutherland took leave of the governor's wife and her
                  lord with a calmness that was well affected; but when he pressed the small white
                  hand of Carlotta, his voice trembled, and he could scarcely master the weakness
                  that threatened to overpower him. She was as pale as death, for one moment, but
                  womanly pride and a sense of duty sustained her, and armed her with a firmness,
                  the exercise of which blinded Sutherland to her love, but nearly broke her own
                  heart.
               He entered his barge, and threw himself recklessly in the stern-sheets; she was
                  launched from the shore, and the next moment glided swiftly down the transparent
                  river; once he looked back, a kerchief was waved from the casement of Carlotta's
                  apartment; in agony he returned the salutation, and when a bend in the river shut
                  out the city of Tampico, he folded his arms, and with contracted brows resigned
                  himself to lonely and embittering reflections.
               Yarnall, perceiving the melancholy mood of his commander, suppressed his
                  garrulity, fell fast asleep, nor waked again, until the cry of "in bows!" roused
                  him with the intimation that he was alongside of the Sparrow Hawk.
               Sutherland and his first lieutenant ascended the ship's side amidst the smiles and
                  gratulations of the crew. The former paused but a brief space on deck, and then
                  descended to the cabin; but Yarnall had a thousand stories to relate, and the
                  patience of poor Topblock was again subjected to the ordeal. At length the bell
                  struck seven, much to his alleviation;-for he knew that Yarnall never permitted
                  that time to pass without commemorating its transit with a whiskey-toddy. The
                  first lieutenant stopped short in his promenade, cast his eyes aloft for a moment,
                  and after informing his companion that the ship would sail the next morning for
                  Key West, sought his own apartment, and commenced the concoction of his favourite
                  beverage.
               For hours together, the commander of the Sparrow Hawk paced the limits of his
                  cabin, in sadness and thoughtfulness. The sorrows that Time had partially pent up
                  again burst their flood-gate, and the miseries of other days returned fresh and
                  full upon him. The past was dark enough; and the future was even as dreary, for
                  not a single ray of hope glittered in its gloomy vista to cheer him onward. His
                  first affection had been blighted in its desires, and now the only being upon whom
                  he could bestow his hand and heart, was the destined bride of another. Indeed, so
                  complete a complication of disappointments and misfortunes had surrounded him,
                  that he knew it impossible that he could ever again enjoy tranquillity in life,
                  and in the consciousness of this he looked upon happiness as he did upon the star
                  of the evening: a thing beautiful and bright, but far, far off—that might be
                  worshipped, but that never could be wooed.
               The day passed away; the sun sank behind the blue mountains of Mexico, and night
                  flung her spangled curtains over and around the scene. Sutherland was leaning
                  pensively upon the taffrail, Mr. Yarnall was traversing the quarter-deck, and the
                  crew were assembled upon the forecastle, whiling away the time with the good old
                  songs and stories that still constitute the chief shipboard pastime of poor Jack.
                  Old songs and old stories, because your thorough-bred tar despises everything like
                  innovation in either; and the ditties and ballads that resounded through the decks
                  of Old England's oaken castles, perhaps fifty years before, were now chanted from
                  the forecastle of the Sparrow Hawk, with all their original beauty and pathos, not
                  deteriorating one iota from their frequency of repetition, and awaking as much
                  feeling and interest in the weather-beaten breast of the worn-out mariner, as when
                  they first broke upon his ear. As many of our readers may not have had the good
                  fortune to have heard what is called a sea-song, we subjoin a verse extracted from
                  one which their universal suffrage had rendered the most popular. 
                     
                        "It's farewell and adieu to ye, Spanish ladies,
                        It's farewell and adieu to ye, ladies of Spain;
                        
                        For we've received orders to set sail from Cadiz,
                        In hopes that short time we may see you again."
                     
                  
               
               Sometimes a musical greenhorn intrudes something of a more modern and fashionable
                  stamp; but as the fluctuations of a bravura, or the trills and cadences of an
                  opera, conveys about as much music to the soul of the sailor as the rattling and
                  clanking of a chain-cable, this style of execution is soon suppressed; and the
                  freshman himself, first from self-defence, and afterwards from a sort of
                  unaccountable taste, gradually forsakes the compositions of Auber, Rossini,
                  Bellini, and Von Weber, for the more elegant harmonies of "Billy Taylor," "Young
                  Bung-your-eye," and "The Gosport Tragedy."
               This evening the crew were unusually gay; jests and repartees, intermingled with
                  snatches of song and bursts of laughter, were bandied from one to another, and
                  Jack seemed to forget the past and the future in the enjoyment of the present. In
                  a little while the confusion was silenced, and a clear voice accompanied the
                  following verses with an air of peculiar sweetness and simplicity. It is
                  unnecessary to add that the performer was a tyro upon the deep. 
                     
                        A SON of the ocean stood gazing on high,
                        Where the tall tap'ring spars stretched away to the sky,
                        And the wide-spreading sail caught the breath of the breeze,
                        That so often had fanned her along the deep seas;
                        Then his full bosom heaved, and his eye then grew bright,
                        For his country's gay pennant there greeted his sight,
                        With its stripes of the morn, and its stars of the night,
                        An Iris in peace, but a meteor in fight;
                        And he smiled as he thought how in victory's pride
                        That banner triumphant was borne o'er the tide;
                        Though war darted thunders along the free air,
                        To daunt the proud heroes that hoisted it there!
                     
                     
                        Still dashed the ship on, and the swift winds were free,
                        And clear was the sky, and calm was the sea;
                        When "Oh!" cried the sailor, in transports of bliss,
                        "What object in life is more lovely than this?
                        The gaudiest warbler that sails through the air,
                        Spreads never such pinions as those which fly there;
                        And where is the fish in the fathomless sea,
                        That sweeps through its waters so graceful and free?
                        No steed of the desert, no light-limbed gazelle,
                        No bird of the forest, no beast of the dell,
                        Ever gladdened the eye, like a ship under sail,
                        As she bows to the wave, or she bends to the gale!
                     
                     
                        "There's nothing," he said, "from the Pole's icy chain,
                        To the shores where the Ganges rolls on to the main,
                        There's nothing," he said, "that I've ever yet seen,
                        More lovely in aspect, more graceful in mien;
                        There's nothing," he said—but e'en as he spoke,
                        A fairy-like touch the fond dreamer awoke;
                        He turned, and a pair of bright eyes met his own,
                        That sparkled with love, yet reprovingly shone;
                        And he smiled a sweet smile, as he caught to his breast
                        His own dearest Mary, the girl he loved best;
                        "O forgive me," he cried, and he sank on his knee,
                        "I was wrong, but oh, never unfaithful to thee!
                        Forgive me this once, and I promise no more
                        To forget, for a moment, the girl I adore!"
                     
                  
               
               As the last words died away in cadence upon the air, Sutherland, whose attention
                  had been riveted to the song, heaved a deep sigh and quitted the deck.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVI.
               THE night wore placidly on; the noises were hushed upon the forecastle, and no
                  sound but the measured tread of the sentinel broke the stillness that prevailed
                  throughout the decks of the Sparrow Hawk. Sutherland was yet awake; he seldom
                  retired before one or two bells in the middle watch, and now he was not in a state
                  of mind to obtain repose, how much soever he might covet it. After traversing his
                  apartment until he had fatigued himself with the exercise, he threw himself upon
                  the sofa, and was about to open the pages of a favourite author, when his
                  attention was suddenly arrested by the quartermaster's hoarse summons of "Boat
                  ahoy!" The response, whatever it might have been, was uttered too faintly to reach
                  his ears; but the rattle of oars, in a moment or two afterwards, convinced him
                  that the boat had been permitted to come alongside. Whilst he yet awaited the
                  official report of the officer on deck, the door was opened, and he was informed
                  by the quartermaster that two persons had come off from the shore, and that one of
                  them desired to speak with him.
               "Show him in, Jeer," returned Sutherland. The quartermaster withdrew, and the
                  stranger entered the apartment, but paused, motionless, within a pace of the
                  threshold. The light burned but dimly in the cabin lamp, and the features of the
                  new comer were besides so effectually screened by the broad brim of a Spanish hat,
                  that Sutherland obtained but an imperfect view of his countenance; but he saw
                  enough to convince him that he was both youthful and beautiful.
               His dress, though tastefully fitted and gaudily decorated with trimmings of
                  crimson and silver, was but the attire of a mountaineer; but the feminine delicacy
                  of his form, the exquisite whiteness of his little hand, and the smallness of his
                  foot, ill accorded with the wild and perilous pursuits of that roving tribe; and
                  Sutherland was at once convinced that the habiliments of the person before him
                  were chiefly adopted for the purpose of disguise.
               The commander of the Sparrow Hawk was still upon his feet, but the stranger had
                  not yet put aside his sombrero; and though he had been twice requested to seat
                  himself, he returned not a syllable in reply, but stood with downcast eyes and
                  clasped hands, in an attitude that might be one of bashfulness or
                  supplication.
               The singularity of the stranger's conduct at first created no other sensation in
                  the breast of Sutherland than that of surprise; but his continued silence, and
                  apparent neglect of everything like courtesy, at length brought the angry spot to
                  the commander's check.
               "If you have business with me," said he, and his voice sufficiently indicated his
                  displeasure, although he wished it otherwise, "I am awaiting your leisure to make
                  it known!"
               The new-comer said not a word, but the vexation of Sutherland was changed to
                  astonishment; for a sob, that was heart-breaking, burst from the bosom of the
                  addressed, and for the first time Sutherland observed that the youth had been
                  weeping. Still more surprised at this sudden ebullition of feeling, and finding
                  his own heart touched by sympathy for the grief of his visiter, he advanced for
                  the purpose of cheering him, but stopped short, as a wild and involuntary thought
                  flashed upon his mind. He looked again upon the form of the stranger, and his
                  examination was that of one who endeavours to recognise and identify objects which
                  he had seen and known before. He put his hand upon the other's arm, and he felt
                  that the stranger trembled in every limb, and shrank like the sensitive plant from
                  his touch.
               "Nay, fear nothing," said Sutherland, in a voice that was mild as it was
                  respectful; "whoever you may be, you are safe whilst here; and if it is your wish
                  to remain unknown, I shall make no attempt to penetrate your disguise."
               But scarcely had he finished when the sombrero fell from the visiter's head and
                  disclosed the beautiful features of Carlotta. The maiden's cheek burnt with the
                  glow of shame; and, screening her face with her small white hands, she wept on,
                  her bosom heaving with anguish, and the tears gushing through her alabaster
                  fingers, like diamond dew-drops along the spotless stem of the snowy jessamine.
                  Sutherland, in his astonishment, saw not, or understood not the flush of modesty
                  that overspread her countenance; he had suspected that the new-comer was of the
                  opposite sex; but when she proved to be his loved Carlotta, he was completely
                  astounded, and for a moment confused in all his faculties.
               "My God!" exclaimed he; "Doña Carlotta, has anything happened to your father?"
               There was a silence of a moment before the maiden replied.
               "Señor, no."
               "Your mother—" exclaimed he, still mistaking the cause of her grief.
               "Is well, señor."
               "What then——"but he stopped short, for the truth came upon him like a blessing
                  from Paradise, and he felt ashamed of himself for not having discovered it at
                  first. "Then, sweet Carlotta," resumed he, "dry up those tears; for I am sure you
                     have no cause for this unhappiness.
                  Nay, nay, why give yourself so much pain, Carlotta, when there exists not the
                  shadow of a reason for it? Come now, seat yourself here, and smile away those
                  tears, whose source, my dear Carlotta, would be about as difficult to discover as
                  the prime fountains of the Nile."
               But the maiden, though she suffered herself to be conducted to the sofa, made not
                  an effort to suppress her sorrow.
               "Carlotta, dearest Carlotta! why do you indulge in this unwarrantable
                  affliction?"
               "Señor, I have too much cause for it!" responded she. "I have deceived my father
                  and mother—I have performed that which every maiden should blush to think of, and
                  have forfeited my own self respect for ever. And you, señor captain, how will you
                  esteem the woman who forgets the delicacy of her sex, defies the opinions of those
                  that have grown up with her, and throws aside the garb of modesty, in wild
                  obedience to a passion which she is in honour and in duty bound to suppress?"
               "Carlotta," said Sutherland, and his voice was the voice of one who is about to
                  utter a grave and impressive truth—it was full of tenderness—it was melodious with
                  affection—and there was in it a feature of deep-toned sincerity that caused the
                  maiden to forget her grief that she might gather every word that fell from his
                  lips—"if for one moment you suppose that my esteem for you is lessened in the
                  least, you most egregiously deceive yourself. But why should I designate my
                  feelings towards you by the cold appellation of esteem, when that sentiment
                  scarcely existed in my breast before it gave way to a far more endearing passion?
                  Yes, Carlotta, I loved you! dearly, devotedly, madly loved you! but I was told you
                  were the promised of another—I was told your affection had been long bestowed upon
                  him—that your parents approved the union, that your relatives desired it; and
                  under these circumstances I was bound to conceal a passion that I thought utterly
                  hopeless. Nor, Carlotta, did I then presume to suppose that a being so
                  surpassingly beautiful as yourself ever gave other than a thought of friendship to
                  me. I dared not aspire to the bliss of being loved by such a one: but now,
                  Carlotta, I may hope that I was then in error; speak, dearest, may I not?"
               "Señor, you were!"
               "Sweet Carlotta! those words have made me happy beyond all the hopes I ever yet
                  indulged. Yes! were the wild and romantic fancies of my boyhood realized at this
                  moment; or were the graver expectations of manhood all verified, I could not have
                  been more blessed than I am now!"
               Sutherland paused, and a smile of irresistible enchantment played upon the
                  maiden's lips; her tears ceased to flow, and her dark eyes sparkled with a
                  brightness more beautiful than the sunshine that follows the showers of April. He
                  took her little hand in his own, and after gazing for a moment in fondness upon
                  her beauteous brow, he again resumed the conversation. He told her of his hopes,
                  and of his fears; he described the agony he suffered, when he was swept by the
                  walls where she dwelt; he recounted the many bitter reflections that followed; he
                  spoke of the misery that had been his throughout the whole of that protracted day;
                  he assured her, again and again, of his devotion, and the assurance was made in
                  all the beauty and all the poetry of the language of the east. To the outpourings
                  of his affection the lovely girl listened with downcast eyes and a beating heart;
                  the smile of happy triumph was on her lips, but the glow of modesty suffused her
                  cheeks, and she dared not raise her dark eyes to encounter his.
               Still Sutherland pursued the conversation. Love had made him eloquent and happy.
                  The past he no longer reverted to in bitterness; the present he dwelt upon in
                  terms of joy; and the future he painted with the brightest hues that gild the
                  memory of our forfeited Eden. To all this Carlotta listened with rapture. The
                  beautiful girl was lost to everything in the dreamy bliss of that moment; but when
                  her thoughts wandered back, as that spell was broken, a change came over her
                  features, and a deep, deep sigh escaped her bosom. Sutherland marked the
                  transition, and inquired its cause; and it was then that, with a trembling voice,
                  she reminded him of her engagement to De Hautville.
               "Sweet Carlotta," said Sutherland, "let not one thought of that for a moment
                  disturb you. The promise you gave him was made under different feelings from those
                  you now entertain; and if you could not become his wife without a sacrifice of
                  your happiness, you are not in duty bound to fulfil the engagement. De Hautville
                  himself, if he is a man of honour, under these circumstances, would absolve you
                  from its consummation."
               "But my parents, señor; my dear, dear, indulgent parents, what will they think of
                  my faithlessness?" and tears again sparkled in her beautiful eyes.
               "Sweetest Carlotta, what can they think?"
               "Oh! señor, you know not how dear Don Juan is to them!"
               "But, my Carlotta, is not your happiness still dearer? Would they shower down
                  misery on the head of their own child, to gratify the desire of a stranger? Would
                  they scatter the pathway of the sole daughter of their love with thorns, that
                  another might gather the roses?"
               "Oh! no, no, señor, no," answered the maiden, with mournful emphasis, "they have
                  ever been kind and gracious to me; they would compel me to nothing that I was
                  averse to. My welfare is dearer to them than life; and my whims, capricious as
                  they have too often been, were never answered with a denial, or chilled by their reproof. But oh! señor," and a
                  shade of repentance settled upon her brow, "how have I requited all their
                  goodness! how have I repaid their tender anxieties, their watchfulness, and their
                  affection! Señor, I am an ungrateful child! May our holy mother forgive my
                  errors!"
               "No, Carlotta," said Sutherland, "it is not in your nature to be ungrateful;" and
                  he stooped down and printed a kiss upon her fair forehead—a kiss of profound
                  respect and love. "Listen, Carlotta! to-morrow I shall wait upon your father, and
                  demand your hand of him in marriage. I will tell him of your altered feelings, and
                  my own devotion, and I am sure, Carlotta, that he will not withhold his consent.
                  He loves his beautiful daughter too much to reject my suit. He could not surely do
                  it."
               "He will not, señor," murmured she softly; for the words of Sutherland had filled
                  her with joy, and a new and a pleasing hope arose in her mind; a hope that
                  brightened her eyes with pleasure, lavished smiles upon her lips, and brought such
                  beauty to her features, that he stood for one moment enchanted, and almost
                  irresistibly impelled to fall down and worship her. Happy indeed were the emotions
                  of that fair girl. She had clandestinely quitted her paternal roof, to throw
                  herself at the feet of a man she adored. Father, mother, home, friends and all,
                  she forsook for his sake. A fair name she jeoparded, and that, too, when she knew
                  not how he would receive her. Many, many clouds were before her, but these had all
                  been driven away. The star of hope was bright in her path, and she was as blessed
                  as an angel in the sunshine of Paradise.
               "Then, señor," said Carlotta, banishing the dream she had for a moment indulged,
                  "I will return at once to Tampico."
               "Certainly," replied Sutherland; "and one of my fastest boats shall take the place
                  of yours, and convey you thither; and I, myself, will accompany you."
               "May our gracious Saviour protect you, señor mio," ejaculated the beautiful girl,
                  as she looked up with such love and witchery in her glance, that Sutherland forgot
                  the forbearance he had generously resolved to exercise towards her; and throwing
                  his arms about her waist, kissed the pretty lips that gave forth so pious and
                  affectionate an exclamation. It was at this moment that a knock from without
                  summoned the commander to the cabin door; and he was informed by the
                  quarter-master that the wind had come out from the north, and there was every
                  appearance of a blow. The check of Carlotta grew pale at this announcement; but
                  Sutherland partially quieted her apprehensions by assuring her there was little
                  danger of a gale, as the fury of the elements must have been all exhausted in the
                  storm that ceased but three or four days before. Excusing himself for a moment, he
                  then ascended to the deck; but the never-failing indications of a norther soon
                  convinced him that he was mistaken. A current of cool air blew steadily from the
                  quarter whence they arise; and the haze that always accompanies their advent had
                  lifted over the land and shut out the polar star; the spars and the guns were wet
                  with the dews that precede them; and all the minor signs that foretell their
                  approach were abroad in the heavens. He saw at once that it would be impossible
                  for a boat to reach the shore before the full force of the gale would be felt on
                  the waters; and turning to the officer of the deck, he commanded him to have all
                  hands called to heave up the anchor.
               The situation of Carlotta now recurred to Sutherland with heartfelt regret. To
                  return to the shore was impossible; no boat could live through the surf on the
                  bar, if the breeze was at all fresh; and as there was every probability of its
                  blowing a gale before the lapse of another quarter of an hour, he saw no
                  alternative she could adopt but to remain on board until the storm had again
                  subsided. But then, when he reflected upon the distress this measure would subject
                  her to—threatening as the appearances around—he was strongly inclined to attempt
                  the passage.
               "Poor girl!" said he, "what will be her feelings? Young, lovely, and inexperienced
                  as she is, unattended by any one of her own sex, and wearing the apparel that
                  belongs to the other, tossed about by a boisterous sea, and limited to the
                  contracted confines of a rude ship; separated from her parents, too, whilst they
                  must remain a prey to the most torturing anxieties on her account. And how can I
                  tell her that it is impossible to return? Will she not believe that I am deceiving
                  her? will she not suspect the fairness of my intentions? will she not imagine that
                  I am taking an undue advantage of the helplessness of her situation?" And to be an
                  object of suspicion to Carlotta! The thought was maddening; and striding towards
                  the officer of the deck, he was about to command him to hoist out the first
                  cutter, when a cooler and a fresher current of air warned him to desist from an
                  enterprise that desperation dare not justify. "There is no resource left her but
                  to stay," muttered he, with a sigh; and casting his eyes around the darkening
                  heavens, he again descended to the cabin. Carlotta, pale and agitated, was seated
                  upon the sofa; but Sutherland stopped short, for she was not alone; another,
                  similarly habited with herself, stood beside her.
               "It is only Juanna, señor," murmured the maiden, when she perceived the
                  commander's uncertainty; for he stood with his hand upon the latch of the door, as
                  if he doubted the propriety of his intrusion. Sutherland entered, but there was
                  care and anxiety upon his brow, and Carlotta read in its gloom a full confirmation
                  of her fears. With faltering accents, she inquired if he thought there would be
                  another storm, and before he could
                  reply, the shrill whistle of the boatswain, accompanied with the hoarse cry of
                  "All hands, up anchor!" anticipated the response.
               Carlotta's heart sank with despair. "Ah!" said she, "I thought it would be thus!
                  But, señor, there may be yet time for a boat to gain the shore!"
               Sutherland shook his head mournfully. "Nay, Carlotta, the fury of the tempest will
                  be upon us in less than ten minutes!—the attempt would involve certain
                  destruction!"
               As he finished, an additional shade of grief passed over the features of the
                  maiden; and, leaning upon the shoulder of her attendant, she gave way to a flood
                  of tears. For one moment her lover stood regarding her with feelings of distress
                  as acute as those that were rending her own heart-strings, and then seating
                  himself beside her, he took her hand in his own, and endeavoured, by every
                  argument, to console her; there was nothing he left unsaid that might comfort her.
                  There was no hope he did not whisper; there was no fear he did not essay to
                  eradicate. For a long time the maiden wept on in silence; but at length
                  Sutherland's extreme earnestness, and his apparent uneasiness at her sorrow,
                  called upon her to assume a calmness, though it might be unfelt; and turning to
                  him with a smile that was even more fascinating for being born in tears, she said,
                  "Señor, since this ill luck cannot be remedied, I will e'en become a philosopher,
                  and make an effort to forget it. On the morrow you will find me in better spirits,
                  perhaps as gay, indeed, as the butterfly!"
               "Sweetest Carlotta, your words have made me very happy," replied Sutherland, "but
                  I must still hope that the sunshine of content will brighten your reflections long
                  before the dawn of the morning illuminates the cast. At this moment I would give a
                  universe to see you as joyful as I myself have known you to be!"
               "Ah, señor," replied she, and her voice was as sweet as the notes of the
                  nightingale, "you cannot expect me to change from extreme to extreme in the space
                  of a moment. When the storm is done, the sea requires time to lull itself into
                  repose; and when its waters are unruffled, the first sweep of the tempest scarcely
                  agitates them. But I am detaining you, when your presence is required elsewhere.
                  Good-night, señor,—may our Holy Father preserve you in his most gracious
                  favour!"
               The lover pressed her small white hand in his own, and kissing it with all the
                  homage of devotion and gratitude, left the apartment to superintend the sterner
                  duties of the deck.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVII.
               WHEN the commander of the Sparrow Hawk emerged from the companion way, he found
                  that the three topsails had been set double-reefed, and that the crew had been
                  sent to the capstern bars, and were heaving up, to the lively tune of "Off she
                  goes," Mr. Yarnall ever and anon accompanying the shrill notes of the fife, with
                  the accustomed "walk away, my boys," "run him up, my hearties," "a few more heaves
                  and he's all your own," "there you have him."
               "The anchor's a-weigh, sir!" shouted Mr. Topblock, from the forecastle. "Very
                  well, sir!" responded the first lieutenant. "Quartermaster, put your helm
                  hard-a-starboard! hoist away the jib, there, for'ad!" and then the gallant vessel
                  fell off, with her head towards the open sea, as if indeed she understood the
                  wishes of the master spirits that guided her along the treacherous waters.
               "She's off," said Mr. Yarnall, after the head yards had been braced sharp up, and
                  the bowline hauled well out.
               "And in good season, too," continued Sutherland; "for here it comes, stirring up
                  the spray as the blasts of Arabia bear on the sands of the desert."
               Yarnall looked aloft, to see that the weather-braces were well taughtened. "We are
                  ready for it," said he; and as he spoke, the full force of the norther burst upon
                  the distended canvass; then the tall spars of the Sparrow Hawk inclined to
                  leeward, until the lower yard arms nearly kissed the water; and for an instant she
                  maintained that recumbent position, as though she feared to oppose her wings to
                  the strength of the tempest. But it was only for an instant, and before either
                  Sutherland or Yarnall spake again, she pointed her slim royal masts higher in the
                  heavens, and commenced buffeting the mad element she had already mastered in a
                  thousand strifes.
               It was the wish of Sutherland that his officers and crew should remain in
                  ignorance of the identity of the passengers with Carlotta and her attendant; but
                  as Yarnall was well known to both of them, he was in doubt whether or not he
                  should inform him of the whole truth of the matter. He knew that every confidence
                  might safely be intrusted to the first lieutenant, and he was well aware that
                  there were many chances of his detection did he attempt to mislead him; but again,
                  on the other hand, the reputation of Carlotta was so dear to him, that upon
                  further reflection he resolved to say nothing upon the subject. He could not
                     bear the idea of having the
                  slightest suspicion of guilt attached to the character of the woman he loved, and
                  he concluded that by proper management he could prevent their recognition by all
                  on board, not even excepting Yarnall himself.
               "We had better give her the courses," resumed the first lieutenant; "she's making
                  too much lee-way; and should the wind chop round more to the eastard, we'll have
                  the devil's own work to claw off the shore."
               "Board the fore and main-tacks!" replied Sutherland; and in another moment two
                  broad sheets of canvass were added to the sails that had already been spread along
                  the yards.
               "She staggers through it like an overladen jackass along the defiles of the Sierra
                  Morena," ejaculated the first lieutenant. "The sea is getting up, too, and I
                  shouldn't wonder if we had a rough night of it. By the Lord! how it blackens to
                  win'ard; depend upon it, we'll be under much shorter sail by daylight."
               But the thoughts of Sutherland were now elsewhere, and he made no reply to his
                  subordinate's remark.
               "Mr. Yarnall," said he, at length, starting from a revery he had indulged for some
                  moments; "you have a spare state room in your apartment, I believe?"
               "We have, sir."
               "Then, as I have given up mine to the passengers, I will be obliged to you for the
                  use of it until such time as they quit the ship."
               "Sir, it is at your disposal, and we shall be most happy of your company. You will
                  of course mess in the cabin?"
               "No, sir," returned Sutherland; "the strangers would be private, and I am not
                  disposed to interrupt their seclusion; you will see that their wishes on this
                  subject are not thwarted. They must not be liable to the slightest intrusion
                  whilst they may remain on board."
               Yarnall bowed in reply, and the commander, after scanning well the appearances of
                  the weather, descended to the ward-room.
               "The strangers would be private," muttered the officer of the deck; and, for the
                  first time during the evening, that gentleman commenced a series of reflections
                  upon the probable cause of their coming on board. But from this spirit of inquiry
                  he was quickly aroused by the increasing heaviness of the weather. The sky had
                  assumed a pitchy darkness, and the phosphorescent sparkling of the water seemed to
                  render its blackness more visible; the wind was gradually gathering strength, and
                  the sea had risen to the full tide of its swell. Still the Sparrow Hawk continued
                  plunging and driving through it; at one moment sinking in its boiling depths, as
                  if she was about to succumb to its mastery in despair, but rising in the next, and
                  shaking the spray from her frowning sides, as if she spurned the terrors and the
                  trammels of the angry element.
               As it was essential to the safety of the ship that as much canvass should be
                  spread as she could possibly bear, the first lieutenant refrained from shortening
                  sail, until the force of the gale had so augmented that it was dangerous to
                  procrastinate the event any further; he then clewed down and took the third reef
                  in the fore and main-topsails, close-reefed the mizzen, and reefed the courses,
                  hauled down the jib, and run up the fore-topmast staysail; the topgallant yards
                  were then sent on deck, the topgallant masts housed, and the flying jib-boom
                  rigged in, the battery secured, the gratings and tarpaulins put on, and everything
                  prepared for defence against the powers of the tempest.
               At eight bells the other watch was called, and shortly afterwards Mr. Topblock
                  emerged from the wardroom hatch to relieve the deck.
               "Glad to see you, Mr. T.," said Yarnall, transferring the trumpet, and abdicating
                  his authority with an amiability and a willingness that not even Charles the Fifth
                  could have emulated with anything like success.
               "Ugly night," responded Topblock, whose thoughts were dwelling upon the
                  inconvenience of keeping a mid-watch in such disagreeable weather.
               "Very," replied Yarnall; "very ugly night;" and to escape its unpleasantness he
                  quitted the deck, drank a rum-toddy, retired to his cot, and slept as soundly as
                  if the winds of heaven and the waves of the ocean sympathized with his
                  slumbers.
               Daylight came, but brought with it no cessation of the storm; and by eight o'clock
                  Sutherland ordered the ship to be hove-to under her close-reefed main-topsail,
                  fore storm staysail, and storm mizzen.
               Dull, cheerless, and disagreeable was the prospect. The sea had lost its azure
                  beauty, and the music of its waters was changed to the terrific roaring of the
                  tempest; dark clouds shut out the beautiful firmament, and not one spot of blue
                  greeted the eye from the horizon upward. The winds came shrieking over the driving
                  spray, with a strength and steadiness that gave no promise of immediate calm; and
                  the fair proportions of the Sparrow Hawk had been reduced in homage to that mighty
                  power that was still to be dreaded, though many a success over its terrors had
                  attested her mastery in the strife. Her slim royal-masts no longer shot up towards
                  the sky in the pride of their loftiness, nor were her hundred wings spread out to
                  woo the kisses of the dancing breeze; she had cast aside her pomp and splendour,
                  as useless and even dangerous appendages, to war with that wild element that was
                  neither to be awed by the one nor dazzled by the other.
               Sutherland was melancholy, but his sadness was the result of sympathy for the feelings of Carlotta; he knew that
                  every day she was detained on board, under the present circumstances, would add to
                  her unhappiness; and he saw no prospect of the storm's abating in the many signs
                  that foretell the vicissitudes of the weather.
               With a reluctant step he sought the cabin, and with a heart beating with agitation
                  he was admitted; Carlotta was seated upon the sofa, paler than usual, and with an
                  expression of melancholy upon her countenance that it had not often worn; she had
                  resumed the attire of her sex, and with it that dignity and gracefulness of
                  deportment, that she could not, or dare not, have summoned to her aid when attired
                  in the disguise of the night before. With a languid smile she welcomed him to a
                  seat, and sweetly though sadly she responded to all his inquiries; he told that
                  there was as yet no indication of fairer weather, but held out to her many a hope
                  that the storm would break on the morrow. But that morrow came but to falsify
                  expectation. Another and another succeeded, and still it raged. Seven days passed
                  away, but their termination was attended but with an increase of the fury of the
                  tempest.
               "D—n such weather, I say!" exclaimed the first lieutenant, as he strode the
                  quarter-deck, exhibiting an acidity of temper that might have ruined an
                  orange-grove. It was but seldom that Mr. Yarnall indulged in those little
                  outbreaks of passion, but when they escaped, their violence amply repaid their
                  unfrequency. "D—n such weather—it's nothing but blow, blow, blow—rain, rain, rain,
                  when a man's on deck; and when he's below, the infernal creaking of the pumps, and
                  the d—nable stench of the bilge water is enough to make him wish himself in
                  h-ll—there seems to be an arrangement between the two; one to keep him awake,
                  while the other stinks him to death—I've no doubt it is so; no I haven't, d—n me
                  if I have!" and the enraged officer paced up and down, a moment; but his feelings
                  were entirely too volcanic in their nature to be then smothered in silence, so
                  they exploded in the following beautiful declamation:
               "And that demijohn, too! as if there are not curses enough upon us already. That
                  demijohn must turn traitor, to mock my sufferings; who the d—I would have thought
                  that ten gallons of Jamaica could be consumed by me in eight days—nor was it—d—n
                  me if it was—no, it couldn't be—the rascally steward lies; but curse him, I'll
                  sweeten him so high, that his taste for saccharine substances will be paralyzed
                  for ever!"
               "The ship's off, a p'int," said Jeer, the quartermaster.
               "Silence, you d—d old sarpint!" ejaculated Yarnall. "If I hear another word out of
                  you, I'll beat that binnacle down your guzzle, with a top maul!"
               The old tar looked disconcerted, but, touching his hat respectfully, he replied
                  "that he was merely insinivating that the wind had hauled ahead—nothing more."
               The first lieutenant perceived that he had wounded the feelings of the tar, but
                  being too much exasparated to evince his repentance, he turned on his heel and
                  walked forward.
               "What the d—I are you grinning about, you archangel of Beelzebub! you
                  woolly-headed disciple of Lucifer?" This interrogatory was made to a being of
                  sable complexion and snowy teeth, who exercised, with considerable success, the
                  generous functions of ward-room steward.
               "Speak, d—n you!" roared Yarnall, for the rage of the officer seemed to have
                  deprived the menial of that faculty. "You won't speak, eh? very well—forecastle
                  there, get a whip on the fore-yard and stand by to strangle this libel upon the
                  human form!"
               But by this time Julius Cæsar had recovered the use of his tongue.
               "I found it, sir," said he, looking about him in terror at the ominous
                  preparations that were going on forward.
               "Found it—found what?" thundered the officer.
               "Dat breaker."*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *A small cask, used for containing liquor.
               
               "What breaker?" asked Yarnall, and it was observable that his voice descended
                  several notes, and that it was softer, and by no means as powerful; a change, too,
                  came over his countenance—his eye lost its raging flash, and the frown that
                  darkened his heavy brow was gradually disappearing. Some vague suspicion was
                  stealing upon him with a pleasing influence, and all his features at length
                  relaxed in a grave but not repulsive evenness.
               "What breaker, my man?"
               "Dat breaker you bought to win'ard—dat breaker of rum you sposed was left
                  ashore!"
               "All ready with the whip, sir!" sang out a clear voice from the forecastle.
               "Ah, never mind it now. Just belay—unreeve it again, Wilkins."
               "And is this breaker full?"
               "Chock up to de bung, sir."
               "Ah! very well, Cæsar—keep it there—now recollect, I place that breaker under your
                  especial charge. There are not many men, holding your situation, that I would
                  trust in this matter; but you have proved yourself worthy of confidence, and I
                  therefore repose it most unboundedly in you. And, Cæsar, chock it well in the
                  pantry, and see that it is secured so as not to fetch away—do you mind now, bung
                  up and bilge free."
               
               "Yes, sir, I reg'late all dat;" and the negro touched his hat.
               "And, Cæsar, have me a toddy mixed, by the time the watch is relieved!"
               "Yes, sir!" and the negro descended the main hatch, while the officer turned to
                  resume his walk. "Faithful creature!" apostrophized he. "Yes, Cæsar, they may
                  boast of friendship, and its multifarious endearments; but there is more
                  affection, more generous disinterestedness in the breast of a faithful servant,
                  than ever yet warmed the feelings of that proud race that style themselves your
                  lords and masters—there is, Cæsar—depend upon it, there is!"
               "The ship has fallen off another point," said the quarter-master, in a tone of
                  evident displeasure, for he was still hurt at the insulting speech of the
                  officer.
               Yarnall looked up. "Very well, Jeer," said he, "very well; and look you, Jeer—come
                  to me in the ward-room, at eight bells—I've something for you."
               The tar touched his hat, made an awkward bow, and the little anger that remained
                  in his breast was obliterated for ever.
               It was now more than a week since the Sparrow Hawk stood out from Tampico, and
                  during this time the sun had never for one moment been visible, so that they had
                  no opportunity of obtaining an observation, and were consequently at a loss to
                  determine the latitude or longitude of the ship. A heavy sea had been setting from
                  the northward since the commencement of the gale, and there were many reasons for
                  thinking that a strong current was also running from that quarter. Once during the
                  night of the third day, the wind had increased to a degree that rendered it
                  necessary to put the ship before it for some hours of time; and when she was again
                  brought by, it was still too powerful for any other than her storm-sails, so that
                  she was all the while drifting rapidly to leeward.
               Sutherland and his two lieutenants were standing upon the quarter-deck, and it was
                  evident from their manner that their discourse was one of profound interest. A
                  shade of deep anxiety had settled upon the commander's brow, and both Yarnall and
                  Topblock indulged in an unusual seriousness of aspect. The gaze of the three had
                  been settled to leeward for many minutes, and as the deep-sea lead was kept going,
                  it was evident that they suspected the vicinity of land, and that the suspicion
                  gave rise to threatening apprehensions. But fathom after fathom of line was paid
                  out, up and down, and no soundings had been obtained; and many now believed that
                  the man at the mast-head had mistaken a cloud for the peak of Orizaba, which he
                  affirmed most strenuously to have seen, notwithstanding the jeers of his
                  messmates, and the doubtful smile with which the officer of the deck received the
                  intimation.
               "I can see nothing that bears the least resemblance to the land," said Sutherland,
                  as he lowered the telescope from his eye, "and yet I have not a doubt but that it
                  could be seen, if the weather were clear. My dead reckoning places us nigher Vera
                  Cruz than accords with our safety, under the present circumstances."
               "But, Captain Sutherland, do you remember that Orizaba may be seen at eighty miles
                  distance?"
               "Not with such a haze as this around us."
               "Then I cannot believe that the look-out is correct," returned Topblock. "The
                  Sparrow Hawk could scarcely make so much leeway in so short a time."
               "Would to God I could think with you!" resumed Sutherland.
               "Or I," exclaimed Yarnall; "the wind has been too violent throughout to allow us
                  to show canvass enough to hold our own, and then again we must have made seventy
                  or eighty, or perhaps a hundred miles on a southerly course, the night we were
                  obliged to up-helm to it."
               Topblock made no reply, for he was himself at times inclined to admit what he had
                  but just opposed.
               "And this change of wind had not deadened it an iota," resumed the commander. "It
                  blows as fresh now as ever, and the ship wouldn't bear another rag aloft if it
                  were spread there. Our only chance, gentlemen, is to keep as well to windward as
                  possible, until we can get an observation or make out the land, if it be, as I
                  think, close under the lee."
               "Yes, that is certainly our only alternative," resumed Topblock.
               "And the very moment she'll bear the fore-topsail close reefed, give it to her,
                  Mr. Yarnall," continued Sutherland; "but, for heaven's sake, don't endanger the
                  spars; our own preservation depends upon theirs."
               "I'll look out for them, sir; I'll look out for them."
               "And let the look-outs be vigilant at their posts."
               "Ay, ay, sir!"
               "And station one of them upon the fore yard, with orders to keep a bright look-out
                  for breakers under the lee bow; and it would be well to place another in the
                  mizzen-top to watch for the light of St. Juan de Ulloa. We are in a dangerous
                  predicament, and cannot dispense with any precaution, Mr. Yarnall."
               The first lieutenant bowed an assent to the latter remark, and Sutherland, after a
                  long and scrutinizing observation of the hazy horizon to leeward, left the
                  quarter-deck in possession of the two subordinates.
               "Our commander is becoming unusually discreet," said Topblock block; "I never have known him to exhibit the
                  slightest uneasiness before in an hour of real, much less one of threatened,
                  peril. There must be some powerful reason for this unwonted change."
               "There is," returned Yarnall, with a grave and measured inclination of the head,
                  and a look of intelligence that caused his companion to believe that he was well
                  acquainted with the motives that influenced Sutherland on this express
                  occasion.
               "I thought as much," replied Topblock. "He is the last man that personal danger
                  could intimidate."
               "The very last," resumed Yarnall.
               "I have of late suspected that some great responsibility in connexion with our
                  passengers gave rise to his uneasiness. There is certainly some mystery in that
                  quarter. They have not been on deck since they first came on board; and
                  Sutherland, in his conversation, studiously avoids any allusion to them. Haven't
                  you observed that, Yarnall?"
               "Why, yes, but then—" and the speaker paused, as if fearful of communicating
                  something that it were better should be retained in secrecy.
               "What?" exclaimed Topblock, his curiosity the more excited by Yarnall's
                  hesitancy.
               "Nothing," replied the first lieutenant, somewhat coldly.
               "Nay, Yarnall, you were about to make some remark—you know something of the
                  inmates of the cabin?"
               "Well, admitted—what then?"
               "Nothing further than this: we have been messmates long enough to know one another
                  well, and I think I do not flatter myself when I say that I have always proved
                  myself worthy of your confidence."
               "I understand you, Topblock; but the fact is, this is rather a delicate affair;
                  however, I cannot distrust your discretion—you will preserve what I am about to
                  disclose to you an inviolable secret?"
               "I will."
               "Nor, by the most obscure hint, intimate to Sutherland that you know anything
                  about the strangers?"
               "Most certainly."
               "You will never even allude to them?"
               "Never."
               "Then you must know that our passengers are none other than Morelos and one of his
                  aide-de-camps."
               "Is it possible?"
               "So it seems; he was defeated with terrible slaughter at Guanaxuato, and obliged
                  to seek protection here for his life. Now, not a word of this, Topblock!"
               "Oh, no!" returned the other; and he went below a satisfied man. A weight had been
                  removed from his mind; and while he thought the matter over in the gratification
                  of his spirit, his friend Yarnall was chuckling over the deception he had put upon
                  him.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               AGAIN, that night, the sun set without affording to the storm-tossed mariners a
                  glimpse of his descending orb, whereby to form a judgment of their situation; the
                  wind had continued hauling more and more to the eastward, and the sea ran higher,
                  and with more fearful violence, having a strong set to the south-westward, than at
                  any previous period during the prevalence of the blow.
               So dark were the masses of dense, lead-coloured cloud, which overspread the whole
                  sky from the horizon to the zenith, that it was only by a trifling difference in
                  the obscurity, which pervaded both the air and ocean, that the fact was
                  discoverable to the unassisted senses, that the sun had set. No indications of
                  land had as yet been discerned, nor had the lead hitherto given evidence of any
                  undue proximity to the shore; so that it could not be doubted any longer that the
                  distant view of the peak of Orizaba, which had been announced by the look-out, in
                  the morning, was purely delusive and imaginary.
               Still, the experienced wisdom of the officers of the Sparrow Hawk could not be
                  induced to doubt that the land lay not very far to leeward of the corvette, and
                  that her position was one of considerable, if not imminent danger. The ship,
                  however, rode the seas bravely, nor did she labour so much as might have been
                  expected; being a ship of singular capacities, and famous for looking well up to
                  the weather. She was under snug sail, too, and no seas came on board her, so
                  beautifully did she swoop into the trough, and then soar again, as if she were a
                  winged thing, over the crest of the long-succeeding rollers.
               Nothing more could be done for the safety of the ship; no further precautions
                  remained to be taken; and, when Sutherland ascended from the ward-room, in which
                  he had now taken up his quarters, in order to see with his own eyes how the night
                  went, before retiring to his wearisome and sleepless pillow, though he saw nothing
                  to reassure him, or to remove his apprehension of perils close at hand, he saw
                  nothing to be done beyond reiterating his former instructions, and desiring that
                  he should be at once awakened, should anything occur unusual during the hours of
                  darkness.
               This done, with the usual courtesies, he left the deck in charge of the first
                  lieutenant, and descended the after-companion, in order to pay a momentary visit
                  to his fair passenger, before retiring to his own berth.
               To those of the gentler sex, who have braved the dangers of the great deep, and
                  who know what it is to have groaned in the overwhelming agony and helplessness of
                  that most crushing of maladies, sea-sickness, it will not appear wonderful, that,
                  from the first day of that wild tempestuous uproar, Carlotta De Silva had no
                  leisure to bestow on mental cares or sorrows, fanciful or real; that the physical
                  sufferings of the body, exhausted and worn out by weariness and pain, had
                  paralyzed the moral sensibilities of a mind, than which none was more awake, when
                  not distorted by the vehement and fiery force of the proverbial Spanish passion,
                  to all the nice and delicate perceptions of feminine propriety.
               So utterly, indeed, was she outdone and overwhelmed by the yearning throes of that
                  annihilating ailment, that she lay unable almost to move hand or head, scarce
                  conscious of her own identity, and wholly careless of the past or future, both of
                  them merged in the intense anguish of the present; so that to have been told that
                  she was about to die, would have been a source to her neither of apprehension nor
                  rejoicing.
               And, perhaps, it was well for her that it was so; for of a surety her mental
                  agonies would have been intense, had she possessed the power to meditate and brood
                  in almost total solitude—for delicacy, and a tender regard for the reputation of
                  his intended wife, deterred Harry Sutherland from paying her more than short and
                  ceremonious visits—over the consequences to herself and to others, of the
                  disastrous and unmaidenly step which she had taken. Of these things she thought
                  not, however, as she lay fully dressed on the sofa of the inner cabin, with an
                  aching head, a frame dislocated and unnerved, and a mind so enervated and
                  disjointed, that she almost lacked the power of connecting two ideas, much more of
                  deducing effects from causes.
               Juanna, fortunately for the good report of all parties, was a stout, healthy
                  maiden from the mountains, who no more yielded to the attacks of sea-sickness,
                  than the peaks of her native hills to the puny assaults of any lesser influence
                  than the earthquake; and having by Sutherland's advice retained her masculine
                  attire—which was not ill adapted to her darkly embrowned skin, her lofty and well
                  filled stature, and her strongly marked, though handsome features—was enabled to
                  communicate with the steward and other servants, dispensing with their attendance
                  in the cabin, without betraying her own sex or that of her youthful mistress.
               This had, moreover, been facilitated by the absurd invention of Yarnall, in
                  relation to the quality and condition of the Sparrow Hawk's passengers, which had
                  been communicated by Topblock, under a pledge of secrecy, no less solemn than that
                  which he had himself given on receiving it, to his particular crony, Grampus, the
                  ship's surgeon; and by him, on like conditions, made known to Starveall, the purser; from whom it
                  speedily percolated through the medium of the reefers to some of the old
                  quartermasters, and through them to the ship's company at large.
               Thus it came fully to be believed, that the illustrious patriot Morelos was on
                  board; and to the preservation of his safety were attributed all those precautions
                  which were in reality taken for the concealment of Carlotta's sex, and the
                  protection of her honour. So that, between the rude sense of chivalry and honour,
                  for which Jack is famous, and his innate love of mystery, no wonder was exhibited
                  by any of the officers or crew at the unusual measures of precaution, with regard
                  to the inmates of the cabin; and no more than a knowing wink, accompanied by a
                  thrust of the tongue into the cheek, was interchanged between the old salts, who,
                  had they known her true sex and quality, would have been all at loggerheads for a
                  kiss, when the strapping wench Juanna entered the between decks to obtain some
                  luxury for her mistress; and neither rudeness was offered, nor deference shown to
                  her, so that she came and went, utterly unconscious that she was figuring as the
                  Conde San Lucar, aid-de-camp to the patriot Morelos.
               The visit of Sutherland to the cabin was, on this evening, unusually brief, and,
                  on the whole, almost painful; for not only was Carlotta far too weak to converse
                  with him, or appreciate his delicacy and generous care of her good repute, but she
                  wandered in her mind, and was perfectly unconscious of his presence; a symptom
                  most incongruous with ordinary sea-sickness, and one which arose, probably, rather
                  from the feverish agitation which her mind had probably undergone, than from her
                  present malady. She talked wildly and rapidly in her native tongue, which
                  Sutherland spoke fluently, in the evident conviction that she was at home with her
                  parents; now addressing them with words of love, and supplications of pardon for
                  her offence in leaving them; now fancying herself in the presence of De Hautville,
                  the wronged and forsaken, accusing herself of impiety and faithlessness, now
                  imploring him, with shrieks and long, shuddering groans, to spare her, and not to
                  kill her, for the love of the Blessed Virgin; for, indeed, indeed, she could not
                  help it. Then she would stretch her arms abroad and call for Sutherland, her best
                  beloved, her only beloved Sutherland, to rescue her from the enraged and
                  vindictive Don Juan.
               Could it be that her fears, her visions, were prophetic? After events would have
                  made it appear so, could we believe that such things may be. But at this time it
                  must be remembered that Sutherland knew not who was De Hautville, nor suspected
                  his identity with Montgomery, his ancient rival.
               Still it was sadly and with an unquiet conscience, that Harry Sutherland retired
                  to his couch. He could not, strive as he would, disconnect his thoughts from his
                  first love; the pure, the gentle, the delicate, the modest Anna Hamilton; and
                  still, repulse as he might, he could not repress the comparison which would keep
                  constantly occurring to his mind between the calm, serene; and tender affection,
                  tempered ever by a sense of womanly dignity and maidenly timidity of the American
                  maiden, and the violent, impulsive, passionate love of the voluptuous Spanish
                  girl. Still he almost felt that he adored the former now the more, when his
                  voluntary deed was about to set an impassable gulf between them; and that he half
                  shrank from the impetuous temperament of the latter, when he was on the very point
                  of making her his own for ever. Anon, the thought crossed his mind, how base, how
                  shameless, how unmanly, how unkind had been his own conduct toward Anna Hamilton.
                  He reflected how he had deserted her; deserted his betrothed and acknowledged
                  bride without a hint of apology, a shadow of excuse; without even that courtesy of
                  a last farewell, which is due even to the commonest and least esteemed of his
                  associates. He fancied her now brooding over her disappointed love, now wondering
                  at the causes of his own unaccountable falsehood, now doubting the reality of his
                  alienation from her, and, perhaps, framing excuses for him in her inward heart,
                  which her cooler judgment could scarcely suffice to approve. Thence arose the
                  recollection, how, just previous to his departure, events had so crowded on
                  events; the sudden death of his father, his appointment to the Sparrow Hawk, and
                  precipitate orders to sea; all of them events of which she could, by no means,
                  have failed to hear; that she might well be, even to this moment, entirely
                  unsuspicious of his breach of faith, as she must of necessity be ignorant of the
                  cause of it; that she might well conceive a thousand reasons, apart even from the
                  loss of letters, which should have rendered it impossible for him to convey to her
                  the tidings of his unwelcome but imperative departure; that she might, even now,
                  be looking forward to his return, clad in the laurels of victory, and wafted on
                  the wings of love.
               And how would she, he thought, bear to look upon him—her affianced lover—the
                  bridegroom of another, far less accomplished, far less lovely, and above all, how
                  immeasurably far less feminine and delicate! How would her father, his benefactor,
                  and the first founder of his fortunes, regard the apostate renegado to his first
                  faith and first affections? How would the proud and stern Montgomery glare with
                  contempt and indignation on the craven and the traitor who had snatched from him
                  those affections which would have rendered him supremely blest,
                  which, perhaps, his love might, in the end, have won her mutual love;
                  snatched them from him only to betray, to reject, to repudiate them when won,
                  without the semblance of a cause.
               
               Thereafter, he began to consider what the cause was: whence all this misery, this
                  crime, had arisen; and thence to debate within himself on the last words of his
                  father, and to scrutinize their weight, their probability, and their force; until
                  he began to confess to himself that he had acted like a rash, mad boy; and that
                  the evidence was so slight on which he had acted, and the fact itself, if proved
                  evident, so inconsiderable, that neither the world nor his own conscience would
                  excuse him for so violating his own plighted faith, and breaking a pure woman's
                  heart, without further proof and stronger reality.
               "Had it been Anna's father," he said to himself, "who was the violater of my
                  father's nuptial bed, the corrupter of my mother's honour, and that, too, long
                  years after I was born into this world of sorrow—that—that indeed had been
                  something. But her uncle, only—and that, too, an uncle who had never known her—an
                  uncle of whose existence she was, it might be, all unconscious! Tush! it is all an
                  error or a dream—a vision or a vanity. I'll none of it."
               But then, again, the thought of Carlotta, pure and innocent, indeed, though wild
                  and wayward in her impulses, with her reputation blighted, and her
                  heart-affections blasted, came to his recollection; and he smote his breast
                  bitterly with his clenched hand, exclaiming, "What must be, must be!—It is done,
                  done for ever! and I am damned on earth, as before heaven—damned, as a double
                  traitor!"
               And soon thereafter he sank into a deep and troubled slumber, disturbed by an
                  appalling dream, which shook his mind, when he returned to it, unto his dying
                  day.
               He thought that he was dead, and in the regions of departed spirits; standing
                  before a judgment seat colossal, on which sate, indistinct and misty, invisible
                  through the glory of its own brightness, the Divine Presence, circled
                  by saints and martyrs, cherubim and seraphim, angels and archangels, dazzling with
                  super-natural whiteness. And, bound like himself, with fetters of flame-breathing
                  serpents, Carlotta stood beside him, awaiting the dread doom, from the voice of
                  the PRESENCE, which should condemn them to the fiery lake, that yawned and
                  bellowed far beneath them, with infernal thunders. The fiend stood hard by them,
                  impatient of his prey; and that fiend was Montgomery, sneering, in grand but
                  blasted beauty; but the doom was not spoken yet; and, while all things appeared to
                  whirl and wheel in dizzy mazes round them, he caught a glimpse of his guardian
                  angel, white-robed and silver-pinioned, but formed and featured like to Anna
                  Hamilton, pleading for him before the throne, to the DIVINE PRESENCE. Then, again,
                  he seemed to hear the clarions of ten thousand legions of angels proclaiming the
                  glad tidings of a pardoned sinner: but anon a hideous yell burst from the lips of
                  his fiendish rival, answered by a heart-broken shriek from Carlotta, as the fiend
                  snatched her in his arms, and plunged with her into the infernal lake, which
                  closed above them, with a roar, to which the loudest thunder was as a tune of
                  summer music.
               He started from his horrid slumbers, and Yarnall stood beside his berth, touching
                  his arm respectfully, while the boatswain's shrill pipe was ringing in his ear,
                  and the hoarse summons of "All hands!" above all the crash and creaking of the
                  straining masts and cordage, the roar and reel of the heavy surf, which was
                  thundering on every side around them, and the howling of the giant winds of
                  heaven.
               "I have been knocking at your door these five minutes, Captain Sutherland," said
                  Yarnall. "The night has changed, sir. It is quite clear now, with a bright
                  moon."
               Ere he had spoken six words, Sutherland was on his feet, and was hurrying on some
                  of his clothes, which he had thrown aside before lying down; but as he did so, he
                  asked hastily, "What then, Yarnall, what then? Is there land in sight, and how
                  near are we in shore?"
               The lieutenant shook his head anxiously. "Plenty of land, Captain Sutherland, a
                  d——d sight more of it than ever I wish to see again, anyhow! We are embayed
                  fairly, and within a short mile of the breakers."
               At this instant a heavy rumbling sound was heard, succeeded by a great splash, and
                  the quivering of the timbers of the corvette, as the chain-cable ran out, fathom
                  after fathom, from her hause-holes.
               The captain turned a quick, inquiring glance on his subordinate, who answered to
                  the mute appeal of his superior's eye, saying, "You will pardon me, Captain
                  Sutherland, for the liberty. But the clouds lifted like a curtain all at once and
                  showed us where we were in an instant. There was no time to wait or ask for
                  orders. The wind, and the drift of the current, were setting us in like a
                  mill-race; it is our only chance of saving the ship, sir."
               "You have done very wisely, I doubt not, Yarnall. But the chance, I fancy, is a
                  very slight one."
               "There is just a hope sir; the tide seems to be just on the turn, and these are
                  indications that the norther has blown itself out. I think within half an hour we
                  shall have it out of the southwest, if our ground-tackle will only hold so
                  long."
               "If, if! ay, Yarnall! with an 'if' we can compass everything. The only thing that
                  troubles me is our passengers. We all of us, I trust, know how to meet our fate by water or by fire, be it which it may.
                  But for them I tremble!"
               "Why as for that," answered Yarnall gruffly—following up his own preconceived
                  idea, or rather believing now at last that what he had at first asserted as a
                  funny quiz, was veritable truth—"I should think they had run their chances by fire
                  often enough, not to make any terrible bobbery about risking the water, too."
               Sutherland stared in his face in mute wonder, utterly unconscious of what he could
                  mean; and half suspecting that either the terrors of the night, or the sense of
                  the responsibility he had taken upon himself, had demented the worthy officer,
                  whom he knew to be the strangest conceivable medley of professional matter of fact
                  and imaginative romancing.
               He made no answer, however; for he had now reached the deck, and the full aspect
                  of the perils into which they had been driven burst upon him. The sight was,
                  indeed, awful in the extreme. The corvette lay nearly in the centre of a deep
                  bight of the low sandy coast, which might, perhaps extend three miles or a little
                  better from point to point of the headlands, which, as could now be seen by the
                  clear moonlight, no longer wading through the clouds, but riding resplendent in an
                  azure sky, ran out at least four points to windward of her, so that there was not
                  a possible chance of her clawing off, as the wind now blew. The whole line of the
                  coast was lashed by as tremendous a surf as the eye of man probably ever
                  witnessed; thundering as it rolled in upon the sand-hills in a huge treble line of
                  snow-white foaming rollers, flashing in spots, when some greater obstruction met
                  it fifty feet in the air, sparkling like a jet of liquid diamonds. It was clear
                  that, once in them, no ship could hold together for ten minutes—no open boat could
                  live an instant.
               Still, as Yarnall said, there was a hope. A second and a third anchor had been got
                  over; and, as yet none of the cables had parted, although they showed, like tense
                  bars cast of iron, rigid and horizontal, so great was the strain upon them, as the
                  vessel rose over the succeeding rollers which half submerged her forward, and
                  plunged into the troughs with shocks that made her every bolt and timber groan and
                  quiver, as if she had struck upon a rock. The yards were all down upon the caps,
                  and the active crew had worked so rapidly in furling them, that scarce any
                  surface, save that of the hull and the bare spars, was now exposed to the norther,
                  which was still blowing, though with decreasing violence; for the wind now came
                  only in fierce and sudden gusts, with lulls between of almost absolute calm; and
                  it momently became apparent that the intervals of lull were growing longer, and
                  the puffs gradually losing their violence. The clouds, moreover over, which had
                  lifted so suddenly, were already swept out far to seaward, making it evident that
                  there was an upper stratum of strong wind blowing off shore above, while the sea
                  breeze still prevailed in the lower regions.
               "And a half eleven!" sang out the man in the chains, almost as Sutherland reached
                  the deck, while his quick eye was still taking note of all the signs of the
                  weather.
               "What was the last cast, Mr. Topblock?"
               "A quarter eleven, sir."
               "And a half eleven!" sang out the man again.
               "She drifts none at present," remarked Sutherland. "Did she drag much at
                  first?"
               "A fathom every cast, sir. But she feels the ebb already, and would swing, if it
                  were not for the butt end of this no'ther."
               "She will swing presently. Is not that the day breaking yonder in the
                  east?"
               "Yes, sir, we shall have it daylight within the hour."
               "See all ready, then, to make sail at the first puff of the land wind. We shall
                  have it so soon as the sun peeps above the sandhills; and we will lose no time in
                  getting off this cursed coast. It is God's mercy, and no less, that we are not
                  rolling in those breakers now, so many corpses! Ten minutes more of that norther,
                  and the flood-tide would have done for us, beyond the help of seamanship. See, we
                     are swinging! It has fallen calm already. Heave her up, by and
                  bye, closer to her anchors; there is no more danger to her cables."
               It was indeed a providential escape; but now all risk was ended, though the ship
                  rolled heavily in the groundswell created by the long tempest.
               As the day broke, the land breeze came and freshened; and ere the crew were piped
                  to breakfast, the yards were swayed aloft, the topsails sheeted home, the reefs
                  all shaken out, and the good ship was standing out of the perilous bay, in which
                  she had so nearly laid her bones, amid the hearty self-congratulations of her
                  gallant officers and crew.
               At noon an observation was obtained; and the Sparrow Hawk was found to have
                  drifted about two hundred and fifty miles to the south-eastward of the harbour of
                  Tampico; and as the wind was now not only fair and fresh, but promising to hold,
                  the corvette was soon under top-gallant studding-sails, and running gallantly
                  before the wind, in spite of the nasty cross sea, which was still running.
               Desiring his subordinates to splice the main-brace, and pipe the men down to
                  breakfast, Sutherland now descended to the cabin, well assured that the
                  intelligence he had got for his fair passenger would do more to allay her ailment,
                  than all the medicaments dicaments of
                  Dr. Grampus, and all the condiments of Cæsar, the steward.
               But little did he think, when he assured her that, past doubt or fear, he would
                  place her in her father's arms ere the nightfall of the next-coming day, what
                  havoc should be cried, what dogs of war be let slip, on the seas which lay all
                  bloodless now and bright between him and the land of promise!
            
            
               CHAPTER XIX.
               WE must here call it to the minds of our readers, that, immediately on hearing of
                  Sutherland's arrival at Tampico, and previous to our hero's first acquaintance
                  with Carlotta, Montgomery took horse and rode away into the interior, without
                  taking leave of his intended bride, or stating, except in the vaguest and most
                  general terms, to her father, the reasons of his departure.
               It now remains for us to state, in order to render intelligible what follows, that
                  which occurred during the interval, in every way so fatal to himself, during which
                  the daughter of Don Silva eloped with Sutherland, who thus unconsciously became,
                  for the third time, his involuntary, but successful rival.
               It will be remembered by all readers of South American history, that, up to the
                  year 1815, in which occurred the events we have been relating, the patriot
                  Morelos, striving incessantly for Mexican independence, had sustained himself in
                  arms with invariable success against the Spaniards and the Royalists, and had so
                  nearly conquered the freedom of his country, that a long suspension of arms had
                  ensued, and Mexico was almost considered free and independent. Prompted by that
                  love of liberty, and that propagandizing spirit of freedom which predisposes every
                  American to sympathize with all men and countries struggling against oppression,
                  and to aid them by their individual prowess, no sooner had Montgomery reached the
                  shores of Mexico, whither he repaired immediately on his recovering from the wound
                  he received at the hand of Sutherland, than he joined the patriots under the
                  assumed name of De Hautville, his perfect acquaintance with the French language
                  enabling him to pass himself off without difficulty for a native of France.
               In this service, reckless of life, and seeking in warfare rather the repose of
                  death than the renown of military glory, while the former seemed to shun him in
                  the deadliest mêlée, the latter fell upon him unawares, and he became, in a short
                  space, the boldest and most successful cavalry officer in the service of the
                  patriots, and the bosom friend and counsellor of Morelos. During the suspension of
                  hostilities I have named, during the fight fought, and the prize of victory won,
                  he had retired to the neighbourhood of Tampico, to the enjoyment of solitude, and
                  the cultivation of his loved letters, and there had found, had loved, and, as he
                  believed, won the beautiful but false Carlotta.
               When he fled like a maniac, or one pursued by the fabled furies of Orestes, from
                  the presence of the only man on earth
                  who had ever foiled him, the only man on earth whom he hated with an invincible
                  and deadly hate, as he galloped, he knew not why or whither, madly into the
                  interior, a rumour reached his cars that his old friend and general, hard beset by
                  superior numbers—for the Spaniards had been of late powerfully reinforced—was
                  drawing to a head among the mountains, and preparing to give battle, once more, to
                  the enemies of freedom. At the word, instantly the spirit of the partisan was
                  rekindled in his bosom, as is the fire of the old warhorse at the clangour of the
                  trumpets. Easily learning from the Rancheros, many of whom knew him of old, who
                  were flocking to the standard of Morelos, where that great leader was encamped, he
                  pricked on, night and day, until he reached the rendezvous, on the eve of the
                  fatal fight of Guanaxuato; fatal to liberty as that of Chæronea. Received with
                  joy, amounting almost to rapture, by his ancient leader, and reinstated in command
                  of his old lance regiments, he had fought even more madly than his wont, for there
                  was a strange foreboding at his heart, and, he knew not wherefore, something akin
                  to despair. He fought again, as was his wont, to win a soldier's death; and
                  though, as usual, death, shunned him, he failed this time, at least, to win
                  victory.
               Never was there a sterner, never a deadlier defeat, never a more disastrous, a
                  more total rout. The patriot force was scattered to the four winds of heaven.
                  Morelos, playing the part of a soldier, after doing all the devoirs of a general,
                  was taken prisoner; nor could all Montgomery's charges, pressed home with the
                  disinterested valour of friendship, with the recklessness of despair, avail to
                  break the serried masses of the veteran infantry of Spain, or to rescue his
                  helpless leader.
               In the last onslaught, all his men, save a dozen veteran troopers, broke and fled;
                  and the few that remained faithful, seizing his horse's reins, compelled him,
                  weary and wounded, to accompany them in their flight, for retreat it could not be
                  called, towards Tampico. On the route they were overtaken by a person of
                  commanding stature, and fine martial air, though far advanced in years, like
                  themselves flying from the field, whom Montgomery had seen busy in the heat of the
                  fray, and in the last despairing shock fighting undaunted to the last, and
                  reckless as himself, although he failed to recognise him as an old
                  acquaintance.
               When this stranger overtook them, they had halted by a mountain stream to refresh
                  themselves and recruit their horses, which were almost overdone by the hot speed
                  at which they had ridden; and he, recognising at once the colours of the patriot
                  cockade, drew his rein and dismounted, claiming his right to do so as a
                  comrade.
               It now for the first time struck Montgomery, that he had seen this man before,
                  though he could not remember when or at what time; but what was his surprise when
                  the stranger addressed him in good English, saying:
               "We meet again in a bad plight, Mr. Montgomery, but you were in a
                  worse, I think, when we met last."
               "Ha! you know me!" exclaimed Montgomery eagerly; "you know me, and you are an
                  American. Where have we met before? Your face is half familiar, but familiar
                  rather as a dream than a reality. Where have we met before? Speak, I pray you, for
                  memory fails me!"
               "In Washington."
               "In Washington? I cannot recollect."
               "No wonder; you were all but dead when I found you, on the night of your mad duel
                  with Sutherland—"
               "Curses upon him! curses! ay, ten thousand curses!"
               "And you had not recovered sufficiently to know me, when I was forced to set
                  sail," replied the stranger, unheeding his interruption. But in a moment he
                  continued, "He married her then—he married Anna Hamilton, that you so curse
                  him?"
               "Who are you, man? who are you, who so dare to torture me?" exclaimed Montgomery,
                  springing to his feet.
               "One who is nameless; but one who has a right to ask it of you, for I am her
                  reputed father's brother."
               "Reputed father's brother!" cried Montgomery, yet more bewildered by
                  his words—"reputed father's—and nameless! I knew not ever that she
                  had a reputed father save her own."
               "She had. But answer me, I charge you: did he marry her?"
               "I cannot answer, until I learn to whom."
               "You may call me Captain Manly; men knew me once by that name."
               "Manly! the mighty privateer! the captain of the glorious Sea-King! Manly, whom
                  the whole world knows and honours!"
               A flash of exultation gleamed over the pale features of the privateersman.
               "The same whom you mean, Montgomery, but captain of the Sea-King now no longer.
                  When the war with England ended, Othello's occupation was no more. The combatant
                  of fifty battles could not descend to be a trading trafficker. The Sea-King plies
                  but an ignoble trade now as a Guinea-man—her whilom captain has been for the first
                  time beaten, fighting for liberty and honour. I know now that my time is at hand.
                  Speak to me, therefore, while there is yet time. Did he marry her?"
               "He did not. He deserted her as basely, as he won her traitorously. Ere I left
                  Washington, which I did secretly, the whole town rang with the tale of his
                  desertion and my unaccountable absence. He is on this coast even now unwedded, and
                     it may well be, plotting further
                  treasons. You have tortured me! My heart is on fire! Let us to horse!"
               "Pardon me if I hurt you. But this is of strange import to me. Speak, I pray you,
                  was the cause known wherefore he so deserted her?"
               "Ask me no more, then. There were a thousand rumours; his father, the old gloomy
                  hermit, died very suddenly, and, it was hinted, with his last breath, forbade the
                  marriage. Certain it is, the old man dead, they never met again. He was appointed
                  to the Sparrow Hawk within a week, and sailed without seeing her or leaving any
                  tidings. Now, then, to horse."
               "I understand, I understand! This must be set to rights!" exclaimed the other,
                  gloomily. "Sin ever leads to sin. Father and son, they must not then both perish.
                  Be it so, Montgomery; to horse, if you will, and away!"
               And off they started, and onward they sped, day and night, until, in the gray
                  twilight, they reached the heights above Tampico, and there, in the roadstead,
                  just without the bar, awaiting the land breeze, with her sails brailed loosely up
                  in beautiful festoons, lay a long, raking barque at anchor, with a heavy armament,
                  but showing no colours at her gaff, no pennant at her main. Yet evidently she was
                  a man-of-war.
               So soon as Manly's eye fell on the shapely spars, it flashed dark fire. "Once
                  more," he cried, "once more, and in good time! My own, my own, my gallant
                  Sea-King! Montgomery, go with me! The cause of freedom here is over for a while;
                  our lives are forfeit to the law, and yonder come the heads of the royal
                  columns!"
               And as he spoke, the clang of martial music was heard on the morning air, and at
                  about five miles' distance the serried masses of the Spanish infantry were seen,
                  with their glittering arms and ensigns, surmounting the dark Sierra.
               "Montgomery, I say, come with me!"
               "Whither?"
               "Wherever the breeze blows and the billow bears us! Wherever tyranny rules, and
                  freedom struggles! Come with me. It is no use to die, shot in the back as traitors
                  by these Spanish bloodhounds. Come with me. We will fight yet for liberty, and
                  conquer."
               "One short half-hour, and I will answer you. I must to the governor first, and
                  then—if it need be, can you give me place for a passenger, or it may be for
                  two?"
               "For twenty! In half an hour, upon the quay. Adios!"
               And the privateersman galloped down to the beach, and firing both his pistols in
                  the air to attract the attention of the ship, drew a small ensign from his bosom,
                  which he waved aloft.
               The effect was magical. A heavy gun was fired by the ship, and the faint sounds of
                  three distant cheers reached the ears of Manly, while a barge fully manned came
                  dancing over the waters yet ruffled by the dying sea breeze.
               As the barge touched the sand, Montgomery joined the privateersman alone, with a
                  brow black as night, and an eye glaring with lurid light.
               "Ha, so soon! Do you go with me?"
               "To the world's end, so you will give me vengeance!"
               "It is her motto now!" And he pointed to the Sea-King, to whose gaff
                  a broad, blood-red ensign rose. "See you you ensign? It is her motto now, and
                  mine! 'Vengeance, and war upon all nations!' Are you answered?"
               "As I would be. Come on!"
               And they sprang on board the barge, and within ten minutes stood on the deck of
                  the gallant Sea-King, amid the cheers and congratulations of her fierce crew.
               But while they were yet shaking hands, and renewing old, or commencing new,
                  companionships, a wild cry floated down from the fore-topsail-yard, with a
                  strange, melancholy sound, ominous of evil.
               "Sail, ho!"
               "Whereaway?"
               "Broad on the weather-beam, sir!"
               "What do you make her?"
               "A heavy ship, square rigged. She looms like a frigate!"
               In a moment Manly and Frederick, who had instantly surrendered the command to his
                  old leader, mounted to the tops, telescope in hand.
               Both gazed for a few seconds steadily on the speck of white in the far offing,
                  which was fast rising into view. Both closed their glasses by a common impulse,
                  and as their eyes met, Frederick exclaimed:
               "The ship I fought in the white squall, off the Bahama Banks!"
               "The Sparrow Hawk!" responded Manly.
               "Great God be praised!" shouted Montgomery, who had followed them aloft. "I have
                  thee, then, mine enemy!"
               "We will go to quarters, Frederick," said Manly, coolly. "He is bringing up a
                  spanking breeze with him, and will be upon us within half an hour."
               "Shall we keep that rag aloft?" asked Frederick, pointing to the pirate ensign,
                  which was still fluttering at the gaff.
               "Ay, ay! No use to douse it! There are eyes in that lad's head that we cannot
                  cheat! Now, then, up anchor and make sail; we can claw off with this wind, and we
                  will fight him under sail. And see,
                  there come the Spanish guns down the Sierras. We must not be between two fires.
                  Hardily, now, my lads! Three cheers for the saucy Sea-King!"
               Three full-mouthed cheers attested the gallantry and good-will of the crew, and as
                  they died away, a hoarse voice bellowed out, "And three more for dare-devil
                  Manly!" and the ship's timbers literally trembled with the tumultuous cheering
                  which succeeded.
            
            
               CHAPTER XX.
               STILL, certain as it appeared at first sight that an immediate action must ensue
                  between the cruiser of the United States, and the pirate, for such she had now in
                  truth become, so many are the changes and the chances of the sea, that, although
                  both parties were as anxious to bring on the barren conflict as they could have
                  been had wealth the most unlimited, honours the most exalted, been the prize of
                  victory, whereas in truth it was the bare sense of duty, uninfluenced by hopes of
                  profit or by feelings of personal animosity, that prompted the Americans, and a
                  bloody and brutal hankering after carnage and revenge that kindled the breasts of
                  the buccaneers, a longer interval was interposed between their first catching
                  sight of each other and their final conflict, than any one on board either vessel
                  had deemed probable, or indeed possible.
               When the Sparrow Hawk, which had thus far brought her own spanking breeze down
                  with her, steering right before it with every inch of canvass set that would draw
                  from her royals to her lower studding-sails, was within some three miles of the
                  Rover, the sea-breeze suddenly began to fail: for a quarter of an hour there was a
                  succession of short irregular puffs and uncertain calms, and then the wind sank
                  altogether; the crisped smiles of the ridgy waves subsided into cool serenity, and
                  a few minutes later the whole surface of the Gulf was shining silvery and bright
                  as a vast mirror, or as the unruffled bosom of an inland lake.
               Condemned to inactivity on both sides, the future combatants applied themselves at
                  once to the sternest preparations for a fight which all foresaw must be final and
                  conclusive; but doubly perilous was the need of Manly to provide every resource
                  with which his genius and experience could surround him, since the very calm which
                  prevented him from working off shore manfully under bold sail to meet one enemy,
                  compelled him to await the insidious and almost unseen approaches of another, in
                  the triumphant army of the Spaniards, flushed with their recent victory, whose
                  columns he might already behold entering the gates of the city; and whose
                  artillery he might soon expect to hear thundering from the embrasures of the
                  batteries under whose guns he lay.
               "Are they eighteens or twenty-fours, Montgomery," asked the commander of the young
                  man, whose long sojourn might be presumed to render him familiar with all the
                  details of the city and its
                  fortifications, "which form the battery of yon low fleur
                     d'eau fort to the left of the mole?"
               "Neither one nor the other, Captain Manly," replied the young man; "there is not a
                  gun there of smaller calibre than a thirty-two. The castle to the right has
                  twenty-fours and eighteens."
               "Heavy odds against eighteen-pounder carronades, and that at long bowls too. We
                  must be moving, if we mean to do anything against that heavy fellow in the offing,
                  for he is a hard match for us at the best; and if these Dons begin to pepper us,
                  as it is like enough they will, at their leisure, if they don't sink us at our
                  anchors, for which I would be loth to answer, they will leave little work for him
                  to do."
               "Mr. Morton," he continued, after a moment's pause, addressing the officer of the
                  deck, "call all hands, if you please."
               The shrill whistle of the boatswain, and the hoarse call repeated everywhere, was
                  followed by the heavy trampling of feet and the simultaneous rush of the crew from
                  all quarters, until an hundred and twenty as stout fellows as ever walked a deck,
                  were mustered about their ancient captain, whose long-relinquished and now
                  reassumed authority they hailed with transport and the fullest conviction of
                  triumph.
               "Clear away all the boats, sir, and let the launch and long-boat have their kedges
                  on board—I shall both tow and kedge off shore, as cheerily as we may, for we must
                  put two miles of water between us and those water batteries before they open their
                  fire upon us, which they will do soon as they know I am aboard you. Look alive,
                  now, my lads; if you do your duty lively, we shall be without the range of their
                  guns before they can train their muzzles upon us; and every mile we make now
                  brings us as much the nearer to yon cruiser, which is our real enemy,
                  as it removes us from these haughty Dons."
               The men cheered lustily, the boats were speedily fitted, manned, and lowered, and
                  the ship was about to commence the doubtful experiment of kedging out from under
                  the guns of the heavy batteries; the capstan bars being already manned, and the
                  boats carrying out the anchors for the purpose; when suddenly a white flag was
                  displayed on a must at the mole-head, and immediately afterward a boat was seen
                  pulling out, with its stern sheets filled, as it would seem, with officers of
                  rank, and a similar emblem of pacific intentions floating from a staff at her
                  bows, and the gorgeous blazonry of Old Spain displayed at her stern.
               "Ha! they will treat with us!" cried the commander; "It is well so—we shall gain
                  time. Heave her up short to her anchors, but do not trip them till the Dons are
                  well aboard and in the cabin—then heave her adrift, kedge her seaward as steadily
                  and as silently as ye may. Haul down that red ensign, meantime, and set Spanish
                  colours at her gaffs, with a white flag at her fore. We are an American, remember,
                  and with protection from his excellency the governor at the Havana."
               In the meantime, the shore boat had come alongside, and the envoys, consisting of
                  two or three subalterns of the Spanish army accompanying a lieutenant-colonel, who
                  was the governor's aid-de-camp likewise, came on
                  board, and were received by Frederick and his other officers, who were now all in
                  full uniform as officers of the United States, with all courtesy and honour.
               Their errand was soon told. Information had been given to the royalist general,
                  that two persons most obnoxious to the government, daring partisans of Morelos,
                  and unremitting enemies of Spain, having succeeded in making their escape from the
                  bloody field of Guanaxuato, had been received on board the Sea-King, and were now
                  in asylum under the cover of her flag. It would appear that the momentary
                  elevation of the piratical ensign on board the cruiser had escaped the observation
                  of the Spaniards; since they spoke of the Sea-King, and appeared to consider her
                  as a cruiser of the United States: and it was in consequence of the assumed
                  neutrality of that power, and on the faith of treaties, that the surrender of
                  these men was demanded, who had, it was alleged, borne arms against Spain on her
                  own ground, in defiance of the state of amity and peace existing between the two
                  governments.
               Frederick was not slow to profit by the advantage which he derived from this
                  error. Professing his willingness to be ruled in all things by the faith of
                  treaties and the national honour, he affected to consider it in some respects
                  doubtful whether the case could be made out against the two American gentlemen,
                  very distinguished gentlemen, too, he said; who, he did not pretend to deny, were
                  on board the Sea-King, and under the protection of the American flag. These
                  gentlemen, he added, were both now well known to himself, and had been so for many
                  years; the one being no other than the very valorous Captain Manly, who had spread
                  such terror and devastation along the coasts of England during the last war, and
                  to whose identity every officer, and many of the crew of the Sea-King could
                  testify, as he had actually, until within a very short space of time, commanded
                  the very vessel in which they were now sojourning. The other, he said, he also
                  well knew to be Mr. John Montgomery, of the city of Philadelphia, of great
                  attainments, and of the highest respectability. Under these circumstances he
                  submitted that he could not surrender persons, whom he knew of his own knowledge
                  to be Captain Manly and Mr. Montgomery, when demanded under the titles, as they
                  now were, of the Señor Hernando de Ribadeva, and Monsieur de Hautville; at the
                  same time he invited the Spanish officers below to communicate further on so
                  delicate a question; stating that in
                  all probability a reference to the United States Consul at Tampico would obviate
                  all difficulty in the premises, and either establish the innocence, or lead to the
                  surrender of the fugitives. The deck was left therefore to the officers of the
                  watch and the crew; the rowers of the Spanish boat, like their superiors, were
                  soon engaged in discussing the delicacies, edible and potable, which were set
                  before them, in the between decks; while the anchor of the Sea-King was tripped
                  and secured at her bows, and she herself was steadily moving out to seaward at the
                  rate of some two or three knots an hour, as her kedges were carried out
                  alternately, each a quarter of a mile beyond the last, and the good ship heaved up
                  to them successively by the exertions of the crew, who walked round with the
                  capstan bars gallantly, and with a right good will, but without cheering or
                  singing as they went.
               If the Spaniards perceived the motion, suspecting nothing, and being aware that
                  the sea-breeze had ceased and the land-wind not as yet commenced blowing, they
                  were easily satisfied by the reply that the Sea-King was merely shifting her
                  berth, as that in which she lay had become inconvenient; and as, very shortly
                  after, the ship became stationary once more, having dropped her anchor at a full
                  mile beyond the longest range of the batteries, they thought no more of it, until,
                  on coming upon deck towards evening, with a view to return ashore, they found
                  themselves at three miles distance from the sally-port of the batteries at the
                  mole-head, and though all courtesies were still extended to them, could doubt no
                  longer that they had been most egregiously outwitted.
               Nothing remained, however, but to return to Tampico, and there procure, if so they
                  might, the authorization of the consul of the United States at that port, for the
                  apprehension of the fugitives, to which the captain of the Sea-King had professed
                  his readiness to defer; and therefore, after all the ceremonials and grimaces of
                  official politeness, with smiles and civilities on every face, and suspicion,
                  distrust, and dislike at every heart, the Spanish officers departed landward,
                  while the bold buccaneers rejoiced at their ruse de
                     guerre, in having so skilfully carried their ship under cover of a
                  flag from under the yawning guns of a ready and hostile battery, and in the speedy
                  prospect of a combat with a hated enemy, of whom they asked no odds but what they
                  were like to have, a fair field and no favour.
               So soon as his unwelcome guests, the Spanish officers, had left the Sea-King, the
                  whole crew of that vessel, after having held some conversation among themselves
                  forward, came aft in a body to the quarter-deck, on which Frederick Atherley and
                  Evan Morton, the second in command, were standing, surrounded by their junior
                  officers; the whole staff of the ship having been assembled to do honour to the
                  Spaniards. Their manner was firm and decided, yet respectful, and they gave no
                  token of any intent to mutiny; for, desperadoes as they were, and something very
                  near akin to pirates, they had all been privateersmen, and many of them
                  men-of-war's-men, in their day, and had thus contracted habits of discipline, if
                  not principles of obedience, which are not easily shaken off.
               The fact is, that on Manly's leaving the Sea-King, and giving her over as he did,
                  a sort of joint-stock association had been formed of the men and officers, share
                  per share, according to rank, and she had been converted into a Guineaman, or
                  coast-trader, alias slaver, alias picaroon—for most Guinea traders, like the Malek
                  Adhel of well known reputation, and free-traders or smugglers in general, when
                  their cargoes are out and their guns in, will levy tolls on the ocean on vessels
                  slower and weaker than themselves, going on the principle of what Wordsworth calls 
                     
                        "The good old rule, the simple plan,
                        That they should take who have the power,
                        And they should keep who can."
                     
                  
               
               In the first instance, a fair cargo for the African trade had been taken out, with
                  the intention of bartering it honestly for gold-dust, palm-oil, and other similar
                  productions of the western coast. But the temptation of vast and inordinate gains
                  presented too strong a temptation for minds in which the true ideas of right and
                  wrong, the meum and the tuum, had become somewhat confounded by a long course of applying to
                  their own uses the goods of other men, captured on the high seas, under the
                  specious guise of patriotism. As if to render the temptation irresistible, which
                  was already strong, a very fine cargo of slaves having been offered at very low
                  prices, owing to the risk of capture from the combined American, French, and
                  English squadrons on the coast, a Spanish slaver got into the river where they
                  were lying, with great difficulty, so thoroughly crippled by the fire of a British
                  brigantine, for which they had refused to heave to, that all hopes of her
                  obtaining repairs so as to be able to proceed with her voyage, were hopeless. A
                  liberal offer was made of her rice, water-casks, slave-decks, manacles, and all
                  the other hideous apparatus of that most abominable traffic; conditioning a home
                  passage for the crew of the Santissima Margaretta.
               The bargain was soon made; for the votes of some two or three of the officers, who
                  were opposed to the conversion of the late honoured and honourable cruiser into
                  one of those lazar-houses of the ocean, a slaver, were overpowered by the
                  interested majority, and the Sea-King letter of marque was converted into the
                  Santa Maria Brazilian slaver; while her American build with the stars and stripes
                  constantly preserved her from search;
                  and perhaps more than this, her man-of-war rig and heavy battery, which she now
                  took no pains to conceal, caused her constantly to be mistaken for an American
                  sloop of war—to favour which deceit her officers were always provided with the
                  uniform of the United States, her men wore the regular frocks of the service, and
                  she was handled so shipshape and man-o'-war fashion that she was actually on more
                  than one occasion saluted as a United States vessel by English and French cruisers
                  on the Cape Coast. Her first essay at buccaneering was accidental; for having
                  fallen short of water and happening to overhaul a large English merchant ship,
                  which was no difficult matter for her to do, since she had the heels of almost
                  anything afloat of her own tonnage, and in light weather would have bothered the
                  fastest frigate, the crew, in virtue of the democratic principle of the rule of
                  the majority, divided against paying for the supplies which they had the power to
                  take; and in consequence, the British master on his return to London entered his
                  complaint that he had been plundered of water, seventy casks of pork, a set of
                  spare sails, besides some old London Dock port wine and genuine cordial gin from
                  the private stores of the captain, by a United States sloop of war of sixteen
                  guns, which had brought her to, between Abaco and the Hole in the Wall. But
                  whereas the said worthy master insisted, which was perfectly true, that the
                  aforesaid American sloop of war had no name on her stern, he was dismissed with a
                  flea in his ear by the Secretary, and was ever after suspected by his owners of
                  being a very great rogue, and of having made away with the missing goods for his
                  own advantage; in fact, had he not possessed some trifling share of the vessel,
                  and made good the losses out of his own pocket, it is highly probable that he
                  would have been disgracefully deprived of his command.
               With regard to the Santa Maria, however, from that time forth it was proved of her
                  how true is the old French saying, que ce n'est que le
                     premier pas qui coute; for from that time forth, having once got a
                  taste of the sweets of English plunder, the crew insisted that they had served so
                  long against John Bull, that it came natural to have a shy at him, and
                  consequently poor Johnny was pillaged remorselessly, but, to do the worthy crew of
                  the Sea-King justice, always with the greatest politeness and without any show of
                  violence, of whatever appeared most valuable and least weighty, such as valuable
                  dry goods, choice wines, and above all, specie; and, greatly to the amazement of
                  both governments, constant complaints were made of depredations committed by an
                  American man-of-war on the British commerce. Still, as Manly's skilful system of
                  disguising the ship was persevered in, and as no complaints were made from any
                  ship masters except Englishmen, the complaints were set down by both the
                  governments to the account of the querulous rancour of skippers who had suffered
                  losses from the American cruisers during the late war, and could not lay aside
                  their bitter feelings on the return of peace.
               Never as yet had they, however, committed any deed of violence or outrage, nor
                  offered any wrong to any but the one hated flag of Great Britain. Often they had
                  succoured American vessels in distress, and once had done good service in beating
                  off and destroying a genuine Isle of Pines pirate, which was in the act of
                  capturing a New York packet ship, which had got too far to the southward; of which
                  fact they had testimonials and certificates so strong from the master and
                  passengers of the good ship American Eagle, that it was believed they would avail
                  to procure a free pardon for all the crew as regards any ordinary delinquency or
                  crime. But on the unlucky night when she fell in with, and fired into, the Sparrow
                  Hawk, she had a full cargo of slaves on board, and the deck was unfortunately in
                  charge of a junior officer, who madly gave the word to fire, without the slightest
                  necessity, since the Sea-King had the heels of the Sparrow Hawk, and could have
                  distanced her without firing a shot.
               Now, however, all hands felt that as regarded that particular vessel, and if she
                  should tell the tale as against the United States in general, they had committed
                  the unpardonable crime, and fancying that the halter was already about all their
                  necks, they fancied also, that there was nothing left but to fight for it. It was
                  under this hallucination that they committed the egregious error of hoisting the
                  bloody flag, which they had never shown before; though some of the worst fellows
                  on board, who thirsted to become actual pirates, and riot in lust and blood, had
                  prepared one, for any occasion. That occasion was offered by the reappearance of
                  their beloved chief, Manly; and his sanction of it can be accounted for only by
                  supposing him to have been in one of those moods of terrible excitement, bordering
                  upon insanity, into which it is said persecution will drive wise men; owing to the
                  late annihilation of the party with which he had cast his lot, and in some measure
                  to the enthusiastic rapture which he felt as a sailor, on being once again on the
                  deck of the vessel in which he had so often sailed to deeds of honour and of
                  daring, and which he loved with a love passing that which a landsman can conceive
                  one bearing for anything inanimate; perhaps, too, there was connected with this,
                  at first thought, an idea of fighting his ship against the Spanish, and taking
                  vengeance on the Gachupinos, for the massacre at Guanaxuato, which
                  he was well aware he could do under no flag of any civilized government.
               With quiet, however, cool reflection came; and while Frederick Atherley and his
                  officers were conversing with the Spaniards, Manly, who with Montgomery had been
                  concealed in one of the state-rooms,
                  with injunctions to keep their heads shut, fell into a deep train of musing, and
                  thence into a profound melancholy; as he began to perceive, now that the heat of
                  passion had faded from his mind, the strait into which he had thrust himself.
                  Manly, though a man of tremendous passions, which he lacked at times the power or
                  perhaps the will to govern, though he had in many instances, particularly as
                  regards the sex, perverted his great talents to evil ends, was not altogether a
                  bad man, or a man without principles of a certain sort. He would have robbed a
                  friend of a lovely wife, or fair daughter, without a moment's hesitation, and
                  thought he made ample reparation by receiving, without returning, as many fires as
                  the gentleman thought proper to demand, but he would not have robbed an enemy of a
                  cent to purchase Paradise. He would have shot his kinsman like a mad dog, in fair
                  duello, on any the merest punctilio; but he would not have raised a weapon against
                  an unarmed person, or stabbed his direst enemy in the dark, to save his own soul.
                  In his code all trade or traffic was dishonourable, and beneath the character of a
                  gentleman; how then could he condescend to become the lowest, basest, and most
                  sordid of all traders, a trader in human flesh? How, to become a wholesale robber
                  of the seas, a general butcher, a promiscuous assassin? All this, and much more,
                  boiled upon his brain, and boiled over on the instant, as soon as he was left to
                  commune with his own thoughts; ay, much, much more! For, if there was one thing on
                  earth which he loved more than the fantastical creation of his heated soul, which
                  he chose to call honour, it was his country—the United States, the continent of
                  America, and liberty! Yes, he loved liberty, not for itself, nor that he very
                  clearly knew what he himself understood by the word; but that it was the watchword
                  of his country, the abstraction for which she and all her sons were ever prompt to
                  bleed, and hold their loss of blood a gain to human nature. At the commencement of
                  the war of 1812, being too old to enter the regular service, and yet being a
                  thorough sailor, an art and science which he had acquired as the owner and acting
                  commander of the finest yacht then in America, which he had used not merely in
                  creeping along shore, but in visiting the West Indies, the Spanish Main, the
                  British Isles, the Mediterranean, nay! even the northern seas and the coasts of
                  the Skagerack and Cattegat, he fitted out at his own expense, with the relics of a
                  princely fortune, which he had madly lavished in his younger days, the noble
                  barque the Sea-King, which he had himself commanded, being able also to command
                  from his known qualities as a gentleman, as well as a sailor, the assistance of
                  gentlemen for his subordinates, and, by his well known munificence and success,
                  the ablest mariners as his crew. Unhappily a habit of roving begets a taste for
                  roving; and a habit of blood a taste for blood; so that when the war ceased, and
                  Othello's occupation ended, Hamilton, alias Manly, could not settle down to any
                  peaceful occupation. The immense gains which he had easily acquired during his
                  glorious career as the privateersman, were as easily lavished as acquired. Light
                  winnings are light losings, says the proverb. He was therefore unable, for want of
                  pecuniary means, to resume his station as a gentleman of leisure in his native
                  city, even had there been no other causes to prevent it; but there were other
                  causes.
               His seduction of Mrs. Sutherland, who had eloped with him, almost a bride, leaving
                  our hero a mere child, had been what it is the fashion to call a bad
                     business! In other words, a case of treachery and domestic baseness, of
                  the worst and most odious order. The elder Sutherland was a gentle, quiet, shy,
                  secluded scholar, detesting society as much as he adored his beautiful young
                  wife—Hamilton, who, rich as he was, through his careless prodigality and
                  recklessness of character, was often deeply involved, he had befriended in every
                  way—His house had been his friend's house; his purse his friend's purse; and, on
                  one occasion, when, in an affair also about a lady, his friend Hamilton had needed
                  a second, his sword had been his friend's sword. His friend was a man of the
                  world, he was not; of the gay world, he detested the gay world; of society, he
                  eschewed society; but his wife—his beautiful young wife! would it not be cruel,
                  would it not be unjust to deprive her of society; and society, in her, of its
                  brightest ornament? And who so fit as his friend, whom he would have trusted with
                  his soul, to take charge of his soul's best treasure? His friend did take charge
                  of the treasure, and found it such a treasure, that he converted it to his own
                  use: in other words—though he was a man of honour—stole it.
               Which was the tempter, which the tempted, 'twere difficult to tell; and, if easy,
                  useless. Probably both! For, in our creed, there is such a majesty, such a might
                  in the innocence of a truly virtuous woman, that the maddest libertine that ever
                  lost his own soul for the pleasure of destroying those of others, would as soon
                  rush voluntarily into the abyss to which his courses are urging him, as meet the
                  ineffable scorn of her calm indignation, were he to dare assay her virtue. 
                     
                        It is said, that a lion will turn and flee
                        From a maid in the pride of her purity;
                     
                   and, in our mind, a braver, if brave, and a wickeder, if wicked, creature
                  than a lion, even a man, will turn and flee rather than dare attack a holier
                  thing, and a stronger thing in her purity, if pure, than the chariest maid who ever lived—a
                  virtuous and loving wife.
               But Hamilton did assay Isabella Sutherland; and therefore, in our creed, it is
                  possible that Isabella Sutherland gave him some encouragement; and he won her,
                  and, and—as I have said, it was a bad business.
               
               The worse, that it was known that Sutherland was not a fighting man; and
                  therefore, although no one questioned his courage, neither asked nor received
                     honourable satisfaction of the honourable man who had most
                  dishonourably robbed him of his wife.
               The worse yet—when it became known why he neither asked nor received that
                  satisfaction—when it was known, that on being informed that his honourable friend
                  was ready to give him honourable satisfaction, he exclaimed—"God forbid—God
                  forbid, that I should rob the miserable girl of the only being she has on earth to
                  love or cherish her. He will leave her soon enough without; and she will suffer
                  enough. God forbid!"
               It is true that honourable men thought this very odd reasoning, and Mr. Sutherland
                  a very odd and rather tame individual; but not the less for that did they think it
                  a very bad business for Jem Hamilton.
               And worst of all did the whole world think it, when it became known that Mr.
                  Sutherland had become a whole misanthrope, and a half maniac, and that, at times
                  ignorant when his wife's infidelity commenced, he doubted his own child's
                  legitimacy, and treated Harry always coldly and morosely, and at times harshly and
                  even cruelly.
               This bad business it was which led to the yacht, and the far distant
                  voyages; and Isabella Sutherland was the companion of them so long as her life
                  lasted; but she soon pined away, and faded like a flower scorched by too hot a
                  sun. She was not too proud to sin; but, alas! like too many of us, she was too
                  proud to bear the reproach that follows sin.
               She died, and the long voyages became longer; the wild courses wilder; and
                  Hamilton, or Manly—for from that day he assumed the name under which we first saw
                  him—became what we find him.
               The war followed, and he rushed into it; the war ended, and he rushed into another
                  war—that of the South American Independence—all to avoid the war which never ends,
                  the war within himself. And when he rushed into that second war, he gave his
                  gallant vessel to his crew; and they, whom he, for his pleasure, had plunged into
                  privateering, having no use to make of the fine vessel which he gave them,
                  plunged, for their own pleasure, into slave trading and piracy. And so—for even
                  thus wonderfully do human consequences result from human causes—because, in the
                  year 179—, Mr. James Hamilton ran away with Mrs. Isabella Sutherland; five or six
                  as good young gentlemen as the general run of young gentlemen are, and a hundred
                  and twenty as noble specimens of seamen as ever stepped from stern to stern,
                  turned slave-traders and pirates in the year 1815; and in the summer next ensuing,
                  they and the noble officers and crew of the United States corvette Sparrow Hawk
                  lay about three miles distant from each other, on a lovely calm evening, off the
                  pier of Tampico, only awaiting the next morning to cut one another's throats with
                  all the zest imaginable.
               We have digressed a little—but, while these thoughts were passing through the mind
                  of Captain Manly below, it would appear that words and thoughts to nearly the same
                  effect had been passing among the crew on deck.
               The Sea-Kings wished to know, in the first place, whether Captain Manly had come
                  to resume his property—for in that case, they wished to say no! It had now become
                  their property, and Captain Manly, though a very worthy man, and most undeniable
                  sea-captain, had neither art nor part in her.
               The Sea-Kings wished to know, in the second place, whether Captain Manly had come
                  to resume his command of the Sea-King in her novel career; and whether he would
                  govern them as of old, receiving one-fourth of their gross gains for his share. In
                  that case, they would at once swear obedience to his commands, and follow him, as
                  they said themselves, "into the mouth of—, if he could steer them into it."
               These queries were propounded to Atherley, Morton, and the other subaltern
                  officers, by the crew with all due gravity and respect, and with such received by
                  the same. A brief consultation was then held on the quarter-deck, in which it was
                  agreed among the officers, that the advantages to be gained by Manly's resuming
                  the command would be so great as to justify their losing rank to attain that end;
                  and they all agreed each to decline one grade, Frederick Atherley to be first luff
                  in lieu of captain, and all the others so in rotation.
               This being duly settled, Atherley descended to the cabin, where he propounded to
                  Hamilton the questions of the crew; Montgomery, who had been as silent as his
                  friend since the arrival of the Spaniards, and as thoughtful, raised his head
                  quickly and looked in his face inquiringly.
               "I will speak with you, hereafter, Mr. Montgomery," said Hamilton, bowing low;
                  "first, I must answer these good fellows. You will allow me to do so myself, and
                  in my own words, Captain Atherley? If so, please lead the way."
               "I follow you," replied the other, bowing in his turn, and in another moment they
                  stood together on the quarter-deck, whereon Manly had so long ruled supremely.
               
               "And so, my lads," he said in his own clear, heart-filling tones, "and so you
                  think so ill of me, your old captain, as to fancy that under any circumstances, by
                  any possibility, I could prove such a land-lubber as to unsay my say; or like an
                  Indian giver, regret my own gift, and come back to look after it! I am sorry, I
                  say, my lads, that you hold this opinion of me, for I must have done something
                  mean or niggardly while I commanded you, that you should now believe me niggardly
                  or mean!"
               "No! no!" from all hands, gradually waxing into a shout—"No! no! Manly—never,
                  never!"
               "Be it so! I am glad to hear it. But now to set your hearts at rest for ever, the
                  Sea-King is none of mine. To you I gave her when I left you, and yours she is, for
                  me, and shall be for ever. Are you satisfied now?"
               "Ay! ay! three cheers——"
               "No! no!" interposed fifty other voices. "We want you to come back to us—We want
                  that you should never leave us more. We want you to be once more our captain."
               "That, my lads, is a question," he replied, half doubtfully, and scarce knowing
                  how to answer them—"a question which requires some consideration. You know that if
                  you make me your captain, your captain I will be—all in all!—all or nothing! No
                  half ways for Jack Manly! No votes of majorities, no caucuses on my ship-board—If
                  I say go, go you must—if I say do this, done it must be; or—you understand
                  me?"
               "Ay! ay! go on! go on! Manly."
               "You know, also, that if I say, ay! I will do ay! If I say no! I will do no!"
               "To be sure we do!—say, ay! say, ay!"
               "I must be sure, men, before I say 'ay!' that I can do 'ay!' and, therefore, my
                  lads, to-night, I will say neither ay nor no; but I will think it over ere I
                  sleep, and so soon as my foot is on this quarter-deck to-morrow, you shall have my
                  answer. Will that suit you?"
               "If we can't have no better—but——"
               "'Taint no use argufying along o' him," said an old quartermaster, hitching up his
                  waistband, "When he says he'll do a thing, why, he'll do't; and if he says he
                  won't, why all —— won't make him!"
               "And if that ere bloody cruiser works in and lays us alongside?"
               "If any ship that floats lays the Sea-King alongside," answered Hamilton, the old
                  leaven kindling his heart and flushing to his cheek—"So much the worse for her!
                  I'll fight her till she sinks, or I——"
            
            
               CHAPTER XXI.
               AS Manly descended the gun-room companion, followed by Atherley and the other
                  officers, the former said to him somewhat abruptly, "You will wish, I am nearly
                  sure, Captain Manly, to have some private conversation with your friend Mr.
                  Montgomery, whom I recollect very well in Philadelphia, before you decide on this
                  very important question, for very important it indeed is; and after that I am very
                  sure you will do us, who had so long the honour of serving you honourably, the
                  honour of communicating with us before you divulge your intentions to the crew.
                  There are some of us," he added in a very low tone, "who are not easy at the
                  position which we now hold, and who voted against the course we are pursuing, but
                  were overruled by the majority. We all marked what you said about being captain in
                  earnest, and no majorities or caucussing on board, and were glad to hear you say
                  so; for we see in it a chance of getting clear of this accursed traffic we are in.
                  They will swear to do anything if you will be their captain; and as for that
                  cruiser in the offing, I don't care a farthing for her. We can tow off here to the
                  westward in the night and get a better offing than she has against the sea-breeze
                  rising, and we can go five miles to her four any day."
               "How know you that, Atherley?" asked Manly quickly; "some of these new United
                  States twenties are very fast ships, and carry very heavy armaments."
               "This one is fast," replied Atherley quietly, "but we can beat her on
                  a wind and off a wind. She is heavier than we, but not so much. She carries
                  eighteen twenty-four pound carronades to our sixteen eighteens; but what is worse,
                  she has two long eighteens on her forecastle."
               "You seem to know all about her: how?"
               "She has chased me twice; and I have fought her once, and had the best of it in
                  both. Her commander, too, has been aboard of us."
               "On board of you! how?"
               "As our prisoner, or hostage rather, under the guns of the Moro."
               "What ship is she, and her commander?"
               "The Sparrow Hawk, and Henry Sutherland."
               "Harry Sutherland! By all the Gods!—"
               "Yes! captain, your old friend."
               "He knows you, then, and the Sea-King?"
               "Just so surely as I know you, captain."
               
               "This alters and complicates matters."
               "As how—for the better, or the worse, captain?"
               "It is too long to explain now. If he knew you not, all were plain sailing; as it
                  is, I scarce know whether to say better or worse. He owes me some kindness, and I
                  him some reparation. I will think of this; and, Atherley, be sure I will speak to
                  you, and that fully, after I have spoken with Montgomery, for I will take your
                  offer."
               "Use my own cabin as your own, then. I will tell Mr. Montgomery, who is in the
                  ward-room, that you wish to speak with him, and I will send you wine—"
               "No!" replied Manly, quietly; "no wine, till business is over. Then we will join
                  you in the ward-room."
               And with the word he passed into the cabin which had been so long his own abiding
                  place and home; in which she, whom alone of women he had truly loved, had
                  lived—had died. He thought of her, and milder, better thoughts came over him, as
                  they had done on the night when he first saw Harry Sutherland, and, after having
                  determined to make him his own and train him up to his own desperate trade—for her
                  sake relented.
               He buried his face in his hands as he sat down in the chair in which he had sat
                  hundreds of times before; and though he did not weep, for he was of too iron a
                  nerve, and of too self-sustained a pride to condescend to such weakness, the tears
                  which scorched his brain oozed into his eyes, and there swam until the heat of his
                  passions dried them up.
               At this moment Montgomery entered the room, still habited, as indeed he was
                  himself, in the full costume of Morelos' patriot lancers.
               A broad-leafed sombrero hat of long-napped white beaver, with its band adorned
                  with heavy silver ornaments; a tightly fitting jacket of dark blue velvet,
                  ornamented with innumerable hanging bell-shaped buttons of filagree silver; black
                  velvet breeches, with a double row of the same jingling decorations down the seam;
                  dressed deer-skin leggins, with tremendous silver spurs having rowels two inches
                  long at his heels; a long Toledo rapier, straight-bladed, with a cross hilt
                  hanging by a breast-belt richly embroidered on his right hip; a formidable dagger
                  and a brace of silver-mounted pistols at his girdle, completed his dress, which
                  set off his fine figure and singularly martial air to the utmost advantage.
               Manly gazed at him, as he entered with a steadfast and half melancholy eye, and
                  asked, as he signed him to take a seat,
               "Do you know the character of the ship on which you are aboard, Mr.
                  Montgomery?"
               "I can guess at it, at least, Captain Manly, by the ensign I saw flying at its
                  gaff soon after we came on board."
               "Ay! indeed!" replied the other thoughtfully, "that was a blunder. But let me tell
                  you, sir, bad as she may be, she has never sailed or fought under that ensign
                  yet—whatever she may do hereafter."
               "Indeed? what is she then?"
               "She was the finest privateer that ever floated, and I was her commander. She was
                  the Sea-King—known half the world over. She is now the Santa Maria, African
                  trader, slaver, rover, what you will. She has Brazilian papers."
               "And if you take command of her, as I have heard you asked to do, may I inquire,
                  under what flag and what commission she is to sail?"
               "You may, if you will answer me one question."
               "Ask it."
               "Do you intend to remain on board of us?"
               "I do."
               "She is to sail under my flag, and under a roving commission."
               "In other words, to become a pirate?"
               "You have said it."
               "We are friends, Manly, are we not? You have saved my life: we have fought side by
                  side, in the same good cause; we are here together, fugitives from a certain and
                  cruel fate at the hands of those dastardly Dons, on board this ship through your
                  agency—so that in fact you have a second time saved my life—we are friends, are we
                  not?"
               "So far we are, and it shall not be my fault if we continue not so."
               "Tell me, then, Captain Manly, what can induce you, you whose great deeds and
                  great glory have never yet been disgraced by any act of darkness, you whose name
                  in our country would be hailed with delight from one end of the Union to the other
                  as the bravest of the sons of liberty, the tamer of the insolent Red-Cross—you,
                  whose recent deeds here would but add to the lustre of your reception at home—what
                  can induce you, short of madness, to accept the office of a chief of buccaneers, a
                  captain of butchers, robbers, and assassins?"
               "Let me reply, Irishly, by another question—What can induce you, whose position is
                  at least as enviable as my own at home, to accept the office, not of a chief, but
                  of a private buccaneer—not of a captain of butchers, &c. &c., in the truth
                  of all which very Saxon, if not very polite terms, I fully coincide; but yourself
                  a journeyman, perhaps even an apprentice butcher, &c., &c., as
                  aforesaid?"
               He spoke not sneeringly, but sportively; and Montgomery gazed at him wistfully, as
                  if in doubt, before he made answer—
               "My question first—yours afterward. What can induce you to become captain? That is
                  my question."
               
               "It is the very same I have been asking myself these two hours; and I can give you
                  no answer, unless it be that I have given myself—'Faith, I don't know!'"
               "Can you avoid it, captain?"
               "What should hinder?"
               "If we go ashore there," replied Montgomery, pointing to Tampico, "we shall be
                  shot in the back by the Spaniards as traitors, rebels, I care not what. If we go
                  on board yonder, we shall be strung up by the neck to the yard-arm, as coming from
                  on board a notorious pirate."
               "Not quite so fast. The captains of American men-of-war know as well as any other
                  men in the world the virtues of 'any port in a storm,' and I doubt not the
                  commander of yon tight schooner would go on board a buccaneer himself, to avoid
                  being shot in the back. No, no—there is no talk about hanging. If you and I were
                  to jump into the dingy, how long would it take us to pull, with this ebb tide, to
                  yon cruiser?"
               "An hour, at most."
               "At most. Well, we have been fighting for Morelos and liberty—our uniforms vouch
                  for us—every American knows Morelos; every American loves liberty. We are
                  fugitives from a cowardly and cruel enemy, seeking the protection of our own
                  flag—who shall refuse it to us?—We have no explanation to offer, save that we came
                  aboard this ship first, and not wishing to remain on board a Brazilian slaver—that
                  without breach of honour we may call this ship—for there is honour even among
                  thieves, Montgomery—when our own flag is flying within sight, we bought his dingy,
                  and pulled ourselves on board, claiming the protection of our flag?"
               "Will they let you have a boat, hence, for such a purpose, Captain Manly?"
               "They will, sir. Why not?"
               "Will they not fear betrayal, sir?"
               "No man, sir, ever feared betrayal at my hands, who knew me; and these men know me
                  to their hearts' cores. Besides, they fear nothing. If they fight that cruiser it
                  will be for fun. They can escape from her as easily as I now speak it. If I leave
                  them they will escape her."
               "Then, to return to my old question, why will you not leave them?"
               "And again I will answer by another question; why shall we not leave
                  them?"
               "I cannot."
               "And wherefore?—"
               Montgomery was silent.
               "I answered your question, Montgomery, under an implied promise. Now I ask mine.
                  'What can induce you to become a buccaneer?'"
               "It will be long to tell."
               "We have the night before us, and I ask you in your own words, are we not
                  friends?"
               "We are," replied Montgomery, cordially, shaking his offered hand; "and you have a
                  right to ask it, and I will answer; but first, do you know who commands yon
                  cruiser?"
               "I do. Harry Sutherland."
               "Even so. Do you know the man? I mean personally."
               "I do," answered Manly, gloomily, "and owe him a deep debt."
               "Do you?—Do you?—I also. Manly, on your life, what debt? what sort of debt, I
                  mean?"
               "Of penitence," answered the other, "and deepest reparation."
               "And I of the deepest, direst, deadliest vengeance. I cannot receive his
                  protection; rather had I be shot coward-like in the back by the Spaniard. I cannot
                  breathe the same air with him; it would stifle me. I cannot eat the bread of his
                  hospitality, it would choke me. Better disgrace, infamy, death on the
                  gibbet,——"
               "Ah! I remember—" replied Manly interrupting him, but in a meditative rather than
                  an abrupt manner—"I remember. You fought him and he pinked you; but you are not
                  the fellow to bear a grudge for that; it must be the cause then—what was it?
                  Speak, Montgomery, tell me. For something tells me here," and he laid his broad
                  hand on his breast, "that the crisis of all our lives is very near at hand. Nay!
                  do not answer, hear me; for I swear by—"and he uttered an imprecation too horribly
                  solemn to be here written down," if you stay on board this ship I stay also. I
                  leave no comrade to such a fate alone. If you have cause to be a buccaneer, I will
                  make that a cause why I will be a captain of buccaneers. Now answer me—why do you
                  so hate this Sutherland?"
               "Because throughout my life he has crossed me, thwarted me, conquered me. In the
                  paths of fame, of love, of vengeance. My star has ever paled before his; and yet I
                  know myself the higher mind, the loftier genius; as brave, as handsome, fifty
                  times more accomplished, fifty times more learned, ten thousand times more
                  resolute—for he is weak and fickle, though fierce and hasty as the waves on which
                  we float; while I—I—but pshaw! I must not turn braggart."
               "But tell me the cause, the cause! I must know all; our lives, our honours, our
                  souls, perhaps, are at stake on this cast. I must know all, or how shall I
                  decide?"
               
               "You shall know all. Now listen,"—and eagerly, vehemently, he began the recital of
                  their first boyish rivalry; of his own attempt to rescue the child from the
                  burning house; of his failure; of his bitter disappointment; of Sutherland's
                  arrival and success; of the hatred he conceived against him from that moment; of
                  the insult and defiance he then offered him, and of the vengeance he had then
                  resolved to take upon his head. He paused, literally for want not of words, but of
                  breath, so fiercely had he spoken, so vehemently had he lashed himself into fury.
                  He paused, and as he did so, Manly interrupted him again—
               "Ha! I remember—were you that boy? yes! yes! I remember—that was the first night I
                  ever laid my eyes on Harry Sutherland. It was very gallantly done of you both—of
                  you quite as gallantly as of him, for luck favoured him in that as the fire
                  increased the smoke diminished—and so he succeeded where you failed, by fortune's
                  favour. But what would you have? Every one can't win; there must be some luck in
                  every game one plays; and you will pardon me, my good Montgomery, if I say to you
                  that I consider all this very wrong, very unworthy of you; very unmanly, in a
                  word. I cannot conceive how Sutherland could have fought you on such grounds; and
                  so if this bit of boyish emulation, which ought to have made you friends, be all
                  that you have against Sutherland—"
               "All!" interrupted Montgomery, who now had recovered not his breath only, but his
                  coolness—"all! hear me! only hear me out. He went his way, and I mine. We met no
                  more. In my career I succeeded; he in his. I had forgotten, or, if not forgotten,
                  remembered only to smile at the boyish rivalry, and I not only rejoiced that our
                  paths in pursuit of honour lay diverse, but rejoiced to hear that he in his, as I
                  in mine, was in the ascendant. Years passed, I had achieved reputation, I loved—Oh
                  God! how I loved—I believed that I was loved in return—I was honoured, esteemed,
                  all but loved—had he not thrust his cursed presence in, I must, I should have been
                  loved—should have been happy—should have been a man—should have been anything but
                  what I am. He came. It was at Washington—they met, and it appeared, which I knew
                  not before, that they were acquaintances, friends, what knew I?—boy and girl
                  lovers, it may be, of old—I saw that she was glad to see him, that she liked him,
                  but I never dreamed she loved him, the rather that he was neglecting her, dancing
                  attendance on every pretty woman in the city, sighing his soul out at the feet of
                  that jilting jade Trevor, the very night when, for his sake, she refused me."
               "Ha!" exclaimed Manly, with deep emphasis. "Again!—I knew the crisis of our lives
                  was here; strange that their threads should have been so intermingled from the
                  first, and we not dream of it—but go on, though I know what is coming."
               "The very night, I say, that Anna Hamilton refused me for his sake, and told me
                  so, as I was going from her house with the agonies of h—at my heart, I met him—ay!
                  him—the preferred above me by that pure angel—descending the steps of Treyor's
                  door, fresh from her wanton company, fresh, perhaps, from her arms. We met—I
                  reproached, defied, challenged him—we fought—you know the rest! Now, have I cause
                  to hate him?"
               Manly paused, and mused deeply before he answered. "I cannot say ay!" he replied,
                  at last, "I cannot say no!—for if he wronged you, he intended, nay! he knew it
                  not. It is all a mystery—on the very night when you two first met, we three first
                  met—on that night, I brought Harry Sutherland on board this ship in which we now
                  sit. On the next day I sent him to Anna's father with commendations, which made
                  him at once one of the family."
               "You sent him, Manly?"
               "Tush! Manly not me. My name is Hamilton, the brother of her"—
               "Great God! And the seducer of Sutherland's mother!" exclaimed Montgomery,
                  starting.
               Hamilton glared at him for an instant, clinched his right hand, raised it, as if
                  he would have struck him, but after a pause dashed it against his own breast,
                  saying—" Thou hast said it!"
               There was a moment's pause, for both were thunderstricken. Hamilton, for we will
                  call him by his nom de guerre no more, recovered
                  himself the first, and continued: "To my certain knowledge they were engaged long
                  before she ever saw you, before she ever heard your name. So, you see he has not
                  wronged you."
               "Ha! has he not?" replied Montgomery, fiercely: "nor Anna Hamilton, perhaps; why
                  did he not marry her—why—"
               "Did he not marry her?"
               "Do you not know he did not?"
               "Shortly after your duel, I sailed for this country, and have returned no more,
                  nor sought for any tidings from a land whence I could hope for no good ones."
               "On my recovery, Sutherland had disappeared, no one then knew whither, but it soon
                  appeared that he was ordered to that very ship the Sparrow Hawk. He had left Anna,
                  without a word, without a farewell letter, without a parting token. Every one
                     knew that she was in despair, every one believed that she was
                  dishonoured."
               "Dishonoured! and by him! no! no! Impossible. He is incapable of it. You belie
                  him. No! no! Anna dishonoured—no! Impossible!"
               
               "Is he incapable of it? say rather of what is it he is not capable? Hark you! Did
                  you ever hear of a fair girl, Carlotta, the daughter of the governor, yonder?" and
                  he pointed with his hand in the direction of the city.
               "Surely; of course; what of her? what do you mean, Montgomery? speak, man!" cried
                  Hamilton, half believing that his companion had lost his senses through the
                  violence of his passions.
               "Listen. After I recovered from the wound I received that night, I heard what you
                  have told me, that he was engaged to Anna Hamilton before I ever saw her. Of that
                  wrong, therefore, I acquitted him; though for her dishonour, I was still resolved
                  to call him to account. But her, as a dishonoured thing, I plucked from my
                  heart-strings, though I had well nigh plucked them with her. I came hither, joined
                  Morelos, fought, how, you know, and with what fortune! A year ago I
                  was wounded; and then a long truce, which we all believed would end in a permanent
                  peace, followed. I came hither, was received hospitably, kindly, by the governor,
                  was pleased with Carlotta, loved her, first as an intelligent and artless child;
                  then as a lovely girl, a bewitching woman; then, then as my own—as my promised
                  bride—as my betrothed wife. Again, he came——"
               "Who came?"
               "Harry Sutherland."
               "Ha!"
               "Ay! ha! he was invited to dinner at the governor's, and I was asked to meet him.
                  I feigned urgent business at a distance, mounted my horse, and rode away I cared
                  not whither, determined not to return until the Sparrow Hawk should be gone. I
                  know not how long, nor where I tarried; I was half mad between hate, and jealousy,
                  and the desire of vengeance! I returned. The Sparrow Hawk was gone. SHE was gone
                  too."
               "SHE! who?" exclaimed Hamilton, springing to his feet and laying his hand on his
                  sword's hilt; "who?"
               "Carlotta!"
               "Whither?"
               "She is there, now!" said Montgomery, speaking very slowly through his set teeth,
                  pointing to the quarter where the Sparrow Hawk might be supposed to lie; "on board
                  his ship, another of his victims!"
               "Ha! there is no doubt then; my own, my adopted daughter; but Piercy, Piercy,
                  Piercy, my oath shall be kept; she shall be avenged, since I have failed to keep
                  her pure and happy. Now, sir," he added, turning to Montgomery, who, in his turn,
                  had been gazing on him, as if he thought he was now insane. "Now, sir, I
                  understand you, and I answer you. Vengeance can induce me to become a captain of
                  buccaneers. Now I can say with you, I cannot breathe the same air with him, it
                  would stifle me; I cannot eat the bread of his hospitality, it would choke me! I
                  ask but one thing more of heaven: place him but once within my sword's length, and
                  if he 'scape me—why—the gibbet!"
               He paused, and then called out in tones that made the cabin ring, "On deck,
                  there!"
               "Ay, ay, sir!"
               And in an instant a steward entered.
               "Tell Captain Atherley I will be glad to speak with him."
               Not a word was interchanged between those two, who remained alone together until
                  Atherley entered. Their hearts were too full for words.
               "Atherley, things have come to light this night, which must be avenged; but never
                  revealed. My career must be here, in this ship! must end here, in this ship! I
                  would not give the chance of capturing that cruiser, and slaying her captain with
                  this right hand—no, not to win the crown of the whole universe! Go, commune with
                  your officers; if you agree to fight that ship to-morrow, to the last shot in the
                  locker, beat to quarters and tell the men my terms. If they say ay! I am again
                  your captain!"
               Atherley bowed without speaking, and withdrew.
               "He does not half like it, Montgomery. If they say no, we will have the dingy, and
                  board the Sparrow Hawk alone, defy him to his teeth, and make him fight us to the
                  death! But, hark! hush! a cheer in the ward-room! They have decided, and for us!
                  They beat to quarters! A pause; Atherley's voice haranguing them; three cheers
                  from all hands! Now, to-morrow! to-morrow! His fate cries out, or mine! Whether of
                  the two, God knows!"
               "Amen!" said Montgomery. "But, if he escape thee, he has yet me to deal with, and
                  I have twice to be avenged to-morrow!"
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXII.
               IT was upon the morning of the day succeeding the end of the norther and the
                  almost miraculous escape of the Sparrow Hawk, that land was made from her tops;
                  and within an hour afterward a strange sail was discovered without the bar of
                  Tampico. Nor were the eyes of Sutherland slower than those of the rovers to detect
                  the ship which had already twice escaped him, though it was not till the ensuing
                  morning, when the calm was succeeded by a brisk sea-breeze, that he was perfectly
                  certain of her identity.
               With a sensation akin to rapture he beheld and recognised the Sea-King; for he
                  knew and felt that the advantage was all his own. He had the weather gauge, and
                  held his enemy at bay, with a dead lee shore behind him, so that he had now no
                  chance to escape by dint of his matchless sailing. Sutherland knew, too, by his
                  own personal experience and observation, the superiority of his own armament; the
                  whilom privateer being mounted only with sixteen twenty-four pound carronades,
                  while his own ship, in addition to twenty carronades of the same calibre, carried
                  two long twenty-four pounders on pivots upon the forecastle, giving him a fair
                  chance of disabling the rover before coming to close quarters.
               He beat immediately to quarters; the long guns were cleared away and double
                  shotted, arm-chests were emptied on the decks, and within twenty minutes of the
                  discovery of the rover, the Sparrow Hawk was prepared for action, and running down
                  at a tremendous rate on her anticipated prey.
               When he discovered, however, the red ensign floating at the Sea-King's gaff, the
                  exultation of the young captain was converted into fierce and bitter rage.
               "Aloft there!" he shouted.
               "Ay, ay, sir!"
               "Shake out your royals, and sheet home! alow and aloft, set the larboard studding
                  sails! so! Mr. Yarnall, show those infernal knaves the stars and stripes! give
                  them an ensign at every mast! Three cheers for our country and her flag!"
               And as the cheering ended, he ascended the forecastle and stood by the breech of
                  the long gun, around which were clustered Jack Jeer, the boatswain, and his
                  crew.
               "I think, Master Jeer," said Sutherland to the old tar, "we can speak to him now,
                  so that he shall understand our Yankee English. See if your gun cannot do
                  something for the Sparrow Hawk."
               "Ay, ay, your honour! That can she—I'll warrant her;" and he stooped over her
                  breech, took a long sight at the rover, and as he arose after elevating her a
                  trifle.
               "That'll do. Watch the roll of her—now she rises! fire!"
               The heavy piece exploded, and as the white smoke drifted away to leeward the ball
                  was seen to strike the billows a few yards short of her, and ricochetting from the
                  surface, made a great rent in her fore-sail.
               Immediately the Sea-King, which was heading towards them, braced sharp up on the
                  wind, fell off a little, and simultaneously eight bright flashes burst from her
                  gunwales, with a cloud of white smoke; but the iron hail of the carronades fell
                  short by a cable's length of the corvette, calling forth a derisive cheer from the
                  crew of the Sparrow Hawk.
               "A good shot, Jeer!" cried Sutherland, "but we must mend it. Get your foretacks
                  inboard, Mr. Yarnall. Your main and mizzen-topsails back. We will hold him there
                  till we have reduced his rags a little. Now, Master Jeer, if that gun's reloaded
                  I'll see if I can't beat you. Try a shot with the other long Tom, Mr.
                  Topblock."
               And as he spoke he sighted the forward gun carefully, and pulled the lanyard with
                  his own hand, exclaiming "Fire!"
               The two guns flashed almost simultaneously; Sutherland's a second or two the
                  first, and tremendous was the execution done.
               Harry's shot took effect in the head of the foremast; and after swaying for an
                  instant to and fro, down crashed fore-topmast, fore-top-gallant mast and
                  fore-royal, with all their pyramid of snowy canvass, dragging the
                  main-top-gallant-mast, with all its superincumbent spars, and the
                  mizzen-royal-mast after it.
               Topblock's shot cut the spanker-gaff asunder, and down went the head of that
                  important sail, with its atrocious blood-red ensign.
               Of all the stately spars which had lately stood erect on the rover, the stump of
                  the fore-mast only, the main-mast with the mainsail set, and the mizzen-mast,
                  remained standing; but the Sea-King, was, it must be remembered, barque-rigged,
                  and Topblock's shot had deprived her of all her after-sail, so that she now lay
                  virtually a mere wreck on the water.
               Three wild, exulting cheers burst from the lips of the crew, as again the
                  Sea-King's broadside was discharged, and again fell short of the corvette.
               "Let everything draw now, Mr. Yarnall; lay us across her bows, within half pistol
                  shot. We will rake her till she's sick of showing her red bunting to a
                  cruiser."
               And with the word, with her snowy canvass perfect and unspotted, and her three
                  starry ensigns floating sublime from her trucks, she swooped down like her own
                  glorious eagle upon the shattered pirate.
               
               Having now gained what is called the point of impunity, whence her own whole
                  broadside could sweep the decks of the rover from stern to stern with a hurricane
                  of round and grape, while only the bridle port guns of the Sea-King could respond
                  to her devastating fire, the fight might be said to be ended. But the pirates,
                  fighting with halters round their necks, fought indeed the fight of despair.
                  Hoisting three blood-red ensigns on the stumps of their masts, they replied with
                  musketry and hand-grenades most ineffectually, but not for that the less
                  resolutely, to the sustained and incessant cannonade of the Sparrow Hawk.
               At last their every cannon was dismounted; the very stumps of their masts were
                  shorn away flush with the decks; the blood streamed in torrents from her hawse
                  holes and scuppers, and of her crew, four-fifths lay prostrate on the decks.
               "Have you surrendered?" shouted Harry Sutherland, as the last mast toppled
                  overboard, and the last bloody ensign fell.
               "Not yet, sir," answered Manly in a firm, deep tone.
               "You can resist no longer; will you take quarter?"
               "Will you give it?" shouted Montgomery, for in the midst of all the havoc these
                  two, bearing, as it seemed, charmed lives, stood unwounded.
               "Surely I will. Range alongside them, Mr. Yarnall; heave the grapnells in; they
                  have no boats that will swim."
               And, obedient to his word, the stately ship ran round her bows, and fell alongside
                  her, their yards interlocking as they came together.
               At this instant, however, when the crew of the Sparrow Hawk, supposing the battle
                  won, were entirely off their guard, many of them having cast aside their arms, the
                  surviving pirates poured in, some twenty-five in number, three close volleys with
                  their muskets and pistols, before a shot could be returned, killing Yarnall
                  outright, with above thirty of the Sparrow Hawks, and severely wounding Topblock
                  and many others of the men.
               Sutherland, who stood in the very centre of the iron shower, escaped unharmed.
                  Under cover of this treacherous fire, the desperate pirates leaped forward with
                  cutlass and tomahawk, Manly and Montgomery leading; the former intent only on
                  dying by a soldier's weapon, not by the shameful halter; the latter bent on a
                  two-fold bloody vengeance.
               The surprise failed, however; for the marines, levelling their arms, poured in a
                  close volley, and charged bayonets, followed by the whole crew of the Sparrow
                  Hawk, with the exception of her captain only, who was engaged hand to hand with
                  the pirate chief, who had actually gained his own quarter-deck, though wounded
                  slightly by the bayonets of the marines. One other of the pirates only succeeded
                  in boarding the corvette. That one was Montgomery; and he was stricken down in the
                  rush by a blow on the head from a marine's musket butt, and fell stunned, and for
                  the moment senseless, close to the hatch of the cabin companion.
               Thereupon ensued a strange, and perhaps unparalleled scene. Every man and boy,
                  unwounded and able to ply a weapon, from the second lieutenant down to the ship's
                  cook, who were on deck when that act of deadly treachery was done, dashed forward,
                  madly beating the boarders of the rover back, and following them to their own
                  ship, where they pursued them into every nook and corner of the vessel,
                  slaughtering them without mercy, even to the wounded or the dying. Meanwhile, on
                  the deck of the victorious corvette, the two captains stood, in deadly duel, with
                  the man at the wheel, and the helplessly wounded, alone looking on as arbiters of
                  that fell contest.
               But fierce as it was, it was unequal; for Manly fought to die, only; and, either
                  paralyzed by a sense of guilt, or unwilling to injure further one whom he felt
                  that he had injured deeply, fought but weakly, and on the defensive.
               While the duel continued, Montgomery raised his head, dizzily, and gazed about
                  him, scarcely conscious, as it seemed, of what was passing. Suddenly perceiving
                  his proximity to the open hatchway of the companion, and appearing to be possessed
                  with some new and sudden frenzy, he gathered his limbs under him, unsheathed his
                  knife, and plunged headforemost down into the cabin, before any eye perceived
                  him.
               Meanwhile the blade of Sutherland had thrice pierced the broad chest of Manly, and
                  he fell severely wounded, but not slain outright, while the young avenger stood
                  erect, gloomy and terrible, above him.
               "Hamilton," he exclaimed, "Hamilton, destroyer of my father's peace, despoiler of
                  my mother's honour! Know you by whose hand you have fallen, know you by whom God
                  has avenged your crimes on your own guilty head?"
               "It is well, Henry Sutherland! It is well! I know all. I have looked, hoped, and
                  prayed for this. It is well, I say, and one good deed done, I die happy. Let me
                  make you the only amends I can now make for the ruin of your family, the misery of
                  yourself. Anna is not my brother's daughter, is not a Hamilton at all. Nay—hear
                  me—her true name is Piercy, the daughter of a noble English captain who died upon
                  his quarterdeck, which I had with difficulty conquered. Take her. There is no
                  obstacle. None of the guilty blood runs in her veins. I saved her, and he brought
                  her up. My brother has the papers."
               "Manly, at such a moment I think you would not lie to me."
               "Not for my life. Not for my soul. It is true, Sutherland, as true as that I—I—am
                  dying. For—forgive me, Sutherland."
               "As I pray that God may forgive me, Hamilton!"
               
               But, as he spoke, a fearful shriek from the cabin startled him, and these
                  appalling words, the very words of her hideous delirium—"My best beloved, my only
                  beloved Sutherland, save me! save me!"
               Sword in hand, he dashed down the companion—the cabin door stood open, but he was
                  too late.
               Carlotta lay outstretched in her innocent blood, but her glazing eyes met his with
                  a glance of gratitude, of confident and pure affection; while over her, with his
                  back toward him, stood her bloodthirsty slayer.
               Her lovely eyes closed for a moment, and reopened. She was dead; happy to die
                  unconscious of her lover's changed affection.
               Montgomery turned; and, as he turned, was cut down on the instant by Sutherland's
                  avenging weapon, before the avenger of blood had so much as suspected whom he
                  slew.
               But, as Montgomery fell, his deep voice filled Sutherland's ears with sudden and
                  most painful recognition.
               "Once, twice, thrice, four times, have you conquered me! My curse upon you, Harry
                  Sutherland!"
               And at the words, the young conqueror sunk down among the corpses with scarce more
                  life than they, and it was weeks and weeks, and the Sparrow Hawk had sailed
                  leagues on her homeward route, or e'er he awakened from the stupor into which this
                  shock and horror had plunged him.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               CONCLUSION.
               SUTHERLAND was still gazing on the sights of horror which surrounded him on every
                  side, when a tremendous explosion was heard without, louder than the simultaneous
                  discharge of ten-thousand pieces of the heaviest ordnance. In an instant the young
                  captain stood upon his blood-stained deck, and, as he surmised instinctively, the
                  Sea-King was no longer to be seen, a vast wreath of smoke black as ink had settled
                  down like a huge funereal pall over the spot where she had sunk, and a few blazing
                  and smoking spars and pieces of timber were still falling here and there into the
                  hissing waters. Fortunately, after the desperate attempt to carry the cruiser by
                  boarding, the last effort of the defeated pirates, the very impetus of the
                  collision with which they came together drove them apart again, and the conflict
                  for a few minutes was so severe on board the Sparrow Hawk that no one thought of
                  looking after the pirate; and the man at the wheel receiving no further orders
                  kept the ship steady, the effect of which was that the ebb tide which was running
                  strong, carried the pirate well to leeward of the corvette, and dead out to
                  seaward, as the latter was standing in with a fresh breeze from the Gulf. The few
                  moments which elapsed after the fight had ended, had been all bustle and
                  confusion; the sound of a woman's shriek from the captain's cabin, where no woman
                  was known to be, and the sound of a fierce conflict succeeding it, had called all
                  the unwounded officers and many of the crew below. This too had accidentally
                  tended to good; for no officer being left on deck of sufficient authority to order
                  the ship about in pursuit of the disabled and drifting picaroon, she had attained
                  the distance of nearly half a mile from the corvette before she blew up.
               The cause of the explosion was never known; but no one doubted that every
                  unwounded pirate had joined in the last desperate charge, and that, seeing all
                  lost, some maimed surviving desperado had fired the magazine, desperate of life,
                  and preferring any fate to the gallows.
               Such was the fate of the Sea-King! such the results of James Hamilton's first soft
                  sin—first breach of faith and honour, at which fashionable people half smiled,
                  even while they pronounced it a bad business.
               Horror-stricken and wonder-stricken as he was, Sutherland was a thorough seaman: his duty called, and must be
                  obeyed—besides, the dead were the dead, and what was done was done.
               The first thing was the care of the wounded; and of his own people, though many
                  had fallen by the close and well-aimed volley of the pirates' small arms, and many
                  more were badly cut by their sabres and haggled by their long knives, the
                  casualties were few in comparison with the loss inflicted on the pirates; of whom,
                  with the exception of Hamilton, if he were to be accounted one—for he still wore
                  his uniform as a colonel of Morelos' lancers, and no one could account for his
                  presence or that of Montgomery on board—not one was found alive. Two or three who
                  were but slightly wounded, when they saw that all was lost, had leaped overboard
                  and so perished, and one who was desperately, perhaps mortally maimed, had rolled
                  himself through a port-hole after his companions. The dead of the buccaneers were
                  cast overboard with small ceremony; those of the crew were cared for by their
                  comrades, and decently sewed up in their hammocks, ready to be committed with due
                  ceremony to the deep, when the time should come for their interment.
               In the mean time, Sutherland had ordered the ship about, and stood out to sea
                  under easy sail to repair damages, wash the decks, bury the dead, and care for the
                  wounded. Several hours elapsed before this melancholy task had been performed, and
                  it was drawing toward sunset, when the Sparrow Hawk stood once more into the bay,
                  with a Spanish flag at her fore, and two American ensigns flying, but all
                  half-masted, and with minute guns firing. Running as near to the pier as she
                  judged good, she clewed up her sails, and let go her anchor, and immediately after
                  the captain's barge was lowered, and he went on shore in person to account to the
                  authorities for what had occurred within their waters.
               Sutherland was a brave man, and in the case of the unhappy Carlotta he felt
                  himself innocent, yet he felt also how difficult it would be for him to prove it
                  to the bereaved and agonized parents; so that it was not a little to his
                  satisfaction, when, on inquiring for the governor, he was informed, that being
                  suspected of patriotism, or, in other words, rebellion, he had fled
                  from Tampico, with his whole family, on the approach of the loyalists.
               For the rest, he was referred to the commander of the royalist forces, who was in
                  full command and possession, and up to his ears already in sentences of exile,
                  death, confiscation, and the like. He received Sutherland with all the solemn and
                  stately dignity of an old Spanish grandee, listened to his explanation in regard
                  to the capture of the pirate attentively; took the deposition of his officers, and
                  declared himself perfectly satisfied. With regard to the fugitives, on being
                  informed that one was dead and the other desperately wounded, he waived his demand
                  for their surrender, which Sutherland did not judge it advisable to tell him,
                  would in no case have been admitted; and lastly, to do the hard and merciless old
                  loyalist justice, when the sad fate of Carlotta was brought before him, he
                  expressed all the sympathy and sorrow which could be expected from a man and a
                  father. At Sutherland's instance, he consented, irregular as it was, to hear
                  evidence in regard to her conduct on board the Sparrow Hawk; and, as it was easy
                  to prove by the officers and men that he had entirely given up his own cabins to
                  the use of the strangers, and by Juana that he had never been once for a moment
                  alone in her young lady's company, it was not difficult to establish the purity of
                  the unhappy maiden, and to preserve her honour, like herself, spotless and pure
                  from taint. The Spanish general declared that on the honour of a grandee he
                  believed her to have been as good and pure as his own children, and arm in arm
                  with the young captain followed her to her last home in consecrated ground, while
                  the minute guns of the corvette were answered by those of the castle, in both of
                  which it had been her strange fate to be awhile a sojourner.
               Nay, more; in token of regard and sympathy the general granted Sutherland's
                  request that Montgomery should be buried on shore and in consecrated ground—but
                  with no military honours, no tap of drum, or toll of bell—but silently, sadly,
                  solemnly, as one who had died guiltily, as in an unjust quarrel. Farther, he
                  promised to exert himself in order to obtain the pardon of Carlotta's father, and
                  subsequent intelligence reached Sutherland that he had kept his promise.
               No more time was lost; but on the third day after the action the Sparrow Hawk
                  weighed anchor, sheeted her topsails home, and, her duties accomplished, lay her
                  course with a fair wind for the capes of the Delaware.
               It must be remembered, here, that, until Sutherland saw Montgomery in his foreign
                  uniform boarding his ship at the head of the pirates, he had no conception that he
                  was in that part of the world, much less had he a suspicion that the Sieur de
                  Hautville, of whom he had heard as the unloved lover of Carlotta, was identical
                  with his former rival. Had he known that, assuredly he never would have yielded
                  one inch to the charms or blandishments of the hapless young Mexicana—generosity
                  and honour would alike have forbidden him.
               And now that he knew the truth—the whole truth—that his whole life had been one
                  chapter of errors—that like Don Quixote he had been ever fighting windmills and
                  flying chimeras—that his Anna—how could he dare to call her his, after all his
                  delinquency, all his infidelity?—was of no kin to the betrayer of his mother's
                  honour, the murderer of his father's happiness—how did he curse his precipitancy, how curse his want
                  of courtesy, of faith, of self-respect, in sending her no message, in leaving her
                  without so much as a sign! How did he watch and pray for Hamilton's recovery!
               Slow was that recovery, tedious, and oft interrupted, and when it was complete, so
                  far as it could be called complete, the surgeon pronounced, what the patient felt
                  beforehand, that it was but for a time; and at Hamilton's express desire and
                  entreaty, stated at last, that, before the leaves which were beginning already to
                  grow sere on the woodland shores which they were coasting, should again be green
                  in spring, he would sleep with his fathers.
               For a long time Hamilton positively refused to see Sutherland or speak with him;
                  but, at length, when the young man, suspecting the cause of his obduracy, opened
                  his heart to the surgeon, in so far as he could do with propriety and honour, and
                  that functionary satisfied the invalid that, in the whole matter of Carlotta,
                  Sutherland was indeed entirely blameless, he began to see that he might have been
                  as much misinformed and mistaken in other matters, and took time to consider.
               Then, reflecting on the first wrong he had done Sutherland, the most grievous
                  perhaps that can be done to any man, and reviewing the harsh, haughty,
                  unforgiving, and uncompromising character of Montgomery, and remembering, too,
                  that he was nearly approaching to that awful day when he must be judged in the
                  spirit for things done in the flesh, he relented.
               Many strange feelings, many strong thoughts were in the minds of those two men so
                  strangely thrown together, and so fatally thus far for both, as they met, and
                  exchanged forgiveness, and shook hands.
               Tears were in the eyes of both, and prayers on their tongues, and perhaps both
                  these for the first time with both.
               Long explanations followed, and all that had been dark was made light; and much
                  that had appeared black as night with pestilent guilt, was alleviated, if not made
                  white as snow. But the end was not then, nor could be till they landed.
               For the rest, mutual and entire silence was agreed on. The officers were
                  convinced, the crew persuaded, frightened, and bribed into the belief, that
                  silence was the best policy, and at the worst, if talk they would, they knew but
                  little about which to talk.
               At length they landed, and, to prolong suspense no longer, when the real action
                  and agony is over; all things turned out to have gone better for Sutherland than
                  he had hoped, or than he deserved. From the instant of his abrupt departure,
                  William Hamilton had suspected its reason, knowing it to be in some sort connected
                  with his father's death, and though the whole subject was of such a nature that
                  Anna could not be informed of it, he yet accounted to her for his unaccounted
                  absence, and persuaded her that she was still loved, and he still faithful. Had he
                  been detained a week longer at Tampico, or had he touched at Vera Cruz or the
                  Havana, he would have received letters explaining all, and entreating him to
                  return home as soon as duty would permit.
               The meeting between the brothers was most affecting, but both felt that God is
                  wiser than man, and that it was indeed better for James Hamilton to die, as he
                  did, before the leaves were green, in penitence and peace; and when the world knew
                  that the debauched and debaucher, the wild, wicked James Hamilton was one and the
                  same with the great Captain Manly, they forgot the vices of the one in the glories
                  of the other.
               James Hamilton died before the leaves were green, but not before he had given his
                  adopted daughter, Anna Hamilton, for she was never suffered to know that she was
                  not the daughter of the good man she had ever loved as a father, to Sutherland,
                  his slayer.
               But none, not even William Hamilton, ever knew that it was the sword of Harry
                  Sutherland which led to the disease that cut off his brother; and Anna never was
                  told the sad tale of Carlotta; nor yet the lamentable end of the gifted yet
                  perverse Montgomery. But these two were the only concealments, from that day
                  forth, between Harry Sutherland and his beautiful wife. She always said that she
                  was the happiest of wives and he the best of men. But he knew the truth, what
                  indeed he had been; and in that truth, lived and died not a sadder, but a wiser
                  and a better man.
            
            THE END.
