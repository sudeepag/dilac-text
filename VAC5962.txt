               CHAPTER I.
               INTRODUCTORY—THE "BEAVER."
               BEFORE the discovery of copper, there were but few inducements to visit the
                  sterile shores of Lake Superior, and it remained an almost terra incognita, except to the traders, who were lured thither by
                  the hope of gain from the Indians, and the employeés of the rival fur companies.
                  They had fully explored its shores upon both sides, from Sault de Ste Marie to La Point—had
                  trapped and fished in every stream—builded their lonely camp fires in every bay
                  and upon every headland, and circled every island. There was not a spot where
                  human footsteps could stray, that they had not visited, or a locality with which
                  they were not familiar, and though men of little or no education, experience had
                  made them skillful boatmen and pilots, and the successful rivals of even the red
                  men themselves in woodcraft.
               Here to-day and away to-morrow—perhaps located but for a single winter in a place
                  to which they would never return, very few formed lasting attachments, although
                  the great majority had taken a squaw as a wife, (to be deserted whenever interest
                  or inclination dictated) and left behind half-bred children, that would never even
                  know the name of their father. The prevailing opinion with regard to this matter,
                  could be summed up in the words of one of their number, "they made good Indians
                  but very bad white men." So it was better by far to leave them in ignorance and
                  superstition, than attempt to graft them upon civilization, of which they would
                  only learn the bad, without the slightest striving for the good!
               So common, however, had quick desertion followed these quasi marriages, that the
                  better portion of the Indians—all indeed except those who were not thoroughly
                  debased by associations with the white man and his "fire-water," looked more than
                  anxiously, when they saw their daughters receiving presents from or associating
                  with the white man, and strove by every means in their power to save them from the
                  ruin that was almost certain to follow.
               That there were honorable exceptions—men who respected the lightly binding
                  marriage vows, cannot be denied; but they were the exceptions that proved the
                  rule. Others there were, also, who wandered among the Indians for years, in fact
                  lived and died with them, without forming a single feminine attachment.
               Of the latter class was Louis——or "the Beaver," as he was most commonly called.
                  The former title had been given him by the French, and the latter, "Ah-meek" by
                  the Indians; but as to what his paternal one was, he might have been questioned in
                  vain. When a mere child he had been captured by the Chippewas, while upon the war
                  path in a distant part of the country, and those who had been engaged in the
                  bloody fray, had long since been gathered to their fathers. That he was of white parentage no one
                  would deny. With his earlier years passed among the Indians, and his latter ones
                  among those of his own color, he was perfectly familiar with the language and
                  manners of both; and now, when over forty winters had lodged their snow amid his
                  hair, and the plow of time had left many a furrow in his weather-bronzed face, he
                  led a sort of hybrid-hermit life. And like his associations so was his home. It
                  was a lonely cabin, situated just far enough from the Sault to be able easily to supply his wants, and sufficiently so to
                  enjoy all the advantages of the solitude of the forest.
               With the news of the discovery of the metals, especially of copper, his wonted
                  habits were sadly broken in upon. The spots where he had been used to trap for
                  beaver and otter—the quiet bays where the wild geese and ducks had been accustomed
                  to rest unmolested for years—the leafy coverts where he had never sought the shy
                  deer in vain, and even the waters where the mottled trout frequented, were overrun
                  with explorers, blasting the rocks and tearing up the earth. The searchers after
                  mineral wealth left no stone unturned to gain knowledge. They sought the Indians
                  and acquired but little—paid high prices and were deceived.
               "Go to Ah-meek," they said, when they found their duplicity unmasked. "His head is
                  covered with grey hairs. The snows of many winters are upon it. He is wise. He
                  knows where the Pewaubic sleeps in the earth."
               They turned to the voyageurs and found them engaged to the Hudson Bay Company, or.
                  (by their means) to other parties.
               "Go to the Beaver," they replied, when questioned. "If there was any one that
                  could guide them, it was him. He had spent all his days upon the shores of the
                  lake, and not even the Indians knew half as much."
               "Who is 'the Beaver?' they asked.
               The voyageurs shook their heads at the ignorance, and pointed to where the smoke
                  of a fire was curling skyward through the tall trees. Thither went the heads of
                  the party, and saw both the man and his home. The latter was a simple, strong, but
                  rudely constructed cabin—such an one as can be found almost anywhere on the
                  north-western frontier. The former was the type of a race that are fast fading
                  away—the connecting link, as it were, between the white and the red man, between
                  civilized and savage life.
               It was near sun down. The old man was seated upon a broad, flat stone, that
                  answered all his purposes for a work-bench, dressing a few fish that he had just
                  taken. They saw that he was far above the usual height, broad-shouldered,
                  long-armed and limbed and chested, like a giant. His hair hung in waving masses of
                  iron gray around his neck, and his bronzed face was framed in heavy whiskers of
                  the same hue. Like his mode of living his dress was hybrid—partaking both of the
                  civilized and savage. The material had all been gathered in the wilderness and
                  dressed by his own hands, but it was fashioned more after the manner of the white
                  than the red man. The cariboo had been robbed of his tough hide for the hunting
                  shirt, moccasins and leggins, and the otter of its soft fur for the facings and
                  the cap. From beneath these, undergarments of heavy woolen peeped forth, and the
                  sash that girdled his waist was of unmistakable silk—scarlet, and such an one as
                  an officer might once have been proud of though now sadly frayed and faded. The
                  rifle that lay within reach of his hand was of American manufacture. So, too, the
                  knife that he was using, and the hatchet in his belt; but the bow and arrows and
                  pipe, that could be seen suspended within his little home, told of Indian
                  skill.
               With the first echo of their footsteps, he raised his head and revealed the eyes,
                  black and sparkling as anthracite, the Roman nose, broad, high forehead, firmly
                  set lips, and neck with sinews standing out like whip cords. One glance was
                  sufficient to have satisfied any one that he was a man of iron will, dauntless
                  courage and unusual strength. A man that once a friend would remain so to
                  death.
               "Are you the 'Beaver?'" asked the leader of the little party.
               "Ahem!"
               He was measuring them with his sharp eyes—testing them with a mental gaze—trying
                  to determine the object of their visit before he answered, although both nature
                  and his wild wood training had made him uncommonly reticent. But they fancied that
                  he had not heard them, and repeated the question:—
               "Are you the man that is commonly called 'The Beaver?'"
               "Wal, yes. Ther Injins first named me so, and since then everybody appears ter
                  have taken it up."
               "Then we came to see you."
               "What kin yer want of me?"
               His language was the true, uneducated frontier dialect. A dictionary and grammar
                  were things he might have heard of but never seen. In polite circles he would have
                  been scoffed at, but in the locality where his lot had been cast and upon the
                  platform of sound common sense, he would have been the peer of almost any man.
               "You are acquainted with all parts of the lake?"
               "Every foot of it."
               "And the streams and rocks?"
               "E'enermost as well as ther fishes and ther deers themselves."
               "And the headlands and islands?"
               "Yes. Yer want'er go on er fishin' and huntin' tower, don't yer?"
               "No. We are searching for copper mines and wish to employ you to guide us. We will
                  pay you well for your services."
               "What!" and the black eyes flashed with an almost dangerous light. "What! are you
                  some of them chaps that ar eround tearin' up God's airth, blowin' up God's rocks,
                  cut-tin' down God's trees, turnin' aside God's rivers, and searchin' for ther
                  secrets that he has hidden?"
               "We are surveyors and geologists."
               "I don't know nothin about them ar names, but I do know that sich as ye ar drivin'
                  away ther game, and bribin' ther Injins ter see what ther Lord Almighty gave them
                  for huntin' grounds and erdwellin' place."
               "Do you not kill the deer and take the fish when you are hungry?"
               "Ter be sure."
               "And where do yer get the material for your canoes and bows and arrows?"
               "From ther woods," and the old trapper laughed at the absurdity of the
                  question.
               "And where the iron that is made into your traps, and manufactured into steel for
                  the barrel of your rifle, and the lead that you use for bullets?"
               "From the arth, sartinly."
               "And do not the rocks have to be blasted, the trees cut down, and the earth torn
                  up to procure them?"
               "Ahem!"
               The old man saw at a glance the foolishness of his argument. The one educated and
                  used to mental combat, was far too powerful an antagonist for him to cope with.
                  Never before had any one attempted to convince him of the injustice of his
                  opposition to the march of progress. They had either sneered at his stupidity, or
                  abused him for his obstinacy. Now the cobwebs were swept from his brain in an
                  instant. He saw that he must be left high and dry upon the rocks or swim with the
                  current. Still it was very hard for one of his nature to give up the feeling that
                  had been riveted around his heart by long years. Well was it therefore that his
                  visitor continued:
               "You say, my friend, that God gave this lake and its surroundings to the red man
                  for a hunting ground and home. It would be useless to deny that, but he also
                  pitied the white man across the great ocean, and gave him the knowledge to find
                  and the skill to develope the riches that are hidden in the soil. Had it not been
                  His will, do you think that He would have permitted any man to penetrate the
                  secret?"
               "I could'nt sarcumvent yer knowledge, stranger, ef I tried. I am er honest man,
                  though er unlarned one, and I believe in and love ther good Lord even ef I have
                  bin brought up in the wilderness. So I tell yer that yer have opened my eyes ter
                  look at the matter as I never did erfore."
               "Then you can no longer have any feeling that we are doing wrong?"
               "Sartinly not. He," and the old man pointed reverently to the sky, "He wouldn't
                  permit yer ter do it."
               "And you will give us the benefit of your experience—that is if we pay you for
                  it?"
               "I don't know that. I don't know that," was the musing reply. "Fer over forty
                  years, man and boy, I've dwelt on this here lake, and arned my livin with that ar
                  rifle, and them ar traps, and it would be
                  most mighty hard ter give them up now."
               "But you are getting old—the work would be much more easy, and in a few months you
                  could earn far more than you could possibly do in years."
               "Old? Yes, yes," and raising his hand to his head and brushing away the tangled
                  locks from his honest face, he continued, "yes, yes, ther topmost branches of ther
                  tree is dead, and er few more winters may sap their trunk. But ther heart is sound
                  yet, and he who would try ter bend even er limb may find ther strength of ther
                  roots."
               Ther was nothing vain or vaunting in the speech, although his eye kindled, and his
                  sinewy hand was struck upon the breast with a report like a pistol. It was simply
                  the natural sequence of a mind that had been trained amid danger and exertion, and
                  was confident of its ability to do and dare to the end; the natural speech of a
                  man, somewhat proud perhaps, of his giant frame and strength, and yet one who knew
                  that death would certainly come.
               "But." he continued after a brief pause, during which, simple hearted as he was,
                  he had evidently been pleased by their admiration, "but you said sumthin' about
                  airnin' money, stranger, didn't yer?"
               "Yes, that we would pay you more for a few months' services than you could gain in
                  years of hunting and trapping."
               "Very like—very like. Ther game and ther otter and beaver and mink and rats ar
                  gitting scarce, that am er fact, and I've thought often of movin'. but somehow
                  couldn't give up that old spot. It might not be like yer home but yer couldn't
                  love it any better."
               "That is a natural and an honorable feeling. You would not be long away, however.
                  Our explorations will only continue during the summer months."
               "And mighty short they ar, too. Ther snow and ice comes arly and lasts long, in
                  these ar latertudes."
               "We know it."
               "How kin yer when yer have never bin here berfore?"
               "Books teach us."
               "Wal, book larnin is er great thing. I've often thought that I'd like ter know how
                  ter read and write. It might have been cheerin' like when I've been snowed in fer
                  days. Howsomever, it wouldn't have bin of much 'count ter me arter all."
               "You would certainly have lost nothing by it. But what do you say to going as
                  guide and interpreter to our little party?"
               "How many ar thar of yer?"
               "But two that will go with you. We shall want you to take us in your canoe. You
                  have one, I presume."
               "Have er canoe? Yer mought jest as well have expected ter find er Injun without er
                  dog, 'specially of he whar poor! Two on yer?"
               "Yes, that is all."
               "Be yer them?" and the black eyes of the Beaver were riveted upon them, as if he
                  would perfectly read their character before committing himself.
               "I am one. The other will be here tomorrow, I expect."
               "What sort of er man mought he be? I like you well enuff, but I can't tell erbout
                  him until I see him."
               "A good, clever, jovial fellow."
               "Ahem!"
               "You will like him, I am certain."
               "Er young man?"
               "Yes—half your age or mine."
               "Wal, stranger, I can't make up my mind, ontil I've thought over night on it. Ef I
                  couclude ter go, and I rayther reckon I will, I will be at ther head of ther
                  portage at ther Soo, day arter ter morrow mornin', by the time the sun rises."
               "Let me give you something to bind the bargain," and a piece of gold was
                  offered.
               "No, no!" replied the old man, drawing back proudly. "Ther beaver haint mine,
                  ontil I have him in ther trap. Ef I do go, perhaps I may git yer ter advance er
                  leetle ter buy powder and ball, and sich like."
               "We will furnish all that, as well as provisions."
               "Mighty leetle of them yer will want, but what these ar tough hands kin git
                  yer."
               "Then that part of the matter is easily arranged. With regard to the pay for your
                  services?"
               "Ahem!"
               He had never done a day's work in his life for pay, and had no more idea of what
                  he ought to receive than a child; and child he was in many things pertaining to
                  the customs of civilized life. His questioner saw this and at once helped him out
                  of his trouble.
               "We can settle that matter when we meet again."
               "Yes, yes." was the eager reply.
               "Good night, then."
               "Wont yer come in and see how ther old man lives?"
               "Certainly."
               "And perhaps yer would like ter have er supper of trout? Yer don't see sich
                  speckled beauties as these every day, I kin tell yer."
               They saw that it would gratify him, and consented, stepping into the little cabin
                  and taking a survey of its contents while he was cooking the fish. Of furniture
                  there was very little. A rude table, bedstead and a couple of benches (all of
                  domestic manufacture) comprised the entire inventory. Every corner, however, was
                  filled with traps and peltries, and the walls were garnished with trophies of the
                  chase, gathered during many a long hunt and amid many dangers. The skins, claws
                  and teeth of the bear, the fox, the wolf, and even the panther were there,
                  strangely commingled with the finer ones that in these days an empress might be
                  proud of, and which it requires almost the dowry of an empress to purchase. There
                  were hatchets and arrow heads of stone, the feathers of the eagle, moccasins and
                  leggins quill-worked and beaded, telling of softer fingers than his own and, in
                  short, everything that could be possibly collected during a nomad life in the
                  wilderness.
               "Thar!" said the old trapper, bringing in to them some of the fish upon a clean
                  piece of bark for a plate, "Thar! ef yer ever tasted anything nicer than them,
                  jest tell me on it. You folks that live in great cities don't know nothin' of how
                  to git ther true flavor—nor of deer meat neither for that matter."
               "They are certainly exquisite," was the response after the crisp, golden flakes
                  had been tasted.
               "Yes, and yer'll learn how to cook 'em if I go with yer."
               "We shall want no better cook then."
               "Ther way am this. Yer jest take er fish and hang it on er stick that is bent nigh
                  onto ther fire. Then yer hang er piece of pork jest over it, and that kinder
                  bastes it like by drippin' down the fat, and keeps it juicy, and and makes it
                  brown like er berry."
               "But if you have no pork, what then?"
               "Jest roll it up in some wet leaves and bury it in ther hot ashes. I consate one
                  is jest erbout as good as ther tother."
               "We must thank you for the finest meal we have tasted in many a day. Once more
                  good night."
               "Good night. Ef I decide ter go you'll find me waitin' in the canoe and all ready
                  for a start, day after ter-morrer morning at the head of ther portage, as I told
                  yer."
               The old man lighted his pipe and sat upon the broad rock watching until a turn in
                  the path shut them from his sight. Then he muttered to himself:
               "Young man? Er young man goin' too? I wish I could have seen him. It would have
                  been easier ter have made up my mind. He may be all right, and I hope he is, but
                  anyhow I must manage ter keep him from seein' the Swaller, ef I kin."
               Satisfied apparently with his conclusions, he arose, carefully knocked out the
                  ashes from his pipe, entered his cabin home, and throwing himself upon his bed of
                  skins, was soon lost to all the surroundings of earth.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               SHAW-SHAW.
               AT the junction of the waters of the Michipicoten river and those of Lake
                  Superior, was a village of the Chippewa Indians. Builded upon both sides of the
                  stream, the cone-shaped wigwams stood like so many shocks of corn, and entirely
                  filled the cleared space between the water and the heavy background of evergreens,
                  spotted here and there with trees, whose leaves were deciduous. Beyond this, and
                  as a finish to the picture, rose the high
                  and irregular coast range of hills, brilliant in summer with the verdure of the
                  larch, tamerack, fir and pine, and in winter glittering with the sheen of the
                  thick branches heavily laden with snow and ice, and flashing in the sunlight like
                  a forest of chrysalite.
               To describe one, would be to describe all. The frame of poles, the covering of
                  mats and skins, with a circular hole at the top, was the sum total of the
                  architecture. In the hot months of summer, or the freezing ones of winter, there
                  was no change. Each boasted of its family, and each of its half-starved and the
                  eving dogs. The line of demarcation that occurs in civilized life between the rich
                  and poor, was not to be found there—all were poor alike. The highest chief lodged
                  no better than the lowliest hunter, and their food and clothing was the same. So
                  much was this the case, that a mad-brained Agrarian would have found no labor
                  either for his pen or his voice. The work he would fain accomplish in other parts
                  of the world, was finished here.
               Around each of the wigwams too, was gathered the same group of men, women and
                  half-clad children, busy with bows, nets, baskets, mats or play. The same scanty
                  cooking utensils were reproduced also upon every camp fire, the same cups and
                  dishes of bark, the same hatchets and knives, the same canoe—almost the same
                  features, in every family.
               In the latter, however, the most marked difference occurred. Nature pleasures
                  herself in the outcroping of rare beauty now and then amid the most uncongenial
                  surroundings. She revenges herself, as it were, by placing in the most filthy
                  hovel faces that are worthy of angelic lineage, while the palace holds those but
                  one remove from the brute. Even as the purely white flower will bud and blossom
                  amid the blackest mould, so now and then the red man's wigwam is blessed with
                  beauty that is rendered far more glorious for the mass of repulsiveness around.
                  Very rare, indeed, it may be and is, but yet as true as that the pearls that
                  queens wear are the offspring of disease, or that from the labor of a worm is spun
                  the snowy bridal vell.
               Of this class was Shaw-Shaw, or the Swallow. Save a very slight olive tinge to her
                  complexion and the want of wave in her hair, there was nothing to have marked her
                  as not having been the child of European parents. Far back a stain of that blood
                  might have mingled in her ancestry and now, perhaps, in the third generation it
                  revealed itself again in almost its pristine purity. This, every one at all
                  familiar with the subject knows is not uncommon. In a more Southern land the
                  slight shading of her skin would not have been noticed, or if noticed commented
                  upon, for the tropical climes have many of undoubted white lineage that are far
                  darker.
               Fully up to, if not above the usual height of womanhood, the figure of the Swallow
                  was perfect in its every proportion and graceful to the extreme, that can only be
                  acquired by constant exercise in the open air and freedom from all deforming
                  pressure. The arms, circled with broad strings of wampum and heavy bands of
                  shining silver (the purchase from the traders by her father and won by many a day
                  of severe toil) were round and symmetrical, and the ancles (ornamented like her
                  other limbs) were taper and joined to feet small and true of arch. The bust was
                  full and the shoulders sloping. The neck exquisitely turned and crowned by a head
                  that might have been born in a sculptor's dream, but could never be reproduced in
                  marble. The hair was very long, soft, and of intense blackness, but of that
                  changeable sheen that gleams in the sunlight like the glossy throat of the wild
                  pigeon.
               But it was the face that first attracted the eye and then chained the gaze. There
                  were no high cheek bones that usually mark her race—the oval was true. So, too,
                  was it with her brow. Nature, and perhaps the constant drawing back of the hair in
                  heavy braids, had made it high—an uncommon thing among the Indians and especially
                  those of her sex. The nose was strictly Grecian; the mouth small and daintily cut,
                  and the lips full and pouting; the eyes large and black as her hair, but marked
                  more with the pensive softness of the dove than the bold gaze of the eagle, while
                  the lashes that shaded them swept low upon the cheek.
               The one remaining child of Ah-ne-meè-kee, or The Thunder, the entire love of his
                  savage nature was wrapped up in her. Her brothers had perished in the war of the
                  Nation against the Sioux, and her only sister fallen a victim to the baseness and
                  treachery of a white man. She loved—he deserted her—she followed him to a great
                  city and died there. That was all the father could tell. But her name was not
                  "written in water," so far as he was concerned. He would remember her to the day
                  of his death.
               No wonder was it then that he was more than careful of his beautiful woodland
                  flower. He spared her the hard tasks usual to those of her sex—decorated her with
                  the most costly trinkets he could purchase—gave her the finest skins and furs for
                  garments, and watched over her as the eagle does the one fledgling that the hunter
                  has left in the nest.
               To guard her against the pale face was the care that was uppermost in his mind. He
                  thought of it by day and dreamed of it by night. One daughter had been lost to
                  him, and revengeless for that, a double portion would fall upon the head of any
                  one who ever attempted to lure the Swallow to his wigwam. Not to be wondered at,
                  therefore, was the fact that the influx of strangers with a white skin sorely
                  troubled him. That the hunting grounds were being destroyed—the caves where the
                  Manitous dwelt torn asunder—the forests cut down—the fish driven away by the
                  "fire-canoes"—almost the graves of his forefathers destroyed were as nothing to
                  him. compared to the thought of losing his daughter.
               "My child," he said as they were floating together in their light canoe—that
                  wonderful construction of red man's skill—that graceful wave cradle that has never
                  been improved upon by all the science and boat building experiments of the Anglo
                  Saxon race, "My child, beware of the pale face."
               "Why, father?" and she looked up to him with her soft eyes beaming with
                  astonishment.
               "His tongue is false as that of the Serpent. He speaks lies."
               "Father!"
               Never before had he mentioned the subject—never had she seen him so excited. But a
                  little babe when her sister went away, she knew nothing of her history. The proud
                  chief had kept it as a sealed book. The shame that had come upon his name he might
                  bear in silence, but not talk about. Now, however, he deemed it time that his
                  tongue should be loosened, and calming himself, continued after the figurative
                  manner of his race:—
               "Let my daughter listen," he said, letting the paddle hang idly in the water and
                  the canoe rock at will upon the gentle billows. "Let my daughter listen with ears
                  like the soft wax of the honey bee to receive, and heart like the flint to
                  retain."
               "It shall be so."
               "Many winters ago two eagles dwelt upon the borders of the great lake. They
                  thought themselves safe from the fire weapons of the Long Knives. The storm rocked
                  their nest and the red flashes from the eye of the angry Manitou glanced around
                  but disturbed them not. They were very happy. The moons grew bright and dark—the
                  earth was covered with flowers—the snow came and hid them, but when the maize was
                  green again, there was a little eaglet in the nest. It grew, became full fledged,
                  and outshone in plumage any that circled around the mountain on their swift
                  wings."
               "My sister?" was the involuntary question.
               "Yes, Wit-chi-ta, but listen and speak not. When she was near your age—how old are
                  you my child?"
               "For eighteen summers the eyes of Shaw-Shaw have seen the bright blue skies—for
                  eighteen winters she has watched the white feathers of the snow spirit fall."
               "So long? yes," he continued as if conversing with himself, "Yes, it must be,
                  though the scar is as fresh as if the blow was given yesterday. The red iron burns
                  not deeper into the flesh than unrevenged wrongs into the heart of the
                  warrior."
               "You were speaking of my sister."
               "True. The eagles watched faithfully, but a serpent came—a false, crawling, pale
                  faced serpent. Silent as the night shadows was his approach. The parents saw
                     but thought him harmless. The eaglet
                  listened to his soft and cunning words. She believed them—and he stung her to the
                  heart. He fled when his work of ruin was accomplished, and she followed many days
                  towards the rising sun."
               "And found him?"
               "It might have been. I do not know. She came not again. The spirit was broken
                  within her—the light in her eyes faded,—she died."
               "Alas! my poor sister."
               He resumed his paddle and forced the canoe on in silence. The recollection of the
                  great, unrevenged wrong done him banished all other thoughts for a time. Even the
                  ever present fear of what might befall his remaining child was forgotten. At
                  length, however, he commanded himself and continued:—
               "Has the Swallow drank in the words of her father?"
               "Yes." The tears were yet swimming in her eyes as she thought of how dearly she
                  would have loved the one that was gone.
               "Have they sunk into her heart?"
               "She will not forget them."
               "When the pale face comes let her ear be like lead, and her moccasins fly as
                  swiftly as she would from the great bear of the mountains."
               "The words of wisdom shall not be forgotten."
               Fair promises, but would they be kept when love had thrown its glamour over the
                  soul? Would not the remembrance of her sister's wrongs and her father's sorrow
                  fade from out of memory like a dream? The rosy shuttle, flying fast from heart to
                  heart, will cover with its golden threads all the sombre ones that care or misery
                  can weave there! But she was honest in her promising—she had never known what
                  temptation was. If any of the braves in her tribe had sighed for her beauty, and
                  longed to woo her to their wigwams, it had been in silence. The flute that was to
                  be played by her lodge might have been tuned, but it had never been sounded—the
                  presents prepared, but they had never been laid at its door. Her simple and pure
                  mind was ignorant of the admiration she excited in the bosom of the opposite sex,
                  and the envy in those of her own. The power that was to wake in her the strongest
                  emotions of the human heart had never crossed her path. 
                     
                        "About her cabin door
                        The wide old woods resounded with her song
                        And fairy laughter all the summer day."
                     
                   And the swift winged birds after which she was named were not more
                  heart-whole. The plummet that was to fathom the fountains of her soul appeared
                  uncast, or if it was, the line had never been let down into the depths.
               Of this her father was satisfied and regretted that it should be so. To have seen
                  her married to one of her own color would have satisfied him. Then his cares would
                  have been at an end. Now he was constantly on the qui
                     vive for danger. To warn her against the spoilers of their hunting
                  grounds and homes, and to sound her mind if such a marriage as he proposed would
                  be repugnant to her, was his purpose in taking her with him that day. But he
                  wisely held his peace until she had become calm, and other topics had somewhat
                  driven away the sombre one upon which they had been talking, from her mind.
                  Indeed, it was she that first broke the silence.
               "Father," she said, "look how the smoke rises from the pipe of the Great Manitou,
                  who sleeps on the lone rock of Gargantua."
               "It is not the calumet of the Manitou, but the breath of the fire canoe of the
                  pale face. The plantain will soon grow upon the entire shore."
               He knew, if she did not, that it was the belief of his race that wherever a white
                  man trod, a plant of the genus plantage would
                  appear. Consequently it was called "the pale man's footstep."
               To satisfy her curiosity he described a steamboat—a new thing upon the lake. He
                  had seen it while at the Sault to receive his
                  annuity, but she never. That done, he cautiously turned the subject to
                  marriage.
               "It is the custom of the Ojibwas," he said, "that when a young brave has won his
                  name, or a daughter seen eighteen winters, that they should marry."
               With wide-eyed astonishment she heard but answered not. The subject had never
                  entered her thoughts. Love's young dream was as fabulous to her as any of the
                  unseen monsters of the deep to us.
               "You have arrived at that time, my child," he continued, "and your mother and I
                  would fain see you settled before we go to the Country of Souls."
               "Father, do not talk of death."
               "I am not, but of you and your happiness. Tell me if any brave of the tribe has
                  ever whispered sweet words in your ears?"
               "Never!"
               "But they will."
               "I will not hear them."
               A sly smile, transient as summer lightning, played over the face of the chief. He
                  knew too well how sharp were the arrows of the rosy boy-god.
               "Do you never intend to marry?" he asked.
               "No! What should I do so for? I will live with you always."
               He saw that her time had not yet come, and taking from her the pipe she had been
                  filling, lighted it, resigned the paddle into her hands and himself to thought.
                  Deliberately he mentally scanned every young brave with the view of selecting the
                  one that would be the most fit husband for his daughter. At length he settled upon
                  a warrior or hunter rather, for the days of blood were about ended, who he fancied
                  would be the most worthy of any. He was brave, young, active, and a skillful
                  hunter (wealth fortunately had nothing to do with the matter) and more
                  kind-hearted than any of the rest. Not that he considered even him actually worthy
                  of his jewel, but he was the best, and she must have a husband. He felt that it
                  was giving the dove into the care of the hawk to save it from the eagle, but the
                  necessity of the case demanded it. There was no other choice left him.
               Having thus decided upon Shoon-ka-ska, or White Dog, he began
                  thinking of the best means of giving him an inkling of how the matter stood—of
                  telling him by actions, rather than words, that he would be a favored suitor for
                  his daughter's hand. He would not beg a husband for her—he was far too proud for
                  that—but he would smoothe the path so that there should be no stumbling blocks in
                  the way. First, however, it would be well to learn if the one the most interested
                  had any feelings of antipathy against this particular man.
               "Did you see Shoon-ka-ska this morning?" he asked, as an entering wedge to the
                  conversation.
               "He started early upon the hunting trail," was the reply.
               "He is a great hunter, and his name will yet be heard mentioned with praise by the
                  nation. He is—"
               The rest of the sentence was lost in the report of a rifle, and the old chief fell
                  forward with a groan. A groan that was answered by a shriek from the lips of the
                  girl, as she threw aside her paddle and flung herself wildly upon the seeming
                  corpse of her father.
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               PITT MONCRIEF.
               TRUE to his promise the Beaver was waiting by his canoe at the appointed spot, and
                  at the appointed time. He had thought over the matter long and deeply, and decided
                  to go. That done it required but a few hours to make the necessary preparations
                  even for a longer absence than he anticipated. To gather up the furs and peltries
                  he had on hand, sail to the Sault, and barter them for the few articles that he
                  considered requisite, occupied but little time. Then he returned again to his
                  cabin and amused himself until night, after his accustomed manner—slept—arose—gave
                  it into the charge of a friendly Indian, and started to keep his word.
               As he was passing around the point that would shut it from his sight, he paused to
                  take a long, last look. It was hallowed by years of occupancy, and when would he
                  see it again? When light a fire, cook a rude meal, and throw himself down to rest
                  upon the bed of skins? The eyes of the old man grew misty as these thoughts forced
                  themselves upon him. He raised his hand, wiped away a tear, and then as if ashamed of so much
                  effeminacy, he turned his head away, grasped his paddle firmly, and made the
                  ripples dance from under the bow of his canoe. Home had never a better tribute
                  than he had given his little one, and for many long, weary weeks, he remembered
                  that last look.
               Reaching the head of the portage he drew the light bark ashore, seated himself
                  upon a huge boulder, lighted his pipe and waited patiently the coming of those who
                  had engaged his services. That they might fail in keeping the appointment, never
                  entered his mind. He knew that he was honest, and reasoning from that stand point
                  considered every one else so. For an hour he remained almost as motionless as the
                  stone upon which he sat, except that he now and then glanced up to watch the
                  progress of the sun whose blood-red disc was creeping above the tree tops. Then he
                  was aroused by the sound of footsteps and a cheery, ringing voice. In a moment
                  after a young man stood by his side, and a hand was laid familiarly upon his
                  shoulder.
               "So you are the Beaver, are you? I would have known you anywhere by the
                  description I received."
               The old man looked up, and the plate of memory received this photograph—one that
                  would never be effaced.
               A young man of perhaps twenty-two years stood before him. His dress, though
                  evidently fashioned after that of the west—Daniel Boone might have furnished the
                  model—was of fine, dark green cloth, trimmed upon the seams with red fringe, and
                  displayed to advantage the slight figure. The face was smooth; the cheeks ruddy
                  with the crimson of health; the hands white, and feet petite as those of a woman;
                  the forehead expansive, the eyes blue as woodland violets; the hair curling
                  chestnut, and covered with a jaunty velvet cap of the same hue as his garments,
                  the lips red as coral, and ever parted with a winning smile that revealed the
                  regular teeth; the nose and chin perfect in their carving, and the voice musical
                  in its every intonation.
               The old trapper rubbed his eyes like one suddenly awakened from a dream, and
                  looked upon again. He had failed to satisfy himself at the first glance that it
                  was not a girl that stood before him. And this was still more the case when he
                  contemplated the toy rifle (compared to his own), the fanciful bullet pouch and
                  powder flask, and the flashing rings that circled the delicate fingers. "Be you a
                  woman?" he asked, almost dropping his pipe from his mouth.
               "Not any more than you are," was the reply, and the blue eyes danced with
                  merriment at the idea.
               "Wal, I should think yer whar from yer looks. What do yer expect ter do with that
                  ar pop gun? Shoot grasshoppers?"
               "You will find that it will carry as far, and that I can shoot as straight with it
                  as you can with your cumbersome weapon. But that is nothing to the purpose now.
                  Are you the Beaver?"
               "Ahem."
               "All right. My name is Pitt Moncrief, and I am going to be your companion for the
                  next few months."
               "You?"
               The trapper would not have been more astonished if a baby had been brought to him,
                  and he told that he must take it with him in his wanderings. He knew the hardships
                  that must be undergone, and the dangers that must be braved, and to think that so
                  girlish a form could successfully pass through them was simply impossible.
               "Certainly," was the smiling reply. "Do you see anything preposterous in the
                  proposition?"
               "No—but—"
               "You think I am not strong enough to endure the fatigue. Is that not it?"
               "Ahem."
               "But has not your experience taught you that the nimble and slender-footed deer
                  can travel as swiftly and as far as the heavy elk?"
               "What do yer know about sich things?"
               "More than you would give me credit for. But get your canoe ready and we will be
                  off. I am tired of city life, and long to be away from brick walls."
               "Whar is the other man?"
               "He is not going. I will be your only companion."
               "The stubborn old man would not have stirred a single step, had not he who engaged
                  him come up at this moment.
               "Good morning, Beaver," he said. "Well, Pitt, is everything all right?"
               "I think so, except that this giant don't like the idea of having so slight a form
                  as mine for a companion; and, come to think of it, we would make a capital cast
                  for Valentine and Orson. Explain to him, if you please."
               "Yes," and turning to the trapper he continued:—"Since I saw you, my friend, I
                  have ascertained that it will be impossible for me to accompany you. My companion
                  will voyage with you around the lake—you will go by the Canadian shore—and I will
                  meet you at Copper Harbor. You know the spot, I presume?"
               "Kewawana Pint? Yes."
               "And have no objections to the arrangement?"
               "No, only this ar gir—boy."
               "You must make a man of him, Beaver. You will find him learned, brave and active.
                  There is far more of strength and endurance, too, in that little body, than you
                  would imagine."
               "I could crush him with a single grip of my hand."
               "If you had a chance," laughed Moncrief. "You settle the preliminaries with him.
                  Colonel, while I take a look along the shore."
               That was an easy matter. There was nothing grasping in the nature of the Beaver,
                  and the sum offered for his services was far beyond his expectations. So much so,
                  that he grumbled about receiving it.
               "We can well afford to pay it," was the answer; "and here comes the outfit. I
                  think you will find everything you need, and if not. your companion has letters to
                  the Governors of the various trading posts, that will secure it."
               The canoe was soon loaded, and the old trapper, with his young companion pushed
                  off from the shore to ramble for a time far away from comfort, luxury, and
                  civilization.
               "Bon voyage," was called out from the shore.
               "Je vous souhaite bonjour," was answered back by
                  Moncried, with a graceful wave of his hand.
               This was was their parting, but who could tell if ever they would meet again? We
                  can read the pages of the past and learn what has been, but of the future none can
                  know—the volume is closed to us.
               "Do you speak French?" asked the old trapper of Pitt.
               "Certainly, and you will find that I can do many more things that will astonish
                  you."
               "Wall, I'll tell you one thing yer must do, and that ar ter take them boots off
                  yer feet."
               "What for?"
               "Ter keep from kickm' ther bottom out of ther canoe. I'll try and make yer er pair
                  of moccasins ter-night when we camp, though I don't know what kind of er job I'll
                  make of it, fer I never tried sich baby things as them'll be."
               "I shall be thankful to you."
               "They won't be sich fine things and all kivered over with beads and quills as they
                  keep for sale at the Soo, lettin' on that they are Injin manufacture when the
                  French girls made every one on 'em, but they'll do you er great deal more
                  sarvice."
               "I have no doubt of it."
               "Yer never need doubt what I say, fer I allers speaks ther truth."
               "Your honest face is proof enough of that. Give me a light, please."
               He had been filling a pipe, and extended his tobacco pouch at the same time he
                  held out his hands for a light.
               "Yer smoke too!"
               "Yes, that is one of my numerous 'accomplishments!'"
               From that moment the feeling of almost disgust that the trapper had entertained
                  towards his companion on account of his size, began to fade away. There must be
                  something good, he thought, in any man who could talk French, smoke, and was
                  liberal with his tobacco. The latter action especially won him, for the sparseness
                  of that article made it almost as valuable as water in a desert. Indian tobacco
                  (the bark of the willow or the leaves of a shrub resembling our garden box) was to
                  be had for the seeking, but the pure article was as rarely met with as gold.
               
               "Yer have never bin here erfore?" asked the Beaver, after he had puffed for some
                  time in silence, and with the most evident gusto.
               "Never. It is my first visit. You have always lived here, I believe?"
               "As fer as I kin remember, and that ar er pooty long trail come ter look back at
                  it."
               "And of course are intimately acquainted with the Indians?"
               "Sartinly."
               "Are they dangerous?"
               "That depends entirely upon how yer use 'em. Ther white man haint never treated
                  them none of the best, that am er fact, but I reckon they won't trouble us
                  none."
               "Are there any pretty girls among them? I have often heard and read of Indian
                  beauties but never saw one. The specimens at the Soo are disgusting enough."
               "Ahem!"
               "I have been told, however, that those who dwell away from civilization are far
                  better looking, Is that the case?"
               "More'n likely. The Injins that is er loafin' eround ther forts and tradin' shops
                  haint no more like er wild one than er eagle in er cage is like one at liberty. It
                  hain't in ther natur of things that they should be."
               "But are any of the girls remarkably beautiful?"
               "Ahem!"
               It was a point the Beaver did not like to talk about. He had said (to himself)
                  when he had first heard that a young man was going with him, that he must keep him
                  from seeing the Swallow, and he was determined to do so. And this resolve was
                  rendered ten times as strong now that he knew Pitt Moncrief. He was satisfied that
                  he could win the heart of any squaw in the tribe without an effort. If the
                  daughter of Ah-ne-mee-kee was beautiful for a girl, so was he for a man, or rather
                  would be when his frame had become somewhat expanded by exercise and his skin
                  darkened by exposure. But he could not lie about the matter, and so had answered
                  by his favorite curt ejaculation.
               "Why do you not tell me?" persisted his companion, "if there are any beautiful
                  girls among the Chippewas."
               "Do yer think these ar old eyes am lookin arter pooty gals?" answered the Beaver
                  with a sly glance at the face of the young man.
               "Certainly, enough to see whether or no they are pretty."
               "Ef yer want ter see pooty gals, yer must go ermong ther Kenucks."
               "I know better perhaps than you that many of the French Canadians girls are very
                  beautiful, but that is not answering my question."
               "Well, yer'll have ter judge fer yerself about that ar matter, though ef yer take
                  ther advice of er old man yer'll let them erlone entirely. Ther Injuns are mighty
                  jealous and ferce jist now, and ef yer want ter hunt arter copper in peace and
                  without any danger of losin' yer scalp, yer'll treat 'em kindly, and give ther
                  squaws er wide berth."
               "You talk as if I intended to fall in love with them or to treat them badly."
               "No man kin tell what he will do ontil he's tried. Who knows but I might have bin
                  as bad as some of ther traders, ef I had lived erway from ther woods and ther
                  great lake and ther blessed sunshine."
               "That is all true, but as I don't propose to entangle myself with any of these
                  wood-land nymphs, I shall certainly keep my eyes open."
               "Better be blind as er bat in ther day time and deaf as er adder," growled the old
                  man, trying to argue with his conscience and satisfy it that it would be right to
                  take the young man past Michipicoten without stopping.
               "Now," continued Moncrief, "I've half a notion that you have a beauty hidden away
                  somewhere, and I am determined to find her out. Let me but clap my eyes upon her,
                  and see how soon I'll steal her away!"
               All this was said jokingly, but it grated upon the old man's feelings. He was
                  aware of the difficulties they would have to encounter even without exciting the
                  ill will of the Indians, and if they should become angry the trail might even be
                  stained with blood. Then, too, he thought of the beauty and innocence of the
                  Swallow, and how one who was evidently fond of girlish loveliness as was his
                  companion, would be attracted by her.
               Suppose he should honestly make her his wife—should be kind and true to her—should
                  treat her as such a companion ought to be, would he not soon tire of a wild-wood
                  life? Would he not become disgusted with the brutality and filth around him? Would
                  even the strongest love of an educated man survive more than one of the terrible
                  winters of hardship and something very near akin to, if not actual starvation?
                  Would he not long for the companionship and luxury of civilization and return
                  thither? And in that case would he dare to take his squaw wife with him? She might
                  be very beautiful to-day, but she was utterly ignorant, and the records of the
                  race show that their girlhood fades almost as quickly as the summer flower, and
                  the belle changes in a very short time into almost repulsive ugliness.
               Such thoughts flitted like lightning through the brain of the old trapper, and he
                  was right. History furnishes but one example of a Pocahontas. The
                  circumstances—the time that made her stand out from the rest of the red
                  sisterhood, will never be known again.
               "Yer all wrong," replied the Beaver, for he could not let even the implied
                  imputation upon his character remain unanswered. "Yer all wrong. I've seen many er
                  squaw that was called good lookin' in my day, but never one that I ever hankered
                  after fer er wife."
               "Still you will not deny that there are some beauties among them?"
               "I can't tell how that mought be."
               "And I can't understand what makes you so reticent upon the subject. Thank
                  goodness, I have sharp eyes and can judge for myself."
               "Sharp eyes, have yer? Wal. kin yer see er leetle pint of land jest ahead?"
               "Certainly."
               "Wal, thar's whar we are going ter camp."
               "And commence our explorations?"
               "No. Thar's no kinder use of beginnin' to look after copper for two or three days.
                  I'll show you whar ther fust spot is."
               For three days (with the usual rest) they continued their way. On the fourth
                  morning they rounded the point of Cape Gargantua and commenced the traverse of
                  Michipicoten Bay. Thus far, the subject of their conversation had not been
                  renewed. If the Beaver feared any such thing, he cunningly avoided it by telling
                  stories of his roving life and the manners and customs of the red man. Now,
                  however, as they were gliding along Pitt Moncrief startled him by asking again
                  about the Indians.
               "When are we coming to a camping ground of the Chippewas?" he asked. "I am very
                  anxious to see some of their beauties."
               "Ahem!"
               "Is there not one of their villages somewhere in this bay? If my geography is not
                  at fault there ought to be."
               "Do you see that loon way out yonder?" asked the Beaver, determined not to be
                  forced into an unpleasant position.
               "Yes. What of it?"
               "Wal, yer said that ar pop gun of yer'n would carry as fer and shoot as strait as
                  mine. Let me see what yer can do. Ef yer kill ther bird, I'll make yer the
                  handsomest kind of er pouch out of ther hide, and say that yer need'nt fear ter
                  try yer hand ergin any one on the whole lake."
               With a glare of pride upon his handsome features, Pitt Moncrief raised his weapon.
                  It was a new invention—such an one as the trapper had never seen—and he knew its
                  capabilities.
               "Throw the head of the canoe towards the shore," he said. "There; keep it so."
               "Jest as still as er rock."
               The old man was indulging in intense satisfaction, as he thought of the failure of
                  his companion, and how he could prove the superiority of his own weapon. So much
                  was this the case, that he failed to look in the direction of the proposed
                  shot—failed to remember the old hunter maxim, "to look at the range as well as at
                  the mark," failed to see a canoe that was passing slowly along. Not so, however,
                  with Moncrief.
               "It strikes me, Beaver, that there is something swimming beyond the deer. It might
                  be a deer. Look and see."
               "Deer don't swim so fur from the shore. Ef it whar later in ther season it might
                  be er cariboo, but they are fur up among ther mountings now. Shoot if yer ar goin'
                  to."
               
               'Look where the ball strikes."
               "Sartinly."
               The trapper turned his head and in an instant his listless manner changed to one
                  of great excitement.
               "Fer ther love of heaven, don't shoot," he exclaimed with the full strength of his
                  powerful lungs, and reaching out his hand to strike down the weapon.
               The warning came too late. The fatal spring had been touched and the bullet was
                  speeding upon its errand. It missed the intended mark, glanced upon the water, and
                  they saw one of the forms in the canoe fall as if he had received his death
                  wound.
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               THE CAMP ON THE ISLAND.
               "MAY the good Lord be marciful to us," was the characteristic exclamation of the
                  Beaver, as he saw the result of the shot.
               His first impulse was to whirl the canoe around, and hasten away. Thereby he would
                  conceal all knowledge of the unintentional harm, and keep clear of any of the
                  fatal consequences of Indian vengeance. But it was a cowardly thought, and
                  instantly banished from his mind. To leave a human being, suffering and in danger,
                  was not according to his nature. If his own life should be the forfeit, he would
                  do what his conscience told him was right. Had he not tempted his companion to
                  shoot, and did not the blame rest entirely upon his shoulders? He thought so, and
                  no one could have convinced him to the contrary.
               "May the good Lord be marciful to us," repeated the old man. "What shall we do,
                  Pitt? What shall we do?" His own mind was fully made up, but he wished to test his
                  companion—to see what metal he was made of in the midst of danger and
                  excitement.
               "Do? What would you do but go to the rescue? May heaven forgive me if I have
                  committed a murder by my carelessness. Come, let us be quick. A few moment's delay
                  might be fatal."
               With tears in his eyes, the Beaver grasped the hand of his young companion and
                  wrung it heartily. From that moment all his first impressions of dislike vanished,
                  and he would be his firm friend to the death.
               "Yer heart is made of jest as good stuff as yer rifle," he said, "and ef ever yer
                  git into trouble, call on ther Beaver."
               "Thank you. I could not call upon a better man. But we are losing time."
               At the same instant their paddles touched the water and the light bark shot
                  forward like an arrow from a strongly strained bowstring. Tiny foam wreaths rose
                  up in front, and a wake, like a serpent's trail, was seen behind. In a race for
                  life they could not have exerted themselves more.
               "It am ther Thunder and ther Swallow," exclaimed the Beaver as the two canoes lay
                  side by side.
               "A red Venus!" murmered Pitt Moncrief under his breath, as his eyes rested upon
                  the girl.
               But she neither saw or heard him. All her attention was given to her father. He
                  lay as he had fallen, except that his head was pillowed in the lap of his child,
                  and she was vainly striving to stop the blood that was rapidly oozing from a wound
                  below the arm, and in dangerous proximity to the heart. Accustomed to such things,
                  the old trapper gave directions for his instant transportation ashore.
               May the good Manitou be thanked." whispered the Swallow, but without raising her
                  eyes from the pallid face she loved so well. "May the good Manitou be thanked for
                  your coming, Ah-meek."
               "He must not be stirred," interrupted the sweet voice of Pitt Moncrief. "To move
                  him now until the bullet is found, or at least the blood stanched, would be his
                  death."
               There was a firmness in the tones that made even the Beaver stare with surprise,
                  while the girl raised her head for the first time and looked upon the stranger.
                  Looked and saw such a face as she might have dreamed of but had never seen.
               "Do you know anything about doctoring?" asked the trapper.
               "Yes. It is my profession, although I am here in the character of a
                  geologist."
               "And you think it won't do ter move ther chief? He would never feel ther motions
                  of ther canoe."
               "Let me examine the wound," and he proceeded to do so, while his patient lay in a
                  stupor.
               He saw at a glance that a long and difficult operation would be necessary to
                  extract the ball. It was deeply buried,—the fountain seat of life near—the
                  slightest mistake fatal, and he dare not trust himself with the egg shell of a
                  bark rocking beneath him.
               "You are right, Beaver," he said sadly, after stopping the effusion of blood as
                  well as was possible. "We will have to take him ashore. How far is it to where he
                  lives?"
               "Ther island is much nearer. We had best ter take him thar ontil he gits
                  better."
               "To the island then. You get in and paddle. I will take the girl—poor child—in
                  ours."
               "To this arrangement the old man would have made serious objections had not the
                  girl herself interfered and settled the matter.
               "Shaw-Shaw will stay with her father," she whispered in the ear of the trapper, in
                  her native tongue.
               "What does she say?" asked Moncrief.
               "That she haint er going ter leave ther old man. I'll take them ashore and you kin
                  bring our canoe."
               The island reached, they carried the wounded man up the shelving bank and laid him
                  upon their united blankets. The insensibility that had followed the first shock of
                  the wound had passed away—he had opened his eyes and knew all that was transpiring
                  around him.
               "Where are you child?" he asked.
               "Here!" and she bounded to his side, raised his head and pressed her lips upon his
                  forehead.
               "And I am here too, my old friend," whispered the trapper, at least he thought he
                  was doing so though in reality his tone was anything but soft.
               "And who is that?"
               The chief raised his hand and pointed to Moncrief, who was engaged in taking the
                  necessary instruments, the old trapper called them "scalping knives" from a case
                  and preparing them for use.
               "Er young Medercine. He'll soon have yer all right ergin."
               "Who fired the weapon that was aimed at the heart of the red man?"
               A very difficult question that to answer, and the old trapper colored like a
                  school girl. Had not his companion come to his rescue he would certainly have
                  betrayed himself.
               "Does the wounded man speak French?" he inquired.
               "Sartinly. All ther Injuns erlong ther shore do that."
               "Then I can talk directly to him."
               "Ter be sure yer kin."
               Moncried addressed himself to the chief, explained the position of the bullet, and
                  what measures would be necessary to extract it and perform a cure. Then he was
                  going on to tell him that it would be very painful, when he was cut short with an
                  emphatic wave of the hand and—
               "The red man is not a sick squaw. Let the pale medicine go on."
               "But your daughter? Had she not better go away?"
               "She is the daughter of a chief! Ask her," was the proud response.
               "She will stay," was the scarcely heard decision of the Swallow.
               Pitt Moncrief looked at the face of the Indian girl. It was pale as ashes, the
                  eyes were filled with tears, but every muscle was firmly braced, and the lips
                  pressed together with an iron resolve. It was wonderful to him that one so young
                  could have such perfect self-control. His hospital experience had convinced him
                  that very few women (except perhaps trained nurses) could bear the sight of blood.
                  For a daughter then to hold her father's head while an operation that might be
                  fatal was being performed, was wonderful. He could not believe that it would last,
                  and calling the trapper aside whispered:—
               "Be ready to take the girl away. Her fortitude will not stand this cruel test. Be
                  on the watch, and as soon as she shows signs of fainting, carry her away and take
                     her place. Strange! strange." he
                  muttered to himself, "that such beauty could be the child of an Indian."
               "Never yer fear. I'll be on ther look out, but she wont faint. Go on and git done
                  jest as quick as ever yer kin. Ther pain am mighty hard on ther old chief and yet,
                  come ter think of it. I believe that his darter suffers ther most."
               "There can be no doubt of that, poor child."
               If the trapper had been astonished before at Pitt Moncrief he was doubly so now.
                  There was something supernatural to him in the rapid movements and firm and
                  delicate touches of the little hands he had laughed at. Something surpassing
                  belief, that so frail a form should be nerved with steel, and the heart he had
                  fancied girlish, be far more manly than even his own.
               The bullet was at last reached, and successfully drawn forth.
               "Show it me," commanded the chief.
               The Beaver would have interfered. It was his intention to have secured it and
                  thrown it far out into the lake, but he was too late. The precaution he had in his
                  mind had never for a moment entered into that of his companion. Moncrief could
                  imagine no reason why it should not be given. Such a request he knew was common
                  among soldiers wounded in battle, and he had seen the battered lead preserved as a
                  sacred relic. So he gave it.
               The Indian eyed it narrowly, looked from one white man to the other, placed it
                  carefully in his pouch, and then directed his daughter to go to the woods and
                  gather certain herbs and roots.
               "It is unnecessary." interposed Moncrief. "I have everything that will be
                  required. I do not doubt the efficacy of what you propose, but I can save your
                  daughter the trouble."
               "You kin trust him," was the endorsement of the trapper, in the Indian tongue.
                  "I've sounded him and found thar whar no lies hid erway in ther bottom of his
                  soul."
               "It is well," replied the chief, and resigned himself completely into the hands of
                  the "pale medicine."
               Having administered the proper antidotes against fever, Moncrief stated his wishes
                  to the Beaver.
               "We shall have to build a shelter of some kind," he said. "It will be impossible
                  to remove him for days, and it may be even weeks."
               "And do yer propose ter stay and tend him?" was the questioning answer; and the
                  old man looked at the younger one as if his keen black eyes had power to pierce
                  through the covering of flesh, and discover what was passing in the heart.
               "Certainly. You would not have me leave one that I came so near murdering, to die
                  for the want of assistance?"
               "But yer can't be er sarching arter copper at ther same time."
               "That is very true. I shall have to somewhat neglect business."
               "And ther Kurnal—him who got me ter go—how will he like that ar kind of
                  doings?"
               "I am my own master!"
               "Wal, wal, yer know yer own business best. And yer think it may be weeks before
                  yer kin safely leave ther chief ter ther care of his darter?"
               "More than likely. If inflammation should set in, it would require careful nursing
                  and skillful treatment to carry him safely through. I wish I had more experience.
                  I shall do my best, but I have great—very great fears."
               "That am er fust rate sign. I've always noticed that when er man don't think tu
                  much of hisself that he's mighty sartin' ter be knowinsome. What whar yer sayin'
                  erbout puttin' up er wigwam?"
               "That both the Indian and his daughter must have shelter from the hot sun and the
                  damp, chilly night air."
               "Ther Swaller will take keer of herself if—" he checked himself suddenly, looked
                  embarrassed, and continued—"It wont take very long ter put up er shanty of some
                  kind."
               "It must be warm and comfortable."
               "Sartinly. Come with me," and having stepped to the canoe and taken his axe, he
                  led the way into the bushes.
               The Indian had suffered very much from pain—from the extraction of the bullet even
                  though skillfully performed, and especially from the loss of blood. With his lips
                  compressed pressed and his hands tightly clasped together, he had lain while the
                  white men were discussing his fate. The instant, however, that they had passed
                  from sight, and their footsteps could no longer be heard his entire manner
                  changed.
               "Daughter?" he whispered.
               "Father?" and she knelt by his side.
               "Where have the pale faces gone?"
               "To gather poles and bark for a wigwam."
               "Are you sure they can neither see or hear?"
               "Yes, father."
               "Go to their canoe and bring me their fire weapons. Be swift as the lightning, and
                  silent as the coming of death."
               To hear, with her was to obey. She had been trained in a school that admitted of
                  no questioning, and scarcely had she heard the command before it was executed.
               "Here they are, father."
               He endeavored to sit upright, but could not do so. Then, with great difficulty he
                  raised his head upon one hand.
               "Bend the muzzles down, my child, so that I may look into them."
               She did so. He tried first that of the Beaver, with his finger, and it was drawn
                  out unsoiled. Then that of Moncrief, and it was begrimmed with powder. Evidently
                  it had but recently been fired. Yet still he was not satisfied.
               "Take the bullet from my pouch and see which it fits."
               "The little one," was answered with a sigh.
               "It is well," he said with a grim smile of triumph lighting up his savage
                  features. "It is well! Hark! The pale faces are coming. Back to the canoe with the
                  fire weapons, and let no one know that you touched them. Place them just as you
                  found them. Quick!"
               She knew now his object—knew that he had fastened the crime upon the beautiful
                  young stranger. This was the very thing the cunning old trapper had feared and was
                  determined to prevent. He was resolved that when the heavy slumber of exhaustion
                  came, to steal the erring bullet away. To more fully carry out his plan of
                  concealment, the first action after his return was to direct Moncrief to wipe out
                  and reload his rifle.
               "We'll have ter be er lookin' out for somethin' ter eat," he said, by way of
                  explanation, "ef we ar ergoin' ter stay here very long, and one kinnot tell ther
                  minnit when er flock of ducks may come flying over, or er rabbit poke his nose out
                  of them bushes.
               The idea was plausible. Moncrief did as he was directed, and then assisted the
                  trapper in the construction of a wigwam from the materials they had brought. First
                  a ring of poles was stuck into the ground—then the tops (left with the branches on
                  for the purpose) were woven together, and then the structure was covered with
                  sections of wide bark stripped from the canoe birch. This, with the fire in the
                  centre, was the usual arrangement—and all of it, but the Sybarite ideas of
                  Moncrief required more. An Indian, or a trapper, would have flung himself to rest
                  upon the bare ground with a blanket only for protection from the damp. He urged
                  and insisted that it should be deeply carpeted with the fragrant and springy
                  boughs of the fir trees.
               "The wounded man," he said, "required a soft bed, and his daughter—"
               "Don't be er troublin' yerself erbout her," growled the Beaver. "Ef yer Medercine,
                  cure ther chief jest as quick as yer kin so that we may git off. You don't know
                  how short ther summer is here, or yer wouldn't be er foolin' erway yer time, I kin
                  tell yer."
               "I shall do the best possible, that you may depend on, but I can see no good
                  reason why they should not be comfortable."
               "Nor I, nuther; but ther gal knows more erbout getting erlong in the woods in a
                  minnit than you've larned in yer hull life time."
               "Very likely."
               "Then jest let her erlone. She kin paddle her own canoe. And come ter that, I
                  don't see no kind or manner of use in our stayin' here—leastwise, no longer than
                  to-morrow mornin'. Ther chief will either be better or dead by that time. Besides,
                  these redskins have er way of thar own of doctorin', and er mighty good way it am
                  tu. Ef it's er fever yer erfeared on, they'll soon drive it erway with wolf's bane, or some sich yarb,
                  and thar's nothin' better on ther face of ther arth fer dressing er wound than
                  spider webs and balsam fir gum and green plantain leaves, and they know it."
               "But you would not leave her alone with her sick father?"
               "Sartinly. Nursing's thar very thing of all others that wimmin folks whar made
                  fur. It comes just as natural ter them as breathin. They begin it when we're born,
                  and keep it up ontil we die."
               Without knowing it, the old trapper had imbibed this same notion that has been
                  made immortal by the pen of the poet. What is it the loving and lion-hearted
                  Ionian slave girl, Myrrha, says to Sardanapalus? 
                     
                        "The very first
                        Of human life must spring from woman's breast,
                        Your first small words are taught you by her lips,
                        Your first tears quenched by her, and your last sighs 
                        Too often breathed out in a woman's hearing,
                        When men have shrunk from the ignoble care
                        Of watching the last hour."
                     
                  
               
               "But you would not—could not think of leaving her thus. Suppose that he should
                  die? What then?"
               "Why, she'd just roll him up in his blanket, put him inter ther canoe, and paddle
                  him over ter whar ther tribe is. Then they'd have er grand pow-ow—sing and dance
                  and cut up all kind of kerlicues—put him inter er birch bark box, lift it up onter
                  four stakes—they call that buryin', ther heathens, when ther body hain't within
                  more'n four feet of ther ground—light a fire, put his canoe and bow and arrers and
                  camp kettle and some provisions under it, and say that he had gone ter ther spirit
                  land."
               "What do they put such things there for?"
               "That he may not starve upon ther journey, and have er boat ter cross ther river
                  of death."
               "Then they think the journey will be a somewhat lengthy one?"
               "Thar appears ter be er difference in erpinion ermong ther tribes erbout that ar.
                  Ther Ojibwas now believe that the spirit journeys for four days and nights. So
                  they light ther fire four times, so that it may cook its food and not be er
                  travellin' round erbout in ther darkness. But I hain't time ter tell yer more now.
                  Ef ther wigwam am finished ter yer likin, we'll carry ther chief inter it, end let
                  his darter take keer of him while we go huntin'. I don't know how yer feel, but I
                  think somethin would taste most mighty good about this time."
               The recollection of what the Beaver had said was not banished from the mind of his
                  companion. He thought of the hours the girl would pass in watching her father—the
                  long, weary days and the terrible nights. And then if he should die! He could not
                  even reflect upon it without a tear. The hour that saw her sitting beside the dead
                  camp fire and the form of her dead father, would be as much intensified by grief
                  as ever visited a human soul. God help her then! Sitting alone through the cold
                  night by the colder form, or paddling with it over a weary stretch of waters with
                  the waves, perhaps, swelling around, and the howling storm singing a requiem. Yes:
                  God help her then! He could imagine nothing—had never dreamed of anything even
                  half so terrible, and swore in his innermost heart that it should never be.
               "What ar yer dreamin' erbout, Pitt?" suddenly asked the trapper.
               "Nothing—only." The voice at once recalled him from the contemplation of his ideal
                  picture of misery, "Nothing—only—"
               "You were in er most mighty hurry ter git ther wigwam finished er leetle bit ergo.
                  Now yer act just as if yer'd forgotten all erbout it."
               "I certainly have not. Come, let us carry the old man in out of the sun."
               A grateful smile rested upon the face of the Swallow, as she saw the preparations
                  that had been made for the comfort of her father. At the moment she thought not of
                  herself. Knowing the old trapper as she did from her earliest infancy, she felt
                  that it was to be attributed solely to the thoughtfulness of his younger
                  companion, and frankly placing her hand within his, she thanked him.
               "The heart of Shaw-Shaw warms towards him of the hair, like the feathers of the
                  partridge," she said. "She will never forget him. Had she been alone with her
                  father he would have died. The Great Spirit will bless the pale face for his
                  kindness to the red man."
               "There is no occasion for thanks," he replied, looking at the beautiful eyes
                  brimming over with tears, and contrasting them, far from unfavorably, with those
                  he had been accustomed to see. "Any one would have done the same."
               "You know not the hearts of the pale men who come to the great lake. But my
                  father!" and she sprang to the side of the wounded man at the first utterance of a
                  sound from his lips.
               The restless eyes of the chief had seen the warm hand pressure and heard the
                  words. The great fear of his life that had been driven away by his sudden and
                  severe injury, arose again within him, and he gave utterance to a groan that
                  bodily pain could not have wrung from him. He saw how strikingly handsome Moncrief
                  was—felt under what favorable circumstances he had met his daughter—knew her
                  loving and impulsive nature, and wisely dreaded the effect upon her.
               "Let my child sit by my side," he whispered, "and keep the leaves dipped in the
                  cool water, upon my head. It is as hot as the summer sun."
               "Yes, that's about ther best thing yer kin do," also urged the trapper.
               He felt about the young people being together very much as did the chief, and
                  arranged his plans so that they would not be alone.
               "Suppose yer take yer rifle and go and see ef yer kin not not find somethin' good
                  in ther woods," he suggested. "Ther Swaller and I will keep watch. Ther used ter
                  be er famous place erbout er couple of miles from here fer game."
               The eyes of the girl seconded the request, and Moncrief nothing loath to show his
                  skill as a sportsman, and feeling satisfied that there could be no more use for
                  his medical services for hours, departed.
               He gone, the old chief grasped the hand of his child within his own, and sank into
                  a heavy slumber. He was satisfied as long as she was near him, and was resolved to
                  tell the Beaver of his fears at the very first opportunity.
               It was near evening when Pitt Moncrief returned, bringing with him a fair string
                  of game. These he gave into the charge of the old trapper, but he had also,
                  carefully enveloped in green leaves, a few flowers—the first offerings of Spring
                  to the Sun. These he laid in the lap of the Indian girl, who looked her thanks but
                  spoke not. Fortunately too, perhaps for them, the old man still slumbered and the
                  trapper was busy inspecting the game.
               "Hit every one on them in ther head, didn't yer! I couldn't have done better my
                  own self. Ther must be some good in that thar little rifle of yourn arter all. I
                  must try it myself some day," he said.
               "It is at your service. How does the wounded man get along?"
               "Wal, for ther most part he has slept like er baby. Yer kin see fer yerself while
                  I go and dress ther birds and rabbits, and git supper ready."
               In the pride of exhibiting his culinary skill he forgot the caution he had
                  promised to exercise, and had they been lovers, the Swallow and Moncrief could not
                  have wished for a better opportunity to have poured out the pent up emotions of
                  their hearts. But they were not so yet, whatever might come in the future.
               "Your father is doing well," he said, "after a careful counting of the
                  fluctuations of the pulse, "and appears to sleep heavily."
               "His eyes have been closed since the pale face took the hunting trail," was the
                  low voiced reply.
               "So much the better. Is it very far from here to where you home is?"
               "The smoke rises from the wigwams. It is plain to be seen."
               "Then you live at the head of the bay?"
               "Yes."
               How long the conversation would have continued could not have been determined, had
                  not the watch dog of a trapper suddenly recollected himself.
               "Here, Pitt, Pitt!" he exclaimed. "Come here and build er fire. Yer kinnot larn
                  younger how ter live in ther woods."
               Although disgusted in having his tête-à-tête
                  thus unceremoniously broken up, Moncrief obeyed, and the Beaver saw that he had
                     no opportunity to renew it until night
                  came. Then he took upon himself to arrange the watches.
               "Ther Swaller and I will take keer of ther chief while you git er nap; you must be
                  tired with hunting," he said, "arter er spell we will call you. So fix yerself
                  jest as confortable as yer like; that ar shelvin' rock is as much protection as
                  any man oughter have, and somewhat arter midnight we'll rouse yer."
               "You must do so if the slightest change occurs," and after preparing some medicine
                  and giving particular directions, Moncrief strolled to a little distance, rolled
                  himself up in his blankets and sought repose.
               And rest he might have gained, but slumber fled for a long time from him. The
                  nearness to which he had taken a fellow mortal's life, his strange surroundings
                  and especially the beauty of the girl, were things that he could not banish from
                  his mind. Fain would he have watched the little group within the wigwam, but could
                  not. The curtains were closely drawn. He could see the light of the fire flashing
                  through the openings in the bark, but that was all. He could hear, for a time, the
                  low hum of voices, but could not distinguish farther than that it was, to him, the
                  strange language of the Indians. But, at length, the poppy leaves fell around him
                  and his spirit, freed from the trammels of the flesh, wandered far away from the
                  wild and rock-bound shore, to the loved ones at home.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               SHOON-KA-SKA.
               THE young brave whom the father of the Swallow had selected as a fitting mate for
                  his daughter, was among the most noted of the tribe. A chief by the right of
                  birth, he had already won a name second to none of his age, and could confidently
                  look forward to the time when he would wear the highest honors. Had his tribe been
                  upon the war path he would have fought desperately for scalps. Now, in the more
                  peaceful pursuits of hunting, fishing and trapping, he made amends as far as
                  possible, for their loss.
               Gifted by nature with a strongly muscled frame, and a bold heart and determined
                  will; skillful with the paddle and rifle; keen eyed as the lynx, and with a foot
                  swift, tireless, and noiseless as the wolf, it was not strange that he should be
                  praised in the locality where men were measured by the physical and not mental
                  abilities. Somewhat, too, of rude beauty there was in his face, although strongly
                  marked with the prevailing traits of cunning and revenge. Evidently Nature had
                  intended him for a warrior, and the force of circumstances that robbed him of that
                  bloody pastime, fretted his proud spirit. The long line of ancestry had reveled in
                  scalps. They were the medals they loved to hang about their necks, and the
                  decorations they coveted for their wigwams. And that disposition made Shoon-ka-ska
                  treacherous in the extreme. If he could have committed murder and secured a white
                  man's scalp without fear of detection, he would not have hesitated for a single
                  moment, and once obtained he would secretly have hugged it to his heart as a miser
                  does his ill-gotten gold.
               The ambition of his nature to be the head of his people tempted him, also, to look
                  upon the most honored and beautiful girl as the one to fill his wigwam. No other
                  would satisfy him. Not that he had any particular affection for the Swallow, or
                  that her rare loveliness had touched his heart as it never failed to do that of
                  others, but she stood the highest and would, more than any other, minister to the
                  haughty feelings of his heart.
               More than once he had been tempted to tell her of his affection, by placing
                  presents at the door of her wigwam in the dead hour of night. More than once the
                  words of passion had trembled upon his lips, but he thought the time was not yet
                  ripe. He feared somewhat the complete idolization of her father, as well,
                  perchance, as the innocence and girlish nature of the Swallow herself, and dared
                  not risk a refusal, that would have been death to him. His proud heart would never
                  have recovered from such a blow. And so he had loitered in his love making until
                  the white men began to crowd the shores of the lake—to invade even the red man's
                  home. But wait no longer he would. Whatever was to be his fate he would know
                  quickly.
               On the very morning that the Thunder and his daughter were floating in their canoe
                  far away from the wigwams of the Ojibwas, he was seeking the girl. Her mother
                  wondered at his questioning, but told him they had gone away from home—where, she
                  knew not. He paced uneasily through the encampment but found her not. He sought
                  the shore—there was no canoe in sight. Had there been the slightest particle of a
                  trail he would have followed it like a hound, but there was not. Water and air
                  never leave any. The circle fades from the stream as the cloud from the sky, and
                  no trace remains.
               Enquiry having proved useless, there was nothing left but search; and any one but
                  an Indian would have shrunk from such a task. Leaping into his canoe he began
                  paddling slowly along the shore and carefully examining every part. But there was
                  neither the print of a moccasin or the mark left by the landing of a boat, and not
                  time enough had elapsed for the waves to have washed out the latter from the firm
                  sand. Seaward there was nothing in sight save the gulls, intent upon procuring
                  food, and now and then a flock of other aquatic birds skimming from point to
                  point. To have followed farther upon such an uncertainty did not suit his habits
                  of indolence, for the Indian, except when under excitement, is far from being
                  active in his habits. The women are literally the "hewers of wood and drawers of
                  water."
               There was nothing for him to do but wait, and turning his light bark to the shore
                  of an island that perfectly commanded the water at every point, he hid it in the
                  bushes, and concealing himself from all but the most minute observation, began his
                  watch.
               Unintentionally he had landed upon a point, that was used by the tribe for a
                  burying ground, and soon his attention was drawn to something or somebody moving
                  around beneath the upraised graves. Was it man or beast? Human or a ghost? Look as
                  he would he could not determine for a time. Then he saw that it was a very old
                  squaw, who enjoyed the doubtful reputation of being a Wabe-no or Magician—in
                  plainer terms, a witch.
               All uneducated, and consequently superstitious people, have those among them who
                  boast of skill at divination—at telling both the past and the future—who sell
                  charms to win love, and tell where hidden treasures may be found. Though known by
                  different names, all the aboriginal tribes of America have them, and they occupy
                  almost as commanding a place as the Great Medicine themselves, although their
                  movements are carried on in secret; for they love "the darkness rather than
                  light."
               For a long time he watched her closely, as she raked around with her long, skinny
                  fingers among the ashes of the dead, that had fallen from their unearthed tombs.
                  Clad in garments of wolf skin, and with the head covering of that animal so
                  arranged that it could be drawn as a hood over her own, she looked, crawling about
                  as she was, more like a veritable monster of the genus canis, than anything human. That she might be looking around for the
                  valuables with which the dead warriors were frequently buried, never entered his
                  mind. He knew that the rank mandrake was the abode of the noisome toad and hissing
                  serpent, and what could woman be doing there except for some foul purpose?
               With feelings of awe, almost of fear, he saw her approach, raise up her head and
                  look towards the spot where he was concealed. Had she discovered him, and was she
                  angry at having her solitude disturbed? It might be so, and his heart sunk within
                  him. He could distinctly see her face, (horrid with its countless wrinkles),
                  framed in straggling locks of snow-white hair, and the eyes that still flashed
                  undimmed and fiery. Age—a century almost, had not tamed them, and they told of a
                  hell of passions burning in that withered frame.
               Still groping she came towards him. He almost held his breath. She was passing,
                  and his heart beat more freely—its wild beatings were becoming still. Strange that
                  one who fears nothing mortal can be made
                  to tremble like a child by anything having the slightest semblance of the
                  supernatural. But in an instant all his fears returned. She stopped directly in
                  front of him, appeared to transfix him with her eyes, and almost screamed, "Come
                  forth! What do you here, in the dwelling place of the dead? Is this a place for
                  your moccasins to leave their imprint? Hark! how the bones rattle in the
                  coffins!"
               He sprang to his feet with the first word. Often as he had seen her around the
                  wigwams, he had never met her alone in the forest, and especially amid such
                  ghost-provoking surroundings.
               "You are seeking for the living and not the dead," she continued in her strained
                  and unnatural voice. "They are not here. Go elsewhere and seek them."
               "How do you know that?" he stammered in astonishment. He had not the slightest
                  idea how closely she and her spies had watched all the younger portion of the
                  tribe, with the view of some day making them pay tribute.
               "How do I know that the trail of the White Dog is upon the ground and the flight
                  of the swallows through the sky? The spirits of those who are sleeping here tell
                  me all things."
               "Here is tobacco—wampum. Tell me where I will find her I seek, if you know."
               "If I know? Beware how you doubt my word. There are those within my call that
                  would strangle you as soon as I could this serpent," and she took one from the
                  bosom of her dress, and swung it in dangerous proximity to his face.
               "I tell you I know all things that have been and will be."
               "Then tell me where I will find—"
               "The Swallow? What do you seek her for?"
               "Why need I tell you?"
               "You would make her your wife. Beware that the pale face does not steal her from
                  you."
               "I know that they are coming in great numbers, but why should I fear them?"
               "Because one is with her now!"
               "With Shaw-Shaw?"
               "With the Swallow. He is sitting by her side and whispering in her ears."
               "Where? Tell me where?"
               "The hour has not yet come. Sit down and wait."
               Though more than half inclined to doubt her word, yet he dared not to give
                  utterance to his thoughts. That she had been upon the island when and where the
                  wounded chief was carried, he could have no means of knowing any more than that
                  she had seen him land, and purposely thrown herself in his path. Yet so it was,
                  and she used her information to impress him with her power.
               Motioning him to a seat and bidding him wait until her return, she was starting
                  away.
               "Where are you going?" he asked.
               "Wait and see. The spirits of the earth and air and water come not at the call of
                  mortals. Spells must be used to compel them. If you would know more, wait. If not,
                  to your canoe and away with all speed."
               "I will wait."
               He was fast overcoming his fear, and curiosity as well as the hope of learning
                  something of the Swallow, urged him to remain. "A pale face was with her and
                  whispering in her ears." So she had told him. He would learn, if he could, and woe
                  to any one of a white skin that should dare to come between him and the object on
                  which he had set his heart. But when and where had they met? There had been no
                  white man around the encampment for days. They must have met before, and this was
                  by appointment. Yet why was her father with her? Was he privy to the arrangement,
                  or had he only been used as a blind—she deserting him when it suited her purpose
                  so to do? It was all very strange to him; he could not understand the matter at
                  all, and the black and devilish fires of jealousy awoke in his heart for the first
                  time. He could but wait, watch and bide his time for revenge.
               The old squaw passed from sight around a point of rocks, but almost instantly
                  returned. She brought with her a little kettle, built a fire, placed the utensils
                  upon the flames, and threw in a handful of herbs. Then she circled around singing
                  a wild, weird song. The witches on the blasted heath, that tempted ed Macbeth to
                  his doom could have found a fitting partner in her, albeit she was but a
                  counterfeit.
               "The charm works," she said, clapping her skinny hands above her head, and
                  throwing herself upon the ground, she lay like one asleep for a long time.
               So long indeed, that the Indian became impatient. The effect of the mummery had
                  began to lose its effect upon him. He was tired of waiting and longed for action.
                  He became restless and moved about. He was determined to waste no more time, and
                  was already unfastening his canoe, when the witch arose and firmly demanded:—
               "Where is the White Dog going? Is his nose so keen of scent, that he can follow
                  the trail after there has been blood spilled upon it?"
               "Blood? Whose? Not that of the Swallow?"
               "Your own eyes must learn. See! the shadows are gathering. It will soon be night.
                  When the owl leaves the hollow in the tree, and the whippoorwil sings, a light
                  will arise that will guide the White Dog."
               Cunning old woman! She knew that a camp fire would be lighted, and that it could
                  be seen plainly from where they were standing.
               "And I must wait until night comes?" he asked, impatiently.
               "So wills the spirits. They whispered it to me in my sleep."
               He saw nothing to do but obey. He had trusted her thus far, and it was too late
                  now to change his plan. Following her example, he filled and lighted his pipe, and
                  for a time they smoked in silence. Smoked until the sun had entirely disappeared
                  behind the western hills, and dark shadows had gathered around. Then she arose and
                  pointing to a little spark of fire that gleamed as a star upon the water, almost
                  whispered:—
               "Let Shoon-ka-ska go, but be watchful as the wild cat when guarding her young, and
                  silent as when it is stealing upon its prey. Go! I would be alone to talk with the
                  dead."
               Without even a word of thanks he stepped into his canoe and shoved off. Whatever
                  the secret of the light, he was determined to understand. A wild, mocking laugh
                  upon his ears. He turned his head, saw the old witch woman standing as he had left
                  her and waving her hands wildly around her head. Then she suddenly disappeared. It
                  seemed as if the earth had opened and swallowed her, and he struck the water more
                  rapidly with his paddle, and forced the light bark onward.
               Had he but waited and watched for a little while, he would have seen the old woman
                  steal away in her canoe from the opposite side of the island, and direct her
                  course towards the encampment of the tribe. Witch or not, she had no desire to
                  pass the night amid rattling coffins, fleshless bones, and the dust of the
                  dead.
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               THE WIGWAM ON THE ISLAND. A DEADLY SHOT.
               ALTHOUGH the chief had received almost immediate attention after his injury, it
                  was evident even to his uneducated watchers that it was much more serious than
                  they had suspected.
               The wound caused by the conical ball partook both of the character that surgeons
                  would call lacerated and contused. Its edges were jagged and unequal, and violent
                  inflammation could not but follow. The hemorrhage too had been great, had not
                  totally subsided under either the inward remedies or external applications, and
                  was evidently of an arterial character. This, had they been the least versed in
                     Materia Medica they could easily have told
                  from the light color of the blood, and its issuing in rapid jets in
                  contradistinction to the dark purple, and smooth, uninterrupted flow from the
                  veins.
               But though not thus wise the old trapper had seen enough during his wandering life
                  both in accidents and during the battles of the Chippewas and Sioux to convince
                  him that something more than ordinary treatment was required. For the girl, she
                  sat in stony silence lence with her eyes
                  never wandering from her father's face, or without changing her attitude except
                  when she went to procure fresh leaves and water from a neighboring spring.
               During one of these brief absences the old trapper cautiously removed the bullet
                  from the pouch of the chief, and digging a hole with his knife in the floor of the
                  wigwam, buried it forever from sight.
               "It wouldn't do him ther least grain of good," he muttered between his compressed
                  lips, "ter know how he got hurted. It war er chance shot. Ther bullet struck ther
                  water and glanced. I mought have been jest as onlucky myself, and ther boy hadn't
                  orter suffer for what he didn't mean ter do—and shan't nuther."
               "What were you saying?" asked the Swallow, who came in at the moment.
               Her footsteps had been so light that even his watchful ears failed to hear her.
                  Taken completely by surprise, and fearful that he had been overheard, it was a
                  moment before he could collect his thoughts sufficiently to answer.
               "I—I—" he stammered, "I talking?"
               "Yes. I heard you distinctly."
               "What was I er sayin'?"
               "I could not catch the words. It was the language of the pale faces."
               "So! That's jest like me. Old fool, that I am, I am always er talkin' ter myself
                  when thar hain't anybody else eround."
               "But what were you speakin'about? Was it of my father?"
               "I reckon it must have bin, though I disremember now. Did you pass near ther young
                  medercine?"
               "Yes."
               She blushed as she answered, for she felt guilty for having stopped to look at him
                  as he lay sleeping with his head pillowed upon his arm. To look, and even compare
                  his face to what she fancied the Manitou might be!
               "Whar he er sleepin'?"
               "Yes."
               "Wall, we'll have ter call him arter a leetle."
               "Then you think my father is worse?" she exclaimed in alarm.
               "I didn't say that," he replied, seeing how agitated she was. "I didn't say that,
                  but it's best ter allers be on ther safe side, and he knows more'n we do by er
                  long shot."
               "I will call him now."
               "No. Let me go."
               He was too late. Her active feet, hastened both by fear and love, were beyond the
                  limits of the wigwam before he had arisen. There was nothing left for him to do
                  but to sit down again, and the more especially as the wounded man was groaning
                  heavily and demanded instant attention; some strong hand to keep him from turning
                  upon the injured side and displacing the bandages.
               As the Swallow had said, Pitt Moncrief lay with one arm beneath his head. His cap
                  had fallen off and his curling auburn hair glittered in the soft starlight like
                  strands of gold. His face was upturned so that she could distinctly see every
                  feature, and marvelled at the beauty of the white brow, the veined lids, the soft
                  cheek and the red lips parted with a sweet smile. She bent low over him, and would
                  have called his name, but she had never learned it. Then by an irresistible
                  impulse of her affectionate nature she bent still lower and touched his cheek with
                  her lips. It was as light as if a butterfly's wing had just brushed it in passing,
                  or as if an angel had left a holy impress there. Then as if startled by what she
                  had done, she drew back and looked wildly around at the wigwam, the forest, and
                  the gray old rocks; rocks primeval with the creation and bearing still the marks
                  of the Noahic flood. Reassured by her scrutiny; satisfied that she had not been
                  seen, she approached a little nearer and said in a tremulous voice:—
               "Let the pale Medicine arise. The Beaver would see him."
               "Beaver? Whom? What?" questioned Moncrief springing to his feet and rubbing his
                  eyes.
               "The Beaver. The one that travels with him in the canoe. Him that has many traps.
                  Does the young pale face not remember?" repeated the girl.
               "Yes—yes."
               The rifle he had grasped as he started up, was instantly lowered and his wild look
                  changed into the sweetest smiles. He was fully himself in a moment.
               "Is it you, Swallow? Have I slept so long? How is your father?" he asked in rapid
                  succession.
               "The black Manitou of fever is busy with his heart."
               "Come," and he walked rapidly by her side.
               The girl had fancied she was entirely unobserved when she gave the kiss (it was
                  one of gratitude and not of love) to the sleeping man, but was she right? The
                  instant she had moved away a dark form arose from behind the rock that had
                  partially sheltered the sleeping man. There was an unsheathed knife in his hand,
                  and the star-light, as it fell upon his face, showed that it was black with
                  passion. Like an angel of mercy, the Swallow had come between that savage heart
                  and murder. But the White Dog had seen the kiss she pressed upon the cheek of the
                  pale face, and it had sealed his fate! Thus far the words of the old Indian witch
                  had proved true, but where was the blood upon the trail she had spoken of?
               Carefully he watched Moncrief and the girl until they disappeared in the wigwam.
                  That structure was a puzzle to him. Had they already gone to housekeeping? Had the
                  Swallow builded it and then come to ask the pale face to share it with her? It
                  might be. He had heard words pass between them but could not distinguish what they
                  were, for they had been uttered lowly. Find out he would, and throwing his blanket
                  over his shoulder, and placing his hatchet ready for instant use, and his knife in
                  his teeth, he knelt down and crept slowly forward. In the movement all the cunning
                  of his race, and all his experience upon the hunting trail, were brought into use.
                  Sometimes the snail was not slower in its movements, and then the fox not more
                  swift. Every stone, inequality of the ground and bush, was taken an advantage of.
                  Nothing that could hide his form was neglected. Of a necessity his progress was
                  very slow, but at length he reached the wigwam and crawling beneath some of the
                     debris that the old trapper had left
                  scattered around, he placed his eye to a little opening and peeped within.
               The chief lay at full length with his daughter kneeling on one side, and Moncrief
                  on the other, while the old trapper was standing at his feet, leaning upon his
                  long rifle. A beautiful tableau, as the red firelight flashed upon it. The
                  skulking Indian on the outer side bent down his ear and listened.
               "Ther Thunder haint so well, am he, Pitt?" asked the trapper.
               "So," thought the White Dog, "the Beaver is there, and it is the father of the
                  Swallow that has spilled his blood upon the trail. The old witch was right.
                  Henceforth I will believe every word she says."
               "Violent inflammation has followed as I supposed," was the answer of Moncrief;
                  "and it will require active measures to subdue it."
               "Will he live? Oh, my poor father!" whispered the girl.
               The young man hesitated about answering, and the trapper did it for him.
               "Life am ther gift of ther Great Spirit, Swallow. It am him that gives and him
                  that takes it erway ergain. But what do yer think ther chances ar, Pitt?"
               "I think—hope that he is not dangerous. He will require constant care and
                  attention, however. Can you not fix a place for this poor girl to lie down? She
                  will need all her strength. It may be days before there is any change."
               He was about to say for the better, but checked himself. He would not hold out
                  hopes that might never be realized. Better for her that she should become
                  accustomed by degrees to the idea of death, than that it should break suddenly
                  upon her.
               "I cannot—cannot sleep," answered the girl, looking, as she ever did, her thanks.
                  "Let the Beaver rest. When the sun shines again, I will sleep—if my poor father is
                  better."
               "I believe she is right," replied Moncrief. "You lie down, Beaver. There is far
                  too great a strain upon her nerves now, to rest. In the morning you can relieve
                  her."
               "Wal, I don't know but that am ther best thing that kin be done; but you must call
                  me ther very minnit that yer think I kin be of ther slightest use. You'll promise
                  me that, won't yer, and not fergit it nuther?"
               
               "Certainly."
               "Then I'll jest go and throw myself down in ther spot that you did—it's warm,
                  haint it?—and take er leetle nap."
               Left to themselves, the white man and girl, after first giving their attention to
                  the sufferer, conversed in guarded tones. To say that he was simply interested in
                  her, would be short of the fact.
               "Is your father a chief, as the Beaver calls him?" he asked.
               "Yes."
               "And you have always lived here?"
               "Yes."
               "And never been among my people?"
               "No, not even to the Soo."
               "Your mother is she living?"
               "Yes."
               "Then we must send for her at once."
               "You will not leave my father?" she asked anxiously.
               "Not until he is beyond danger. Have no fear of that. How long have you known the
                  Beaver?"
               "Since I was a little pappoose."
               He saw that she evidently was loath to converse, and allowed the conversation to
                  flag, attributing it to the anxiety she felt for her parent. In the main he was
                  right, but there was another cause that made her reticent. Suddenly and for the
                  first time since they met, she thought of the warning of her father, "Beware of
                  the pale face! His tongue is false as that of the serpent! He speaks lies!" She
                  thought, also, of the fate of her sister, and trembled to reflect how much she had
                  become interested in one of white blood. But could such a fair form and face
                  conceal a black heart? She would almost have doubted it if even the Manitou had
                  whispered it in her ears.
               With broken conversation upon uninteresting subjects and attention to the chief,
                  the night passed away, and the sky, like plagionite, proclaimed the coming of
                  another day. Then the quick ear of the Swallow was attracted by something stirring
                  without. In an instant she was by the side of Moncrief, who had sat in a nodding
                  attitude for the last hour, had laid her hand upon his arm and whispered in his
                  ear:—
               "Does the pale face not hear something?"
               "No. What is it?"
               "I don't know, but I am certain that something was brushing against the
                  wigwam."
               "It was probably the Beaver. I know by experience that he is given to rambling
                  around in the night."
               "It was not him," she replied, looking out and pointing to where he was seated
                  with his rifle in his hand, and evidently watching something.
               "Beaver?" called out Moncrief. "Has something aroused you too?"
               The reply of the old man was by raising his rifle to his shoulder and firing into
                  a clump of bushes that grew upon a rock whose shelving edges overhung the water.
                  Then he bounded forward hatchet in hand. Very soon, however, he returned
                  grumbling:—
               "Ther raskel got erway from me arter all. I had bin er watchin' him fer er long
                  time, and ef yer had only kept still I could have waited ontil he got in ther open
                  space and fetched him jest as easy as could be. Now he has gone hook and line, bob
                  and sinker. It's too bad."
               "What was it?" asked both in a breath.
               "What yer don't often see. Er big black timber wolf."
               "Are you certain?" questioned Moncrief.
               "Am I sartain! Jest as ef I wouldn't know er wolf arter so many years. I'll bet my
                  life ergin er shot gun that I drawed blood, and I'm ergoin ter look fer it jest as
                  soon as it gits er leetle lighter," and he filled and lighted his pipe to smoke
                  away his discontent.
               He was right in supposing that he had drawn blood, but it was not the blood of a
                  wolf, but that of a man. The White Dog had remained concealed, and watched every
                  movement within the wigwam as long as he dared to do so. The fast coming light
                  warned him that it would be dangerous to stay any longer, and his movements while
                  retreating had aroused the trapper as well as those within. This he was cunning
                  enough to understand, and drawing his blanket closely around him (a dark one as it
                  happened) he imitated both the growl and gait of a wolf, and stole away towards
                  the bushes. His speed, however, was accelerated by the bullet of the trapper. It
                  cut deeply enough into the fleshy parts of the shoulder to draw blood but not to
                  produce any serious results, and plunging into the water he hid beneath the
                  overhanging rock with only his mouth above the water, until all was silence again.
                  Then he swam softly along the shore for a considerable distance, and then again
                  hid himself in the dense woods. Death he had escaped, but it was solely by
                  accident. The old trapper rarely missed his aim and had not his bullet hit a
                  branch, his heart would have been cleft in twain, and he have sung his last song,
                  either of revenge or victory.
               To that he gave no thought. His blood had been shed by a pale face, and like the
                  beast he had imitated does that of a wounded deer, he would follow the trail of
                  the Beaver until it was amply atoned for. The fact of its having been done by
                  accident he gave no thought to. The incarnate vengeance of his savage nature knew
                  but one way of being appeased. "Blood for blood," was the only law he
                  recognized.
               Little, however, did any of the other interested parties think of such a thing.
                  The trapper had sought the rock with the first clear light of day—had found blood
                  upon it and was satisfied. He never reflected for even a single moment, that he
                  might have been deceived, well as he knew the character of the red man, and often
                  as he had played the same game. He was convinced that the wolf he had shot at was
                  dead—had fallen from the rock, been swept away by the, waves and was now food for
                  the fishes. And that was all he cared about the matter, except the loss of the
                  skin.
               "It haint often," he muttered, "that yer find er black one, although ther ar
                  plenty of grey ones about. It would have made er rare mat fer yer ter have taken
                  home, Pitt, or I could have sold it at ther Soo, for as much as two dollars. Yes,
                  yes, it war too bad that I didn't git it arter all. How somever, it haint always
                  that luck am ergin me."
               But soon he forgot his chagrin in tending upon the injured man. As Moncrief had
                  feared, the wound proved troublesome, and the patient anything but easy to
                  control. In the delirium of the fever he would tear off the bandages, and even
                  when himself, submitted with a bad grace, very much preferring such treatment as
                  was usual among his people.
               For days he was never left alone even for a single instant. By turns his daughter,
                  the trapper and Moncrief kept watch, relieving each other as occasion required,
                  and never going to any distance away from the wigwam. Fish were plentiful and
                  easily to be secured. A line let down at night and baited with almost anything,
                  would furnish them with the large, golden fleshed trout, and an half an hour with
                  torch and spear, yield a bountiful return of white fish. For other food they had
                  the stores they carried, and consequently there was no fear of starvation.
               The proposition to send for the wife of the chief had first been vetoed by the
                  trapper, and then by the elements.
               "She would only be in the way," he said. "with her old fashioned squaw notions. Ef
                  ther Swaller and yer and I haint enuff ter save him, ther hull tribe couldn't do
                  it. Besides, who am ter go?"
               "You must certainly do it, if any one," replied Moncrief.
               "And I shan't—that's flat!"
               "Would it be possible for me? Remember that I have never been there, and do not
                  know a single one of the tribe. Do you think that it would be best for me to go?
                  If so I will venture."
               "And git knocked in ther head fer yer pains."
               "Then we must remain as we are. I would not ask the daughter to leave the father
                  at such a time, even if I thought it was safe for her to paddle a canoe so far
                  alone."
               The trapper thought differently. He knew that the girl would be as safe upon the
                  water as the land, and was not long in expressing his opinion.
               "She kin paddle er canoe jist as well as er duck kin swim," he blunted out in his
                  usual brusque manner. "Yer needn't have any fears erbout her. Besides, ef she
                  should git upset she kin swim like er fish, and nuthin wouldn't hurt her ther
                  least grain."
               "For shame, Beaver!"
               The hot blood rushed to the face of Moncrief, and his hand was clenched as for a
                     blow. But though passionate, he had
                  the rare gift of self command, and instantly restraining both his voice and
                  actions continued:—
               "Whatever comes, the Swallow shall not go alone."
               Ah! how sweetly the black eyes looked upon him at the words. The pale face was
                  placing her in a far higher position than she had ever occupied—was lifting her in
                  her own estimation—was treating her as if she had not been born to be the slave of
                  a man, but his equal. Even more, his speech and manners were even tender and
                  respectful. No woman, no matter how uneducated, can but feel such attentions, and
                  to those who receive them for the first time they are particularly pleasing.
               "Wall, yer needn't git mad erbout it," replied the Beaver. "I didn't mean any
                  harm. Only ef yer know'd ther Injins as well as I do, you wouldn't be erfeared of
                  trustin' her in er canoe."
               "It will be days before any one can go," interposed the Swallow, and at once
                  settling the matter. "See how the black clouds are gathering and the gulls flying
                  inland. Hark to the roaring of the wind and the waves in the hollows of the
                  rocks."
               "She am right, Pitt, she am right!" answered the trapper, after a more than
                  usually careful survey of the sky. "We ar goin' ter have er regular old-fashioned
                  Nor' wester, and no canoe would live on ther lake for er single minnit. These
                  redskins are mighty knowin'some about ther weather."
               The result proved that they were right in their conjectures. A wild and protracted
                  storm followed, that kept them for days snugly housed. Then the sun broke forth in
                  regal beauty, the water became like a sea of glass, and scarcely a cloud flecked
                  the sky. But fierce as had been the tempest without, it was rivalled by that
                  within the wigwam, where life and death were contending for the mastery.
               Many a time it appeared to the anxious watchers that the struggle had ceased, and
                  the dark angels of dissolution triumphed. The Swallow sat in tearless silence. Her
                  eyes became like balls of fire. She refused food, refused to rest, refused to be
                  comforted. Atrophy appeared to have fastened upon her, and Moncrief trembled more
                  on her account, than he did for her father. He felt that unless relief came she
                  could not long survive the terrible excitement she was under.
               "Thank God! he is better. The crisis is past," he said, as he entered the wigwam
                  one morning, the very one on which the golden sunbeams pierced the dark
                  clouds.
               "And he will live?" asked the Swallow, breaking the silence that had held her like
                  a spell for hours.
               "He will live."
               "May the Great Spirit be thanked," and kneeling down she breathed a voiceless
                  prayer to Him whose voice she believed to be the thunder, and whose eye-flashes
                  the fitful lightning.
               "Yes, thank God," repeated Moncrief.
               He saw that the eyes of the girl were running over with tears, and knew that she
                  was saved as well as her parent.
               "Now you will take rest and food," he said kindly, taking her by the hand.
               "Let the pale medicine speak. The child of the red man will obey."
               He saw that she was supplied with fitting nourishment, gave her some quieting
                  medicine, and having prepared a comfortable couch, was more than gratified to see
                  the long strained nerves relax and the heavy eyelids fall.
               "Now yer had better git er nap yerself," whispered the trapper. "I wouldn't er
                  thought that er human bein' could have kept up so long. It's wonderful, wonderful
                  what strength thar am in yer leetle body."
               "No, I will not rest yet, I feel more like exercise. I will take my rifle and
                  stroll about a little. Then I will lie down."
               "Wall, jest as yer have er mind ter. I will sit by ther chief until yer come
                  back."
               Moncrief gave a somewhat hasty glance at the father, but a lingering one at the
                  daughter, and then departed. Hardly, however, had he disappeared in the woods
                  before the trapper heard first the report of his rifle and then his voice calling
                  for help. He rushed wildly out and saw Moncrief, whom he had began to love as if
                  he had been his own child, staggering towards him.
               "In the name of heaven what am ther matter with yer?" asked the excited old
                  man.
               "I am wounded. See!" and he pointed to an arrow that was sticking from his
                  side.
               "Who did it? Who did it?"
               "An Indian."
               "An Indian! Didn't yer shoot him?"
               "I fired, but do not think I hit him."
               The outcry had aroused the Swallow. She came hurriedly from the wigwam—saw at a
                  glance what had happened, attempted to withdraw the feathered shaft, and
                  murmuring: "It is a poisoned arrow! He will die!" fell at the feet of Moncrief as
                  if her heart had ceased to beat for all time.
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               THE POISON OF THE CROBALUS.
               THERE are moments in the life of every man, when all the fears of his nature are
                  awakened, and all his dreams of agony are condensed into a single instant, and
                  this was the feeling of the Beaver, when he heard the exclamation of the girl. For
                  a moment he stood as if suddenly struck dumb and robbed of the power of motion. He
                  had seen death in almost every shape—had shook hands, as it were, more than once
                  with the grim skeleton of the scythe and hour-glass; but never had anything so
                  thrilled him to the very core of his heart.
               But not long can mental stupor retain its hold upon such men. Their lives are one
                  of unceasing action, rather than thought, except when it is forced upon them, and
                  when a decision must be instantly made—when to deliberate would be certain death.
                  The one whose canoe is overturned in the swift and rocky rapids—who meets a bear,
                  wolf or panther disputing his path—who is thrown down, and about to be gored by
                  the horns of an angry stag, has no time for cool deliberation, no time to form
                  plans of escape. The resolve and the execution must be both instant and
                  simultaneous.
               And it was this life-time habit, this second nature, that enabled the Beaver to
                  soon throw off the chain that bound him.
               "Pisened! pisened by er Injun!" he muttered, and the words recalled him to himself
                  and the exigency of the case.
               Without paying the slightest attention to the fainting girl, he lifted up Moncrief
                  in his powerful arms, as if he had been an infant, and carried him to the shadow
                  of the wigwam. Then he began to open the clothing.
               "Is it true," asked Pitt, "what the Swallow says?"
               "Wait er minute. I'll tell yer jest as soon as I see."
               The very first glance had satisfied him that the girl was right. He knew that if
                  the head, barbed on either side like a fish hook, was buried beneath the flesh,
                  that it could not be withdrawn like those used in hunting, but would have to be
                  cut out before anything could be done towards antidoting the virus.
               "Wait er minit," he repeated as soon as he had obtained a clear view of the
                  wound.
               He tried to withdraw the frail shaft. The fastenings that held it to the stone
                  head parted, and he threw it in disgust way. But his worst fears were
                  realized.
               "Tell me quickly," almost commanded Moncrief." "Tell me, Beaver, is the arrow
                  poisoned?"
               "Yes. May ther Lord help yer, Yes."
               "Can you not draw out the head?"
               "I am tryin' ter do it, but can't."
               "Get my case of instruments. You will find pinchers there."
               "Natur gin me jest as good a pair, and I know how ter use 'em better nor any of
                  yer doctor things," and he bent down, fastened his teeth firmly upon the part of
                  the flint that was unburied, and after a mighty effort, tore it away.
               "Is it out?" asked Moncrief.
               "Yes. What have yer got ter say ergin them kind of instruments?"
               "Nothing—but—"
               You jest keep quiet ontil I suck out ther pison."
               "For the love of heaven do not attempt such a thing!" exclaimed Moncrief with
                  startling earnestness, as he pushed him back.
               "If you have a slight scratch upon your
                  lips or tongue, or a defective tooth, it would be certain death."
               "Yer right thar, my boy, but I've done it often. My lips and tongue are all right,
                  I reckon, but I don't know erbout ther teeth. They haint as good as they whar when
                  I war er boy, that am er fact."
               "Let me do it," whispered a soft voice by his side.
               "You, Swallow!"
               "The pale face saved the life of my father, and—"
               "That is no reason why you should risk your own. Go, Beaver, heat red hot anything
                  you can find in the shape of iron, and bring it to me. You, Swallow, bring me the
                  flask of what you call 'fire water,' out of the wigwam."
               Both commands were obeyed as quickly as possible. Yet it was some time before the
                  trapper could get the head of his hatchet, (the only thing that he could think of
                  that would answer the purpose,) hot enough to be of any use. He, as well as the
                  girl, had learned to obey the orders of Moncrief, while attending upon the chief,
                  and they did so without questioning, although they had as little idea of the
                  practice of counteracting poisons by means of ardent spirits and radiating heat,
                  as they had of the revolutions of the earth.
               "Is the poison mineral or animal?" asked Moncrief of the trapper, when he had
                  returned and was holding the hot iron (as he directed him) as near to the skin as
                  possible, without burning it.
               "It was from the pisen tooth of ther rattlesnake. Thar can be no manner of doubt
                  of that ar."
               "Give me the brandy every five minutes, and keep up the hot application."
               "Yes, but—"
               The trapper failed to finish the sentence, for once at least in his life, he was
                  deep in thought.
               So long a time had he necessarily been absent, that despite the spirits Moncrief
                  had swallowed, the pains were shooting, very severe, proceeding from the wound,
                  and running in the direction of the heart. The wound itself was marbled and
                  swollen, and there were violent symptoms of vomiting and vertigo. In fact, upon
                  the side of the man as far as could be seen, the spots of the loathsome reptile
                  were being reproduced in all their deformity.
               This was too much for the trapper. In an instant he had thrown the hot iron from
                  him.
               "Sich new fangled notions haint ergoin to save yer," he exclaimed, "and yer shan't
                  die ef I kin help it;" and he disappeared in the direction of the woods.
               "Beaver! Beaver!" called Moncrief, and seeing that he was not answered, enquired
                  of the Swallow where he had gone.
               "To gather the weeds that will render the bite of the serpent as harmless as milk
                  to to the babe," she replied, suppressing by a mighty effort the wild emotions of
                  her heart, and compelling her trembling voice to obey her will.
               "What is it? Do you know the name? Will he soon be back? Oh, heaven! that I should
                  die thus."
               The tears of the girl fell so fast that she could not answer. He die! The thought
                  was like the banishment of all of sunshine from her future sky.
               "Swallow," he repeated, "do you not hear me? Will the Beaver be back very,
                     very soon?"
               "Yes, yes."
               "What has he gone after? O, that he should leave me when my flesh is on fire—the
                  blood running like moulten lead through my veins, and my very heart burning up. I
                  shall die! I shall die! There is no help for me now."
               She crept still nearer to him. She smoothed the hair, damp with the dews of death,
                  from his forehead; clasped both of his hands within her own to stop the convulsive
                  motions, and pressed them to her lips again and again. If she could have died for
                  him, how willingly she would have offered up her young life as a sacrifice. Like
                  one gazing upon the fabled basilisk, she could not withdraw her eyes from his
                  face. Yet it was horrible to look upon. The cheeks were livid, and the lips
                  purple. Upon the fair, white throat she could see creeping the loathsome likeness
                  of the serpent's spots. The pupil of the eyes were like sparks of fire, surrounded
                  by an iris of blood, and the lids were swollen and forced upwards.
               "Oh, my God!" he murmured faintly; "have mercy. Forgive all my sins. Mother, dear
                  mother, I am dying—dy—"
               She had given him the very last drop of stimulant. All the gold in the world could
                  not have procured another, and she could only sit and wait the return of the
                  trapper. But would he come back in time? Would a single spark of life remain, and
                  if so, would his wild-wood pharmacy be of any avail against the subtle poison that
                  was running riot through his veins in sufficient quantities to have caused an
                  hundred deaths? Would the antidote provided by Nature against the bite of the
                  hideous Crobalus, be swift enough in its action,
                  administered, as it would be, so late, to stop its progress towards the heart?
               If it reached that—the citadel—then farewell life, and swing open wide the gates
                  of the other world, for the entrance of another soul freed from the clay fetters
                  of earth.
               "Oh, God, spare me, spare me!" was the faint prayer gasped from the swollen and
                  blackened lips.
               The heart of the Swallow more than echoed it, and if ever the petition of a soul
                  struggling in agony was heard by the Great Spirit, it was that. But she could look
                  no longer. Her head was bowed down upon the wildly-heaving bosom—her long, black
                  hair hung like a pall around it—and it required all her strength to even partially
                  control the workings of his fingers. Then came a mighty, convulsive shuddering of
                  his entire frame, and all was still.
               "Dead! Dead!" she murmured, and her form rested upon his. It was the dying upon
                  the dead!
               "Am I in time? Am he alive?" shouted the trapper, rushing up at the moment,
                  breathless with-exertion, for he had run fast and far.
               "He has gone to the spirit land," was the reply of the Swallow, but it sounded
                  more like a wail of agony than a human voice.
               "It cannot be! The Good Lord will not permit one so young and good ter die."
               The honest old man thought not at the moment that he was calling in question the
                  will of Him "who doeth all things well."
               "There will be mourning and blackened faces in the wigwams of the pale faces,"
                  continued the girl. "The mother will look in vain for the coming of her son, and
                  the father, for him who should take his place upon the war path when the snows of
                  many winters have lodged in his hair, and his arm is weak as the papoose, and his
                  steps unsteady as the wounded buck."
               "Not dead! Not dead! It shall not be!" and the trapper knelt by the side of the
                  disfigured and distorted body, and pressed his ear to his side, to listen for the
                  beatings of the heart.
               In an instant there was a great change in his manner. He started to his feet and
                  exclaimed:—
               "Take these ar leaves. Bile 'em jest as quick as ever yer kin, and bring them ter
                  me. He haint dead yit, and ef ther good Lord wills, he shan't be, nuther."
               Saved! One would about as soon have thought of attempting to save a man who had
                  been decapitated by the guillotine, or who had fallen in battle, pierced by a
                  hundred bullets. Saved! An army of physicians would have voted any one insane who
                  would have dared to advance such an idea. But the trapper stubbornly clung to the
                  belief that he had the means of almost resurrection in his hands.
               He crushed a portion of the leaves he had brought with him, and forced them into
                  the fixed jaws. Others he reduced to a pulp between his teeth, and applied them to
                  the wound, after wiping away the green ooze from the ragged lips.
               "Swaller! Swaller!" he shouted, "haint yer ever er comin'?" The passage of a
                  single moment was, to him, like the creeping of the hands around the entire
                  dial.
               "Yes, I am here."
               "Thank heaven!"
               She gave him a little cup of bark brimming over with the steaming liquor—steaming,
                  but not so hot as to be scalding. She was far calmer now than he, for the hour of
                  her terrible anxiety had past, and had sufficient forethought to cool it somewhat.
                  And well it was that she did so, for without a moment's ment's reflection he pried open the mouth with his
                  iron fingers and poured a portion therein.
               "Is this all you have got?" he asked, noticing how inadequate the supply was to
                  what he thought would be required.
               "There is plenty on the fire," she replied.
               "Good. Keep it er biling. Ther stronger ther better."
               He bathed the wound with what remained, and then handed her the cup to be
                  refilled. But many times both actions were repeated before there was any change,
                  and when at last it came, the eyes of the Swallow were the first to discern
                  it.
               "Look! Thank the Manitou! Look!" she exclaimed, though her voice was still
                  restricted in its volume. But there was a great joy in it. The wail of death had
                  changed into the pean of thanksgiving for life.
               "What am it, Swaller? what do you see?" he asked, wondering at the entire change
                  in her manner.
               "Are you blind? Can you not see?"
               "What are yer er talkin' erbout, child?"
               "The spots are fading away!"
               "They would do ther same thing ef he wer dead."
               The plummet of agony descended again into the heart of the girl. The hope that had
                  been raised fell as suddenly as the high flying bird, when it is pierced through
                  by the arrow of the hunter. Again she veiled her eyes and remained silent, until
                  the voice of the Beaver was heard in as exulting tones as she had used.
               "Yer right, Swallow, right!" he shouted, his voice ringing like a trumpet blast of
                  victory. "Yer right. Ther spots am fadin' out! His heart beats fuller—he's bergun'
                  ter breathe easier. Thank heaven! he will live yet."
               Dubious as had been the ending, there was no question in his mind about it now.
                  The fair flesh was rapidly resuming its accustomed whiteness. The spotted
                  discolorations were becoming less perceptible. There was a nervous twitching about
                  the mouth and eyelids, and even a faint flush upon the cheeks.
               "He will live!" replied the girl, after she had closely marked the change—very
                  closely indeed, for to have been deceived again would have been like a death blow.
                  "He will live! The Good Spirit has heard our prayers," and she darted away, her
                  feet light as air now, although they had been before like lead, to bring a fresh
                  supply of the medicine that had acted so like a charm.
               And charm it was, though hours were required to complete the cure. Hours for the
                  wrecked form and tortured brain to become calm: hours for the swelling to pass
                  away from lip and lid—hours for the snake-like glare to fade from the eyes—hours
                  for the parched tongue to cease to overfill the mouth almost to suffocation—hours
                  for the contracted throat to swallow easily, and hours for the mind to react from
                  the horrors it had passed through.
               But the westering sun saw him free again from pain, and able to sit up, although
                  the ordeal was far more terrrible than the most fiendish revenge could wish to
                  have fall upon even the most bitter enemy. May heaven in kindness save yours and
                  mine from such a fate.
               When they had fully discussed the matter—when the trapper had told how he had
                  found him, upon his return from the woods—had described (without the aid of
                  botany, to which he was a stranger,) the low growing plant that had been the means
                  (under Providence), of saving his life—had told him in what situations it could be
                  found, and related numerous instances of its life-saving efficacy—when he had
                  spoken of the wild anguish of the Swallow, until her cheeks burned for very shame,
                  their thoughts naturally turned to the cause of all this suffering and
                  anxiety.
               "Yer said it whar er Injin that shot-yer," asked the Beaver.
               "Certainly. I saw him just as plainly as I see you," replied Moncrief.
               "How did it happen. Tell us all erbout it, will yer, Pitt? Who knows but we may
                  find some startin' pint fer er trail that we may run down until we have arthed the
                  reptile."
               "I had scarcely got inter ther woods before I fancied that I heard a sound.
                  Thinking that it might be a rabbit, I half concealed myself behind a tree, hoping
                  to get a shot. In a moment I saw an Indian rise from among some fallen timber
                  almost directly in my path. I was about to speak to him when he saw me, raised his
                  bow and fired. My rifle was ready, and though I felt that I was wounded, I
                  returned the shot, and he bounded away. I knew that I was unfit to follow him. My
                  weapon was empty, and he could have killed me a dozen times before I could have
                  loaded it again, so I hastened toward the wigwam, shouted to you and—you know the
                  rest."
               "I know that if I had let yer had yer own way of doctorin', yer wouldn't have bin
                  erlive now."
               The old trapper could not but glorify himself a little over what he had done. It
                  was but natural that he should do so, though far from ordinarily being a
                  braggart.
               "I must confess that I owe my life to you and this good girl, but all I can do now
                  is to thank you. Hereafter I may be able to do more."
               "Thar! Jest stop that kind of talk, will yer. I'm more'n paid already, and I feel
                  ter believe that ther Swallow am."
               Her eyes expressed what her lips failed to utter. The softer sex of her nation are
                  proverbially silent when men are talking. Besides, she had reason to be reticent,
                  for she had shown more of her heart in her actions than she would willingly have
                  known.
               "Still, I would not have you think me ungrateful," answered Moncrief.
               "You saved ther life of the chief, and that pays ther Swaller," continued the
                  trapper, taking a very matter of fact view of the case. "But she am entitled ter
                  yer thanks jest as much as I am, and I hain't mean enuff ter try and cheat her out
                  of it. As fer myself, I don't want any more said erbout it," and as if to cut off
                  any farther mentioning of the subject he asked again:—"So yer saw ther Injin, did
                  yer?"
               "Yes, but it was a flying glance. You may be certain that he did not wait long for
                  inspection."
               "No, that hain't ther natur of ther beast. I wish I could have clapped my two eyes
                  on him, that's all. What sort of er lookin' reptile whar he, onyhow?"
               "Tall and young, I should say, and that is about all the description I can give of
                  him."
               "Whar he painted?"
               "Now that you speak of it I remember that his face was black."
               "That meant death!"
               "And the symbol came very near proving true. To my latest day I shall never think
                  of this one without a shudder."
               "And well yer may. Could yer tell ther Injin again if yer whar ter see him?"
               "There is not the slightest probability of it. I should as soon think of picking
                  out from a drove the deer I had shot at."
               The trapper was nonplussed. He had hoped to obtain sufficient information to guide
                  him in a search through the tribe, but totally failed. Like a baffled hound he
                  hung down his head and reflected for a few moments. Then he raised it again with a
                  clearer light in his eyes and a less troubled expression upon his face.
               "Swallow," he said, "jest look eround sharp and see ef yer kin find ther shaft of
                  ther arrer, will yer, that's er good gal. I whar an old fool or I wouldn't have
                  thrown it erway. Ther head am here somewhar. I'll search fer it while yer hunt fer
                  the other thing."
               For a time both were unsuccessful, but at length the girl returned and laid the
                  wished for article in his hands. He examined it with the utmost care, joined it to
                  the flint head he, also, had found, and then handed it to the Swallow. Evidently
                  there was nothing that would enable either of them to fix the guilt upon any
                  particular person.
               "It's many er long day," he said, "since I've seen one of these ar devilish
                  things."
               "Then they are not common among the Indians?" asked Moncrief.
               "Not ermong ther Ojibwas—leastwise not at ther present time. When I whar a good
                  deal younger, and used ter be out ermong other tribes I saw them, but not lately.
                  I must show it ter ther chief and see what he thinks of it. Thar whar ther Snakes
                  had been. Yer don't know that ther name of each tribe means something, as
                  Camanche, Snake, Pawnees, Wolves, and so on?"
               
               "I was not aware of it. You think the chief can tell us something about the
                  arrow?"
               "He can tell in er minuit whose make it am."
               "Then let us go to him at once."
               With flashing eyes Ah-ne-mee-kee heard the story of what had transpired. He raised
                  himself upon one arm so as to look Moncrief fully in the face, and questioned him
                  closely as to the appearance of the Indian who had shot him.
               "Thar's no use in yer axing sich questions," interrupted the trapper. "I've bin
                  erpon the same trail before, and couldn't find out anything. What we want ter know
                  is who made ther arrer? Kin yer tell us that?"
               "Sioux—Cut Throats!" was the instant response.
               "I thought so myself, though I didn't say it. How do yer know that yer right,
                  chief?"
               "The stone of which the head is made grows not within many miles of the great
                  lake, or where the timber is thick. It is found only upon the broad prairies,
                  beyond the big river Mich-is-i-pic."
               "Ther Mississippi? Yes, I know ther spot."
               "And none of the tribes that dwell there dare set their foot upon the hunting
                  grounds of the Ojibwas."
               "Then some rascal of yer own people has bin play in' false. But whar could he have
                  got ther arrer?"
               If the chief knew, he did not see fit to inform his questioner. Whatever there was
                  working within his subtle brain would be kept from all eyes. So the Beaver
                  continued:—
               "What could he have had ergin the boy? That's more'n I kin tell."
               He was not alone in either his opinion or want of understanding. That one who was
                  a total stranger could have enemies among the Indians, was almost past belief, and
                  it was a matter of deep thought to all until other excitements drove it for a time
                  from their mind.
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               THE ABODE OF THE WITCH-WOMAN. NEGOTIATIONS.
               THE skulking Indian Shoon-ka-ska, after he had so narrowly escaped from the bullet
                  of the old trapper, was not long in hiding in the woods, and binding up his slight
                  wound. That done, he sought his canoe and left the island, while there was enough
                  of darkness to hide him from observation.
               He was fully resolved to revenge himself both upon the Beaver and Moncrief; the
                  one for the shedding of his blood, and the other for having come (as he believed)
                  between him and the girl he had destined to be his wife. But how he should put
                  them out of the way without being suspected, was a matter that required thought.
                  He knew that the trapper was universally beloved by the tribe, and was satisfied
                  that the younger man would be as soon as it became known that he had saved the
                  life of Ah-ne-mee-kee. If he shot them at all, it must be from an ambush, and it
                  would not do to use the weapons he had with him. The heads of his arrows, like all
                  others of his brethren, had a peculiar mark upon them so that the hunter could
                  readily distinguish who struck down the game, where many had made it a mark at the
                  same time. To find some other means was consequently his first object, and as he
                  floated by the grave yard where he had met the witch woman, his thoughts naturally
                  turn-to her.
               The light of the rising sun showed him every part of the habitation of the dead,
                  and he soon satisfied himself that she was not there; that is, he was convinced as
                  far as eyesight was concerned, for nothing would have tempted him to have wandered
                  around among the fleshless skeletons and mouldering dust, seeking for her. Of any
                  other haunts she might have he knew nothing, and so turned towards the village.
                  But would it do for him to take his canoe there? It might be noticed that he had
                  been absent, or he might wish to depart again without being observed; and landing
                  at a point some distance away he drew up the light bark upon the rocky shore,
                  carried it into the dense undergrowth dergrowth and hid it from all but the most
                  careful search.
               From that spot to where the smoke of the wigwams rose curling like azure serpents
                  far up into the clear air, the trail was a difficult one, and but rarely used. A
                  hurricane sweeping through it many years before, had prostrated the trees for a
                  mile in width, and their trunks lay woven together, covered with a dense second
                  growth. Still the adventurous hunter could thread the labyrinth, and care and time
                  would surmount every obstacle. There was an open path, it is true, along the shore
                  of the lake, but that was exposed to observation and but little likely to be taken
                  by any one desiring concealment. Without a moment's hesitation, therefore, the
                  White Dog struck into the wilderness of verdure and crept as best he might amid
                  the mossy trunks, the splintered branches, the gnarled roots and almost
                  impenetrable forest of young shoots.
               But it was a wearisome task, and very glad was he to reach an open space, where
                  the rocks were bare, and sit himself down to rest. Almost without his knowledge he
                  had been ascending, and from the point where he loitered he could see for many
                  miles around. Before him, dotted along the shore with islands, the blue lake
                  stretched away, until sky and water appeared to meet. Behind him the mountains
                  rose dark and frowning. On his right was a gloomy range of forests, and on his
                  left the bay and the cluster of wigwams. As a point for a look-out it was
                  unequalled; as a hiding place few, if any better, could be found. Originally it
                  might have been one monster rock, rearing its head above all surroundings; now, by
                  some convulsion of nature, it lay scattered in huge masses around, with dangerous
                  paths between.
               This much the Indian noticed, as he sat there breathing after his unwonted labor.
                  Then a slight rustling disturbed him, and turning his head suddenly he saw the
                  witch woman of the grave yard, standing beside him!
               "Ioss-a-keed!" (Conjuror) he exclaimed, starting up in
                  astonishment, and looking for some path of escape.
               "I knew you would come," she replied, without any notice of either his alarm or
                  anything but complimentary manner of address. "I knew you would come, and have
                  been waiting for you."
               "I did not know that you were here. I was—"
               "You was seeking me."
               "How can you know that?"
               "How did I know that a pale face was sitting by the side of the Swallow and that
                  there was blood upon the trail? Did I not tell you so, and was not it the
                  truth?"
               "Yes, yes, but—"
               "Come with me."
               "Where?"
               "It is not far. Those who would talk of revenge, must do so beyond the reach of
                  human ears."
               "Revenge!"
               She had penetrated his very thoughts again—told that he was seeking her, and the
                  object of his coming. If she could thus read what was passing within him, surely
                  she also had power to compel him to obey her.
               "Do you not hear?" she asked, screaming until the very rocks rang around. "Do you
                  hear? I tell you to come with me, and you must. Does the snake gender its poison,
                  or the wolf suckle its cubs in the bright sunshine? Does the toad breed its venom,
                  or the spider its spite, except amid the black darkness? Come!" and she waved her
                  skinny hands in a threatening manner.
               "Go on," he replied, not daring to disobey.
               Without looking back, she led the way through one of the most dismal, and
                  apparently dangerous paths, for a short distance, and then, stopping suddenly she
                  withdrew a handful of bushes from an opening in the rocks.
               "Enter," she commanded, pointing to what well might have been the portal of a
                  tomb.
               She saw that he hesitated—saw that he was becoming as deeply impressed by fear as
                  she wished him to be, and after a wild, fierce laugh, herself led the way.
                  Undecided how to act—whether to follow or flee— he remained motionless, until a bright light within
                  showed him a clean path. Then he choked down his fears and entered.
               Wild as were the outside surroundings, there was nothing within to alarm him. It
                  was simply a cave in the rocks, the counterpart of which might have been found in
                  almost any locality. Not a great, rambling cavern, but so low and small that every
                  part could be distinctly seen, without leaving any nooks or corners in the shadow
                  to awake suspicion. Hanging upon pegs driven into the seams were bunches of dry
                  herbs, a few skins, and articles familiar in every wigwam. In vain he looked for
                  dead men's bones or any other of the loathsome objects with which fancy has
                  embellished the resorts of those who deal in mystery. Had he met her for the first
                  time and been taken thither, he would have thought her a simple-minded, or
                  demented woman—one harmless and to be pitied rather than feared. But now suspicion
                  was awake, and his mind was continually on the alert against surprise.
               "You found them," she said, after he had taken a seat to which she had cunningly
                  pointed, so that the light would flash upon, and reveal the workings of his face,
                  while her own was in the shadow, "You found them as I said."
               "Yes. The pale face stealing away the heart of the Swallow and her father
                  wounded."
               "And you longed for revenge, but dared not strike the blow."
               "Even so, though I received one."
               "So!" It was news to her, but she craftily took advantage of it, and jumped at a
                  conclusion which proved to be the true one. "So! The bullet of the pale face came
                  near the life of Shoon-ka-ska."
               "It was from the rifle of him we call the Beaver."
               "I knew it. The owl whispered it to me. You would be revenged. Let my son speak.
                  My ears are open."
               Without reflecting that he was telling her the very things she pretended to know
                  long before they had happened, the Indian related all that had transpired on the
                  island. Very much he dwelt upon the conversation he had heard in the wigwam—of his
                  cunning in crawling so near and retreating again, but his brow grew the darkest
                  when he pointed to the mark of the Beaver's bullet through his hunting shirt and
                  blanket.
               "The White Dog had his bow and arrows," she replied, when she had learned all that
                  was possible.
               "But I dared not use them. They were all hunting arrows."
               "And might have told of the hand that shot them? My son looks far ahead. He will
                  yet be among the wise men of the nation. Had he come to me I would have given him
                  such a skin as I wear."
               "I did not need it."
               "Still you were seeking me and wished no one to know that you were here."
               "I had no thought of finding you in such a spot as this."
               "Why then did you hide your canoe?"
               "That no one could tell which way I was travelling."
               "And you thought that I had arrows that would not be known?"
               "Have you?" he asked with his face lighting up at the prospect of securing weapons
                  that he could use without the fear of discovery.
               "I have one arrow."
               "Only one?"
               "That is enough if the hand that draws the bow is firm, and the eye true."
               "It may not reach the heart."
               "If it but touches the skin it will bring festering corruption to the blood. It is
                  poisoned!"
               "Poisoned!"
               "Yes. I may not tell where I got it from. For many moons I have kept the secret.
                  There is not another in all the wigwams of the Ojibwas. Would my son like it?"
               "Yes! Yes!"
               "And never tell where he got it from, no matter what torture he might be put
                  to."
               "Yes."
               "And if he failed to keep his word?"
               "May the Watcha Manitou keep his spirit from ever entering the happy hunting
                  grounds."
               "It is well, but he must bring many skins of the beaver and the otter to my
                  wigwam. He must give enough of the meat of the deer and the bear to keep me
                  through the long winter."
               "I will. Go to my lodge and take all you can find there, and I will bring you much
                  more."
               She was satisfied, and raising the flat stone upon which she was sitting, bade him
                  put down his hand and draw forth the coveted weapon. He bent forward to do so but
                  drew back with horror. The little cache was
                  filled with hissing serpents who sounded their rattles, raised their heads, and
                  darted forth their tongues spitefully. Far sooner would he have thrust his arm
                  into the fiercest flames. Indian though he was, the antipathy to the scaly
                  monsters of the woods was very strong within him.
               "They know you not," she said. "They are the guardian spirits of my hiding place,"
                  and without the slightest appearance of fear she toyed with the serpents as if
                  they had been the most pleasant playthings in the world.
               "For the love of the Manitou, don't!" he said. "They will sting you to death."
               "Not me. I am their master!"
               "See! They are twining around your arm."
               "They want to be kissed," and she lifted the largest and placed its head to her
                  lips.
               There was something so horrible in the action, that the Indian drew back
                  trembling. That a human being, and more especially a woman, can do such things, is
                  almost beyond the bounds of belief. But as if enjoying his alarm she continued her
                  horrible play for a time. Then she tossed it back, thrust the other
                  unceremoniously aside, raised a second stone, and from among a mass of other
                  articles drew forth the fatal weapon, carefully enveloped in bark.
               She knew that the snakes were as harmless as worms, for with her own hands she had
                  removed the poisoned teeth.
               "There!" she said triumphantly. "There is the arrow. I have revealed to you the
                  secret of my hiding place, but woe to you or any one that attempts to enter it. A
                  thousand deaths are concealed within."
               "Give me the arrow and let me be going."
               He had no wish to remain in such close proximity to a den of rattlesnakes, even
                  though there was a stone between him and them.
               "Never remove the covering from it until the instant of use. You might be
                  forgetful or careless, and kill yourself."
               "I will remember."
               "Then leave me alone. I have charms to prepare that no one must see."
               "Where will I find you, if I should wish to see you again?"
               "Tell me from which quarter the wind will blow to-morrow, and I might answer."
               "Will I find you at the encampment?"
               "Who can tell? Where the spirits call me there I am. Go!"
               He had secured a far more effectual weapon than he had had any idea of, and was in
                  haste to try its power. Still he would not have dared to stir until she gave him
                  liberty so to do. Now he bounded from the cavern, glad to be again away from its
                  noisome damps and foul air.
               "Yes, go," she repeated to herself. "Fool! fool!" and following him out into the
                  sunshine, she sought a spot where she could, herself unseen, watch his departure
                  from the shore.
               But she was destined to have her patience sorely tried. Until the evening he
                  remained hidden in the woods. Then he leaped into his canoe and paddled swiftly
                  away. It was his intention to have stricken down the old trapper, and he had
                  crawled very near the little wigwam for that purpose, when Moncrief came in sight,
                  and he could not control himself. His arrow had been true to its aim, but failed
                  in producing the death he had anticipated. Of this, however, he knew not. The
                  shaft dispatched, he fled to the most dense thicket he could find, and waited for
                  an opportunity to send the Beaver following his companion upon the dark journey
                  every man has to perform, and from which there is no returning.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IX.
               SHADOWS ON THE PATH OF LOVE.
               THE recovery of Ah-ne-mee-kee was very slow. Such frames, although they may
                  possess vast recuperative power and resist successfully for years the inroads of
                  disease, are shaken to the very centre when it has fastened upon them. Though far
                  from being fit to endure fatigue, he would have started home had not Moncrief told
                  of the fatal consequences that might ensue, and the Swallow pleaded with all the
                  earnestness of a daughter's love for delay.
               This view, also, of the matter was taken by the old trapper, though more for the
                  sake of his young companion than any particular regard for the Indian. Not that he
                  loved "Rome less, but Cæsarmore." Very much, however, he chafed under the want of
                  something to do. To remain idle for any length of time was not according to his
                  nature. Fight as he would against this feeling it grew upon and at length mastered
                  him, and having determined to let Moncrief and the Swallow "paddle their own
                  canoe" a very wise proceeding as he could not help it, daily absented himself from
                  the camp to return again in the evening loaded with game or fish.
               There was something of this feeling, too, in the heart of the chief. The wise
                  restraint that Moncrief had imposed upon him both as regarded exercise and food,
                  accorded but illy with his usual habits of life. For though the Indian will endure
                  hunger for a long time, yet gluttony is a part of his nature, and never restrained
                  except for the want of means to satisfy it. To this was added the constant
                  recurrence of the great fear of his life; but the circumstances under which they
                  had met and the time they had enjoyed each other's society without interruption,
                  rendered it very difficult to separate Moncrief from his daughter. He was
                  satisfied that he owed his life to him, as well as that he had been the means of
                  his injury, though why or how he had never ascertained. But the treatment he had
                  received had in a great measure dispelled the feelings of revenge he had at first
                  entertained, and try as he would (especially after the endorsement of his
                  life-time friend, the Beaver) he could find nothing against him except that his
                  skin was white. Still he was determined to invent some excuse for their
                  separation. To that end he strolled from the wigwam one evening, to where the
                  trapper was dressing some game, and lighting his pipe, took a seat near.
               "The Beaver," he said, opening the conversation by well-directed flattery, "is a
                  great hunter. The swift winged duck and the quick rabbit fly in vain from before
                  his fire weapon."
               "Wal, it hain't er bad day's work," replied the gratified old man, "considerin'
                  how scarce ther game am in these parts. Howsomever, Thunder, many's ther time we
                  have travelled tergether and not got half as much."
               "My brother speaks ther truth."
               "I allers try to do that ar thing."
               "Has he ever used the fire weapon of the young Medercine?"
               "No, never."
               "Can it kill from afar?"
               "I haint never tried it, as I told yer."
               The subject was a dangerous one to talk about, and the old man wished to avoid it
                  altogether, especially with the one who was now questioning him.
               "He has seen it shot?"
               "I—I—disremember."
               "Is the bullet like that of the Beaver?"
               "Ahem!"
               "It is not round, but shaped like an acorn?"
               "How kin yer posserbly know that?"
               "The Beaver and Ah-ne-mee-kee have ever travelled the strait trail together. Let
                  not their tongues become crooked now."
               "What do you mean by that ar?"
               "The weapon of the young Medicine came very near sending the red man to the spirit
                  land."
               "You must be er dreamin'."
               "While the pale faces were gathering poles and bark for the wigwam, the Swaller
                  brought the fire weapons from their canoe. The bullet fitted the little one!"
               "Wal," replied the trapper with a forced laugh. "I thought I whar smart, but you
                  whar too much for me, so I mought jest as well own up. I'll tell yer all about it,
                  Thunder," and he proceeded to do so, taking the entire blame upon himself.
               "My brother thinks," answered the chief when he had concluded, "that there is
                  blood to be shed between the young pale face and the red man. It is not so. There
                  is nothing growing upon the trail between them. It is open for either to
                  travel."
               "May ther good Lord be thanked for that. I whar fearful that you would be er
                  feelin' like revenge. Will yer gin me yer hand that yer wont try to harm him?"
               "Is Ah-ne-mee-kee a dog?" was the proud reply. "Is he a serpent that he should
                  sting the one that had saved his life?"
               "No, no! I know that yer jest as true as steel, chief, and shall sleep contented
                  arter what yer've said."
               "Does my brother remember the sister of the Swallow?" asked the Indian, suddenly
                  changing the subject.
               "Ter be sure I do jest as well as ef I had seen her yesterday, but what brought
                  her ter yer mind now?"
               The answer was the pointing of a finger to the wigwam in which the Indian girl and
                  Moncrief could be plainly seen sitting side by side.
               "I know what's in yer thoughts now," continued the trapper, "and I don't blame yer
                  for it nuther. This man haint ertall like the tother, and yet it would have bin
                  mighty well ef they had never met."
               "They must part!" was the stern answer.
               "I've bin er thinking erbout that same thing, and whar only er waitin' fer either
                  you or him ter git well enuff."
               "Ah-ne-mee-kee leaves to-morrow."
               "I dont rightly see how yer kin git erway. Yer haint well, and I'll tell yer how
                  we kin fix it. But come inter ther wigwam out of the night air. There goes ther
                  young folks fer er walk, and we'll have it all erlone ter ourselves."
               When they were seated again, had filled and lighted their pipes, and satisfied
                  themselves that they were safe from being overheard, the trapper resumed:—
               "I'll tell yer what we'll do, Thunder. Ter-morrow I'll git Pitt ter go with me
                  lookin' arter copper; that's what we come fer, yer know; and manage ter keep bim
                  out ontil arter dark. In ther mean time yer kin slip erway, and he'll be none ther
                  wiser."
               "My brother speaks well."
               "I haint got nothin' ter say ergin yer darter, fer I think more of her than any
                  gal I ever saw, but I dont want her ter git mixed up too strong with Pitt. I dont
                  think that ther good Lord ever intended sich ones ter marry, fer he made as hard a
                  mark between them as he did between ther sheep and ther deer."
               "She shall never marry a pale face."
               "Jest stick ter that and yer'll be all right."
               "Far better that she died by the hand of her father, Beaver," and the chief spoke
                  with the terrible earnestness that showed the stern resolve of his iron will.
                  "Beaver, before she shall love any one whose skin is like the snow, this knife
                  shall pierce her heart."
               "Wal I don't know but that it would be better in ther end, and yet I'll advise yer
                  ter banish all sich thoughts from yer heart. They haint natural, and ar jest as
                  onchristian as kin be."
               The Indian had relieved his mind—had had his say, and henceforward his lips would
                  be closed upon the subject. It was a terrible resolution for a father to form, and
                  yet it relieved the honest trapper from all fears on account of his favorite.
                  Under ordinary circumstances the white man would have been the one to be murdered.
                  Now he was safe from vengeance. He might mourn for a loved one, suddenly torn from
                  him by death, but would never have it in his power to do that loved one wrong. Yet
                  it was a terrible resolution to be coolly formed and talked about, for not the
                  trembling of a nerve or the working of a muscle of the face betrayed the intense
                  emotion of the Chief. Outwardly he was calm, but within there was a fire raging
                  wild as that bursting from an outlet in the volcano's heart.
               And very different would have been the conversation of Moncrief and the Indian
                  girl if they could have had the slightest inkling of the Virginius-like
                  determination. Glad to escape from beneath the watchful eyes of the father and the trapper, they left the wigwam and
                  wandered along the shore. Warm and beautiful weather had followed the storm. It
                  was the "moon of flowers," according to the nomenclature of the red man—the month
                  of roses, or June, according to ours. The moon travelled through an unclouded sky,
                  and the stars shot their golden arrows undimmed to earth. The wind had sunk at the
                  going down of the sun, and the waves broke in the tiniest of ripples on the beach
                  of sparkling sand. From the woods came the faint perfume of the few flowers of
                  that far Northern latitude, commingled with the balsamic odors of the evergreens.
                  It was just such a night as lovers would have chosen for the utterance of vows
                  that would bind them until "the silver chord was loosed and the golden bowl
                  broken."
               "Swallow," said Moncrief, after they had got to a little distance from the wigwam,
                  "let us walk along the shore. It is very light and pleasant there. "The woods are
                  heavy with dew and—"
               He paused so suddenly, that the girl looked up in alarm, but instantly seeming to
                  read his thoughts, answered:—
               "You are thinking of the last time you were there?"
               "Yes, and how nearly fatal it was to me."
               "The pale face must thank the Manitou and the Beaver for life."
               "And you, Swallow?"
               "I obeyed the will of the Beaver."
               It was a very modest answer considering all that she had done. At least he thought
                  so, and continued more warmly:—
               "I shall never be able to repay you. Words are but a very poor recompense."
               "The Swallow wants nothing more."
               "Yet let me give you some token to remember me by."
               "Is the pale face going away?" she asked with a start that he could not fail to
                  notice, especially as she had laid her hand upon his arm and he could feel it
                  tremble.
               "I do not know—I am not certain. It may be that I shall be forced to do so for a
                  time, but it will not be long before I return again."
               "And the Swallow will be forgotten," she replied, withdrawing her hand and bowing
                  down her head.
               "Not so, by heaven! I shall never forget you. I could not do so, even if I tried.
                  But take this ring and wear it for my sake," and he withdrew one from his finger
                  and offered it to her.
               "The daughter of the red man cares not for the yellow earth of the pale face. She
                  needs nothing to keep him in memory."
               "But you must take it."
               "No! No! I should not dare to wear it even if I did. The people of my tribe would
                  say—"
               The thought of what would be charged against her, if seen with such a costly
                  jewel, made the hot blood well up from her heart in torrents, and crimson face and
                  neck so as to be plainly visible, even through the olive skin.
               "What would they say, Swallow?"
               "Don't ask me. The tongue cannot utter such thoughts. They would think bad."
               Though he did not closely comprehend her meaning, yet he ceased to press the
                  bauble upon her. He saw that she was very much disturbed by it, and that was
                  sufficient reason for his desisting.
               "As you will, Swallow; but tell me if you will be sorry when I am gone away?"
               She raised her head, and the long, curtaining lashes from her eyes, and looked him
                  fully in the face, and without a shadow of concealment, replied;—
               "I shall be very sorry."
               "Why?"
               "Because you have saved my father's life, and been very kind to me."
               Who could help but be kind to you, Swallow? I have seen many who called themselves
                  beautiful, in my own land, but never one who was as gloriously so as you.
               "Let us go home. My ears must be shut against such words."
               "No, rather let us sit down and talk. Here is a good resting place. I am not as
                  strong as I thought I was."
               It was his turn to blush now. Though he had not actually told a falsehood, he had
                  used subterfuge to accomplish his object, and he felt that it was unworthy of him.
                  The hint, however, was sufficient for her. To have urged him to walk farther after
                  he had complained of fatigue, would have been foreign to her nature, after what he
                  had suffered, therefore she took the place he had pointed out, and he one by her
                  side, upon a rock whose background was a tangled maze of spruce.
               "I was saying," he resumed, "that you were more beautiful than any one I ever
                  met."
               "Let us talk of the pale man's home."
               She was very anxious to change the subject, for at that instant the memory of all
                  her father had told her of the sad fate of her sister arose before her, and his
                  warnings and her solemn promises.
               "What makes you tremble so?" he asked. "Are you cold?" and he wrapped her in the
                  heavy shawl he carried in the place of a blanket.
               Both were natural questions, but how could she answer the first? Deny it though
                  she might, she had learned to love him madly, and to tell him what her father had
                  said—to rehearse to him her sister's wrongs would have been mal apropos at such a time. The second, however, gave
                  her a loop hole for escape and very gladly she availed herself of it.
               "The damp rises from the lake," she said, "let the pale face take back his
                  blanket. He has been very near the jaws of the Manitou of death."
               "No, I am sufficiently warm. You asked me about my home. It is very far away."
               "Are there any sisters there?"
               "Yes, one, but I was not thinking of her. From the very first time that I saw you,
                  Swallow, I have been comparing you with the girls I am acquainted with, and there
                  is no one that is—"
               "Look!" she said again laying her hand upon his arm so as to command immediate
                  attention. "Look! Do you not see the shadow of something crossing between us and
                  the moon?"
               "It is the reflection of a cloud."
               Apparently satisfied, the Indian girl made no farther reference to the matter,
                  though she continued watchful, while Moncrief, far more interested in the matter
                  about which he was talking than anything else, continued:—
               "I am not telling you an idle story, Swallow."
               "The daughters of the pale face are very beautiful," she replied, "with skin like
                  the snow, eyes blue as the summer skies, and hair like the silk of the maize in
                  the autumn time."
               "Yes, there are beauties among them, but as I have said, I have never seen one
                  that could compare with you."
               "Would the pale Medicine make a fool of the poor Indian girl?" she asked with the
                  soft light of her eyes rendered still more so by the fast gathering tears.
               "A fool of you, Swallow? What can you mean?"
               "The daughter of the red man knows that her skin is more brown than the chestnut
                  when the fingers of the frost spirit has opened the burrs and they come rattling
                  to the ground."
               "It is not so. You do yourself injustice. There are very many among my people
                  within whose veins there runs nothing but white blood—brunettes we call them—whose
                  skin is not so soft and fair as yours. But that is nothing to the purpose. The eye
                  of the true man looks deeper than the outward covering, no matter how attractive
                  that may be."
               "The pale Medicine has rested," she said rising. "Let us go back to the
                  wigwam."
               "Not yet, Swallow. Sit down," and he took her hand and gently drew her to a place
                  by his side. "Do not go yet. I have much to say to you."
               Instinctively she knew what was coming, and would have avoided hearing it if she
                  had been possessed of the power to do so. The mighty love that had grown up in her
                  heart was more potent in that hour than the memory of all her father's words, had
                  forced her to remain, and hear the words she shrank from. Had she known that they
                  would have made her future stagnant as Lethe and bitter as the waters of Marah,
                  she could not have torn herself away from the honeyed pleasures of the hour. Talk
                  as we may of paternal love, there comes a time when the slightest words from another's lips have more
                  potency than all their advice, warnings, and even prayers.
               "Swallow," continued Moncrief retaining the trembling fingers in his warm grasp,
                  "you must listen to me. From the moment that I first saw you I have been
                  attracted, and now that I have learned how truly good you are—I love you."
               "Not that! Oh! not that. Better that I should have seen you die from the poisoned
                  arrow than that you should have lived to utter such words," and she bowed her head
                  into her lap and veiled her face with her long, inky tresses.
               "Why? What do you mean?" he asked in amazement.
               "Because there has always been enmity between your race and mine."
               "There is not now."
               "Are you not taking away their hunting grounds? Are you not driving them far away
                  from the graves of their forefathers?"
               "No, we do not seek to harm them. Even the Beaver will tell you that."
               "The Great Spirit gave to them the forest for a home, to the pale face he gave
                  great cities."
               "And you shall go and see them when you are my wife, and—"
               "The Swallow can never be your wife," she replied, shuddering at the thought.
               "Why?"
               "The Manitou has forbidden it."
               "I do not understand you. I can see no reason why you should not be my wife,—that
                  is, if you love me. Tell me if all the affection of my heart is thrown away? Am I
                  mistaken in believing that you look upon me as you have never done upon man
                  before?"
               "I do love you. Oh! how much," she replied, nestling still closer to his side and
                  allowing him to twine his arm around her. "I do love you. The Great Spirit knows
                  it."
               "And yet you would refuse to be my wife?"
               "The sun has shone upon the path of the poor Indian girl, but henceforth all is
                  darkness—darkness."
               "You shall not thus wreck both of our lives. Tell me—I have a right to know—why
                  you refuse to be mine."
               "The father of the Swallow would not give her to one in whose heart flowed a
                  single drop of the blood of the Long Knives."
               "What can he have against them, against me especially?"
               "Let him ask of the Beaver."
               "No. One who has led such an isolated life from all of womanly sympathy, could
                  never understand a love like ours."
               "Then of my father."
               "You say that he is prejudiced. If so, he would not judge impartially. Let me hear
                  from you own lips the reason. If it must be as you say, far better that I should
                  go away without any one else knowing of what has passed between us. Swallow, you
                  must tell me the reason—I know it is a false one—why you will not be my wife."
               Thus urged, what was there left her to do! in a voice broken with emotion she told
                  the sad story of her sister's wrongs and early death. It required all the
                  self-command of Moncrief to hear her to the end, brief as was the narration.
               "By heaven!" he exclaimed. "By heaven! that shall not part us. Because there are
                  bad men among my race, is no reason why all should be so. Are there not
                  falsehearted ones among yours, Swallow?"
               "Oh! yes, many."
               "But all are not so?"
               "No."
               "Do you believe that I am like the base man you have been telling me about?"
               "I believe that you are as true as the Manitou."
               "And yet you would make yourself as well as me miserable? It is not just to
                  either."
               "But my father?"
               "If I can gain his consent?"
               "Would you take me to your home if I were your wife?"
               "That was one of the questions far more easily asked than answered. For the first
                  time Pitt Moncrief reflected upon the matter. He thought of a proud mother—proud
                  of her name and position in society—of his sister and his companions, and how they
                  would jeer at him if he should bring a squaw home for a wife. Strip off the tinsel
                  of her beauty and what would there be left? An uncultivated Indian girl who had
                  been born and brought up amid the most rude associations—without the slightest
                  knowledge of civilized life and one (no matter of how loving a heart) that would
                  constantly bring the blush of shame to his cheeks—shock his propriety and render
                  him miserable. Indeed, it was a home question that she asked. One that was to his
                  love like the frost to the flower. The rough diamond might be polished, but could
                  she ever?
               Still an answer was forced upon him. Her eyes were fixed upon his face—he could
                  almost feel their gaze. He realized that he could not speak false words without
                  her being aware of it, and yet he was forced from silence.
               "Would you be happy there?" he asked, in order to evade her question and to gain
                  time.
               "I do not know. My moccasins have never travelled any trail but that of the
                  forest."
               "Then I could live here with you."
               "You would soon tire of the ways of the red man. You know nothing of how different
                  they are from you—you have never lived among them—nothing of the hardships you
                  would have to endure when the long winter comes, the lake is covered with ice, and
                  the snow piled up around their wigwams like mountains."
               "You are mistaken, Swallow. I should be very happy—with you."
               "You think so now," and she shook her head mournfully, "when the bitter weather
                  came you would—"
               "Love you all the better."
               "The butterfly thinks so as it swims around in the golden sunshine when the
                  flowers are sweet and bright. When the frost comes—it dies."
               "Then we will be like the bees," he replied with a smile at her fanciful
                  comparison, "and lay up stores against the time of want. But seriously, I can see
                  no force in your argument. You say I will soon tire of wildwood life. I do not
                  think so, but should it be so, we can easily make some other arrangement."
               "Will the pale face dare to take me by the hand, lead me to his
                  mother's wigwam and say 'here is your daughter?'"
               That fear more than any other had taken possession of her. She appeared to have no
                  hesitancy in trusting her fate in his hands—no thought that he might prove false.
                  Had she believed—could she have been convinced that he would have been contented
                  to remain in the woods, or that she could share a home with him amid civilization,
                  she would cheerfully have given all the promises he asked. But it was not so. She
                  doubted not for herself, but him.
               "We will talk of that another time, Swallow. Let us allow no skeleton at the feast
                  now. This hour should be sacred to love alone."
               Well would it have been for their contentment, if such a thing could have
                  happened. But there can never be perfect love without confidence and trust.
               "The pale Medicine must answer," she continued, attempting to withdraw herself
                  from his embrace. "He cannot love the daughter of the red man, if he would be
                  ashamed to take her to the wigwam of his mother."
               "Ashamed?"
               "His tongue refused to utter the thoughts of his heart."
               "No, Swallow. I was not thinking of myself, but you. Would you be happy there? You
                  said you did not know, when I asked it before. Think how very different it would
                  be from your own home—how strange everything would be to you. But why must we talk
                  of these things now! We shall have plenty of time in the future."
               "I must know," she said firmly, but sadly.
               "Swallow, you do not love me, or you would trust me."
               It was cruel to break down the defences she had raised around her heart in this
                  manner, cruel to use the deep affection of her nature thus, and the sad look upon
                  her face, and the tearful eyes told more truly than the most verbose confessions,
                  how completely she was absorbed in him. And, true man and gentleman that he was,
                  he saw it, and hastened to correct the wrong into which his feelings had carried
                  him.
               
               "Forgive me, Swallow," he said folding her more closely to his bosom and kissing
                  her for the first time. "Forgive me, I did not think what I was saying. Not for
                  all my future hopes of happiness would I have brought tears into your eyes."
               "The words of the pale Medicine were like the poisoned arrow to the heart of the
                  Swallow," she replied, trying to still the emotions that were heaving her breast
                  like the waves of the ocean. "He knows how well I love him. But look!"
               "What do you see now?" he asked somewhat petulantly at thus having his love-making
                  constantly interrupted.
               "Hist!"
               She placed the fingers of one hand upon his lips to compel him to silence, while
                  with the other she pointed to where the shade of some object rested upon the open
                  space between them and the water.
               "It is some night bird flying over. Don't tremble so. What danger could possibly
                  come to us on this lone island?"
               "It is that of a man!" was the whispered response.
               "If so it must be the Beaver," and he called the old trapper, but without gaining
                  any reply.
               "Have you forgotten him who shot you?"
               "No. But he would not dare come again. However, I will go and see."
               "Not for your life!" and she clung to him in a manner that was the most positive
                  proof of her affection.
               "Why not?"
               "He might kill you this time, and then I—I should die!"
               Sweet words those for a lover to hear at any time, and especially so when there
                  was danger near. When the one we love becomes so entirely wrapped up in us, as to
                  be forgetful of self, we may safely trust that affection, through any changes that
                  can come. Sweet, too, was the task of reassuring her, and trying to prove that the
                  fears she entertained grew only out of her fervent passion, and had no foundation
                  in reality.
               "See, Swallow," he said, "the shadow does not move. It is nothing but a tree,
                  after all."
               "If it were the wind, it would toss the branches and it would be irregular."
               "You eyes are dimmed with tears, darling," and he bent over her and kissed them
                  away. "Now look again. You will see clearer."
               Both did so, but it was gone. An unbroken sheet of moonlight glittered between
                  them and the lake. He thought it a confirmation of his first opinion that it had
                  been caused by a cloud, but the fear in her heart grew stronger.
               "Let us go home," she urged.
               "What, fearful still? Do you not see that the frightful object has disappeared?
                  Wait a little while. When another cloud passes between us and the moon, you will
                  be satisfied."
               "No, no! Let us go now."
               "Are you anxious to separate from me? To go again to the wigwam where we cannot
                  talk unheard? Ah! Swallow, if you feel as I do, the great happiness of this hour,
                  you would not be thus anxious to go."
               "I feel—I know all but—"
               "But still will let the shadow of a tree or cloud come between us and our
                  love."
               "My father, the Beaver, will wonder at our stay."
               "No danger of that. They are fighting their old battles over their pipes, and
                  oblivious to all of earth."
               "But you have been very sick. For my sake, you will not remain," and
                  she looked imploringly into his face.
               If he could resist that after what had just passed between them, he would have
                  been as cold as ice, and far from worthy of the love she had lavished upon
                  him.
               "I would—will do anything for you, Swallow. For your sake I will go
                  in. Tell me however, one thing. Shall I go at once to your father, talk to him of
                  our love, and ask him to give me your hand, as you have done your heart?
               "No, not yet."
               "And why not?"
               "I have told you of my sister, and how very bitter he is towards all of your race
                  that even dare to look upon me. Wait until he knows you better. The feelings of a
                  heart like his are as the roots of the oak, not easily torn away."
               "Perhaps you are right. Promise me one thing, and then we will go to the
                  wigwam."
               "What more could I say? I have given you my hand and heart and could not take them
                  back, if I would. If you prove as true to the daughter of the red man as she will
                  to you, not a single shadow will ever cross your path."
               "True; I would to heaven there was some power stronger than words to convince you
                  of it. But why speak of shadows again."
               "Because there is one falling upon the very path we are going. May the Great
                  Spirit preserve us from its being an omen of our future."
               He looked and saw that her words were true. Looked at the sky and failed to find a
                  single cloud between them and the moon. The silver light was pouring down with
                  unbroken lustre. He looked at the woods. There was not a tree that could possibly
                  cause such a gloom. But if neither cloud or tree, what could it be?
               "Let us stand still for a moment, and see what shape it takes."
               "It is a man—an Indian!" was all she could murmur, with hushed breath.
               "Then let him beware!"
               "Let us fly."
               "No. It has gone again. Kiss me darling. Nothing shall ever come between us and
                  our love. Now—one kiss more—we will go."
               "Come into the woods, then. We are in plain sight here, and could be shot down as
                  easily as wolves in a trap."
               It was a wise thought—one purely Indian in its conception, and he saw that it was
                  the best thing that could be done. Still, it was a cowardly action—one repugnant
                  to his manhood, and had it not been for the loving girl, he would have
                  investigated the cause of her alarm, and braved his fate, whatever it might have
                  been.
               Cautiously they moved along, keeping within the shade of the bushes until they
                  reached an opening. That gained, hope rose in their hearts.
               "We are safe," whispered the Swallow.
               "Yes, thank Heaven! Oh, horror!"
               An Indian, armed to the teeth and grotesquely painted, had risen directly before
                  them. With screams for help, the Swallow threw herself before her lover, to save
                  him from harm, offering her heart as a shield against the knife, hatchet or
                  arrow.
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               ADVICE. SEARCH. THE WAIF'S FRIENDSHIP.
               THE continued absence of the chief and his daughter could not but be talked of
                  among the tribe at the village of Michipicoten. Various were the conjectures, and
                  as is usual at such times, all were very far from the truth. But more than all the
                  rest, the wife and mother was troubled. The husband and child were all that were
                  left for her to love in her old age. She had given her heart to the chief many
                  years before, and though their record was one of hardships and suffering, they had
                  not crushed out affection. And her daughter, the one lamb left her, she worshipped
                  far above all earthly things—worshipped more perhaps, than even she did her
                  God.
               Day by day her anxiety grew more intense. She wandered restlessly about unfit for
                  any occupation, and vainly trying to find the peace that fled from her. At first
                  her fears were scoffed at. What danger could possibly come to one who had ever
                  been familiar with the management of a canoe—who knew the water and the wind in
                  their every phase—to whom every foot of both the main land and islands had been as
                  a play ground? There were no enemies around—all was peace with them and their
                  former enemies, the Sioux, and from the white man they had no fear.
               But vainly they argued with the poor, old squaw. Her heart mourned for the lost
                  ones, and, like Rachel, she would not be comforted. For a time she searched alone,
                  but at length others became interested. Very soon, however, they became tired, and
                  said they must have perished in the late storm, and relaxed into their usual indolence. At this
                  juncture, and when she had prepared to put on the weeds of childless widowhood,
                  Shoon-ka-ska made his appearance again in the village. As if by accident, almost
                  his first stopping place was at the wigwam of the absent chief.
               "What is the matter with you?" he asked as he saw the mother of the Swallow seated
                  with her blanket drawn over her head.
               "The chief, my daughter, are both dead," she replied, ceasing for a moment the
                  ever repeated cry of "wahono'win! wahono'win."
               "Dead? How do you know?"
               "We have searched for them in vain. Where have you been that you have not heard of
                  these things?"
               "Piloting the pale face to the mouth of the Kamanisbique."
               She looked at him sharply from under her grey lashes, and seemed to doubt his
                  word. But the story was plausible enough then, although a year before she would
                  have known that it was a falsehood. He gave her no time, however, for reflection,
                  but continued:—
               "How long has Ah-ne-mee-kee and the Swallow been gone?"
               "The sun has risen and gone down many times since she saw them last."
               "Where have you looked for them?"
               "All along the shore."
               "And found nothing?"
               "Not a broken paddle or a piece of the canoe."
               He called her within the wigwam, carefully drew the skin curtains, furnished her
                  with tobacco, and continued in low whispers:—
               "Shoon-ka-ska loved the daughter of Ah-ne-mee-kee. If she has gone to the spirit
                  land his heart will be covered with ashes."
               "Is it so. Then he will seek for her?"
               "As the bear for the trees where the honey is hidden."
               "Does he know which way the chief travelled?"
               "How should he? He was many miles away."
               "Where will he look?"
               "If the shore has been searched, he will turn to the islands."
               "Why should they have gone there?"
               "Who can tell. They might have been looking for the yellow rocks the pale face
                  loves, or the storm might have thrown them ashore."
               "When will the White Dog go?"
               "This day. And if he finds the Swallow?"
               "She shall be his wife."
               "What if she has given her heart to another?"
               "She dare not disobey my commands."
               "But should she refuse?"
               "I will make her."
               "And if a pale face has been singing sweet music in her ears?"
               "I would strangle him with my own hands!"
               Her actions and voice told that she was terribly in earnest. Without the strength
                  of will to control her passion that was possessed by her husband, her anger
                  against those of white blood was allowed to run riot—unchecked. True she might
                  fail in her purpose of revenge, for when such 
                     
                        "Anger rushes unrestrained to action,
                        Like a hot steed it stumbles in its way'.'
                     
                   but yet no kindness could change it. "The man of thought strikes deepest and
                  strikes safest," but his clear judgment will, also, admit of conviction. Not so
                  she. She would never forget and never forgive. Of this the cunning Indian was
                  satisfied, and determined to bind her to him by every means in his power, and thus
                  have a friend near the throne as powerful as him that sat upon it.
               "Shoon-ka-ska would be a kind husband to the Swallow," he resumed after the hand
                  of the squaw had been unclenched and the fire in her eyes somewhat died out. "He
                  has loved her since they played together when little papooses. His wigwam is ever
                  filled with game, and—"
               "Yes—yes," she replied impatiently, "but the pale face? What makes him think that
                  a pale face has been whispering in her ears like the black snake in that of a
                  bird?"
               "He heard them talking about her—how beautiful she was, and—"
               "Let them come here if they dare! But she is gone—gone!"
               In the moment of her anger she had forgotten her loss, and now it returned to her
                  with double force.
               "We will see if that is so. But if I find her you will not forget your promise to
                  give her to me as a wife?"
               "No. I swear it by the great Spirit."
               "It is enough. Let her prepare for the journey. Soon the canoe will be ready."
               Thus far the object of his return had been fully accomplished. With the mother
                  upon his side it would go hard if he could not succeed, and with a gratified air
                  he walked to his own wigwam to see how it had fared during his absence.
               He found the rude habitation standing—the poles and bark covering remaining, but
                  that was all. Every other thing had been carried away. Not a single particle of
                  food, blanket or skin remained. Even the medal he had received from the "Great
                  Father at Washington," and which was worth more than all his other possessions,
                  was gone. Robbed was he to the very last extremity, and trembling with anger he
                  was about to rush out and proclaim the outrage, when the bark covering was drawn
                  aside and the witch-woman stood before him.
               "My son promised me food. I am hungry. He was to give furs. I have come after
                  them," she said as quietly as if she felt that her errand was the most welcome one
                  in the world.
               "Promised you!"
               Her words were adding insult to injury, and he could hardly keep from rushing upon
                  her and striking her dead at his feet. There were no wild surroundings—no bones of
                  the dead—no subterranean abode or shadows of night to intimidate him now. Like Rob
                  Roy when far from the dismal walls of the Talbooth, he could have exclaimed, "My
                  foot is upon my native heath and my name is McGregor!" At the instant her life
                  trembled in the balance, but second thought convinced him that murder would not do
                  in the midst of the encampment—neither would it restore his lost treasures. At
                  another time and in another place, he could be fully revenged, and so choking down
                  his wrath he continued:—
               "Yes, mother, I promised them to you, but you must be satisfied with what you have
                  taken, until I go hunting again."
               "How long am I to wait? Not until you win your love. I would starve."
               "To-day I must go with the mother of the Swallow, to find her. But it will be a
                  long search. I do not know where she is," he continued with a sly leer.
               "And she will be your wife."
               "Who told you so?"
               "Do I not know everything? You must be quick or you will not find her. Two suns
                  will not rise before she is here."
               "Have you been to the island?"
               "The Spirits told me, as they did that your arrow failed to accomplish its
                  work."
               "Failed! I saw the pale face reel beneath the blow. Failed! You said there was an
                  hundred deaths upon its point."
               "So there was, but he still lives."
               "Then,"—he was about to say "all that you have taken and all that I have promised
                  has been in vain," but her sharp eyes were upon him, baneful in their influence,
                  and he could not entirely shake off his fear, and continued:—"Then other means
                  must be tried."
               "The knife is silent in its work."
               "Yes. How came he to live? I know that I hit him. I saw the poisoned arrow
                  sticking in his side."
               "Had he been alone, the carrion buzzards would have been fattening upon his
                  bloated corpse. But he was not alone."
               "The Beaver?"
               "He knows every secret of the woods as well as I or the Great Medicine. Had my son
                  been cunning, he would have watched and seen that he never returned with the herbs
                  that render the poison of the rattlesnake harmless."
               "His time will come!"
               "What does my son intend to do after he has taken the mother to the daughter?"
               "I shall bring them back here."
               "And the pale face and the Beaver?"
               "They will go away searching for copper."
               "But if they do not?"
               "I do not know."
               "Is my son certain that the young man loves the Swallow?"
               "Yes."
               For a time the old woman sat as if lost in thought. Then she crept to the door of
                  the wigwam, and having satisfied herself that there was no one in hearing, returned to his side
                  and whispered in his ear:—
               "If my son will keep his promises I will tell him."
               "I will."
               "He must make friends with the pale face, and lure him far away to search for the
                  yellow rock, or upon the hunting trail."
               "What for?"
               "Is he blind as the mole? He can easily lose him in the forest, or tempt him into
                  one of the caves of the mountains, and shutting the door leave him to die."
               If ever man had a devilish prompter, the White Dog had in the pretended Witch
                  woman. Not that she cared about him, but she hated the pale faces, and more than
                  all saw a way of making the Indian her slave, and forcing him in the future to
                  supply the wants she had heretofore struggled against.
               "It is good," was the reply. "Now I must go."
               "I shall watch for your coming, my son."
               Well, indeed, she would have done so, if she had known the thoughts that were busy
                  in his brain. He would watch for her too, but it would be to clear her from his
                  path, and to free himself forever from her power. Yes, he would watch for a
                  fitting opportunity to murder her!
               A brief walk around the village to learn what was the general opinion with regard
                  to the absence of Ah-ne-mee-kee and his daughter, and he summoned the mother and
                  pushed his canoe from the shore, taking the direction of the islands. More than
                  one was looked over in vain. He was too crafty to go directly to the spot where he
                  knew he would find them. The old squaw would have seen in an instant through such
                  a proceeding, and his object was to impress her with the importance of his
                  services. All the afternoon, therefore, he consumed in paddling from shore to
                  shore, but when night came, he, as if by accident, discovered a light at a little
                  distance, and turning thither soon led her to where her husband and the Beaver
                  were deeply engaged in conversation—plotting how to separate the lovers, as if
                  there it was not true that 
                     
                        "Love will find its way
                        Through paths where wolves would fear to prey."
                     
                  
               
               Very few were the words spoken between the chief and his wife, for though the
                  Indian will unbend from his haughty demeanor when in the seclusion of his own
                  wigwam, he never shows the slightest affection before the eyes of others.*
                   Then he fondles his children and bends to the sway of his wife. There he
                   is the tender husband and loving father.
               
                  
                  *This point is often disputed. But the evidence of Mrs. Schoolcraft, herself
                     the daughter of a full blooded Chippewa woman, with the unpronouncable name
                     of "Oshanguscodaywaygua," and granddaughter of the famous chief
                     "Wa-ba-jick," is perfectly satisfactory in the matter.
               
               The first brief welcome and explanation over, she took her place near the chief
                  and attended to the filling of his pipe, as if they had not been separated. But if
                  her tongue was at rest, her eyes were not. She looked around in vain for her
                  child, and the pale face of whom her conductor had spoken. But there was no one
                  there but the Beaver, and it could not be him. So, too, was it with the White Dog.
                  The etiquette of Indian life would not permit him to wander away in search of her.
                  He must either wait her return, or be directed to go after her, though his blood
                  was boiling with the thought that she might be even listening to the love vows of
                  his rival, submitting to his embrace, and giving back warm kiss for kiss. As if a
                  millstone had been lifted from off his heart, these were the words of the
                  trapper:—
               "White Dog, surpose yer go and look arter the Swaller and Pitt. They've bin er
                  wandering round er long time, and had oughter be home. Ther night air is gittin'
                  ter be mighty cold. I kin feel it myself, old and tough and well as I am."
               "Shoon-ka-ska is not a dog that he should follow in the steps of a squaw," was the
                  proud reply. Impatient as he was to go, he knew that he had a cunning part to
                  play, and that it was requisite to keep up his dignity as a brave.
               "Wall, yer needn't git mad erbout it. Thar whar no harm in axin yer, as I knowed
                  on. I kin go myself."
               "Shoon-ka-ska will go," commanded the chief.
               That was sufficient, and he walked swiftly away until out of sight of the wigwam.
                  Then his motions became as subtle as the ox. Dropping to the ground, he wound his
                  way along, until their voices gave him some idea of their locality. But he could
                  not see them and was forced to rise. Thus it was that his shadow was seen—thus it
                  was that it disappeared as he dropped again and crawled within hearing
                  distance.
               At length he obtained a position where he could both see and hear, and all the
                  passions in his savage heart boiled for revenge, as he witnessed their
                  endearments. And well was it in that hour that the witch woman had advised as she
                  did. Otherwise, knife and hatchet in hand, he would have rushed upon Moncrief, and
                  glutted to the full, his vengence with his heart's blood. But the moments were to
                  him like hours—his mental suffering equal almost to those of Prometheus when bound
                  upon the rocks of Caucasus—he could not have endured them much longer. Again he
                  rose—again his shadow was thrown alarmingly before them. Then he hastily drew
                  forth his pouch, painted himself and threw himself in their path.
               "The Swallow need not fear," he said. "Her mother waits for her."
               "Shoon-ka-ska!"
               'Her mother mourned for her as one dead. Shoon-ka-ska sought long before he found
                  her."
               "Now we are indeed safe," murmured the girl, and side by side they returned to the
                  wigwam.
            
            
               CHAPTER XI.
               THE COPPER ROCK*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *The author is perfectly aware that he has taken a great liberty with Nature
                     in transferring the noted copper rock from its location upon one of the
                     branches of the Ontonagon River to the north shore of the lake.
               
               THE return of the trio to the wigwam was the occasion for a general conversation,
                  although the trapper somewhat monopolized it. He told of all that had happened
                  upon the island; of the illness of the chief (concealing the cause) and the
                  attempted murder of Moncrief. Loud, too, was he in praise of the White Dog, who
                  had successfully searched for them after all the others had failed. In fact, the
                  rest were but little better than listeners, save as they now and then answered his
                  questions. The chief had no inclination to talk; his wife was closely watching
                  Moncrief and her child; the Swallow modestly sitting at her mother's feet, the
                  young white man dreaming love dreams, and the White Dog plotting for the
                  future.
               "Thar ar one thing that puzzles me," continued the trapper, going over the subject
                  for about the fifth time, "and that am who could have shot the pisoned arrer. Ther
                  chief says that it whar made by ther Sioux, and he am mighty knowing in sich
                  matters, but I dont see how one of them thar cut throats would dare ter come in
                  these ar parts. Have yer seen any strange Injuns erbout, White Dog?"
               There was one from the Prairie, with a party of pale faces, at the mouth of the
                  Kamanisbique."
               "So yer have bin thar, have yer? That whar ther the reason why yer did'nt take
                  ther trail and find us sooner, I 'spose?"
               The Indian nodded his head but spoke not. He had especial reason for remaining
                  silent, and he felt that the eyes of the chief were fixed upon his face.
               "From the Perarer? That am Perarer du Chien, yer mean? Wall, he mought have bin er
                  Sioux, that am er fact. I concait that his trail won't be er very long one, before
                  I run him down. What kind of er man whar he?"
               "I only saw him in passing the canoe. He looked tall and young."
               "That's exactly yer description, Pitt. I should'nt wonder ef it whar ther same
                  reptyle. Howsomever, I'll fix his flint fer him, before I am many days older. But
                  why he should have shot er arrer and er pisoned one at that, is more'n I kin tell.
                  By ther way White Dog, yer know all erbout ther country back of Michipicoten, and
                  as far up as ther Pic River, and Neepigan Bay, don't yer?"
               "As I know the trail to my own wigwam."
               "Wal, yer jest ther man we want. My young
                  friend here am out er huntin fer copper, and ef yer know of any he'll pay yer well
                  ter pint it out ter him."
               Here was a chance to gratify both his avarice and revenge, and the Indian
                  instantly replied:—
               "The big copper rock?"
               "That's ther very thing! Strange that I haint ever thought of it erfore. Pitt, ef
                  yer kin only find that yer fortin am made for sartin. I've often heard of it but
                  never have seen it. Ther fact am ther Injuns have kept ther way ter it mighty
                  secret, fer they believe that er great Manertou lives thar, or something of this
                  sort. Do yer know the way, White Dog?"
               "My father showed it to me when I was a little boy."
               "And yer kin find it ergin?"
               "The trail is grown up. No moccasin has travelled it for many winters."
               "Jest as I told yer, Pitt. They whar erfeared that ther white man should discover
                  it and carry it erway. But I reckon they could'nt do that ar thing. How large
                  mought it be, White Dog."
               "More than ten times as big as the wigwam of the Beaver."
               "Ten times as big as my cabin! I don't believe it. Howsomever, we'll git ther
                  chief ter give us liberty to go, and I reckon ther White Dog kin find it ergin.
                  Trust er Injun fer that. He don't never fergit er trail that he's once travelled
                  ef it's twenty years arterwards. You kin find it, can't yer, White Dog?"
               "The eyes of the Shoon-ka-ska can track the dun wolf in the darkest night."
               "I thought so! I thought so," exclaimed the excited trapper, "and kin find er
                  copper rock when thars plenty of 'ishcodawan 'bo' depending
                  upon it."
               "The red man cares not for fire water."
               "Yer all say the same thing! No matter. I'll bet my rifle ergin er shot gun, and
                  that am mighty long odds—that he will take yer strait ter it, Pitt. But I'm gittin
                  sleepy. Come, we must gin up ther wigwam ter ther chief and ther wimin folks," and
                  setting the example, he went out and prepared a place for passing the night."
               His example was followed by the others. A fire was kindled, the trapper gathered a
                  few branches and threw down upon the hard rock for Moncrief to lie upon, as he had
                  been sick, and then they all wrapped themselves in their blankets, and with feet
                  turned to the flames, sunk into silence if not into slumber. But waking or
                  dreaming how very different were their thoughts? The mind of the honest trapper
                  was filled with the glories that would ensue to his friend upon finding the long
                  sought for copper rock. Moncrief was reflecting upon the beauty and love of the
                  Swallow, and the Indian fighting against the temptations to kill him as he lay
                  defenceless by his side. Most truly his slumber when at length he did so was "not
                  sleep, but a continuance of enduring thought—"the black plotting for another's
                  blood.
               But no murderer's hand was raised that night. All was tranquility. Brothers could
                  not have rested more securely, and the first glistening of the morning sun saw
                  them making preparations for departure. The trapper was as happy as a miser who
                  had discovered treasures that had long been buried in the earth, and to which
                  there could be no claimant. The others were thoughtful and silent.
               "We'll leave ther wigwam er standin'," said the trapper, after they had broken
                  their fast and launched the canoes. "It be kind er useful fer some of yer people,
                  Pitt. They'd be just fools ernuff ter come here lookin' arter copper, though I'd
                  as soon think of sarching fer beaver in er rat hole."
               "It would be useless labor to tear it down," replied Moncrief. "I may wish to come
                  this way again some time."
               "What fer! Ter be shot?"
               "Certainly not."
               "Wal, I hearn tell there is some kind of er God—I disremember his name now, that
                  shoots jest as strait as Injuns," answered the old man with a sly laugh.
               Moncrief knew that he referred to the rosy son of Mars and Venus, blushed, and
                  instantly turned the subject, by saying:—
               "The rest are embarked and off. We shall have to paddle swiftly if we intend to
                  keep them company."
               "Yes, thar they go, the chief and the White Dog in one canoe, and ther Swallow,
                  and mother in the other. Wal, I haint easily beat with ther paddle, but as it'll
                  be two ergin one I'll show 'em er leetle of er white man's contrivance."
               The bark afloat, the old trapper examined carefully the direction from whence the
                  wind came, and having satisfied himself that it was directly aft, he raised a
                  slender pole, fastened his blanket to it in the place of a sail, and soon overtook
                  and could have passed them had he desired so to do. Well he knew that it was a
                  dangerous experiment with such an egg shell of a craft, and with the wind from any
                  other quarter would not have dared to undertake it. Now he had but to steer
                  carefully and could enjoy his pipe at his ease.
               And very swiftly they sped along until they were passing the grave yard, when
                  Moncrief, who had never seen one before, enquired concerning it.
               "It am er Injing buryin' ground," replied the trapper, "but what in thunderation
                  am that er prowling eround under ther corpses?"
               "A wolf," replied his companion, raising the glass he carried with him and
                  adjusting the focus.
               "Er wolf! Then I'll jest show yer what this here old rifle of mine am good fer.
                  I'll try and make as good er shot as you did, even ef I don't hit er chief."
               Before the words had fairly been uttered, the report of his rifle was heard, and
                  the bullet had sped over the waters. All saw the shot and all saw the beast roll
                  over and lie still. They knew that death had followed.
               "What do you think of that ar, White Dog?" shouted the old man.
               "It was a great shot," was the reply, and his heart leaped for joy, for he knew
                  that what had been mistaken for a beast, was in reality the witch woman, and that
                  both he and his secrets would be safe in the hereafter.
               "Yes, it whar a capital shot ter make with er canoe rollin' under yer, and ef I
                  had time I'd go and git ther skin, though it haint of much ercount this time o'
                  ther year."
               "I would like to see where your bullet struck," said Moncrief. "It must have been
                  either through the head or heart, to have caused such instantaneous death. Let us
                  go down and see."
               "So we will. Wait, chief, for er few minutes."
               "Has the Beaver forgotten the big rock of copper," asked the White Dog, who felt
                  as if he was wearing the shirt of Nessus while the conversation was going on. "If
                  we do not take the trail soon, some others may be the first to find it."
               "So they mought—so they mought. It haint no ercount whar I hid ther beast, Pitt.
                  It am dead as er door nail, and that's all I want ter know," and he threw the
                  canoe again before the wind, and continued with unchecked speed until they had
                  reached the wigwams at the mouth of the Michipicoten River.
               A crowd had gathered to receive them. The story was soon told, (excepting always
                  that which could have been uttered by the White Dog,) and Pitt Moncrief became the
                  lion of the hour, for such man-worship cannot be claimed entirely by the demi-gods
                  of civilization! But more than all, he was feted by the old Medicine. Trickster as
                  he was, he yet wished to learn something of the manner in which the chief had been
                  so successfully treated, as well as some new charms, if possible, that would
                  render his name still more famous among the nation. But though disappointed in the
                  latter, Moncrief willingly explained as much as he waable to comprehend of
                     materia medica, and gladly escaped from the
                  wigwam, hoping to see the Swallow. In this he was disappointed. Her mother kept
                  her closely under her watchful eye. Then, as evening was drawing near, he sought
                  the wigwam that had been assigned him, and found the trapper in earnest
                  conversation with Shoon-ka-ska respecting the famous copper rock and its location.
                  Gladly almost as he had escaped from the jargon of the Medicine, would he have
                  done from them, but finding it impossible, he lighted his pipe and sat down to
                  bear the infliction with the best possible grace.
               "Yer say it am on ther branch ef er big river, didn't yer," continued the old man,
                  resuming the conversation that had been broken by the entrance of Moncrief.
               "Yes. It rises in the mountains," was the response of the Indian.
               
               "Is it er very long way from here?"
               "Six days."
               "Er week almost, and all ther way through ther woods?"
               "Half."
               "That will be er long journey fer yer ter undertake on foot, Pitt. I wish I whar
                  er goin with yer."
               "And are you not?" asked the young man in astonishment.
               "No."
               "But I thought you were to continue with me during the entire summer?"
               "So I am arter I git back, and that'll be by ther time you ar."
               "Whar are you going?"
               "Wal, ef yer must know, ter find ther red devil that fired ther poisoned
                  arrer."
               "What difference can that make now?"
               "Wal, ther chief and I have bin er talkin' over ther matter, and come to the
                  conclusion that ef sich things ar ter be, thar won't be any safety on ther lake
                  any more. So I am going ter hunt up ther raskil."
               "Will the chief go with you?"
               "No. He's got enuff ter tend ter at hum."
               "And White Dog is to be my only companion?"
               "Sartinly, and er good one yer'll find him tu. Thar hain't er honester Injin—yer
                  needn't blush. White Dog, though no one could see it through yer skin, that am er
                  fact—ther hain't er honester or more trusty Injin in ther hull tribe."
               "I am satisfied. When shall we start?" he asked, turning to his newly appointed
                  companion.
               "When the sun has risen and set two times."
               "That suits me exactly. I feel the need of rest before starting upon so long a
                  journey."
               "Wal," interrupted the trapper, "you kin fix up things, just as yer have er mind
                  ter, I shall be off early in ther mornin', and now 'spose we go ter sleep," and
                  suiting the action to the word, he prepared himself for rest.
               The hint started the Indian, and Moncrief was left alone with his thoughts. For
                  two days he would have an opportunity to see the Swallow and renew his vows of
                  affection, and with her fully occupying his mind he, also, passed into that
                  mysterious state which is the counterfeit of death.
               The suffering he had recently undergone, fatigue and excitement, told heavily upon
                  him; and long before he was awake the trapper had started upon his journey. This
                  was a great disappointment. He had intended to see him alone, and question him
                  more closely respecting Shoon-ka-ska. There was something—he could not tell
                  what—that he did not like about him. The eye of the Indian appeared to shun his,
                  and he never looked him squarely in the face. Somewhat a believer in the doctrine
                  of the attraction and repulsion of spirits, it was a source of anxiety to him.
                  With the trapper gone, he had no one to utter his thoughts freely to, so banished
                  them as well as he could.
               The care of the chief had provided him with breakfast, rude it is true, but
                  sufficient for hunger. That finished, he turned his steps to where he hoped to see
                  the Swallow. Nor was he disappointed.
               The curtains of the wigwam of Ah-ne-mee-kee were drawn back, and the girl was
                  seated within, busily engaged in making moccasins. She looked up and greeted him
                  with a sad, sweet smile, but a rapid motion of her fingers told him that there
                  were listeners near, and turning his head he saw the mother at but a little
                  distance, engaged in the usual housewife avocations. Compelled thus to give
                  utterance to nothing but the most commonplace sentiments, he talked of their late
                  and of his prospective journey.
               "Do you know anything of the famous copper rock?" he asked.
               "Nothing, though I have heard my father and the old Medicine talk about it," she
                  replied.
               "Then they have seen it?"
               "I think so. Does the Beaver go with you?"
               "No. He started up the lake very early this morning."
               "Who goes with you besides Shoon-ka-ska?"
               "No one. What sort of a man is he, Swallow?"
               He fancied that he saw her form tremble at the question, but could not be certain,
                  for her mother entered at the moment and called his attention to her as she
                  replied in the place of her daughter:—
               "There is none better or braver in the whole tribe of the Ojibwas."
               One glance at her face was sufficient to convince him that he was no favorite with
                  the old squaw, although he could think of no other reason than her savage
                  remembrance of the wrongs done to her daughter by one of his color.
               "Where is your father, Swallow?" he asked.
               "By the water."
               "I will go and seek him."
               "When do you start for the copper rock?"
               "Day after to-morrow morning."
               He bowed himself out and sought the chief, passing with him almost all the entire
                  day, sometime in his wigwam, (to be near his loved one even if he could not talk
                  to her) and sometimes wandering around the encampment "sight seeing."
               The second day was but a counterpart of the first one. He could find no
                  opportunity to converse with the Swallow alone save for a single instant. Either
                  her mother or the White Dog appeared the moment he approached her side. But the
                  one occasion he was fortunate enough to secure he was not slow in improving to the
                  utmost. He reitterated his lasting affection, and slipped the ring she had
                  heretofore refused, upon her finger, and moved rapidly away so that she could have
                  no chance to return it.
               Very early the next morning he was awake. There was no one stirring. He threw off
                  his blankets and in doing so a pair of moccasins fell to the ground. His heart
                  told him whose fingers had formed them. He took them up and inserting his hand
                  within so as to admire the workmanship he found a piece of bark. Drawing it out he
                  examined it closely, but could make nothing of the figures traced thereon—two
                  hands rudely sketched, in close proximity, and a serpent sticking at the about to
                  be interlocked fingers.
               "I wish the trapper was here. He could tell me what this means," he exclaimed
                  aloud.
               "Shoon-ka-ska will interpret for the pale face," was answered in his ear, and
                  turning he saw that the Indian had entered so silently as not to be heard, and was
                  looking over his shoulder.
               "Well," he replied, having been taken completely at a disadvantage and seeing no
                  way of escape. "Well, tell me."
               "The two hands are the Beaver and the pale Medicine. The serpent is the poisoned
                  arrow. The Swallow is congratulating them upon their escape."
               This to one unacquainted with Indian picture writing was satisfactory enough, and
                  as the White Dog urged immediate departure, and Moncrief could offer no good
                  reason for remaining, they entered a canoe and started in search of the copper
                  rock. The bark; however, he secretly concealed about his person, determined to ask
                  the trapper at the very first opportunity, if the interpretation given had been
                  the correct one.
               The naturally unsuspicious and buoyant nature of Moncrief soon recovered its
                  healthy tone, and his dislike to his companion entirely vanished before the end of
                  the first day. The Indian was thoroughly versed in woodcraft, and apparently took
                  great pleasure in imparting it. Freely he told the secrets of trapper and hunter
                  life, and the lessons experience had taught his tribe, making them wonderfully at
                  home when all of theory and written lore would have failed. In every manner he
                  assisted Moncrief, and once when the canoe struck a hidden rock in a swift rapid
                  and upset he clasped him in his strong arms and swam with him safely to the shore.
                  In every danger he was the foremost—in every labor assumed the whole, and when
                  their lonely camp fire was lighted for the first time, the white man felt that he
                  had a firm friend in the red one, and willingly told him so.
               "To tell you the truth, White Dog," he said, "I did not fancy going alone with
                  you. Somehow—I cannot tell why—I had taken a strange dislike to you. Now I do not
                  know a man—not even the Beaver—that I would more willingly trust with my
                  life."
               "The pale faces," replied the Indian with flashing eye and dilated nostril, "have
                  ever looked down upon the red man; but their skin often covers as white a heart as
                  if it was pure as snow."
               
               "I believe you. Taking you and the chief as examples, there can be no truer
                  men."
               "There are crooked trails and many choose to travel in them. Shoon-ka-ska has ever
                  looked for the strait one. His heart is opened. The pale face can read it like
                  their written talk."
               "So the Beaver says. He speaks well of you."
               "He is a great hunter, and his praise is as sweet to the ears of the red man as
                  the rain to the dry earth."
               "Yes, and he is honest. And that reminds me of the errand he has gone upon. Do you
                  think that he will find the Indian?"
               "He might as well look for the track of the gull through the sky."
               "What could have been his motive in shooting me?"
               "Has the pale face never stepped between a red man and her he loved?"
               "Me? No!"
               More he would have said, but the cunning Indian had completely turned the tables
                  upon him. He knew that Moncrief would like as little to talk of the Swallow as he
                  would of the affair of the island. So both relapsed into silence, and soon after,
                  into the sweet slumber that labor ever brings. The last thoughts of the Indian was
                  as to when and how he would accomplish his revenge; and those of the white man, by
                  one of the strange paradoxes of our nature, of an old squaw whom he had saved
                  during his visit at the village, from being beaten by a gang of half grown boys.
                  She was trying to escape them, and they following her with sticks, when he had
                  interfered. But from that moment it had passed entirely from memory until now.
               In his dreams, he saw her again. He fancied that she came toward him, threw back
                  her blanket, and revealed her strikingly ugly face, pointing to the sleeping
                  Indian, made a motion of warning, shook her fist, and just as he was about to
                  question her, disappeared. So life-like was the illusion of slumber that it awoke
                  him. He looked anxiously around, but no one was in sight. At a little distance he
                  thought he could see the bushes disturbed, as if some one had passed quickly
                  through. But he could not be certain. Even if it was the case, it might have been
                  caused by the wind or some night bird, and so he banished it from his mind and
                  knew nothing more, until the Indian shook him by the shoulder, and called him to
                  the breakfast he had prepared.
               Another short journey by water and they left the canoe and struck at once into the
                  woods, beginning in reality the hardships of the undertaking. The trail soon
                  became very difficult. Now through a tangled swamp of larch they were forced to
                  cut their way, and now to creep over high and dangerous rocks. Here Moncrief found
                  the moccasins presented him by the Swallow, and the hand of the Indian, his best
                  friends. Had it not been for them he would have fallen many a time, and been
                  dashed to pieces upon the ragged points below.
               On the summit of a hill they paused on the evening of the third day, and prepared
                  their camp. From it they could look over a wide range of territory, but so winding
                  had been their trail that Moncrief thought it very doubtful if they would be able
                  to find their way back again. To guard against this, he drew forth a little
                  compass he carried, and began to take observations. The Indian observed him
                  closely, wondering for a time, and then as he began to somewhat understand the
                  object, a dark scowl settled upon his features, and almost without his knowledge
                  his hand rested upon his knife.
               "What is my pale brother doing?" he asked.
               "Making sure that we do not get lost on our return."
               "Will that tell him the way to go?"
               "Yes. How do you find which way is North when you are lost in the woods?"
               "By the moss upon the trees in the day time, and the stars by night."
               "This is a more certain method," and Moncrief explained at some length the
                  principle of the magnetic needle.
               "And you could always find your way if you had this with you?"
               "Certainly."
               "Whether the sun was bright, or the moon and stars hid behind the thick blanket of
                  the storm?"
               "That would make no difference."
               The Indian stood for a long time. Then he turned away and resumed his labors, but
                  as the sun was shooting its last golden arrows to the earth, he asked Moncrief to
                  see the "Manitou that told the pale face the trail."
               "Be careful of it," was the answer as he placed it in his hands. "A very little
                  thing would ruin it. Be very careful that you do not let it fall."
               "Without the rocks give way beneath the feet of Shoon-ka-ska, it will be safe in
                  his hands."
               It seemed as if there was something prophetic in his words, for even as he was
                  uttering them, the jutting point upon which he was standing, crumbled away, and he
                  only saved himself by clinging to the roots of a tree that grew upon the very
                  brink. As for the compass, it must have been hopelessly destroyed. Nothing of the
                  kind could have helped being crushed into a shapeless mass, falling so far, and
                  the Indian mourned its loss as deeply as the white man.
               "Shall I go and look for it?" he asked, after expressions of great sorrow.
               "No, it would be useless. The battered fragments would serve no other purpose than
                  to remind me of my loss. Henceforward, White Dog, I must trust entirely to your
                  guidance."
               The Indian bowed acquiescence. He had accomplished his object, and wished not to
                  converse upon the matter. With the compass the pale face could readily find his
                  way out of the woods; now he was entirely in his power. The act of falling and
                  dropping the instrument, he had premeditated from the moment he had learned its
                  use, and while Moncrief was engaged, he had loosened a stone so that it would
                  easily slip, and so give the color of truth to the accident. But all through the
                  evening he mourned for it. So much so, that if the white man had been as well
                  versed in the character of the Indians as the Beaver was, it would have fully
                  aroused his suspicions.
               "Can the pale face get another Manitou like the one that fell down among the dark
                  rocks?" he asked, when they were enjoying their pipes after the evening meal.
               "Certainly, as many as I choose. It is not the worth but the want of it I
                  regret."
               "Shoon-ka-ska is very sorry. He must hunt and get many beaver skins, and buy the
                  pale face another."
               "No need of that. It was an accident, and all of us are liable to such things. But
                  tell me, how far we are now from the 'big copper rock' as you call it."
               "My brother shall see it soon after the sun rises again. It is not more than two
                  leagues away."
               "So near! I wish we had pressed forward to-night. Why did you not do so? There was
                  plenty of time."
               "Shoon-ka-ska must go and take offerings to the Manitou before he dare go any
                  farther."
               "What kind of offerings?"
               "Tobacco."
               "Well, you shall have a bountiful supply. Where does the great Manitou dwell?"
               "In a cave, near the big rock of yellow earth."
               "And unless you make him propitiatory offerings, he will not permit you to visit
                  it? Is that what you mean?"
               "Yes."
               "Is it true that a white man has never seen it?"
               "The moccasin of one has never been nearer than the lake before."
               "I will go with you and tender the offerings. Is there anything besides tobacco,
                  that would make the Manitou look with favor upon our undertaking?"
               Moncrief had learned enough of the superstitions of the red man to humor them, and
                  was determined that nothing—no matter how much he might laugh at it when
                  alone—should keep him from being unsuccessful after so long and tedious a
                  journey.
               "Yes, he loves pipes, iron and beads."
               "Then I am sorry that we did not bring a supply. The next time we come, which will
                  be very shortly, if I find the reality at all like the description, we will load
                  him down with presents."
               A sinister smile rested upon the face of the Indian, but he blew a cloud of
                  tobacco smoke between him and the white man, so that it would not be observed, and as usual urged
                  the necessity of going to rest. Very anxious to see the object of which he had
                  heard such glowing accounts, Moncrief consented, and it was not strange that he
                  dreamed of a mountain of native copper, with an Indian Manitou, whose features
                  strangely resembled those of the White Dog, sitting upon it as upon a throne of
                  burnished gold, and smoking a huge pipe!
               Long before he was awake, the Indian had stolen softly away into the woods, and
                  when he returned Moncrief was still sleeping. Pleased that his absence had not
                  been discovered, he sat about building a fire, making ten times the usual amount
                  of noise. If the object he had in view was to awake his companion it succeeded,
                  for raising himself and rubbing his eyes, he asked what the matter was.
               "My brother would be upon the trail?" demanded the Indian.
               "Yes."
               "Then let him eat."
               Not long does it take to dispatch a meal under such circumstances. There was no
                  ceremony to be observed. To supply the demands of hunger in the least time, was
                  all that was required, and that done they continued their journey for an hour,
                  when the Indian suddenly paused and pointing to a rock, whispered:—
               "There!"
               "Is that the big copper rock?"
               "Yes."
               By the aid of his glass Moncrief could plainly distinguish that it was a huge
                  piece of virgin copper, ramified through a mass of stone, intermixed with
                  calcareous spar. This the first glance showed him, but before he could carry his
                  observations any farther, he laid his hand upon his arm and continued in a
                  mysterious whisper:—
               "There is the cave of the Manitou!"
               Moncrief looked and saw a rock at a little distance, or rather the face of the
                  wall rock, with an opening near its base. This was the Manitoulin
                  rock, and it required no stretch of the imagination for an uneducated and
                  superstitious man, to fancy that the rushing in of the wind at the opening, with a
                  dismal sound, was a voice of a Manitou.
               "Here is the tobacco," said Moncrief, filling the outstretched hand of the Indian.
                  "Now we will go and make the offering."
               "Shoon-ka-ska must go first. When he returns then his pale brother can go."
               "Can we not go together?"
               "But one at the same time. The Manitou will be angry."
               "As you please."
               He saw the Indian creep in at the opening, and amused himself until his return, in
                  taking a general survey of the country with his glass. But so long was he alone,
                  that he begun to be troubled, when the White Dog reappeared.
               "What kept you so long?" he asked.
               "The great Manitou was talking to me."
               "Talking to you! What did he say?"
               "The pale face will hear with his own ears."
               "How far in the mountain does he keep himself?"
               "As far as the weapon of the pale face will carry."
               "A long rifle shot! Well, suppose you take care of my weapon until I return. I
                  shall not need it, I presume."
               "Shoon-ka-ska left his bow and arrows behind. Will my brother let me look at his
                  eye that draws things from afar?"
               "My glass, certainly. How will I know when I come to the spot where the Manitou is
                  to be found?"
               "There are four stones standing side by side. That is the house of the
                  Manitou."
               Moncrief, to carry out the mummery, filled his hand as the Indian had done, with
                  tobacco, took the flambeau of resinous bark that was offered him, and at once
                  started to look upon the home of an Indian god!
               The entrance was low and narrow. He was obliged to crawl for some distance. Then
                  he was able to rise and walk more swiftly along a rough and winding path. But
                  search as he would, he could find no such stones as had been described; and,
                  disgusted with the entire proceeding, vexed that he had lent himself to such
                  foolishness, he turned about to again seek the air and glorious sunshine, when his
                  light was extinguished and he was groping about in the most dense darkness—groping
                  in an unknown cavern, and amid he knew not what horrors!
            
            
               CHAPTER XII.
               A BLIND TRAIL.
               WITH scarcely a pause for rest, the old trapper paddled his canoe from the mouth
                  of the Michlipicoten to that of the Kamanisfique river. The few he fell in with,
                  whether white men or red, were closely questioned, but he could gain no
                  satisfactory intelligence with regard to the strange Indian he was in quest of.
                  Almost every exploring party had one or more of them in their employ—that was all
                  he could learn, but whether strangers to, or dwellers on the lake, was a point no
                  one could answer.
               With anything but patience he paddled away, until he reached the spot spoken of by
                  Shoon-ka-ska, and sought the wigwam of the chief of the portion of the tribe who
                  resided there. Scarcely waiting until the customary pipe had been smoked, he
                  broached his errand.
               "Have yer seen anything of er Sioux Injin erbout here?" he asked.
               "The cut throats are dogs!" was the sneering reply.
               "I know that jest as well as you do."
               "The Ojibwas would send them howling away."
               "That haint nothin' ter ther purpose. What I want ter know, am ef yer have seen
                  one on 'em here lately."
               "They hunt in packs like wolves. There is not one of them that dare take the trail
                  alone. The carrion buzzard has not a blacker heart."
               "Wal, they're all yer say, chief, but jest answer my question ef yer kin."
               "His scalp would be hanging in the wigwam of the Ojibwas if—"
               "Yer don't understand me. He came here, ef he came ertall, with a party of pale
                  faces huntin' arter copper."
               The words, "pale faces," and "copper," aroused the ire of the chief, and it was a
                  long time before the trapper could reason him into sufficient coolness to talk of
                  any other subject. At length, however, he succeeded, and obtained a distinct
                  answer to his enquiries. No strange Indian had been there, as far as he was aware
                  of, and that he was right, was attested by all the tribe. If there had been he
                  could not have passed unnoticed, for, though they were bound to peace by the
                  formal treaty of 1825, made at Prairie du Chien, between the Chippeways, Sioux,
                  Sacs and Foxes, Iowas, Menomonies and Winebagoes—though they then and there buried
                  the tomahawk and shook hands as friends, yet such an opportunity to have taken a
                  scalp for some unforgotten injury could scarcely have been overlooked.
               Disappointed thus, the old trapper sought one after another of the mining parties
                  that were scattered along the main shore and the southern point of Isle Royal, but
                  with a like result. "Ther White Dog couldn't well have bin mistaken," he muttered
                  to himself as he again turned his canoe southward. "He is er knowinsome Indian,
                  and his eyes am jest as sharp as lynx's. Ther raskil of er pisen-shootin redskin
                  must have crossed this lake in the big vessel I learn of, and I mought as well
                  give up ther chase. How-somever, I'll keep er sharp lookout, fer thar's no tellin'
                  when or whar he mought turn up again. I only wish I'd er seen him, that's
                  all."
               Driven ashore by a storm and detained for fully twenty-four hours in repairing the
                  damage done to his frail bark, the temper of the trapper grew still less amiable.
                  But in two respects it did him good—it afforded him time for rest and thought.
                  Forced to the latter, he reviewed all that had transpired since he had taken
                  Moncrief as a companion, and many points arose that he had failed to notice
                  before. But far from complimentary were his conclusions about the White Dog. His
                  coming alone with the mother of the Swallow—his being so long finding the girl and
                  Moncrief—his story about the strange Indian, all told against him, and for the
                  first time something like suspicion arose in the mind of the Beaver.
               Why should he take such an interest in the chief and his daughter? Others did not!
                  Could it be that he loved the girl? That thought was the match that fired the
                  train. All the rest followed as a natural sequence. The Indian that had fired the
                  poisoned arrow was "tall and young." So was Shoon-ka-ska! He had said that he had
                  been at the mouth of the Kamanisbique,
                  but no one had seen him there. Either the entire tribe or he had told a falsehood.
                  And if false in this, might he not be in others? Loving the girl, he would
                  naturally be jealous of a white man, and now he was wandering with him alone and
                  far from all others! That was giving the wolf as a shepherd to the lamb, and the
                  seconds the old trapper was still forced to remain became as hours.
               At length, however, the wind lulled, the sea became calm, and he was able to
                  proceed. Then he pressed forward and without another pause reached the wigwams at
                  Michipicoten. It was night, the curtains of the wigwams were closed, the fires
                  out, and nothing save the half wild dogs with their pointed noses and fox-like
                  ears, were stirring. They were snuffing around to find something that would
                  appease their never-satisfied hunger. Kicking them from his path he hastened to
                  the wigwam of the chief, and rousing him from his slumber he demanded if Moncrief
                  had returned. No, he had not, and nothing had been seen of him since his departure
                  with Shoon-ka-ska.
               "And yer haint heard nothin' of him nuther?" questioned the trapper.
               "Not one word. Who should have told of his wanderings to the Ojibwas?" asked the
                  chief.
               "I don't know! I don't know!" replied the anxious old man. "I kinder thought that
                  yer mought have hearn somethin' of him somehow. But come with me, I want ter tell
                  yer somethin'."
               "Let my brother rest until the morning light."
               Even he liked little to have his repose thus broken, and be dragged from his
                  comfortable quarters into the chill night air and damp woods at midnight.
               "I can't wait, I tell yer. It's most mighty important that I should talk ter yer
                  right now."
               "There are no tongues here that will repeat what the ears hear."
               With more of delicacy than could have been expected from so rude and uneducated a
                  man, the trapper thought of the Swallow, and how his fears would distress her if,
                  as he supposed, she was in love with Moncrief, and insisted upon going entirely
                  out of hearing before he spoke a single word upon the subject for which he had
                  aroused the chief.
               "Yer see," he said, "it's er matter that's entirely between us, chief, and though
                  I don't believe that yer wife or darter would go eround tellin' it, yet I know it
                  haint ther fashion of yer people ter let the wimin folks come inter ther council
                  lodge."
               "My brother is right."
               The point was well taken, for all Indians are very tender about having themselves
                  thought to be influenced in the slightest degree by the squaws, and without
                  another word he wrapped his blanket around him and followed the trapper to the
                  shore, and then by means of the canoe to a lone rock, midway in the stream, where
                  none could approach them without being observed.
               "Now," he said when they had seated themselves, "Now let us light our pipes,
                  and—"
               "Has my brother forgotten his cunning?" asked the Indian, looking up in
                  astonishment.
               He was aware that a quick eye would detect the little spark of fire in the bowls,
                  and keen nostrils scent the smoke as far as the buzzard would carrion.
               "I believe I have! The fact am, I been mighty troubled lately erbout ther young
                  Medercine, as you call him."
               "Has he wandered from the strait trail?"
               "Not as I knows on. No, no, that hain't it, but I'm erfeard that something has
                  happened ter him."
               "Does my brother smell blood in the air?"
               "I hain't quite hound enuff fer that, but I'll tell yer ther hull matter, and then
                  yer kin judge fer yerself."
               "The ears of Ah-ne-mee-kee are open."
               "Yer recollect erbout ther pisened arrer, and that Pitt said that ther one that
                  shot it whar young and tall. Now that am just what ther White Dog told us erbout
                  ther strange red skin he saw up by ther Rabbit Islands. Wal, I bin thar and heard
                  all from ther great Chief—"
               "Na-wa-je-wum?"
               "Yes, the 'Strong Stream'—from him down ter ther leetle boys, all say there haint
                  bin no sich reptyle thar, and I don't believe thar has."
               "Then the Beaver thinks that the tongue of Shoon-ka-ska is blistered with
                  lies?"
               "Yes. Thar's no use in mincin' matters between us. I think he has lied, and more'n
                  that I am e'enermost sartin that he whar the very one that tried ter kill
                  Pitt."
               "The pale face could never have done him any wrong."
               "It war er mystery ter me at fust, but now it's jist as plain as er Buffalo trail
                  ter er salt lick. You have er darter, yer know and—"
               "Shoon-ka-ska loves her, and is jealous of the pale face!"
               "You never made a better shot at er mark in all yer life, chief. Yes, he loves
                  ther Swallow, and would git Pitt out er ther way, so as to have plain sailin. Yer
                  found out mighty cute that ther bullet that hit yer, fitted ther leetle rifle, and
                  perhaps yer kin do the same erbout whar ther pisened arrer come from."
               "Moons ago it was in the wigwam of the great Medicine," was the quiet
                  response.
               "Are you sartin of that?"
               "Is the Beaver certain that the stars shine?"
               "Of course I am. I don't doubt yer word, but how did he git it from thar? Did he
                  steal it?"
               "No."
               "Then how did it come in his possession?"
               "The Medicine was showing it one day to old Sa-sa-nah."
               "What, ther one that passes for er witch?"
               "From that hour he has never been able to find it."
               "So she stole it, and gave it ter the White Dog. Could thar have bin ernuther one
                  like it in ther encampment?"
               "There was but one."
               "The positive assertion admitted of no argument. So confident was the chief, that
                  the trapper was convinced he had some private mark upon it. In this he was
                  right.
               "Does my Brother see this?" continued the Indian, drawing the arrow safely
                  enveloped in bark, from his pouch, and pointing to a minute cross upon it.
               "Sartinly. I haint quite blind yet."
               "When there was war between the Ojibwas and the Cut Throats, (he never called the
                  Sioux by any other name but that of contempt,) this was shot at the heart of
                  Ah-ne-mee-kee. It did not reach it. He brought it home, marked it and gave it to
                  the care of the Medicine."
               "That's all right, and thar haint er shader of er doubt that it whar ther White
                  Dog that fired it."
               "Sa-sa-nah must tell that."
               "Then the fust thing ter be done is ter find her, and I reckon it won't be er easy
                  thing. Do you know whar she am used ter hidin', chief? Ef I remember rightly she
                  used ter be er ramblin round kivered with er sort of er cloak of wolf skin."
               "The Beaver shot at one in the grave yard when we were coming home from the
                  island."
               "So I did! So I did! May ther Lord fergive me ef I have committed er murder. Come,
                  chief, let's go and see."
               The words of the Indian had merely been surmised. He knew that the old squaw was
                  accustomed to visit the spot—was often seen among graves—was frequently imitating
                  a wolf, and nothing had been seen or heard of her since that time, much as he had
                  enquired. To relieve his own mind, therefore, he needed no urging to induce him to
                  go and search. If the squaw had in reality been killed, there was an end at once
                  to her witchcraft and his hopes of proving the guilt of Shoon-ka-ska. Without her
                  testimony he could bring nothing against the denial of the Indian.
               The bright light of the moon, showed them distinctly as soon as they reached the
                  shore of the little island, that something renembling a wolf was lying still
                  beneath one of the upraised graves, and with feelings of horror they drew
                  near.
               "If it am ther poor woman, God forgive me," whispered the trapper.
               "The hands of my brother are unstained with blood," was the comforting assurance
                  of his companion.
               "I don't know—I can't say that. Howsomever, I wouldn't have shot at her any more'n
                  I would at er harmless chippin' bird, ef I had er known it."
               
               The eyes of the Great Spirit are shut to such things."
               "Wal, I'm glad on it, but we haint right sartin that it haint er beast arter
                  all."
               Picking up a branch, he pushed the skin aside, and was satisfied! There lay a
                  human skeleton—skeleton, for the birds and beasts had torn off so much of the
                  covering of flesh that neither form or feature remained.
               "It am ther poor woman!" exclaimed the horror-stricken old man, and falling upon
                  his knees he poured out (for the first time in his life, perhaps) a prayer that
                  God would not lay the crime of murder to his charge.
               The chief, however, was more skeptical. He had seen too much of the mummeries of
                  the old Medicine not to be so, and his examination was long and careful. Repulsive
                  as was the task, he turned over the wretched debris of a human frame until the trapper became completely
                  disgusted.
               "Wal?" he asked under his breath, as the Indian turned away.
               "It is the body of Sa-sa-nah! The bullet of the Beaver sent her to the Spirit
                  land," and he led the way again to the canoe, as anxious now as his companion, to
                  get away from such terrible surroundings.
               With the power of making the old squaw confess taken away from them, new plans had
                  to be formed. Very deep ones, too, they must be, if successful to trap one like
                  Shoon-ka-ska, and pondering upon what was to be done, they returned in silence to
                  the main land. To ascertain if it was true, as the trapper had surmised, that he
                  was in love with his daughter, was the first link in the chain that suggested
                  itself to the chief, and leaving his companion to provide for himself at some
                  other wigwam, he sought his own, and found, fortunately for his purpose, that his
                  wife had gone with others of her sex to gather rushes for the manufacture of
                  mats—an important article in their rude housekeeping.
               "My child," he said, introducing the subject at once, for fear of being disturbed,
                  "has Shoon-ka-ska ever asked you to be his wife?"
               "Father!"
               She thought instantly of the other one who had done so, and to whom she had
                  plighted her troth, blushed and faltered in her speech.
               "Why do you not answer?"
               "He has never asked me to be his wife."
               "Has he whispered sweet words in your ear?"
               "No."
               "Has nothing been said to you upon the subject?"
               "Mother has told me that I must be the wife of Shoon-ka-ska—often told me so. I
                  have heard them talking together about it."
               "Did she speak of the pale Medicine?"
               "Never, except to abuse him."
               "Did the White Dog say he would never return?
               "Never return? Father, father!" and she threw herself in his arms, and confessed
                  the great love of her heart.
               "Is it so indeed, my child!" he replied. "Then may the great and good Spirit help
                  you; but let your lips be closed to all other ears—even those of your mother."
               "And the white Medicine, father? If he should not return, the Swallow would
                  die."
               This conversation, brief as it was, let much light in upon the mind of the Chief.
                  His wife had been constantly talking to him since their return home of the
                  goodness of the White Dog—of its being time that their daughter was married, and
                  various other topics all pointing to one end. His own desire to have matters thus
                  arranged, had departed, but staring him broadly in the face were his words to the
                  Beaver, that he would kill her with his own hand before she should be the wife of
                  a pale face. Either he must forget his years of sorrow and his almost oath, or—he
                  saw it plainly now—break his daughter's heart. Which should it be?
               Long and earnestly he and the old trapper talked about the matter, but without
                  settling it. Of one thing, however, they were both of one mind, and that was that
                  Moncrief must be saved, and to that end they prepared to follow the trail leading
                  to the Copper Rock.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIII.
               IN THE CAVE.
               FOR a long time after the extinguishment of his torch, Pitt Moncrief realized but
                  little the horrors of his situation. He fancied that he might be lost for a brief
                  period, and that the Indian, finding that he did not return, would come in search
                  of him and lead him out again. Winding about as he had done, he could not tell how
                  far he had travelled or which was the way he had come. Like a blind man he groped
                  around in the darkness for a time, his hands touching and shrinking from the slimy
                  walls. Then he called aloud until he was hoarse. The echoes and the whirring of
                  the bats, and hooting of the disturbed owls was his only answer. He rested,
                  recruited his strength, and tried again and again with a like result.
               Still he could not believe that he was intentionally deserted. It could not be
                  that he was heard. His voice must be lost in the cavern, and not penetrate to the
                  outside, or he would be answered. It might be that the Indian had gone to the
                  copper rock, expecting him to follow. If he could catch but one ray of light he
                  would know which way to go, and soon be in safety. The little tunnel by which he
                  had entered must still remain open, and search would find it.
               Then for a single instant he thought of treachery—thought that he might be shut up
                  in a mountain cavern, far away from all of human help, and that he would perish by
                  the lingering death of starvation, and he prayed to God for any other fate than
                  that. But no, no! it could not be. He would soon find his way out again and smile
                  at all his ungrounded fears.
               To guard as much as possible against the danger of physical injury, he stooped
                  down and crawled along, cutting his tender hands upon the sharp rocks. This he
                  kept up for hours—how long he could not tell—then he sank down in hopeless
                  despair. Suddenly he thought of his watch. That would tell him how long he had
                  been underground. He held it to his ear, and found that it had stopped! He knew
                  that he had wound it the evening before—recollected that distinctly, so it must be
                  night again, and for fully twelve hours, he had been crawling amid unseen horrors.
                  Of this both thirst and hunger convinced him. He was faint with exertion—bruised
                  and bleeding in many places, and he stretched himself at full length to husband
                  his strength if possible. But for what? He had come thither in search of a
                  Manitou, and found the dark one of Death!
               Then as if his eyes had suddenly been cleared from all earthly film, he saw in
                  vivid colors all that had been. The face of Shoon-ka-ska had seemed familiar to
                  him from the very first—familiar, and yet repulsive. Now he knew that it was he
                  who had fired the poisoned arrow! In the loss of the compass and the taking away
                  of the glass, he saw premeditation; in sending him alone into the cavern he felt
                  that it was to block up the entrance and confine him there,—and that it was
                  accomplished! But why should he thus long for revenge? The Swallow? Yes, it must
                  be that he was jealous of her, and with the thought came the recollection of the
                  bark he had found in the moccasins. He felt for it and found it safe—drew it forth
                  and attempted to look at the picture writing. The darkest midnight he had ever
                  known was not as black as that around him.
               But thought begets thought, and for the first time since his entombment he
                  remembered a little box of matches that he always carried with him. He struck one,
                  a feeble flame followed, but enough for his purpose. He saw that upon the fingers
                  of one of the rude drawing was a ring, knew that it was intended for her he loved,
                  knew that it was a warning, and that the serpent striking at the about to be
                  clasped hands was the treacherous Indian, Shoon-ka-ska. Ah! why had he been so
                  blind as not to notice it before,—notice it when it was in his power to save
                  himself. Now all was lost, lost!
               The whirling wings, often brushing him in the face, and the shrill cries and
                  hooting of the birds that love the darkness, agreed with his conjectures, that it
                  was night. He struck another match and found that his watch had stopped with the
                  hands pointing nearly at eleven,—now it must be fully an hour later. It was a
                  morbid gratification to know how long he
                  had been there, but was purchased at a terrible price. The strange light attracted
                  the birds. They hovered around him as thickly as bees around honey comb. One, more
                  venturesome than the rest darted at the little blaze, struck it with its powerful
                  wings, and at the same time swept the box from his hands. He heard the clink of
                  the metal as it struck upon the rocks at some distance, but to find it was
                  impossible. Now he must meet whatever came, without even the poor satisfaction of
                  a light.
               An hour of intense mental anguish followed. Then, powerless to help himself, and
                  numbed with cold, he fell asleep and dreamed such dreams of warmth and plenty as
                  ever come to the brain amid such surroundings. The shipwrecked sailor, floating on
                  a little raft dreams of rills of cool, fresh water; the one amid the eternal snows
                  and ice of the Arctic of warm, sunny dells and bright flowers; the prisoner of
                  freedom, and the sick one of robust health. How true it is that 
                     
                        "Dreams in their development have breath,
                        And tears and torture, and the touch of joy,
                        They leave a weight upon our waking thoughts,
                        They take a weight from off our waking toils;
                        They do divide our being; they become
                        A portion of ourselves as of our time,
                        And look like heralds of eternity."
                     
                  
               
               But slumber brought little of rest to Pitt Moncrief. He woke to find his sleeping
                  thoughts but hollow mockeries, and realize more fully than ever he had done before
                  that he was a prisoner, far away from friends, from God's blessed sunshine, far
                  away from hope. His limbs became still more numbed, his hunger and thirst more
                  imperative in their demands. The calmness of despair settled upon his heart. It
                  was better to die suddenly than to linger thus in torture, and meet the grim
                  skeleton at last. He could not rest as he was, and for the hundredth time
                  continued his explorations, feeling his way and creeping along inch by inch.
                  Suddenly his fingers rested upon something round. A moment of manipulation, and he
                  flung it aside in horror. It was a human skull! They were scattered, mixed with
                  other bones, all around him, and he knew that he had been sleeping in a charnel
                  house!
               For hours he again wandered about, hoping against hope that he would find some
                  clue to enable him to regain his liberty. But all was in vain, and when the bats
                  and owls were once more upon the wing he fell from exertion, numbness, and the
                  want of food and drink, almost hoping that he would never wake again. But death
                  comes not to those who pray for it. It has its own time. Once more he awoke, and
                  fainter and weaker, resumed his useless search. He knew that relief must come and
                  that speedily, or it would be too late, for not long can either mind or body
                  survived such a terrible strain. Reason will totter from its throne, as the
                  physical strength gives way, and imbecility or madness follow.
               With the calmness of despair he at length ceased his crawling about in the pitchy
                  blackness—over the rugged pathway where every inch was gained only by severe labor
                  and torn flesh, and began to calculate the chances of escape. And desperate indeed
                  they were. Look at them in any light he would, he could see no possible hope of
                  rescue. Not a single human being could have the slightest knowledge of his
                  situation except him who had cunningly baited the trap and sprung it, and his lips
                  would remain sealed.
               That the opening by which he had entered was walled up and covered over so as not
                  to be distinguishable from the rest of the surface, there could not be the
                  slightest doubt. The trapper was upon a false trail and might be weeks absent. The
                  Swallow was powerless to help him and the chief could not be expected to take part
                  against one of his own tribe (and that one a lover of his daughter) even supposing
                  that he was aware of what had befallen him. But could he not help himself? Would
                  it be a useless task to attempt to dig out? There must be places where the
                  covering was thin compared to others, and if he could only find such a spot might
                  he not yet save his life, and disappoint the vengeance of the Indian? At least it
                  was worth the effort, and far better than thoughtful idleness.
               But how was he to find the point at which his labor would be the lightest?
                  Everything he had ever read or heard of people being lost in caves flashed with
                  lightning-like rapidity through his brain. There must be outside side sounds he at
                  length concluded, and if the shell that hid him from the gladsome sunshine and the
                  sweet music of birds and perfume of flowers was but thin enough, he could hear by
                  attentive listening. In this he was correct, and he was fast learning wisdom in
                  the severe school of experience, but fate was yet against him. He could hear
                  nothing save the same muffled sounds that had filled his ears since the first
                  moment of his confinement. Again he was deprived of even the comfort of action,
                  and to dig in a wrong direction would he merely excavating his own grave!
               Suddenly, however, he fancied that he could distinguish a noise as of a beast
                  scratching. Was that horror to be added to those that already encompassed him? Was
                  he, after all he had suffered, to become the prey of some ravenous bear or wolf or
                  panther? Was his flesh to be torn piecemeal, his blood to stain the floor, and his
                  bones to be scattered about that cavern? Should mother or sister or loved ones
                  never know of his fate? Ah! it is very hard to think of death, when the joys of
                  life are at their flood, but such a fate is more than terrible.
               But might not the very beast he so much dreaded be the means of saving his life?
                  It might pass him in the intense darkness—its lair might be in an opposite
                  direction from where he was lying—in the struggle he might conquer. What if his
                  hand had become weak, his knife was sharp, and forgetful of all other things he
                  waited and listened until he became satisfied that fancy had cheated him—that the
                  sound he thought he had heard was but the coinage of his own brain. Then he flung
                  himself madly upon the rocky floor, and almost raved for death to put an end to
                  his sufferings.
               But the knife—the long, sharp pointed, keen edged steel! It was still firmly
                  clutched in his hand, and one blow would free him from all he dreaded—one little,
                  rapid motion of the arm, and farewell alike hope and misery, love and hate, trial
                  and earth. The temptation was severe—very difficult to be resisted, and he tore
                  the covering from his breast and bared his heart for the blow.
               Well enough it is for us in the full possession of all our faculties, breathing
                  the free air, enjoying light and warmth and reveling in God's bounties, to talk
                  sneeringly (to say nothing of the wickedness) of the cowardice of such an act.
                  Well enough to shudder at and pity the guilty wretch who would take the
                  heaven-given life into his own hands, and send his soul, stained with his own
                  blood, to judgment. But who, surrounded by darkness, worn out, hopeless, dying by
                  inches, would think calmly of that "something after death" except that it was a
                  "consummation most devoutly to be wished!"
               Satisfied that nothing interfered to null the effects of the blow, the poor
                  prisoner drew back his arm to throw into it all his remaining strength. Then even,
                  as every muscle was strained to the utmost a sudden faintness fastened upon his
                  heart, and his hand fell powerless for harm. The thought of his mother—his
                  sister—of a father called home to God, with a crown of glory upon his silver hair,
                  and more, perhaps, than all, of the beautiful and loving Indian girl, robbed him
                  of the power to commit self-murder.
               "Great heavens!" he murmured, shuddering at the feeble sound of his own voice,
                  "Great heaven! What would I do. I may—will die, but it shall not be by any act of
                  my own," and his thoughts rapidly formed themselves into such a prayer as never
                  before had been born in his heart. A prayer that if it was God's will that he
                  should die then and there, that all his sins might be forgiven, and his sould find
                  free passage through the golden gates.
               Tranquilized by the outpouring of his feelings, Moncrief lay for a long time
                  motionless. He knew by the signs that had before warned him that night had come
                  again. But would he see the dawning of another morning save one eternal? Very
                  little chance was there of such a thing. The clock of life was beating more slowly
                  at every pulsation of the heart—the hands had crept around the dial almost to
                  "twelve." Soon the last hour would come.
               Again he thought he heard an unwonted sound. He raised his head from the hard,
                  cold stone pillow, and listened. All was still. His senses almost purified from
                  earth, might have heard the beating of the surf on the thither shore of time—the
                  rushing of angel wings—the songs of the
                  New Jerusalem, but nothing caused by mortals. Once more his head sank—once more
                  the often raised and disappointed hope died out within him.
               "May God have mercy upon me," was breathed from his parched lips. "Mother, sister,
                  Swallow, dear Swallow, I am dying—dy—"
               The black bats screamed, and the great eyed owls hooted above him, but his leaden
                  ears heard nothing of their harsh utterances. The chilling condensations dripped
                  from the rocky roof like rain upon his unprotected limbs, but he knew it not. The
                  skulls and bones of those who had gone before, were scattered around him—he was
                  resting upon them but he heeded it not. The rosy sun was gilding the clouds of
                  grey, and telling that another day of glorious beauty and promise was dawning upon
                  a sleeping world, but his eyes were closed. Loved ones were whispering his name,
                  but he could not answer.
               The blood had faded from cheek and brow—the limbs were becoming rigid as iron—the
                  soft hair was stiffening with the heavy damps of dissolution. The icy fingers of
                  death had fastened upon his heart strings.
               Weep mother, weep sister, weep Indian lover for him whose image ye may have in
                  your hearts; but who shall take his place by your side—whose warm kisses shall
                  thrill your lips—whose breast shall pillow your heads, and whose smile shall be to
                  you as sunshine—nevermore!
            
            
               CHAPTER XIV.
               COUNTER PLOTS.
               AT the very moment of the disappearance of the white man within the cave, the
                  Indian, Shoon-ka-ska, crawled near to it and listened. As long as he could hear
                  the sound of his footsteps he remained motionless, but as soon as they were lost
                  to his ears he placed in front of the opening a flat stone that he had carried
                  thither with much labor during his morning visit, and began to cover it with earth
                  and leaves, effectually shutting out all of light. The rude portion of the work
                  accomplished, he smoothed it over with skillful hands, so that nothing but the
                  closest scrutity could discover that it had ever been disturbed. Not satisfied,
                  however with this, he crept up the steep bank and rattled the earth and stones
                  from above, until for yards there was the appearance of a recent land slide.
               Never was there more care taken or more cunning displayed in the covering up of
                  the tracks of crime. A white man would not have endured the fatigue, even if he
                  had thought of the plan, but to the red one it was almost a labor of love. Next to
                  vengeance the hiding of the trail was a work of peculiar pleasure, and when all
                  was finished to his mind, he sat down and contemplated it, as a skillful engineer
                  might have done some bravely fought battle with, and victory over nature. The one
                  who had stood between him and his revenge, was out of the way, and there was no
                  one to tell the tale. And more than that, he had made himself rich by the securing
                  of a weapon that he had coveted from the outset, and the powerful glass—a thing he
                  looked upon as one of the pale man's Manitous—by which he could see for a great
                  distance.
               Like one, consequently, who had done a noble deed, he sat down and glorified over
                  the sufferings that would come to Moncrief. Well he knew the secrets of the prison
                  house, and that nothing short of Divine assistance would ever free a prisoner
                  confined therein. While treading its darksome way, even for the little distance
                  that he had, his heart had trembled, and how much more so must it be with one
                  frail of frame as the white man, who knew that there was no escape? He knew that
                  it was strewn with the bones of dead men, that foul birds made it their abiding
                  place, and more than once, during hunting expeditions, he had heard it ring with
                  the roars of savage beasts. Might not some now be rearing their young amid its
                  secret hollows, and if so, what would be the fate of him who blindly rushed upon
                  them? Think of it in whatever light he might, the end would be the same—death to
                  the pale face, and not a taint of blood upon even the hem of his garments to tell
                  that he knew aught of the matter.
               Thus far not a single ripple had broken the smooth current of his dream, but now
                  other thoughts forced themselves upon his attention. How should he account for the
                  non-appearance of the white man when he returned to the encampment of the tribe,
                  for return he must to win the Swallow as a bride, otherwise all his labor and
                  steeping his hands in blood, would be lost. Both the old trapper and the chief
                  were not easily to be blinded, and it would require something more than an
                  ordinary story to satisfy them. Both, too, had reason to love Moncrief. One was a
                  firm friend—loved him as a son, and he had saved the life of the other. Nothing
                  short of actual proof, therefore, would content them. Any idle tale they would see
                  through in a moment—any trail to which they could find a starting point, follow
                  like sleuth hounds to the end.
               How, then, was he to set their minds at rest? keep them his friends, and so secure
                  their assistance in wooing and winning the Swallow? Her being betrothed to the one
                  that he had murdered, he took no account of. The mother was on his side, and
                  unless there was something to turn the father against him, he had no fear for the
                  result. But that was merely a secondary consideration. Moncrief, even though out
                  of the way, was far more of a stumbling block than when free.
               Many almost as the leaves of the tree under which he sat, were the lies that came
                  ready formed to his tongue, but all were rejected. To return and say that the
                  white man had wandered from him and become lost, would not for a moment be
                  credited, for any child could find such a trail as he would leave. To say that he
                  had been accidently killed, would be putting upon himself the task of leading
                  others to the grave. To tell that they had quarrelled and separated, would bear
                  falsehood upon the face of it; for the pale man would not be rash enough (no
                  matter what the provocation) to do such a thing, when the chances were a thousand
                  to one against his ever finding his way back to his friends. To assert that he had
                  met some party of his own color upon the lake and joined them, would lead to a
                  severe questioning of all the particulars—of their number, and which way they were
                  bound.
               Between so many contradictory stories he knew not how to decide. There was but one
                  way for him to cut the Gordian knot that suggested itself to his mind, and that
                  was by leaving himself for a length of time. Yet while the matter was being
                  forgotten, might not some one else step in and carry away the prize? Go, therefore
                  he could not, and so must add another murder to his list of crimes. The old
                  trapper had before aroused him to anger—that was not yet revenged, and now his
                  presence rose like a mountain before him. Yes, he must die! That point settled,
                  the other appeared less difficult to be met and overcome.
               Still there were rocks ahead—still lions in his path. The trapper was not of the
                  same metal as his friend. He was accustomed to be on the watch for danger—to
                  expect constantly to meet it, and be prepared when it came. To think of enticing
                  him into a cave would be useless—to assault him openly dangerous. To ambush and
                  kill him when unsuspecting, was the only chance. But here again, as in all his
                  other plans, difficulties arose. The trapper was absent, following, as the Indians
                  well knew, a foolish trail, and he might not return for a long time.
               —"Might not return for a long time." If so he would have an opportunity to visit
                  the encampment, learn all that had transpired during his absence, and arrange his
                  plans for the future without fear of molestation. After a long deliberation he
                  settled upon this, and with his mind relieved, cooked the first meal since early
                  in the morning, and sat down and eat it as coolly and with as much relish as if
                  the one that had trusted him with his life was not starving within a few feet of
                  where he sat! And there, too, he slept, for the entire day had been spent in
                  thought and watching that his victim did not escape; for, fiend that he was, he
                  had distinctly heard the calls for assistance, and smilingly noticed the fact that
                  they constantly grew more feeble.
               And yet another day he lingered. Some strange fascination chained him there. Once
                  or twice he determined upon opening the
                  mouth of the cave, that it had cost him so much labor to close and conceal, and
                  satisfy himself that the white man had not escaped by some unknown outlet, now
                  that his cries had long been stilled. But he dared not do so. Living, he would not
                  have feared him; but that he could live so long underground, shut out from light
                  and pure air, and surrounded by the rattling bones of the departed never entered
                  into his calculations. Dead he must be, and it was the fear of meeting his ghost
                  that alone deterred him.
               Any civilized mind would fancy that he must have had a skeleton for companion as
                  he stuffed himself at his lonely meals; and a skeleton for his bed fellow as he
                  lay wrapped during the dark hours in the blanket of him he had entombed,—that
                  hideous forms must have come trooping around him in his dreams; that he would have
                  awakened from them, nor dared 
                     
                        "Again to close
                        His eyelids in such dire repose,"
                     
                   but it was not so. Never did innocence sleep more soundly—never did
                  quick-footed dreams dance to a more joyous measure through the brain of any man.
                  He saw himself crowned as the great chief of the nation and the hand that placed
                  the badge of power upon his head, accompanied by horrid words, was the
                  Swallow!
               No marvel then was it, that the dawn found him refreshed, and ready for the
                  homeward trail. A trail much nearer than that by which he had journeyed thither,
                  for he had purposely taken a long and blind one to baffle Moncrief, in case that
                  any accident should render his plans of vengeance abortive.
               Hiding the glass and rifle in a secure place until the time came when he could use
                  them without fear of questioning, he gave one more glance at the spot where the
                  opening to the cavern had been—listened once more to satisfy himself that all was
                  silence, and started. To return to where he had left his canoe would occupy too
                  much time, and so he struck a direct course for the mouth of the river where his
                  people lived, condensing the journey to within the space of two days.
               As he came within sight of the fires as they flashed ruddily out amid the darkness
                  of early evening, he paused and considered. If he could, himself unseen, but learn
                  all that he wanted to know, it would be well, for then he could retreat or go
                  boldly forward as policy dictated. Or if he could find some friend within the
                  wigwams who would unknowingly play the spy and come and inform him, it would be
                  better still. If the old witch woman was only alive, he would have such an one,
                  but the fatal shot of the trapper had robbed him of her assistance, and though he
                  gloried in it at the time, it was a matter of bitter regret now. There was but one
                  other one that he dared trust, and that was the mother of the Swallow. To gain her
                  ear, however, without detection, was anything but an easy task. Still it was the
                  only resource left him, and so he waited until the fires were extinguished, and
                  all silence in the encampment. Then he crept cautiously forward, soothing as best
                  he might the outcries of the ever restless and noisy dogs.
               An hour occupied in snail-like crawling, brought him to the wigwam of the chief.
                  There was no sound issuing from within except the regular breathing of some
                  one—one and not more. His quick ears did not deceive him as to that. Could it be
                  possible that he had found the one he sought alone? If so fortune was indeed on
                  his side. Gently he raised the bark covering, and peered within, but all was
                  darkness, and he could discover nothing.
               "Are you alone?" he asked, calling the mother of the Swallow by name.
               There was no answer for a time. He could hear a slight rustling within, as if some
                  one was rising, and repeated his question.
               "Yes," was answered, but in so low a tone as scarcely to reach his ears.
               "May I come in?"
               "No."
               "Where is the chief and the Swallow?"
               "Gone!"
               "Will they soon come back?"
               "Yes."
               "Then put your ear close to the side of the wigwam. I want to talk to you."
               There was another movement within. The bark he had raised was put down, and the
                  same cautious voice told him to "go on."
               "Where is the trapper?"
               "Gone."
               "Up the lake?"
               "Yes."
               "Has he not got back?"
               "No."
               It appeared evident that the squaw was determined to answer only in monosyllables,
                  and though it somewhat nettled him, yet he attributed it to her extreme caution,
                  and continued:—
               "Has the chief heard from him?"
               "No."
               "Has any one been asking for the pale face that went away with me?"
               "No. Where is he?"
               "Safe enough. He is not coming back again."
               The form of the speaker within the wigwam trembled violently, and it was sometime
                  before she could sufficiently command herself to ask:—
               "Where has he gone?"
               "Away with some of his people."
               The very lie he had thought of and rejected, had been forced from his lips.
                  Accident had decided for him what thought had failed in doing.
               "Did he send any word to—to my daughter?"
               "No."
               "He loved her?"
               "Yes, and had he not gone, would have made her his wife. Now she shall be mine;
                  you know you promised me."
               "Ye—yes."
               "What does her father say?"
               "Nothing."
               "Do you think she will forget the pale face, and love me?"
               "No!"
               The answer was given with so much more energy than any had before, that it started
                  the Indian.
               "What makes you speak so strongly?" he asked.
               "Because I hate you."
               "What do I care? She shall be my wife."
               "Which way did the pale face go?"
               "Towards the Sault."
               "Didn't you go to the copper rock?"
               "No."
               "But you started for it?"
               "Yes, but he altered his mind. Are you certain the trapper has not got back?"
               "Look and see."
               "Have you spoken to the Swallow about my love?"
               "Yes."
               "And she will—you will make her become my wife?"
               "When she forgets the pale face?"
               "I'll soon make her do that."
               "Will you?"
               Again the form of the squaw trembled violently, and her hands rested upon the
                  knife within her belt. It was a somewhat strange action for a friend, but she
                  might have been thinking of the wrong done to her other daughter by one of white
                  skin, and it was but a savage way of showing her hatred of all the race.
               "You will tell her that her pale lover has gone never to return."
               "Ye—yes."
               Every time that subject was mentioned, her replies appeared to choke her. So
                  difficult became her utterance, that the Indian could not but notice it.
               "What is the matter with you?" he asked.
               "Noth—Nothing. I was thinking of the pale face."
               "He will never trouble you more."
               "You—have—have murdered him!"
               "No. I left him—that's all."
               "Hist!"
               The signal of warning recalled the Indian to the recollection of the danger of his
                  situation, and with a request that she would meet him outside of the encampment in
                  the morning, he stole away and again hid himself in the forest.
               But if he had remained—if he could have looked within the wigwam, he would not
                  have rested as calmly as he did. No sooner was he gone than her he had taken for
                  the old squaw threw aside her wrappings, and the Swallow was revealed! She had
                  known the voice of Shoon-ka-ska the moment he had spoken, and suspecting
                  treachery, had cunningly forbidden him to enter the wigwam, and counterfeited her
                  mother's voice. Very difficult was it, however, for her to command mand herself when he had spoken of Moncrief and of
                  her being his wife. His wife! Dark as was the road of death, she determined to
                  follow it rather than that the arms of the White Dog should ever press her to his
                  heart or her lips be blasphemed by his kisses.
               But what of the pale face who had won her love? She did not believe a single word
                  of the story she had heard—but she did believe Moncrief had been basely murdered.
                  In an instant all the cunning of her race awoke within her, and she resolved to be
                  revenged, even if her own little hand was forced to do the bloody work. Ah! if she
                  could only see either the trapper or her father then! But both were absent. She
                  knew that they had started upon the trail, but had little idea which way they had
                  gone. Her mother she could not trust—for mother though she was, had proved herself
                  an enemy in her love matters. Hard as it was she could see nothing to do but to
                  wait and watch the treacherous Indian, and he was to be her husband.
               Very quickly these thoughts had flashed through her brain, and she had resolved
                  upon her course. Then she lay down again, and when her mother returned from a
                  night visit to a sick neighbor, she was apparently sleeping soundly. On her
                  entering she arose, thought that it would be necessary for her to keep the visit
                  of the Shoon-ka-ska a secret, and so determined to meet him herself, disguise her
                  feelings, and learn if she could, more concerning the fate of him who was to her
                  more than life. She was fast realizing what it was to become strong by
                  suffering—learning what love would do and dare.
               "Has your father returned?" questioned her mother, as she saw her making
                  preparations to leave.
               "No. I have not seen him."
               "Where are you going?"
               "Down to the lake to see if his canoe is coming."
               "To look for your pale-faced lover," was the sneering reply.
               "I have none. He has gone away."
               "And you are watching for him to come back?"
               "He will never come back!"
               The sound of her own words, although they were used to deceive her mother, struck
                  a chill to her own heart. What if they should prove to be true? Then may the Good
                  Spirit help her, for as she had once said, she would surely die.
               Woman-like, she dressed herself in all of her savage finery—all but one thing. The
                  ring Moncrief had forced upon her acceptance was safely hidden from
                  sight—suspended from around her neck by a string of wampum, and resting above her
                  heart. But all her other adornments were displayed to the best advantage, and
                  satisfied that she could fully captivate the savage heart of Shoon-ka-ska, she
                  went forth to meet him.
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               SEARCHING IN VAIN.
               THE long deliberation of the trapper and the chief was anything but satisfactory
                  save in one respect, and that was the very one that was the most fatal to their
                  hopes—the murder of Moncrief. Still the old man clung to the belief that if they
                  hastened on they would be in time to save him, but the Indian shook his head
                  sadly—he had every reason to believe that they would be too late.
               "Whar shall we go, chief, fer er startin pint?" asked the Beaver, when they had
                  finally settled upon following the trail.
               "Shoon-ka-ska would not follow a straight one if he intended it should end in
                  death," was the answer.
               "He went down the lake, didn't he, this varmint?"
               "Yes, but there are an hundred places where he could land, and no eye be the
                  wiser."
               "That's all true ernuff, but he must leave the canoe somewhar. We kin find
                  that."
               "Can my brother see in the water like the pike?"
               "Of course I can't, and I don't know as I want ter nuther."
               "Is he growing so old that he has forgotten his cunning?"
               "O!" replied the Beaver with a low laugh, "I see what yer er driving at now. Yer
                  haint forgot ther time when I whar chased by the Sacs and filled my canoe with
                  stones and sunk, it and made them believe that I had gone down erlong with it. It
                  war'nt er bad caper, and yer think that ther White Dog might do some sich
                  thing?"
               "He will hide his trail."
               "More'n likely, but ef I don't find it I haint half as smart as ther anermile
                  arter which I am named. We will go down ther lake anyhow, and see what we kin
                  find."
               Slowly they paddled along the shore and examined it inch by inch, and great was
                  the joy of the old man when they came at length to the spot where they had landed
                  for the last time, and the White Dog hidden his frail boat. Both the sand and the
                  green mould showed where it had been taken from the water, and not long were they
                  in finding where it had been secreted.
               "Ther reptyle wasn't half so smart as we gin him credit fer," exclaimed the
                  overjoyed old man; overjoyed, for he could not believe that any one who
                  premeditated a foul crime would leave so open a trail. "It hain't on-possible," he
                  continued, "that we mought be mistaken arter all. Ther White Dog haint sich er
                  fool as ter leave er trail as plain as er runnin' Carerboo, ef he had any
                  raskality in his mind."
               The Indian made no reply. His mind was still far from being at ease, and he knew
                  that such a plan had frequently been resorted to in order to double upon the
                  trail, and blind the eyes of all searchers. Until he had followed it unto the end,
                  no opinion would pass his lips. He was very certain, however, that the joy of his
                  companion was premature, and that before their search was ended it would turn into
                  sorrow. Yet he willingly consented to press forward, and showed his rare wood
                  training whenever any difficulty occurred, leading the way where an unskilled eye
                  could have found nothing for a guide, without the slightest hesitation. The most
                  minute disturbance of the moss upon the rocks, the recently broken branch, the
                  turning of a stone was sufficient for him.
               But at one point they rested longer and examined more closely than they had
                  previously done. It was where Shoon-ka-ska and Moncrief had camped together for
                  the last time. The charred embers of the fire yet remained as they had been left;
                  for, builded Indian fashion (that is with the sticks laid like the spokes of a
                  wheel and the fire kindled where the hub would be, it soon expires unless some
                  hand keeps moving them towards a common centre) it had died out for want of
                  tending. Various other signs, also, revealed the not yet trodden out love of
                  luxury of the white man, and the old trapper smilingly pointed to them and
                  remarked:—
               "That thar boy had orter have bin er woman! Yet he is jest as brave as kin be, and
                  when he sits his foot down ter er thing, thar haint no more use of trvin' ter stir
                  it than thar is of er mounting."
               "The foot of the young Medicine has ventured too near the brink or—"
               "That red devil of er White Dog has pushed him over!" exclaimed the trapper,
                  noticing for the first time the spot where the Indian had hurled down the loosened
                  stone, protending to fall and dropped the compass. "Thar can't be er doubt on it,
                  chief. Here's ther indentical spot whar he shoved him over and murdered him. May
                  ther Lord forgive him, but I never will, ef he has killed ther boy," and unused as
                  his eyes were to tears, they were now flooded.
               "The pale face may have escaped," replied the Indian, anxious to comfort his
                  companion, although he did not believe his own words.
               "Escaped! He's crushed inter er thousand atoms! Thar haint no kind er manner of
                  doubt of that. O! my poor boy! My poor boy."
               "The tears of my brother may have blinded his eyes. Let us go below and look."
               "And find his body all crushed and mangled and eaten by wolves, and picked by
                  birds! Thunder! this am ther most sorrowful minnit of my life, and may I be
                  forgiven for letting him come erlone. I had orter known better. And he has an old
                  mother at home, and—"
               "The Swallow had promised to be his wife."
               "Wal, I thought as much, and now she'll have ter mourn for him all the rest of her
                  days. It am sad fer her too, poor child."
               
               Perhaps the chief felt as deeply as he did, the loss of Moncrief, but his heart
                  gave no expression in words. It was his nature to keep violent emotions under
                  control, and besides, the thought of vengeance was combatting with those of grief
                  for mastery.
               "Thar am ther print of his little feet," continued the Beaver. "They haint much
                  longer than er child's. I kin see it all jest as plain as if I had bin here. He's
                  bin er standing right on ther brink of ther precerpice, and ther White Dog has
                  shoved him off and ther rocks rolled arter him. He whar too cowerdly ter tackle
                  him when he would have had er chance fer his life."
               Even while they were talking, the long howl of a wolf arose from the valley
                  beneath. Their eyes met and they read each other's thoughts. They had frightened
                  the beast away from its loathsome meal, and each seizing a stone, hurled it into
                  the abyss to accelerate its movements, and save for burial the torn remnants of
                  him they had once loved.
               "Quick, chief," shouted the Beaver. "Quick! Let us git down jest as soon as we
                  kin. Ther thought of what thar beast mought have bin er doin, has sent er cold
                  chill creeping over me like ther ager."
               Very far, however, was it from being a speedy task to arrive at the bottom of the
                  deep and ragged ravine. By slow and winding and dangerous paths only, could they
                  reach it without going back to a far greater distance than their patience would
                  endure. Quick eyes, daring hearts and strong arms and limbs, at length
                  accomplished the task, and panting with exertion they paused to regain their
                  breath, before beginning their search—a search for that they did not wish to find!
                  And find the corpse of Moncrief they did not. Look as carefully as they would,
                  there was no trace of it.
               "Ther wolves kin not have devoured bones and all," said the trapper mournfully.
                  "Thar must be somethin' left. I've seen sich things before, but I ollers could
                  find er scrap of clothin' ef nothin' more."
               There was but one solution of the mystery to the mind of the chief, and he turned
                  his eyes upwards. One falling from above might have lodged in a tree or caught
                  upon a far jutting point of rock. Whether this was the case or not, it required
                  much time and severe labor to decide. But they were equal to the task, and after
                  crawling half way up they found—not the body of Moncrief, but his little compass
                  hanging uninjured upon a bush.
               "It's all plain now," shouted the Beaver, as exultingly as he had before been
                  sorrowful. "This ar thing am ther only one that has fallen arter all. We've bin
                  big fools, chief, I'll bet my life ergain er bullet mould, that ef we'd er looked
                  at ther onward trail, we'd have found ther prints of his moccasins."
               And so it proved. The trail from the fire was as plain as any they had followed.
                  The feet of both the white man and the Indian could be plainly distinguished, but
                  as darkness had settled around they were forced to desist from their search, and
                  re-arranging the dry sticks they camped upon the very spot where him they sought
                  had spent his last night above the ground. Spent it with the white man mourning in
                  more than his usual words at discomfiture, and the red man more than usually
                  taciturn. To have gone on such a hard and foolish errand was a shame to the very
                  name of hunters. A hearty supper and a long smoke, the knowledge that no one else
                  was aware of their faux pas, somewhat comforted
                  them, and again they could talk calmly of the object of their journey.
               "How far am ther big rock of copper from here?" asked the Beaver, as he stretched
                  himself at full length with his feet to the glowing coals.
               "Two leagues," was the curt answer.
               "And we had ter be er fooling erway our time and nearly killin' ourselves when we
                  could jest as well have bin thar as not. Howsomever, it won't be many hours till
                  ther morning. What kind of er trail am it, chief?"
               "A child could find it."
               "So much ther better. Then we won't be very long er gittin ther."
               "The foot that is anxious travels fast."
               "Yes, thar's truth in that ar. But did'nt yer say yer darter and Pitt had ergreed
                  ter git married."
               "Yes," and the Indian briefly related all that the Swallow had told him.
               "Wal, I thought as how it would be ther case, and—" He was going on to tell what a
                  handsome couple they would make, and how glad he was of the engagement, when he
                  suddenly recollected that the Indian had almost sworn to kill his child before she
                  should become the wife of any pale face.
               "What is the matter with my brother?" asked the chief, looking up in astonishment
                  at the sudden cutting short of the sentence and the confused face of his
                  companion.
               "Nothin', nothin,' I stopped ter think, that's all."
               "What was he thinking of?"
               "It war'nt of much account no way, and besides I'm gittin' too sleepy ter talk any
                  more. I don't know when I've bin so tired. How do yer feel?"
               "Well."
               "So am I in body, but my mind is kinder restless-like when I think of what ther
                  morrer may bring."
               "Would my brother sleep dry?" suddenly asked the Indian."
               "It haint of much ercount no way, but its er good rule ter take keer of yerself
                  when yer kin. What makes yer ax sich er question?"
               "Look," and his finger pointed to the sky.
               "Blacker than er mink, haint it? Nary er glimpse of er moon or star ter be seen.
                  Yer right. We're going ter have er regular old-fashioned deluge, and we mought
                  jist as well be er takin keer of ourselves."
               The large drops pattering upon the leaves quickened their movements, and a
                  shelving rock, a few pieces of bark, and their blankets, were soon made to afford
                  perfect protection. For hours the tempest raged furiously. The rain fell in
                  torrents, the inky sky was fitfully illuminated by the lightning; the thunder
                  fairly bellowed amid the mountain tops; great trees were twisted off as if they
                  had been but slender reeds, and if ever the demons of storm were out upon a
                  holiday it was on that night.
               Morning followed, more beautiful for the freshening of nature, violent though it
                  had been. The evergreens shook off their spicy odors at every breath of the wind;
                  the foliage was dripping and sparkling like emeralds; the little blossoms of that
                  far northern Flora held a pearl-like drop in each petite cup, and the brooklets
                  sang sweet songs as they ran gurgling down the mountain side.
               What if a few trees had fallen splintered—the monarchs of an hundred years been
                  laid prostrate? From amid the countless thousands they would no more be missed
                  than a grain of sand from the seashore. Their ruin was but a wise provision of Him
                  who rides amid the thunder and directs the lightning for his nomad children. The
                  track of the whirlwind and the red bolts was their woodyard. The elements had torn
                  apart and broke into fragments the giant trunks that they had not the tools to
                  cope with. The sun and the wind would dry, and their hands would gather them as
                  they had need for their little fires. Then kind mother Nature that abhors
                  barreness as much as she does a vacuum, would cause the green mould to gather, the
                  little blue-eyed violets to bloom, the trailing vines to creep over the ruins, and
                  the sprouting second growth to cover with beauty the work of her hour of wrath.
                  But a few years and other trees would appear where the dust of the old had fed the
                  earth, little birds sing and busy squirrels gather their winter stores from amid
                  the branches, and no living eye be able to trace the wreck there had been
                  before.
               Up with the earliest bird, the trapper and the Indian could hardly control their
                  impatience long enough to partake of the morning meal. But years of experience had
                  taught them the lesson that it was best to eat while they had the means and
                  opportunity. Such a conjunction of circumstances might not occur for hours—even
                  days. A thousand things in such roving lives as they led, and especially when
                  engaged as they led, and especially when engaged as they now were, might prevent
                  the satisfying of hunger. Best, therefore, was it for them to keep up their
                  strength, and though they lingered not over their meal, yet there was no undue
                  haste. That finished, they literally girded up their loins (for the sashes around
                  them were tightly drawn, and would be more so from time to time if they were
                  forced to fast) and took the forward trail.
               
               Everywhere around them were plainly to be seen the marks of the storm, and as the
                  old trapper stepped upon an open spot—the bald top of the hill, he paused and
                  leaned upon his long rifle thoughtfully. A moment after he gave vent to the
                  reverential emotions that underlaid his character and in a great measure
                  controlled his actions, except when intense excitement made him forgetful for a
                  time.
               "Ther Good Lord," he said, "has bin erbroad in his wrath. Look, chief," and he
                  pointed to rived and twisted trunks, the huge rocks torn from their resting places
                  and hurled into the valleys, and the furrows ploughed by the water down the faces
                  of the hills. "Yes, ther Good Lord has bin erbroad in His wrath and ther forests
                  and ther hills have bowed unto Him. Ah! how very leetle is man when ther tempest
                  is erwake. How feeble am his arm and how cowardly am his heart. He twists ther
                  great trees inter wisps like straws, and crushes the hard rocks into powder. He
                  leaveth his track upon ther land, and ther waves of ther lake bile inter foam
                  berneath ther wind from his wings as he passes erlong."
               Not either polite or correct his words, but they were the outpourings of a true
                  heart, and never more fervent ones were ever uttered by the most eloquent lips
                  beneath the groined and fretted roof of the money builded sanctuary. But he was
                  not alone in his feelings of reverence and awe. The "Poor Indian," also, "saw God
                  in clouds and heard Him in the wind," long before the pale faced and blue eyed
                  Saxon came from trans-Atlantic climes. Yes, in fanciful imagery they talked of
                  such things, for 
                     
                        "Poesy, agrestic maiden,
                        Wild-eyed, black haired, haunted here,
                        Singing of the Indian Arden,
                        Southwest of this mortal sphere;
                        Singing of the good Great Spirit,
                        Who is in and over all;
                        Singing sweetly every river,
                        Mountain, wood and waterfall."
                     
                  
               
               "The Manitou was angry with his children," replied the chief, as his eye ran
                  rapidly over the footprints of the storm. "Now he smiles again, and the black
                  shadow has passed from his face."
               "And why would'nt he be angry when His arth was stained with human blood, and
                  black wolves whar er roamin round devourin' innocent lambs? I hearn ther
                  misernaries tell before now at ther Soo erbout ther world havin bin covered with
                  water, and I only wonder ther flood don't come ergin and sweep all ther people
                  erway, they er gettin so bad."
               Whatever the opinion of the Indian might have been upon the subject—probably he
                  had no very clear one—he failed to express it. He waited patiently until the fire
                  in the eyes of the old trapper had somewhat faded, and then gently reminded him of
                  the necessity of speed when upon a following trail.
               "Yer right, Thunder, right," was the reply as he threw his rifle upon his shoulder
                  after having first carefully examined it to see that it had not suffered from
                  dampness. "We haint got no time ter loose, but I allers feel kinder sad-like when
                  I see ther old trees fall. It reminds me that some day I must go like them."
               To one educated in the woods the reflection was very natural. All of his
                  comparisons were drawn from the scenes around him. It is the open volume of the
                  living God that his eye ever rests upon. The tree is a symbol of what an atom he
                  is, and he cannot but mournfully compare his end to its fall. Its crash is the
                  iron knell that enters his soul. Like it, with its great arms crushed under it, he
                  soon shall lie a lifeless corpse upon the ground. Ah! there is something sublimely
                  beautiful in such thoughts, that we who pass our lives in cities know nothing
                  of.
               After the few moments thus given to looking up through Nature into Nature's God,
                  they pressed forward at a rapid pace. The long lopes that red man and trapper used
                  alike, soon made the two leagues dwindle into nothing.
               "Am that ther big copper rock?" asked the Beaver, as they came within sight of
                  it.
               "It was placed there by the Great Spirit."
               A careful examination satisfied them that the white man, Moncrief, had not been
                  there, and they returned to the spot where the White Dog had camped for two nights
                  after he had immured his victim. From signs that no other but trained eyes could
                  have discovered, they decided that but one had rested there, and that was an
                  Indian. But equally certain were they that his companion had come as far as that
                  point. What then could have become of him. Both eyes looked anxiously around for
                  some rude grave, and both at the same moment saw the opening to the cavern. The
                  heavy rain had washed away all the covering of dirt and apparently removed the
                  stones. At all events there was nothing to conceal the entrance.
               "Thar!" almost whispered the trapper, "thar is some kind of er devil's den whar er
                  murderer could hide away more'n er hundred, I reckon."
               "My brother is right."
               "You know the cave well, then?"
               "I have been in often."
               "What kind of a place mought it be?"
               "It is covered with the bones of warriors."
               "Ugh! Suppose he should have put Pitt in thar and erlive! Come, let's go and
                  see."
               "Is the Beaver a bat?"
               The trapper understood the hint, and assisted the chief to prepare torches. Then
                  they entered and fully explored it. They found the little match box that had
                  belonged to the missing man—his cap, and a portion of his dress, but that was all.
                  That he had been there was certain. Had the wolves fattened upon him? There was a
                  deep, well-like opening, that they had no means of fathoming. If his body was
                  there it must rest until both the land and the sea should give up its dead.
               Not a word was spoken by either tongue until they were again in the open air. The
                  horrors of the cavern had fallen upon them too heavily for speech.
               "Whar shall we go now, chief?" asked the trapper, when once more they stood in the
                  sunlight.
               "Home."
               "What for?"
               "Vengeance!" was the stern reply.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVI.
               ARISING FROM THE DEAD.
               THE chief, Ah-ne-mee-kee, and the Indian Shoon-ka-ska were right, when they
                  supposed that the wolf-like form the old trapper had fired at upon the little
                  island, was the witch woman, Sa-sa-nah. Right, also, were they all, in the opinion
                  that the shot had hit the mark, for the bullet pierced the shoulder of the old
                  woman, knocked her over, and for a time rendered her helpless. Had the trapper
                  followed his impulse of going after the skin, all would have been discovered, but
                  as he changed his mind it gave her time to recover from the shock, gather the
                  proper remedies, and soon cure the evil to a great degree.
               That accomplished, her crafty mind saw that she could increase the dread of her,
                  and materially augment her power by being reported dead for a time, and then
                  suddenly reappearing. So she removed a corpse from its birch coffin, put on it the
                  copper ornaments she had been accustomed to wear, wrapped it in her wolf skin
                  robes, and stole away like a shadow.
               Chance had thrown her in the way of Moncrief, when a band of mischievous boys were
                  hooting at her and driving her before them with sticks and stones. He had taken
                  her part—rebuked them, and saved her not only from insult but injury, and made
                  her, from that moment, a fast friend. There was another thing, also, that
                  contributed to this end. Shoon-ka-ska had seen her fired at, fall, and had not
                  come to her assistance, leaving her to die alone. That rankled in her breast, for
                  she knew she had laid herself open to severe punishment for stealing the poisoned
                  arrow from the lodge of the Medicine man, and for him to thus to desert her in the
                  hour of need was more than she would tamely submit to. Out of her desire for
                  revenge upon him, grew the love of the pale faced stranger, and she instantly
                  resolved to be to him as a guardian angel, knowing that the Indian would never
                  rest until he had accomplished his murder.
               By means of eaves dropping and gossiping with those who were boon companions, and
                  but little, if any, better than herself, she learned that the pale face would
                  attempt to visit the copper rock, accompanied only by the Indian Shoon-ka-ska.
                  Shrewdly guessing, from what had passed upon the island that the Swallow was
                  betrothed to Moncrief, she saw the
                  additional motive there would be for putting him out of the way. To have warned
                  either the trapper or the chief would have been to annul all the power she
                  intended to acquire by means of her reported death, and so having bound the few
                  that knew of her escape from the bullet of the trapper to secrecy, she turned her
                  back upon the encampment, plunged into the woods and started for a point she
                  thought they would be certain to pass.
               And long and faithfully she watched, only to be disappointed at last. By accident,
                  far more than intention, the White Dog had guided his companion around the
                  opposite side of the hill from where she lay concealed. Convinced that such must
                  be the case, Sa-sa-nah crept thither, and her very eyes flashed fire as she saw
                  the trail and knew by the marks that they were hours ahead, and that their swift
                  feet would travel at least with four-fold the rapidity her feeble ones could
                  possibly do. For a moment only, she thought of turning back. What was the pale
                  face to her? Did he not belong to the race that had ever been enemies of her own?
                  Was he not going to try and secure and take away that which had ever been sacred
                  by all the tribe?*
                   No, she would leave him to his fate. Then the recollection of his kindness
                  to her, an unknown old woman, softened her heart, and she followed on with all
                  possible dispatch.
               
                  
                  *"This, Fathers, is the property of no one man. It belongs alike to all of
                     us. It was put there by the Great Spirit and it is ours."—[Extract from
                     aspeech of an Ontonagon chief to Gov. Cass and Col. T. L. McKenney,
                     Commissioners, etc. A. D.1826.]
               
               Had they stopped to hunt along the way as was frequently done, the fable of the
                  hare and the tortoise might have been reënacted. But it was not so. The Indian had
                  his reasons for being in haste, and Moncrief was anxious to claim the rock by
                  virtue of being the first white discoverer. So, had the trail been a circular one,
                  they would have overtaken the old woman in the place of her overtaking them. With
                  tortoise-like perseverance she crawled along, keeping up her strength by
                  stimulating draughts, prepared from roots and herbs, until she reached the same
                  spot that had been so carefully examined by the trapper and the chief. Here, too,
                  she paused and pondered, but either more cunning or more thoughtful than they, she
                  did not idle her time and waste her strength by an investigation of the valley. On
                  the contrary, she looked at once at the trail, and though forced to rest, was up
                  and away long before the rising of the sun.
               Knowing the locality fully as well as Shoon-ka-ska, her movements became very slow
                  and careful as she reached the vicinity of the copper rock. It was the very
                  morning that he was preparing for departure. By the fast coming light she could
                  see him as he partook of his last meal, and so strong was vengeance in her heart,
                  that she would have shot him dead if she had only been possessed of the necessary
                  weapons. What had become of the pale face was a mystery. That he had come thus far
                  there was not a shadow of a doubt, and if murdered, it must have been very near
                  that spot. Yet, although consumed with impatience she could do nothing until the
                  departure of the Indian, and begrudging him every mouthful that he swallowed, in
                  fact, hoping that they would choke him, she kept her eyes fixed upon his every
                  movement. Well she knew that 
                     
                        "Time at last sets all things even—
                        And if we do but watch the hour,
                        There never yet was human power
                        Which could evade, if unforgiven,
                        The patient search and vigil long
                        Of him who treasures up a wrong."
                     
                  
               
               At length he hid the weapon and glass he had obtained from Moncrief, and took the
                  homeward trail. Still she stirred not for a long time. He might be watching as
                  well as she, and her fate would be sealed if she was found upon his trail. Noon
                  had come before she dared to stir. Then she ventured cautiously out, and all the
                  experience of years of trickery was brought to bear upon ascertaining what had
                  become of the pale face. She had tracked him without difficulty thus far, but here
                  was a sudden ending of the trail. She examined every possible spot for concealment
                  without avail, and though aware that there was a cave somewhere in that vicinity
                  could find no clue to it, and as fully deceived as she had ever deceived others,
                  she sat down to rest as the evening came on. Came on with the terrible storm of
                  which the trapper had so feelingly spoken.
               That storm was the accidental means of finding what she sought. The heavy rain
                  gathered on the top of the hill, rolled down in torrents and swept away all the
                  work of Shoon-ka-ska. It loosened the dirt around the heavy stones he had placed
                  as a door, and they fell below. The fitful flashes lighted up the cavern within
                  for a considerable distance, and to protect herself the drenched and chilly woman
                  crawled thither. That accomplished a fire was the next thing in her thoughts.
                  Flint and steel and punk she always carried with her, and it was brief work for
                  one accustomed to such tasks, to gather dead branches and resinous barks. True,
                  she had to go out again into the driving storm, but that was a matter of little
                  moment. She couldnot be more wet than she was already.
               The fuel prepared, it was soon kindled, and the red flames danced cheerily amid
                  the blackness, sending volumes of smoke aloft, driving the birds with ill-omened
                  screams from their nests. With a smile of comfort upon her face, seamed and
                  crossed with countless wrinkles, the old woman sat down, kept piling on the wood,
                  and rubbed her fingers in the blaze. Then she spread out her blanket to dry, and
                  prepared herself for slumber. Around her were scattered the bones of the dead, but
                  they had no terrors for her—they had been her companions for years. Two or three
                  that interfered with her resting easily, she flung carelessly aside. Had it been
                  otherwise, she would not have given herself that trouble. Familiarity with such
                  things had robbed them of all their terrors, and without the least scruple she
                  would have piled them upon the flames had it been in the slightest degree
                  requisite for her comfort.
               The heat aroused something besides the birds. There was one there nearly past the
                  boundaries of life—one numbed with cold, starving and helpless—one who had
                  breathed his latest prayer and to whom the angels were calling. An hour more, if
                  indeed he could have lived so long, and the lips of Pitt Moncrief would have
                  failed to utter the groan that now issued from them as the light and warmth
                  penetrated to the spot where he was lying.
               The woman heard it, started up and listened; but it was not repeated for a time
                  and she communed with herself:—
               "No bird makes a noise like that. It was not the cry of a beast except one in its
                  last agonies. The dry bones cannot talk! May the Manitou save me, it must
                  be——"
               Another groan. She seized a blazing brand from the fire and rushed wildly about
                  until she almost stumbled over the body of Moncrief, stretched upon the hard, damp
                  stones. With the exertion of far more strength than one could have thought
                  possible, she dragged him to the side of the fire, rubbed his hands and feet, and
                  forcing open the set jaws, poured into them a little of the stimulating drink that
                  had so sustained her. Food, too, she knew he must have, but how to procure any
                  that would be suitable to his condition, would have been a puzzle to almost any
                  one, especially when the storm was raging so violently without. The young of bats
                  and owls might have been had in plenty. The simple reaching out of the hand, or at
                  most the throwing of a stick or stone at the nests above would have secured them.
                  In a state of hunger she would not have hesitated to have eaten them, but she knew
                  that the stomach of the pale face would revolt against them if well, and must be
                  far more delicate now. Another and yet another draught of her favorite beverage
                  given, and she drew ready-made snares from her pouch, and defying wind and rain,
                  went forth to set them. The same kind Providence that had thus far watched over
                  the poor sufferer, soon guided a young rabbit into one of them, and before its
                  little heart had done palpitating from fright, she had seized it, carried it in
                  triumph to the cave, dressed it, and was squeezing the warm blood from the half
                  cooked flesh into the now more easily opened mouth.
               But nature never suddenly reacts after so long prostration. Strength can only be
                  gained by time and careful nursing, and it was near midnight before the pale face
                  could be said to be fairly out of the hands of death. Slowly, very slowly she had
                  fed him. Slowly, but constantly, keeping up the friction of the extremities
                  without intermission. Then as the stars began to wink dreamingly, and the dawn was
                  stepping forth grey hooded from the
                  clouds she saw that he was able to sit up and even whisper lowly.
               "Don't talk, my son," she said kindly, "wait until you get stronger. Do you think
                  you will soon be able to walk a little way at a time? No, you are not strong
                  enough."
               "What for?" he asked faintly.
               "Have you forgotten Shoon-ka-ska?"
               "No. Where is he?"
               "Gone, but he might return at any moment."
               "Is that the reason why you want me to go?"
               "Yes. If he should come back he would kill us both."
               "Let me try."
               She assisted him to rise and stand upon his feet. They felt like mountains, the
                  blood had remained so long stagnant. Like a little child learning to walk he
                  tottered and would have fallen, had she not caught him and gently eased him to the
                  floor again.
               "No, I cannot walk. At least not yet. Sit down and tell me how you found me. It
                  seems an age since I first was left alone in the darkness. O! it was
                  horrible!"
               "Not now. Some other time. We must leave the cave and hide away somewhere until
                  you get your strength. Then will I tell you all. But if the White Dog should
                  return, then—"
               "Give me my rifle and I'll—O! I remember now, although my brain is yet whirling.
                  Indeed I have been very near to death."
               "The white winged Manitou of life and the black one of the grave, fought long and
                  hard for the soul of the pale face. Had not the Good Spirit guided the moccasins
                  of Sa-sa-nah hither, the battle would soon have been ended. He sent the floods to
                  open the door and the bright lightning to show her the way."
               "Then I was walled in?"
               "As cunningly and as strongly as the hand of man could do it;" and she explained
                  briefly how the waters had washed away the earth and torn the stones from their
                  resting places.
               "It is as I thought. Tell me of the trapper. Where is he?"
               "Gone up the lake."
               "And the chief?"
               "At home waiting for the return of the Beaver."
               "And the Swallow."
               First though she was in his thoughts and heart, yet she had been the last
                  questioned of. His love and modesty kept him from uttering her name before a
                  stranger until forced to do so.
               "Mourning for the pale face. If he should not return soon her mother will force
                  her to wed Shoon-ka-ska."
               "Great heaven! She dare not."
               "As sure as the sun rises she will."
               "Give me another drink."
               The simple thought of the Swallow—the one he loved and who loved him so well,
                  being torn from him and compelled to be the wife of him who had trapped him to
                  death, forced the hot blood to run through his veins with a swifter current than
                  anything else could have done. It was the triumph of mind over matter. Although
                  the new born energy might be short lived, yet it assisted materially in carrying
                  out the plans of the old squaw, and almost without her help he dragged himself to
                  the mouth of his prison house and looked once more at the glorious light of the
                  sun and breathed the sweet, pure air.
               "This way, my son."
               Compelling him to lean upon her shoulder and furnishing him with a stout staff,
                  she piloted the way around the foot of the hill, until they were completely out of
                  sight of any one on the other side. Then she bade him sit down and rest him in a
                  clump of bushes and returned and covered up, or otherwise completely obliterated,
                  their footprints.
               There was but little use in giving the advice she had, for if his life had been
                  the stake, his limbs would have carried him no farther. Yet short as was the
                  distance, it would have been far better if they had failed of support before, for
                  scarcely had they disappeared before the old trapper and the chief were coming
                  down the hill in plain view of the opening to the cave. One little twentieth of an
                  hour only separated him from those who would have given their heart's blood to
                  have saved him from any farther suffering, and had travelled fast and far to
                  prevent, if possible, any danger coming to him. In this as in the great majority
                  of the affairs of life how fully is proved the value of minutes.
               Yet he was with one who would take care of him as far as her limited means would
                  permit. She might not be able to save him by rifle or knife, but the cunning of
                  the fox is often of more avail than the courage of the lion, and perchance he
                  would be the safest in her hands until his strength had returned, and his mind
                  resumed its normal condition.
               Anxious to be as far as possible away from the scene of his late suffering, and at
                  the same time lessen the distance between him and the object of his affections,
                  Moncrief struggled on during the day as far as was possible, or rather as far as
                  the Indian woman would permit him to go. The miles they accomplished were very
                  few, but had his footsteps kept pace with his desire, the wigwams of the Ojibwas
                  would have found him in their midst long before the going down of the sun. As it
                  was they rested on the bank of a little tributary of a river that debouched its
                  waters into the lake, not many miles to the southward of the Michipicoten.
                  Ordinarily, except during the spring and fall freshets, one might have crossed it
                  dry shod. Now it was swollen so that a deeply laden canoe would easily have
                  floated.
               On its bank and protected from sight, the old squaw erected a little shelter and
                  floored it with green branches and soft grass, so as to make it comfortable.
                  Willingly, for the labor of the day had been intense to him, Moncrief threw
                  himself down, and even while his guide and nurse was preparing supper, and
                  steeping some febrifugal plants he fell asleep. But it was far from being a
                  healthy slumber, and on waking, his first thought was of the little case of
                  medicine he was accustomed to carry with him, and great was his sorrow when he
                  found that it was gone. To the skill of the squaw, therefore, he must trust
                  entirely. Well, however, he knew that his journeying was done for a time. He had
                  gone far beyond his strength, and nature was revenging herself for being
                  abused.
               "I can go no farther," he said sadly, as Sa-sa-nah brought him the herb tea, and
                  compelled him to swallow it, hot and bitter as it was.
               "You will be better to-morrow," she replied consolingly.
               "Very doubtful."
               "The Great Spirit has not brought you thus far to allow you to die in the
                  woods."
               "But I cannot walk. O! if we had a canoe."
               There was something like a smile for a single instant upon the face of his
                  attendant, and a quick lighting up of the eye, but she made no reply. Very soon
                  she brought him more tea, and a very minute quantity of some (to him) strange kind
                  of soup, and after he had eaten and drank, she covered him up and closely tucked
                  him in her blanket, builded a fire so that it would reflect upon him and left him,
                  to pass through the great cure-all of the red man—sweating. Understanding her
                  object and that the latest draughts he had swallowed were a decoction of the plant
                  usually known as "boneset or thoroughwort" (Enpatorium) he remained as passive as possible, sleeping at
                  intervals, and rising refreshed and greatly releived from pain.
               As for the squaw, she slept not. During every moment of the night, she was busy
                  constructing a raft, and as soon as he was ready in the morning, she assisted him
                  on board, screened him with thick branches, and taking her place at the stern,
                  guided the little structure, with the swift current for a propelling power. The
                  second morning (for they had travelled as well during the dark as the light hours)
                  brought them in view of the lake. Here she gained the shore, cut the bark lashing
                  of her rude vessel, and allowed the logs to drift out.
               "Where are we going now?" asked Moncrief, astonished at the wonderful sagacity
                  that made her destroy the means of their sailing so far, for fear some eye would
                  rest upon it and be curious to learn for what purpose it had been constructed.
               "Where no one would ever think of seeking for you, even if they knew you were
                  alive. Follow me."
               By sigus only known to herself, she guided him into the middle of a gigantic
                  wood-fall, until she came (after creeping for many yards) to where a half a dozen huge trees had
                  lodged in falling. These had remained living, (for the roots were only partially
                  torn up) and were covered not only with their own verdure but parasite vines,
                  forming underneath a wigwam sufficiently large to have sheltered half of the
                  branch of the tribe to which she belonged. It was evident that it was not her
                  first visit there, for everything to make one confortable was at hand. In fact it
                  was very near the cave to which she had taken the White Dog.
               "In the name of goodness," asked Moncrief, throwing himself upon a pile of skins
                  to which she pointed, "how did you find this place. A man might live here years
                  without being discovered."
               Pleased by his opinion, she showed him where a little, cool spring trickled along
                  underground, concealed only by a stone, and a cache, where a store of provisions was hid.
               "It is a charming place for a summer resort," he continued, "if only thatched, so
                  that the rain would not come in."
               "It is," was the curt answer.
               "But in the winter time you would freeze without fire."
               Again her explanation was by actions. She walked to the largest of the trees that
                  framed the enclosure, and carefully removing the bark from the inner side, showed
                  him that it was hollow, and had before been used as a chimney.
               "I understand. It is hollow to the top. But the smoke? Would that not be
                  seen?"
               "Dry wood makes a thin smoke. It is soon lost in the air. The eye cannot discover
                  it. The red man is too cunning to use any other. But rest now. As soon as I have
                  prepared food and drink, I must take the trail again."
               "And I?"
               "Must remain until I come back."
               "When will that be?"
               "Two suns."
               "Two days! Where are you going?"
               "You will learn when I come back."
               "And I must not venture from here?"
               "Are you afraid to stay?"
               "No."
               "The beasts may howl around in the night time, but none can get within, after the
                  door is closed," and she again showed him how Indian cunning had aided nature in
                  making the place safe.
               "I care nothing about them. I have never been afraid yet of anything in the woods,
                  except serpents."
               She looked at him a moment, as if astonished that a man should be afraid of the
                  things she toyed with, and then replied:—
               "They will keep farther away from here than they would from a circle of fire."
               "I do not understand why."
               "Do you not see that I have planted ash saplings thickly around?"
               "Well?"
               "No snake was ever yet seen where one grew."
               The trapper, indeed any backwoodsman, could have explained to him that her words
                  were true. Could have told him that they had often enclosed a serpent in the
                  leaves of the ash, leaving but one outlet, where they builded a fire, and that it
                  had crawled through the flames! The fact is too well known to admit of argument,
                  and hunters stuff their moccasins full of the leaves when in a dangerous
                  locality—even more, they carry those of a peculiar species with them, to cure the
                  bite. But while the white man doubted it, he had no inclination to say ought
                  against it. His mind was filled with matters of far more importance.
               "I am to remain here until you come back?" he asked again.
               "Yes. Rest, sleep and drink of this tea. It will drive away fever and take all the
                  pains from your bones."
               "I will not forget. Are you going where my friends are?"
               "I am going where the Great Spirit leads," was the anything but explanatory
                  answer, and after a few more instructions she crept outside and disappeared.
               Very long seemed the hours to Moncrief, although he knew that he was doing the
                  best possible thing for his recovery. But he attended to her advice and strove to
                  kill time by fanciful dreamings of how happy he would yet be with the Indian
                  girl.
               And thus the two days dragged themselves along, and the third morning came when he
                  was aroused from his slumbers by some one knocking at the door of his wild wood
                  home, and a voice calling his name. He was very glad to have even the
                  companionship of the old squaw, and hastened to admit her.
               "I am glad you have come. I was very lonely," he began, but looking more closely
                  he exclaimed, "Thank heaven," and folded the intruder to his heart, covering her
                  lips with kisses.
               It was not the old squaw, but the Swallow!
            
            
               CHAPTER XVII.
               COUNTERFEIT LOVE.
               ALTHOUGH the Swallow had appointed no particular place to meet Shoon-ka-ska, she
                  had no fears but that he would be upon the watch, and so as soon as she had got
                  out of sight of the encampment, turned at once into the bushes and began singing
                  one of the familiar love songs of the nation. Reaching a point not too far distant
                  from the wigwam to be heard in case he attempted any violence, she sat down and
                  waited his coming, but with her heart filled with anything but affection for him.
                  In truth her mind was preoccupied with thoughts of the pale face. Intent upon
                  that, she failed to notice a pair of fiery eyes that were watching her from the
                  underbrush. All the rest of the form was hidden. The White Dog fancied and rightly
                  that this would be the spot her mother would choose for a meeting, and hours
                  before had prepared himself to watch her, hoping to learn something that might be
                  of use to him.
               In that he was mistaken. Save the love song she had trilled while on her way
                  thither, no word passed her lips; and though her fingers toyed with the ring that
                  was hidden beneath her dress, it was never drawn forth to the light and pressed to
                  her lips, as it had been hundreds of times when alone or when the darkness
                  rendered it safe for her to do so. That had been her object when her fingers first
                  sought its warm resting place, and she had almost withdrawn it when she
                  recollected that she might not be without a watcher, and she contented herself
                  with pressing it more closely to her heart, slipping her finger within the golden
                  circle and breathing a prayer for him who had placed it there.
               Tired of playing the spy without any hope of profit, the Indian at length threw
                  aside his coverings and sprang up directly in front of the girl
               "The Swallow did not expect to see me here,' he said. 'She was not thinking of
                  me"
               "Of course I was not," she replied. "How should I? I thought you was far away with
                  the pale face."
               "I have just returned."
               "Where is he?"
               "Gone."
               To use a familiar expression, she was determined to "throw dust in his eyes," and
                  so choked down her feelings and replied:—
               "It is well."
               "Then you are glad that he has gone? I thought you loved him, and had promised to
                  be his wife?"
               "So I fooled you as well as him!"
               "You have not me. I heard and saw all that passed upon the island the evening I
                  came to tell you of your mother's being there."
               "You thought I did not know it! Do you think that I am blind?"
               The Indian was puzzled by the coolness of the answer, and still more by the way
                  she flashed her eyes upon him. The difficulties and dangers he had braved to
                  possess her, had rendered her far more dear than he had ever conceived she could
                  be, and the love-light that shone upon her face had a strange power over him.
               "Then you do not love the pale face?" he asked.
               "How can you ask such a question?"
               "But you promised to be his wife?"
               "I could not get away else. You saw that I often tried to do so."
               "Yes—but—"
               "You had forgotten what reasons my father, mother and I have, for hating all his
                  race."
               "Your sister loved one, and why might not you?"
               
               "Because she did so love and was betrayed, is the reason why I hate them!"
               "Is your tongue travelling the trail of truth?" he asked, fixing his eyes upon her
                  face as if he would follow the subtle workings of the brain.
               "As the crow flies," she answered, meeting his gaze with the most wonderful
                  fortitude.
               "Why then did you let him take you in his arms and kiss you?"
               "Why does the warrior walk backwards when he is upon a dangerous trail?"
               "To deceive the enemy."
               "And may not a woman play as cunningly? If she would leave a blind trail may she
                  not double upon it like a hare? Shoon-ka-ska has not studied her heart. His ways
                  have been those of the eagle, and not of the dove."
               "To whose wigwam will the moccasins of Shaw-Shaw be turned?"
               "She has none but that of her father."
               "And if he should be called to the spirit land?"
               "She will have to live alone like old Sa-sa-nah."
               "Sa-sa-nah! What do you know of her?" he asked in alarm, fearful that he had been
                  mistaken in supposing her dead, and that she had revealed their secrets.
               "My father and—" She had nearly betrayed herself by adding "the trapper" whom she
                  had said (when playing the part of her mother) had not returned from up the lake.
                  "My father saw her lying dead among the dead upon the island.
               It was his his turn to appear ignorant, for how was he to know that she had been
                  shot.
               "Yes. Do you not remember that the Beaver fired at a wolf there?"
               "Was that Sa-sa-nah? O! I remember that I have seen her going around dressed in
                  skins."
               "It was her. She had been dead for days."
               The girl believed that she was telling the truth and so did the Indian. Neither
                  had any knowledge of her having escaped. Both the chief and the old trapper had
                  been deceived in the matter, and all the proof in the world other than that of
                  their own eye sight would not have convinced them to the contrary. But the Swallow
                  had little feeling upon the subject. It was an old woman gone—that was all. With
                  her companion it was a source of exceeding joy. Such testimony effectually quieted
                  the doubts that had sometimes floated through his mind. He was safe now, and all
                  that was connected with the poisoned arrow buried with her. The dead whispered no
                  secrets.
               "Are there not wigwams open for the Swallow," he asked, continuing the
                  conversation from the point where it had been broken off.
               "She has not looked."
               "Is there no heart empty among the braves of the Ojibwas?"
               "How should she know?"
               "Has she thought of no one?"
               "No. Whose?"
               Had she been a trained coquette she could not have used her eyes with more effect.
                  Their soft light appeared intensified—to possess a magnetic power. They drew him
                  to a seat by her side and chained him there. They fettered the tongue that had
                  never faltered before—they made tremulous the nerves that had been like iron.
                  Strange how a simple girl can make a strong man grow weak. A few weeks previous
                  she would have been unable to have coped with him, but now she loved and was a
                  woman!
               "Shaw-Shaw knows," he said falteringly, "that she is the most beautiful of all in
                  the tribe."
               "So the pale face told me," she answered with a puzzling smile.
               "Then for once his tongue was not forked. All the others are sun-burned compared
                  to her. They are like black clouds—she the one that the moon is shining
                  through."
               "The pale face said that there were many among the girls of his people that were
                  not as fair. Then his tongue did sometimes travel a trail that was not
                  crooked?"
               "It was to tempt the Swallow to her ruin. It was her that had forgotten the fate
                  of her sister."
               Alas! she had far too much reason to remember it, for it was ever rising between
                  her and the one she loved. It was the cause of her father's opposition—warning and
                  almost curse; it was the black thunder-freighted sky that might at any moment
                  vomit forth destroying lightnings. The rapt devotion of her heart could blind her
                  for a time, but there were moments of reflection when unbidden and unwelcome tears
                  would start as memory conjured up a spectral face—the face of a dead sister—dead
                  in all her youthful hope and beauty, by the treachery of a white man.
               "She never forgets the one that has gone," she replied, bowing her head until the
                  black hair hung like emblamatic willows over the tomb of departed hopes.
               "Then she will not believe the words of the pale face."
               "Has she said that she did? Shoon-ka-ska told her that his tongue was not crooked.
                  Has he looked at his heart?"
               "It is blacker than the starless sky. But we will not talk of him. Has no brave
                  laid gifts at the door of the wigwam of the Swallow?"
               "None."
               "Would she take them in if he did?"
               "How can she tell?"
               "Have the eyes of no one told her that she was dearer to him than even beaver
                  skins or scalps? and he endeavored to throw into his own the feeling he
                  described."
               "No one brave of the tribe," and she looked up at him as innocently as if she had
                  never known what love was. She told but the truth. No one of her nation had thus
                  talked to her, but she said nothing of one of another skin and bright eyes and
                  curling hair.
               "Then let the ear of the Swallow be open."
               "They are not closed. She can hear the sweet singing of the little birds and the
                  far away music of the waters."
               "Shoon-ka-ska loves her."
               "Loves me!"
               She knew that it was coming, and yet with all her preparation could not keep from
                  starting. It brought very vividly back to her mind the time when another had
                  whispered the same sweet words—and where was he now? For an instant she was
                  overcome by her conflicting feelings, but she felt the importance of retaining her
                  self-command—the necessity of learning if possible what had become of Moncrief;
                  and sweeping her long hair as if by accident over her eyes, so as to free them of
                  tears, continued:—
               "Shoon-ka-ska is making light of the heart of the Swallow."
               "No. The very day she went away with her father he was going to ask her to come to
                  his wigwam and be his wife."
               "She is very young."
               "Her mother has given her to him."
               "But she has never thought of him except as—as a friend."
               It was very hard for her to use the word when she meant "enemy."
               "He will be very kind and good to her."
               "She will think of him."
               "And will be his wife."
               "Let him fill his wigwam with furs and meat, and when the leaves fall come and ask
                  her again."
               Vainly he endeavored to obtain some more definite answer, though he had not
                  expected to receive one even so promising. He put his arms around her and
                  attempted to draw her closer to him, even to kiss her, but she started proudly
                  away.
               "My lips are for my husband," she said.
               "And you gave them freely to the pale face!"
               "To blind his eyes. Where has he gone?"
               "How should I know?"
               "You do know. Shoon-ka-ska would win the Swallow and yet would have
                  secrets from her. It is thus he would treat his wife?"
               "No, but—
               "If she cannot trust him now when could she?"
               "She said she did not care for the pale face?"
               "But she is a woman and likes to know what has become of one who pretended to love
                  her."
               "He will tell her when she is his wife."
               She changed her tactics in a moment. She threw one arm around his brawny neck,
                  rested her head upon his shoulder, and looked up so lovingly in his eyes that he
                  found it difficult to resist her entreaties.
               "Come," she whispered, "show the Swallow
                  low the scalp of the pale face. Let her have the soft hair to fringe in his
                  leggins. The daughter of a chief of the Ojibwas loves one whose tomahawk is red
                  with the blood of the pale face."
               "Shoon-ka-ska has no scalp."
               "Then he was a coward!" and she tore herself away from him and her black eyes
                  flashed with apparent scorn. "A coward!"
               "He is brave as any one in the tribe."
               "It is false. He pretends to love the Swallow, and yet let a pale face who had
                  insulted her—had come between them, escape without revenge. Hereafter he will not
                  be called Shoon-ka-ska but Shangodà-ya—coward!"
               "He has not escaped," answered the Indian, moodily.
               "Then where is he? Tell me that her he loves may be proud of him."
               "He is—dead!"
               "Dead!"
               With the greatest difficulty she repressed a cry of sorrow. Dead? The word blotted
                  out every star from her sky in an instant.
               "Dead—and—and you killed him?"
               "I did—Hist!"
               The cracking of the dry brush under the heavy step of a man, startled both in an
                  instant.
               "I will see the Swallow to-night," whispered the Indian, and darted into the
                  bushes. The girl, however, remained. She had nothing to fear. In an instant after
                  the old trapper was by her side.
               "So I have found yer at last," he said. "I have bin er looking arter yer fer er
                  long time fer I have got something ter tell yer."
               "Of the pale face?" she asked excitedly.
               "Yes, and I don't know how ter tell it nuther. But here haint ther place. Jest
                  come erlong with me."
               Leading the way they journeyed through the forest. The old man was satisfied that
                  she would follow him. The mention of Moncrief would be a charm sufficient for
                  that. Very much, consequently, was he surprised when he turned around and saw that
                  he was alone. Where and when she had disappeared he could not determine, and
                  grumbling aloud he returned to the wigwam of the chief.
               "Thar's no more dependence to be placed on one of these ar gals," he said, "than
                  thar is on er weasel. They jest slip through yer fingers and yer can't tell whar
                  they ar gone ter. Wal, I 'spose she'll turn up ergin all right."
               Had he but known that she had been suddenly arrested by the old witch woman, who
                  stepped from behind a tree, and that after a few whispered words she had fled with
                  her, he would have been still more puzzled. But so it was, and a few hours after
                  they were knocking at the door of the gigantic wigwam where Moncrief was
                  concealed.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               CONSPIRACY.
               FOR some reason, the old Medicine man of the tribe had taken a great dislike to
                  the trapper. His open expressions of disbelief of what he asserted to be the
                  revelations of the spirits, and his scoffing at what he fain would have had him
                  believed to be miraculous, had tended much to that end. Perhaps he was jealous of
                  his power, for the advice of the Beaver had many times been followed, although
                  directly opposite to his own. Of late this feeling had increased. The moment he
                  saw him in the capacity of a guide to the pale face—saw him going with them, and
                  showing the spots where copper was to be found, he became an inveterate enemy, and
                  was waiting impatiently for some means to work his ruin.
               This came far sooner than he expected. When the White Dog had stolen away into the
                  bushes, he saw the trapper arrive and the Swallow go with him. Farther than that,
                  he knew nothing. He had failed to follow to the point where the old squaw lured
                  her away. Satisfied that she would return with the evening, he waited. Waited and
                  watched until he at length fell asleep, to be awakened by some one stumbling over
                  him, and starting to his feet he found himself face to face with the Medicine.
                  From him he learned that the Swallow had been missing since morning, and the
                  entire encampment was in a state of alarm on account thereof.
               "What does the Beaver say?" asked the White Dog, prompted by the same black devil
                  that heretofore swayed his actions.
               "He does not know where she has gone."
               "Pretends he don't."
               "Pretends? What does my son mean?"
               "That he does know. He has carried her off to join her pale faced lover."
               "How do you know?"
               "I saw them together in the forest this morning."
               "And she has not been seen since? It looks very dark."
               "The Beaver has even laughed at the Medicine."
               "And the young pale face pretended to be one."
               Here was ample data from which to work, and the White Dog was not very slow in
                  convincing his companion that the old trapper was guilty of abduction. That point
                  settled, they talked long and earnestly, and the result was that they returned
                  together to the wigwams. But the White Dog would never have dared to do so had he
                  not learned that the chief was again very ill. The rapid march, the exposure and
                  fatigue he had endured while searching for Moncrief, had caused a return of the
                  illness of the island, and from which he had never fully recovered. As the
                  Medicine man stated, he was beyond the power of exercising any authority—in fact
                  helpless, and they could work without any fear of him.
               Boldly, therefore, Shoon-ka-ska walked to where the other chiefs and warriors were
                  assembled, took his place in the circle, smoked the proffered pipe and waited to
                  be questioned of his absence.
               "Where has our brother been?" was asked, after the usual silence, by the acting
                  head of the nation.
               "To pilot the pale face."
               "Did he show him the copper rock?"
               "Is Shoon-ka-ska a fool?"
               "Where did he go?"
               "He wandered along the lake until a party of the pale faces came along. Then the
                  one he was with went with them."
               "It is well. Has he seen anything of the Swallow?"
               "He has."
               "Does he know where she is?"
               "He does."
               "The ears of his brother, are unlocked. Let him tell them."
               "The Beaver has stolen her."
               There was a visible emotion among the group at the answer, for the great majority
                  respected and looked up to the old man. The Indian pretended not to notice it, and
                  related briefly the meeting of the trapper and the girl, and hinted that she had
                  not been seen since, and consequently that he had carried her away.
               "What could he want of her?" was asked.
               "To take her to the pale Medicine?"
               "Could he not come after himself?"
               "Are my brothers blind as the bat? He pretended to go away and paid the Beaver to
                  bring her to him. Is it not as plain as the sun at noonday?"
               To them it did appear so. One pale face would of course assist another. Though the
                  trapper had been reared among them, had he not severed the tie and gone to live
                  with those of a white skin? What but treachery could they expect of a pale face?
                  Yes, it must be so, and willingly they assented to the proposal of the White Dog,
                  (seconded by the Medicine) to send for the Beaver and put him to the proof.
               The old man was seated by the side of the sick chief, and vainly trying to soothe
                  him, for his mind was wandering to the early days when he was accustomed to follow
                  the bloody trail of war. Fully occupied in this, he was startled when a messenger
                  came and demanded his instant presence at the council fire.
               "I can't go," was the bluff answer. "Don't yer see that I am tendin' on the
                  chief?"
               "The Beaver must go."
               "I tell you that I shan't do no sich er thing. Do you think that I am er heathen
                  and goin to let ther Thunder die?"
               This reluctance was remembered and used against him afterwards as a certain sign
                  of guilt.
               "Then the warriors will come after him."
               
               "What kin they want of me?"
               "He has ears and will hear."
               "Wal," he turned and addressed the wife of Ah-ne-mee-kee, "Wal, yer'll have ter
                  take keer of yer husband ther best yer kin ontil I come back ergin. I don't see
                  what ther fools kin be arter wantin."
               A true daughter of Eve was the mother of the Swallow, and as curious as the
                  trapper to learn what the unexpected summons could mean. The moment he and the
                  messenger was out of sight she called in a neighbor, and crept noiselessly to the
                  vicinity of the council of warriors. Shoon-ka-ska saw her, and not wishing to meet
                  the keen eye of the trapper until it was necessary to do so, stole to her side and
                  they conversed in guarded whispers. In her he knew he had a firm friend, and it
                  gave new courage to his heart to play the treacherous part he had undertaken.
               "What do you want of me?" asked the trapper, as he stalked without ceremony into
                  the midst of the circle, and looked savagely around. "It must be somethin' most
                  mighty important when yer take me erway from the side of the chief, and he jest as
                  sick as kin be."
               "Where is the Swallow?" was asked in reply.
               "Ther Swallow? How should I know? You had better ax her mother, or somebody that's
                  got something ter do with her."
               "The snows of many winters have lodged in the hair of the Beaver. His tongue
                  should have learned to travel as straight as the honey laden bee."
               "And so it does. I haint never om given ter tellin' lies, and I haint er goin ter
                  begin now. Ef yer want ter find out anything that I know, jest speak out plump and
                  plain. I never like ter have anybody er beating erround ther bush with me."
               "Where has the Beaver taken the daughter of Ah-ne-mee-kee?"
               "Taken her? Wal, that am er pooty question ter be axin. Taken ther Swaller? I
                  haint taken her no whar's."
               "Where is the pale Medercine?"
               "That's jest what I'd like ter know."
               "Did ther Beaver not take the Swallow to join him?"
               "I haint seed her or him neither."
               "Was he not in the company of the girl this morning."
               "Wal, come ter think of it I war, and now I remember too that I have heard that
                  she hadn't bin home all day. Yes, it am er fact that I saw her this very
                  mornin'."
               "Where did you take her to?"
               "No whar. She took herself away from me in ther most mysterious manner," and he
                  proceeded to relate seriatim all the incidents
                  of their meeting and parting. But he saw that he was not believed and added, "ef
                  any body has got er different story ter tell, he had better speak out, that's all
                  I've got ter say."
               "Both the Great Medercine and I saw them together and heard him coaxing her to go
                  away with him," said the White Dog, stepping boldly in front of the old man.
               "Liar!" and he raised his arm as if he would fell him to the ground. He saw,
                  however, the folly of such an outburst of temper, and calming himself,
                  continued:—"Here is one that kin tell all erbout ther pale Medercine, as you call
                  him. Jest ask him."
               "He is no more to us than the wind that blows through the tree tops. But if the
                  Beaver would know, he has gone away with his people."
               "I don't beleave er single word of it. My mind am this, and I haint erfeared ter
                  speak it out nuther. The White Dog has murdered him."
               "It matters not. He was an enemy of the Ojibwas. If he has gone to the spirit land
                  it is well. What has Shoon-ka-ska to say of the Beaver and the daughter of
                  Ah-ne-mee-kee?"
               "The years of the Great Medercine are many and he is wise. Shoon-ka-ska is young,"
                  and he withdrew with apparent modesty for the old trickster to speak.
               The joint production of the Medicine and the White Dog was a clever story, and
                  nothing was lost in the telling of it. By that account both had seen the trapper
                  and the girl together in the forest, had seen him take her in a canoe and paddle
                  rapidly and cautiously away, and that he had returned alone late in the
                  afternoon.
               "Wal, I whar out on ther lake this arternoon noon and didn't git back ontil nigh
                  erbout sundown, but I whar all erlone," said the trapper, as if talking to
                  himself.
               That was an admission little expected, and the Medicine somewhat enlarged upon his
                  theme. The telling was perfectly straight forward. There was not the slightest
                  hesitancy. Its effect to was increased by the mother of the missing girl. At a
                  sign from the White Dog she rushed forward and loudly demanded her child.
               "Ah-ne-mee-kee is dying," she screamed rather than uttered.
               "The pale face stole away one child. Now he has taken another. Give me, oh! give
                  me back my daughter," and she threw herself at the feet of the Beaver, and raised
                  her hands imploringly.
               "Silence!" was thundered from every tongue.
               To have a woman thus dare to obtrude upon the council was a thing almost unheard
                  of, and she was put out without an opportunity to utter another word. Both she and
                  the Indian who had arranged the episode, well knew that this would be the case,
                  but they knew, also, that her presence could not be without effect and having
                  gained their point were content to offer no resistance. Still the White Dog
                  riveted the feeling by adding in a sorrowful voice:—
               "The heart of the mother mourns for her lost child. She asks for justice. Her
                  husband is traveling the dark road that leads to the grave. She has no one to
                  speak for her now. Shall she ask in vain of her brothers for her daughter?"
               "Justice?" blurted out the trapper, unable longer to restrain his tongue.
                  "Justice? ef you had it you'd be er swingin' ter ther highest tree."
               "Does the Beaver deny still that he has stolen away the child of the red man?" was
                  asked.
               "Ter be sure I do. Every word that yer've heard has bin lies, except what I told
                  yer erbout seein' her in the timber, and erbout my bein' out in ther canoe. But I
                  whar erlone. remember."
               "If he speaks the truth he would have come willingly when he was sent for. Only
                  the guilty have to be forced."
               "So I would, ef it hadn't er bin fer their chief's bein' sick. That's what kept me
                  and nothin' else. Jest wait ontil ther chief gets better and see what he'll
                  say."
               "And give the young Medicine time to carry away the girl beyond the reach of the
                  tribe," craftily suggested Shoon-ka-ska.
               "My brother speaks well," replied the leading spirit of the council. "If the
                  Beaver would save his life he must bring back the Swallow."
               "So it's my life yer arter, am it?" answered the trapper, beginning to somewhat
                  understand the matter, and seeing that it was a conspiracy to get him out of the
                  way while Ah-ne-mee-kee was unable to assist him. "So yer want my blood? Wal, the
                  tree am old, and it don't matter very much when it falls, but look out it don't
                  crush some on yer when it does go down."
               It was no braggart boast, and they knew it. Although he was only armed with his
                  knife, yet one blow from his powerful arm would be certain death. This the White
                  Dog realized, and knowing that he would be the first victim to the righteous
                  vengeance of the trapper as well as to appear disinterested answered:—
               "The warriors of the Ojibwas thirst not for the blood of the Beaver. He has been
                  one of them. They love him. If he has forgotten that love in a stronger one for
                  the pale face, let him but bring back the Swallow and all will be forgotten and
                  forgiven."
               "I don't want ter talk ter any sich reptyles as ye are. You want ter git me out on
                  ther way, no matter how yer cover up yer tracks and I know it. I wont fergit ther
                  blind trail yer sent me on in er hurry."
               "The Beaver is angry," continued the crafty Indian, addressing those of his own
                  race. "When he is cool he will not talk thus."
               "I haint ergoin ter talk onymore onyhow. I've told yer all I know, and am ergoin
                  ter go back and take keer of ther chief, that's jest what I am. He's er
                  white-hearted Injun, and that's more than I kin say of most of yer.
               "The Beaver must stay," said the leader in words of authority.
               "Must!" replied the old man with a
                  scornful laugh. "Must?" Wal, I rayther like that, must? I jest like ter see onyone
                  that will ertempt ter stop my goin."
               A dozen of the bravest arose and stepped in front of him, but without even drawing
                  his knife he dashed them aside, and marched straight to the side of the sick man.
                  But like cowardly wolves they gathered noiselessly around the wigwam (opened for
                  air) and like the same cowardly beasts springing upon a wounded buffalo, they
                  threw themselves upon him, and by sheer weight bore him backwards, held him down
                  and pinioned him beyond the possibility of escape.
               "Who laughs now?" hissed the White Dog in his ears.
               "Go erway sarpent!" replied the old man, "you think you've got me tight now, but
                  my turn will come some day."
               "Let us take him away, brothers, he will disturb the chief."
               The suggestion was adopted and the prisoner lifted up and carried to the prison
                  wigwam, there to remain until his fate was determined upon. What that would be it
                  needed no prophet to foretell with such enemies around him as Shoon-ka-ska, the
                  Medicine and the mother of the Swallow, who in reality believed that he had stolen
                  her child, and taken her away to join her white lover.
               "Wal," communed the trapper with himself as soon as he had been thrown upon the
                  floor of the wigwam, the curtains been tightly drawn, and he left alone, "Wal, I
                  can't rightly see but one way that this ar thing ar ergoin' ter end and that will
                  be by killin' me. It haint dyin' that I am erfeard on, for I've bin face ter face
                  with it often and never so much as flinched, but what galls me is ter die for sich
                  er black-hearted rascal as that ar White Dog. Howsomever, ef I only knowed that
                  Pitt whar safely out'er his clutches, I'd be content. But I mustn't think erbout
                  dyin' jest yet. I must find out erbout ther boy, and ef he has bin murdered, as I
                  fear, I reckon I shall have er little job of revenge on my own hands. No, no, I've
                  bin in many er tight place before, and I haint ergoin' ter gin up now, ontil I am
                  obliged ter," and he settled into serious thought of some means of freedom.
               This was easy enough to dream of, but-very hard to be accomplished. He was bound
                  hand and foot, with all the cunning and strength of those long accustomed to such
                  business. The deer skin thongs would cut into the flesh if he exerted himself to
                  part them, but the iron fetters of the white man would not hold him more securely.
                  Even if it should be possible for him to gain the use of his limbs, of what would
                  it avail him? The lodge in which he was confined was in the centre of all the
                  others, and it was a full half mile to the nearest timber or water. There were
                  guards chosen for the express purpose of listening to his every movement without,
                  and the thousand and one eyes of the entire tribe would be upon the watch that he
                  did not escape. Turn which way he would, he could not see a single ray of hope,
                  and yet he never thought of giving way to despair.
               Denied a light, and without even the dim glimmer of moon or star piercing the
                  heavy skin and mat covering, he could not see if there was anything that would aid
                  him. It was an idle fancy that he might find a knife, hatchet or sharp edged
                  stone, he could turn to account. Idle, because he had no means of using them.
                  Still he stretched himself at full length upon the ground, and groped blindly
                  around with his fettered hands, almost holding his breath and listening between
                  every movement. But his search was in vain. A full hour was occupied in this
                  anything but a pleasant task, and then he sank down with a heavy sigh and resolved
                  to save his strength until morning.
               "Ef ther good Lord wills that I am ter die," he murmured, "I only hope that he
                  will fergive all my sins and take keer of Pitt. He's too young and to good ter
                  die." Then his thoughts changed and he continued:—"I do wonder what kin have
                  become of ther Swaller. I almost reckon that she's got some kind of er trail and
                  gone ter him. But ef that's ther case he must be erlive. I wish I whar sartin of
                  it. Ef she whar only here and ther chief well, he'd soon find out ther truth. But
                  I'm erfeared he's e'enermost got ter ther end of ther life trail, and who knows
                  but we may travel ther dark road tergether? Wal, I haint got no wife or child ter
                  mourn for me when I am gone and—Who are you?"
               The sudden flashing in of a fire light showed that the curtains had been opened,
                  and some one had entered.
               "A friend to the Beaver," was answered in a low and disguised voice.
               "What do yer want?"
               "Would the pale face save his life?"
               "Ter be sure I would. Any fool would do that. What do yer want ter know fer?"
               "Then tell me where the Swallow is, and I will untie you and guide you to a place
                  of safety."
               "Ef I were sartin of that I might—Whar ar all ther guards?"
               "I have bribed them to leave."
               "No body watching?"
               "Not a single eye. Tell me what I want to know, and you shall be free."
               "Come nearer. We mought erwaken some one ef we talked so loud. I want ter whisper
                  in yer ears."
               "What do you want to tell me?"
               "You seem like er kind-hearted sort of er man, and I want ter tell yer—"
               "Erbout the Swallow?"
               "Yes, erbout her and whar yer kin find er good lot of furs and traps and some
                  money, in case I should be killed. They'll be of no use ter me, and you mought as
                  well have them as any one. You know that I haint trapped so many years for
                  nothin', and that I haint had no one ter give em to except now and then er poor
                  old squaw."
               It was a tempting bait—he intended it should be—and he had the reputation of being
                  "well to do," for he had never squandered the money he had received for his
                  industry in either "fire water," or riotous living, as was the custom with the
                  great majority of those who followed his calling.
               The Indian caught at it greedily, and drawing near knelt down and prepared to
                  listen.
               "Come a little nearer," urged the old man.
               "I can hear."
               "You act jest as if yer whar erfeared, and me laying here tied hand and foot. Wal,
                  I kin holler it out so that ther hull tribe kin hear, and dervide ther spiles with
                  yer, ef that's what yer want."
               That it was not what he wanted was evident, for the visitor immediately crept
                  nearer and bent down so that his face almost touched that of the trapper. Whatever
                  had been his motive in coming, it was certain that avarice was then the passion
                  that had strongest sway over his heart.
               "Let the pale face speak, and softly as the wind that blows from the south in the
                  summer time," he whispered, forgetting for the moment to disguise his voice as he
                  had hitherto done.
               That was enough for the prisoner. He was convinced of the truth he had hitherto
                  but suspected, and reaching up he grasped the throat of the Indian and drew him
                  down to him. Though his wrists were tied, yet his hands were at liberty, and
                  retained their immense muscular power.
               "I know you, traitor! Thar haint no White Dog livin' that kin play that possum,
                  game with an old trapper more'n once, and now yer've got yer neck in er trap, all
                  yer've got ter der, is jest ter die as quietly as yer kin, and so—"
               The struggles of Shoon-ka-ska as he strove to tear himself away from the vice-like
                  grasp cut the speech of the old man short. Had he been free, the end of the Indian
                  would have been swift and sudden. As it was, the contest was unequal, and in a
                  moment he was flung back and the White Dog was kneeling upon his breast with his
                  knife raised in one hand, while the fingers of the other were tearing the short
                  hunting shirt from above his heart.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIX.
               STRANGE REVELATIONS.
               No one but lovers who had dreamed each other dead, and were thus suddenly brought
                  together, can realize the raptures of the Swallow and Pitt Moncrief on again
                  clasping each other to their heart, and feeling their lips burning with kisses. It
                  was a moment ment that amply repaid them
                  for all they had suffered—one that is more like our dreams of heaven than anything
                  else in the world.
               Beckoned to follow the old woman, even while she was journeying with the trapper,
                  (who was now suffering imprisonment, and with a death of torture in prospect) she
                  had wonderingly turned aside. Wonderingly and with an exclamation of horror upon
                  her lips, that was only checked by the whisper of the old squaw.
               "Sa-sa-nah no ghost. The fire weapon of the Beaver did not kill."
               "But he—my father, both saw you lying dead."
               "They thought they did. Come," and she rapidly drew her within the cover of the
                  bushes, and explained the reason of her coming.
               On their forced journey the Swallow had learned much of what her white lover had
                  suffered—much, and yet under the circumstances how little that appeared.
               Drawing her to a seat, Moncrief sought to calm her agitation, for she clung to
                  him, sobbing and looking anxiously around, as if even then they would be
                  separated.
               "You are safe here," he whispered, lavishing his kisses upon her upturned lips.
                  "Safe, my dear Swallow, and what makes you tremble so?"
               "I was thinking of Shoon-ka-ska," she replied with trembling accents.
               "Where is he?"
               "I don't know. Prowling about the camp like a wolf."
               "Two can play at that game," growled the old woman, who was busy preparing some
                  food.
               Her words were either unheard or unnoticed, for Moncrief continued:—
               "It is a terrible account he will have to settle with me when we meet again."
               "Don't go near him! Oh! don't go near him. He will kill you—kill you!"
               "Little fear of that, now I know him. Besides, the trapper will be upon the
                  watch."
               "And so must I," again growled the old squaw, who was evidently de trop, as all third parties are with lovers.
               "But you do not know—know what a bad, black heart he has," still urged the girl,
                  her fears for Moncrief being the one absorbing passion of her heart.
               "I know enough, and shall go boldly into the encampment and charge him with his
                  treachery before all the tribe."
               "It will do no good. You are a pale face."
               "But your father will not dare to deny me justice?"
               "My father—"
               The ever fatal advice and warning he had at the outset given her, and his
                  exclamation when she had confessed her love, arose before her like a mountain.
               "Why do you stop?"
               "My father—"
               "Must and shall consent to our marriage and so protect us. To do that he must
                  punish him who would have torn us apart, and—"
               "Murdered you!"
               It was useless for him to attempt to convince her of the safety of the plan he
                  proposed to follow. She had but the one argument of woman—love, and that cared
                  little for reason. The old witch woman, however, settled the matter.
               "The pale face must not go," she said, "Sa-sa-nah must. He must stay until she
                  comes back. Then she can show him and the Swallow the trail of safety. Now both
                  would follow a trail as blind as that of the mole."
               "And you will go and return to us?" he asked, not sorry to be unmolested for a
                  time in his wooing.
               "I will go. Eat."
               She placed food before them, took her seat near, and satisfied herself as fully
                  and as quietly as if there were neither lovers or murderers in the world. That
                  done, and without answering a single question as to what her purpose was, she
                  stole softly away, leaving them to their enjoyment. With a frame that appeared to
                  be composed of steel springs and whalebone rather than of the elements of
                  humanity, she dashed along until she neared the encampment of the tribe. Then she
                  drew from a secret hiding place a disguise such as she had been accustomed to
                  wear, and robing herself in it, crept noiselessly forward.
               The natural avarice of her nature led her first to inspect the wigwam of
                  Shoon-ka-ska. To reach it she was passing very near to the one in which the old
                  trapper was confined, when hearing a strange noise she stopped and listened. Well
                  was it for the prisoner that she did so. In another moment the knife of the red
                  assassin would have been buried in his heart. She heard the voice of but one, and
                  yet instantly comprehending that something wrong was going on, seized a stone and
                  hurled it through the covering.
               Quick as thought all was silent as the grave, and a dark form crept swiftly away,
                  passing so near to the disguised and couchant woman, that she could have touched
                  him. She knew that he saw her as plainly as she did him, but she also knew that he
                  took her for the beast she had counterfeited, and had no time just then to bestow
                  even a passing kick upon a dog. And so she followed him at a safe distance, and
                  saw him enter the very wigwam she had at first designed searching.
               "Shoon-ka-ska would murder the Beaver," she muttered between her clenched teeth
                  and tightly compressed lips, "but what could he have done that he should be
                  confined in the prison wigwam?"
               This was a point that puzzled her far more than the fact that he had come so near
                  his death by the hands of the Indian. For the latter she could see reason enough,
                  but the former was something far beyond her powers of understanding. It was a
                  labyrinth to which she had not the slightest clue. From infancy he had been
                  protected by the entire tribe—in fact had been as one of them. Why then should
                  they, at this late day, turn against him? Honest as the sun she knew him to be,
                  and where was the chief, Ah-ne-mee-kee, with whom he had ever been hand and glove,
                  that he did not protect him? Thus one question rose upon another, difficult of
                  solution, and whatever she would learn must be done quickly.
               First she turned her attention to the prisoner.
               Creeping back to the wigwam where he was confined, she assumed the gait of and
                  snuffed around like a dog, even thrusting aside the covering and looking within.
                  With her eyes accustomed to the darkness she was soon able to determine that he
                  was securely bound. In this her ears as well as her eyes assisted her, for he was
                  talking to himself after his usual custom, when at all excited.
               "Ther good Lord be thanked for savin' my life from that bloody-hearted Injun, but
                  I can't see how it whar done. Somethin' came er crashin' through ther side of ther
                  wigwam jest as I whar er sayin' my last prayer. I wonder what it could have bin?
                  Thar whar no one keepin' guard without, that's fer sartin, er he wouldn't have
                  dared ter try and murder me. It's most mighty curious too that I should be here
                  for carryin off the Swaller, when I haint no more knowledge of her than er child
                  unborn. And ther chief, too, must be took sick jest when I wanted his help more'n
                  I ever did that of er mortal man. Hello! Wha's that ar er snuffin round? Er dorg,
                  as I live. Wal I never heard of any of them tryin ter eat up er live human, but
                  thar's no tellin' what they mought do, fer they ar more'n half starved all ther
                  blessed time. Er fool fer luck, er poor man fer children, and er Injun fer dorgs,
                  is er mighty true sayin', so fer as ther Injun am concerned anyhow."
               The old man paused, whistled and called without effect. The animal was deaf to all
                  persuasion.
               "I never saw er dorg before that I couldn't call jest when I had er mind ter. Git
                  out!" and he resumed his soliloquy.
               "I 'spect I shall have ter die onyhow, but it won't be ther fust innercent man
                  that has bin killed. Wal, ef I only knowed whar Pitt was, I'd be far more
                  contented than I am. Thar's that brute ergin! I hearn Pitt tellin' one night
                  erbout somebody, 'Sop I think he called him, who told a story, though that wharn't
                  ther name he gin'it, erbout er little mouse that bit off ther meshes of er net so
                  er great big lion crawled out and run away. I wish this ar dorg would do the same
                  by me; but no, no, luck's ergin me this time, and die I must, but it shall be like
                  er brave man and not er very bad one nuther;" and with this resolution and little
                  morsels of self praise, he relapsed again into a silence that that was soon
                  followed by heavy slumber.
               From him Sa-sa-nah had learned all that she wished to know, excepting something
                     more deffinate about the illness of
                  Ah-ne-mee-kee. To attempt anything farther might betray her before she was ready
                  to have it known that she was still an inhabitant of earth, and not of the land of
                  spirits. It was perfectly in her power to have freed the trapper, and had it not
                  been for the chance shot at her while creeping among the graves, would have done
                  so. That rankled far more in her heart than the bullet had done in her flesh. A
                  very little thing had made her the friend of Pitt Moncrief, and one almost as
                  small had made her the enemy of the trapper. Her mind was of too narrow a compass
                  to contain two generous emotions at the same time, although it would a dozen of
                  revenge.
               So the old man was left to his fate. She had and would save the young pale faced
                  Medicine, but the old catcher of beaver might suffer from torture, from knife,
                  hatchet and fire, and she would not raise even a finger to ease his sufferings.
                  Settling these things to her satisfaction, she hastened back again to the wigwam
                  in the track of the whirlwind, and surprised the lovers by her sudden
                  entrance.
               "O! Sa-sa-nah!" exclaimed the Swallow, springing from the arms of her lover, and
                  blushing far deeper than ever did the heart of a forest rose.
               "The Swallow has not missed her of the white locks," was the reply of the old
                  woman, with a sly laugh. "She has had no time to think of the one who saved the
                  life of the young Medicine."
               "Indeed, my good friend, we have talked much about you," said Moncrief, coming to
                  the rescue of the girl. "Come, sit down, rest and eat. Then you can tell us all
                  that we wish to know."
               The varied requests complied with, and what was of more pleasure than all the
                  rest, the offer of a well filled pipe, the squaw muffled herself in her blanket,
                  and awaited their questioning.
               "Did you see anything of the trapper?" asked Moncrief, taking the initiatory.
               "I didn't look for him," was the evasive answer.
               "Nor hear anything?"
               "I was among the wigwams at night. All were sleeping."
               "And the White Dog?"
               "Was in his wigwam."
               "Then he is back again?"
               "Did not the Swallow tell you?"
               "That he was near but not in their midst."
               "He is there now."
               "What is he doing?"
               "He was sleeping."
               "And the chief—the father of my darling?"
               "The sum of his life is very fast going down behind the western hills."
               "My father! Oh! may the Manitou save him. My father dying!" exclaimed the girl
                  with clasped hands and tearful eyes.
               "The fever fiends that were driven away by the young Medicine, have returned
                  again, and are clutching his heart with their icy fingers."
               "I feared that it would be so," answered Moncrief sadly, "and wish I could be with
                  him again. It might not yet be too late."
               "Let us go. O! let us go," answered the Swallow, forgetting in her earliest love
                  the later one that had blossomed, and was bearing ripe fruit in her heart.
               "Yes, let us go and at once," and the white man began to make preparations for
                  departure.
               "You could not save him. He is either in the spirit land or his moccasins are upon
                  the backward trail," replied the old squaw.
               "But we cannot remain here when he is ill."
               "Then you go alone. Listen to me. Pale face, for your kindness I have done that
                  which gold would not have tempted me to do. I have forgiven the injuries of your
                  race, and even brought you one of my own to gladden your heart when I should have
                  cursed you."
               "I never injured you."
               "Others—one at least of as white a skin, as soft curls and as bright eyes, did. It
                  is long, very long ago and,—but let me not think of it. It would turn the brain
                  that is far from being steady now. When I remember how he was my young love—how he
                  ran away and left me—how I followed him—how my child died—how—"
               "May the great Spirit have mercy! You are not, cannot be—" exclaimed the
                  Swallow.
               "I am your own—only sister!" and she clasped her hands over her ears,
                  as if to shut out all other sounds, and ran wildly out into the forest.
               Like two who had suddenly been struck dumb, the lovers sat and gazed after her for
                  a time. Then Moncrief took the icy hands of the Swallow within his own and
                  whispered:—
               "Darling, this must not part us."
               "My sister!" was the only whispered response.
               "And she has given you to me. It appears as if she was an instrument in the hand
                  of heaven to cement our love."
               "I know not. I cannot think."
               "And I must think for you," answered a deep voice, and turning their heads, they
                  saw standing before them, a woman who was a stranger.
               "Who are you, and what is your purpose?" demanded Pitt Moncrief fiercely, as he
                  threw a protecting arm around the Swallow.
               "The one who has saved your life, and will still continue to do so."
               "Sa-sa-nah?" asked both in a breath.
               "Yes, her, and yet not her. I have deceived you, as I have done my own father and
                  mother, the chiefs, and the tribe, for years. Sit down and listen."
               Her face had been washed from paint—her hair still glorious in its length, had
                  been released from beneath the cap of wolf skin—her form was unbowed, and her eyes
                  flashed with all the fire of a full score of years previously. All of disguise was
                  wanting."
               "When I left home," she continued, as soon as their exclamations of surprise had
                  ceased, "When I left home to follow my husband, for he was so in the eyes of the
                  Good Spirit, and found him not, I sat down within a great city with my dead baby
                  in my arms, and prayed that I, too, might go to the happy hunting grounds. But I
                  could not—did not die. What I suffered—what I did—how long I stayed, it matters
                  not. My heart longed for the green forest and the bright lake, and one night I
                  came within sight of the wigwams of my father. I dared not go farther. Old
                  Sa-sa-nah had been very kind to me, and I sought and found her. She was dying—did
                  die, but lived long enough to teach me many things. I closed her eyes and buried
                  her—painted myself to look like her—took her dress, and have lived her life."
               "Why did you not come back to father and me?" asked the Swallow, who had crept up
                  to her side and was gently pressing her hand.
               "It was my purpose to do so. In my disguise I stole to his wigwam and heard him
                  curse me—then I shut both loves out of my heart forever."
               "Still you have been very kind to me," said Pitt.
               "Have I?" was answered with a forced laugh—the habitual one of the witch
                  woman.
               "Certainly."
               "But I did not mean to be, I gave the poisoned arrow to Shoon-ka-ska, and told him
                  where he could find you. I used your love for the—for my sister, to make him angry
                  and jealous."
               "You?"
               "Yes, I; and yet I travelled miles upon miles afterwards, to save you."
               "You did? Explain."
               "I learned that you was a Medicine. I looked at you when you did me a kindness—I
                  heard your name—I knew that your father was also a Medicine—"
               "He was, and was—"
               "Very kind to me, and—and—my poor little baby," and she darted from the wigwam as
                  before.
               "May the Great Manitou be thanked," said the Swallow in an impressive whisper.
                  "Your father was kind to the—to my sister, and she has saved your life."
               "Yes," replied Moncrief, reverently, "yes, the hand of God was in it."
               "And in every thing!" responded his benefactor, entering at the moment again fully
                  disguised, and with her customary wild manner and assumed voice.
               Vain, however, were all their efforts to get her to renew the conversation or to
                  go home with them.
               
               "It is time to sleep," was her only answer, and wrapping herself fully in her
                  blanket, she turned her moccasins to the fire.
               "She has more than earned the right to rest," said Moncrief in a low voice.
               For a time they conversed, as who would not, upon the strange page in their
                  history that had been opened to them, and then the birds, had they looked from
                  their nests above, would have seen then, also, dreaming golden dreams, the arm of
                  the pale face around the Indian girl, and his breast her pillow.
            
            
               CHAPTER XX.
               LIFE AND DEATH.
               WITH the rising of the sun, the council fires of the Ojibwas was lighted again, a
                  strong post strongly driven into the vacant space in front of the prison wigwam,
                  and the old trapper aroused from his slumber, placed against it and firmly bound.
                  Then and there his doom was to be decided, and executed. Of what it would be, the
                  preparations told, without the mock ceremonies of pipe smoking, cabalistic
                  mummeries of the Medicine Man, inflammatory speeches of the White Dog, or wailing
                  of the false-hearted mother of the Swallow. One who was a stranger to the customs
                  of the Indians might have still falsely dreamed of hope. But the trapper knew
                  better, for though he had never taken a part in any such diabolical outrages upon
                  the name of justice, yet he had often been forced to be a witness of them in his
                  younger days. Yet even if he had dared to think that his long association with
                  them—his being a child of their adoption would procure him mercy, the blackened
                  faces would have instantly convinced him that such a thing was not to be.
               "Yer haint even goin' ter give me er chance fer life?" he exclaimed, after he had
                  fully nerved himself to bear whatever might come, and yet determined not to throw
                  away a single chance for life.
               "Let the Beaver tell where he has hidden the Swallow, and his red brothers will
                  listen to his words. Until then they can see him no more than they can the wind
                  that whispers in their ears," replied the Medicine.
               "I can't tell what I don't know."
               "The pale faces have ever wronged the daughters of the red man."
               "Ef yer mean that fer me, it's false."
               "So sings the cuckoo when it throws the little birds from the nest, and they
                  starve upon the ground."
               "Thar's no denyin' that I know what yer mean by that, fer I should lie ef I did.
                  Why don't yer speak up like men and say that I have not only wronged but murdered
                  her arterwards. That's what yer tryin' to insinuate onyhow."
               "The Beaver was alone with her in the forest, and—"
               "So I'd jest like ter be with you, and have my hands free fer erbout five
                  minutes."
               "That they will never be again. They are stained with the blood of a daughter of
                  the chief."
               To be thus openly charged not only with having committed a great wrong but to have
                  attempted to conceal it by murder, and that of one he loved so well as the
                  Swallow, struck far more deeply to the soul of the trapper than all the terrors of
                  death had done. It was not the punishment but the shame he feared, and for a
                  moment it crushed him beyond the power of speech. This was looked upon as a sign
                  of guilt, and the Medicine continued tauntingly:—
               "The Beaver has forgotten his cunning. His trail is as open and broad as that of a
                  pale man's fire canoe. The little boy hunters can find the way to where he has
                  builded his dam. Why does he not answer?"
               "Ahem!"
               "The red man loved him well, and now he has repaid them with wrong and
                  bloodshed."
               "You say so, but that don't make it."
               "And you have not denied it."
               "I did in the very beginnin' of ther matter, and have all erlong. But it haint no
                  manner of use, for ther long and short of it am, that yer detarmined ter kill me,
                  and all I kin say wont alter ther matter one grain."
               There was so much of truth in the charge, that for a moment they were as completely
                   silenced as he had been. But might with
                  them was right. They were thirsting for blood, and the devilish spirit of the
                  White Dog was urging them on, and the (supposed to be) childless mother ringing
                  her cries in their ears. The Medicine soon aroused himself and continued:—
               "It is ever thus that the pale faces whine like sick papooses when they see death
                  even afar off. No one but cowards talk thus."
               "Coward!" thundered the old man, straining at his bonds until the blood circled in
                  dark rings beneath them.
               "His red brothers had thought him brave. He is not. He is a squaw, and afraid to
                  die."
               "Me erfeared ter die? Me erfeared ter die! Thar isn't er livin soul ermong yer but
                  what knows ther words ar er lie. I thought when yer charged me with murder that
                  yer couldn't say anything worse, but this am ten times as bad. Er coward and
                  erfeared ter die!" and his iron frame trembled with the terrible anger that boiled
                  up from his heart, his hands were clenched and his eyes filled with tears.
               Call such a man anything but that name and you may be forgiven—that never. It is
                  to him more than even honor among business men—it is his entire stock in trade.
                  Every hour of his life is a continued disregard of danger. He wins his name for
                  bravery by hand to hand encounters with the wild beasts of the forest, prairie and
                  mountain, and the scarcely less savage Indian. He dares all things
                     alone. Very seldom has he any companion, and then only one. He is
                  brave to recklessness, and next to the deer and the buffalo, leaves behind him the
                  trail that civilization will follow, carve out new states, make the wilderness
                  like the rose, teach the mountain cones of Oregon to echo with the music of the
                  church going bell, and "Sacramento's golden gate to swing open to the song," of
                  thanksgiving and of prayer. What! call such men cowards? Why, 
                     
                        "They knew no dread of danger,
                        When rose the Indian's yell;
                        Right gallantly they struggled,
                        Right gallantly they fell;
                        From Alleghany's summit,
                        To the farthest western shore,
                        These brave men's bones are lying
                        Where they perished in their gore.
                        Their bones were left to whiten
                        The spot where they were slain,
                        And were ye now to seek them,
                        They would be sought in vain.
                        Their very names are dying,
                        Unconsecrate by fame,
                        In oblivion they slumber,
                        Our glory and our shame!"
                     
                  
               
               Ltttle, however, did the breast of the red man know of such feelings. To him the
                  white one was and ever will be, despite all treaties and annual
                  payments—simply enemies. With one accord they took up the cry of the Medicine, and
                  croaked like so many ravens:—
               "Coward! Shangodà-ya! Coward!"
               "Howl on yer bloody wolves!" answered the old trapper, "If yer think yer kin scare
                  me with yer screachin, just keep at it ontil yer tired, that's all."
               "The pale face is singing his death song."
               "Wal, it shant be er croakin one anyhow."
               The farce of a trial had been carried far enough to please even those who
                  pretended to shield themselves behind the scales of justice, and the cry for blood
                  was struggling upon their lips for utterance.
               "Once more," demanded the Medicine, as he filled the great calumet of the tribe
                  with tobacco and Ken-ne-ken-ick, preparatory to the last smoke before the doom was
                  spoken, "once more, will the Beaver tell us what he has done with the
                  Swallow?"
               "Nothing! So help me heaven, nothing," and his eyes were raised on high to that
                  heaven, from which help alone could come. In view of that other and better world
                  upon whose confines his feet were trembling, his anger dwindled into nothingness,
                  and natural awe and reverence took its place.
               This answer was deemed final. In solemn and ominous silence the chiefs seated
                  themselves in a circle around the fire, the huge pipe was passed from hand to
                  hand, clouds of smoke were blown from each pair of nostrils into the air, and then
                  the predetermined sentence was given:—
               "Death by the knife, the arrow, the tomahawk and the fire."
               Such a compilation of torture was enough to shake even the stoutest heart, and for
                  a moment that of the trapper trembled and grew faint. Well he knew what the words
                  imported, simple as they were. He had seen them tested before, and knew how little
                  it was in human nature to bear up even if one could have exclaimed with gallant
                  Sir Walter Raleigh, "this is a sharp
                  medicine, but a sure remedy for all evils."
               First the youths of the tribe would amuse themselves shooting with blunt headed
                  arrows and dull knives, so that no injury could be inflicted by their
                  inexperience. The object was not to hit, but to see how near they could come
                  without doing so, and with the very refinement of savage torture, all parts of the
                  victim were bound beyond the possibility of moving, except the head. That was left
                  free so as to tell whether he flinched or not, as the weapons were shot or hurled
                  in close proximity. Boasted civilization has never yet invented a more complete
                  test of courage than this. To keep the head from the slightest quivering when an
                  ill directed arrow or knife would pierce the eye, requires nerves of iron and a
                  heart of adamant. There is nothing amid the clashing of steel, the rattling of
                  musketry and the thunder of cannon that can compare with it.
               Towering above all stood the trapper, with his broad shoulders thrown backwards,
                  and his deep chest forward like a bulwark. His long, muscular arms, were pinioned
                  to his sides. His head was uncovered, and the hair of "silvered sable," blown back
                  save a few locks that hung down and mingled with his beard. His lips were slightly
                  compressed; his eyes more sparkling and black than usual even under the most
                  intense excitement, and his entire appearance like one who might be slaughtered
                  like an ox in the shambles, but without a single groan escaping from his lips.
               True, both beart and pulse beat more rapidly than they had ever done before. He
                  would not have been human had it been otherwise—a statue and not a man. True it
                  was, also, that his ear was strangely alive to every sound, and his eye strained
                  to the utmost watching for relief that he could have no hope of, save from
                  heaven.
               A touch of scorn now and then curled his lips as some shot flew very wide of the
                  mark, and an exclamation of disgust escaped him.
               "Why don't yer set yer old and blind squaws ter throwin' things? Er bat could see
                  sich er big mark as I am in ther brightest sunshine thar ever was. Better let me
                  run ther gauntlet, and have ther little papooses slap at me with their little
                  hands!"
               There could be no more bitter taunt to an Indian than this, and they felt it to
                  the very core. A dozen hands grasped knife and tomahawk, and it required all the
                  efforts of the Medicine man to still the tumult and save his life from instant
                  vengeance. But there was another outcry that was not so easily quieted. An hundred
                  voices clamored for the ordeal of the gauntlet. This was particularly the case
                  with the young men, boys and old women, who were excluded from taking part in the
                  other tortures. There each would have an opportunity to wound him in some manner,
                  as he ran through the double line.
               The old trapper knew that he would arouse such a feeling when he cunningly threw
                  out the suggestion. He knew, also, that once free, his immense strength would
                  enable him to burst through as easily as the moose tosses the wolf from his way,
                  with his mighty horns, when they would bar his passage, drive him over a precipice
                  and feed, free from danger, on his mangled remains.
               But others were aware of the same thing, though the lesser lights had not
                  experience or craft enough to look so far forward, yet the elders and the Medicine
                  man had, and they forced silence. The "ignoble rabble" driven back grumbling and
                  discontented, the order for the warriors to take the place of the youngsters was
                  given, and the actual torture began.
               Knives and hatchets were showered thick as hail around, many cutting the firm
                  flesh and leaving terrible wounds. Not deep enough to bring death, save by the
                  constant leakage of blood, but yet rapidly wasting alike to the strength and
                  courage.
               "Fire away!" shouted the old man, falling into the custom of his tormentors, when
                  placed in such a situation and talking braggingly, although the strain upon his
                  nerves was terrible, and the effort to keep his head from involuntary motion was
                  swelling his neck cords almost beyond the power of endurance. "Fire away! Ef I
                  couldn't shoot straiter than that when I whar ten years old, I'd have sold myself
                  for a coon skin, taken in the summer time. Fire away, and then go and tell yer
                  squaws thar's er man stood before yer bigger nor er ox, and yer couldn't help
                  hittin' him. Better let ther boys take yer place ergin. They kin shoot straighter
                  nor any of yer!"
               The taunting speech was near his death knell. Outraged beyond measure, and still
                  fearful that something might occur to set him free, Shoon-ka-ska snatched a heavy
                  tomahawk from his belt, measured the distance carefully, and hurled it with all
                  his strength. The aim was true, and the blow terrible. The head of the heavy
                  weapon struck full in the broad forehead—had it been the edge, it would have cut
                  through the skull like paper—and the trapper quivered for a moment, his head
                  dropped like lead upon his breast, and had it not been for his bonds he would have
                  fallen to the ground.
               A cry of baffled vengeance rang through the entire encampment. They thought
                  themselves robbed of the brutal exhibition of farther torture, and were not
                  satisfied that one jot or tittle should be omitted. Had it been so there would
                  have been another victim required to satisfy their fiendish passions, and that
                  would have been Shoon-ka-ska. But the wild burst of savage fury operated upon the
                  old trapper like cool water to one fainting. It caused his strong nature to almost
                  instantly relax. His knees became firm again under him—his breast heaved with a
                  mighty emotion, his head was raised firmly upon the stalwart neck, and he was all
                  the strong, determined, defiant man again. A red, purpling spot alone told of the
                  blow. His face had lost something of its usual flush, but his unshorn lips were
                  bitter in their scorn, and his tongue worse than the waters of the Dead Sea.
               "There's er specermin of er warrior fer yer! Look at the White Dog! See what yer
                  think of him. Him er brave! A dog ter ther very heart's core! Er sick squaw would
                  make him run. He's ther man that gits behind bushes and shoots at men with er
                  pisened—"
               "Silence!" thundered Shoon-ka-ska, fearing that another word would be his
                  ruin.
               "Thank heaven, yer haven't got my tongue tied up ef yer have my hands and feet. I
                  say that he shot ther young pale faced Medicine with—"
               "Set the torture of fire—"
               "Er pisened arrer, and—"
               "Tear his tongue from his mouth."
               "I speak ther truth. Ther Swaller and ther chief know—"
               His voice was completely lost in the Babel of confusion that followed. All were
                  shouting for faggots, and bark, and fire, and scores of willing hands gathered and
                  piled them around him breast-high. He saw that he was wasting his strength
                  uselessly—saw the White Dog dancing in triumph at a little distance—saw him as he
                  rushed forward torch in hand, and then turned his thoughts beyond the dark
                  river.
               "May the good Lord forgive them," he murmured to himself. "They are acting
                  ercording to thar best lights, and ef I had allers lived ermong them, I shouldn't
                  have been any better."
               "Who triumphs now?" was hissed in his ears.
               "You, White Dog. I'm going ter ther happy land of ther Great Spirit, I hope, but
                  you—"
               "Where is the Swallow?"
               "Ask yer own black heart, sarpint."
               "She lives, and she will be my wife."
               "Liar!"
               "The white Medicine, I killed—starved him to death in a cave, and—"
               "God fergive yer. Go erway—go erway. Yer make me think black thoughts."
               "You shall burn by inches," and he commanded those around to remove the faggots,
                  and re-arrange them so that they would simply roast, not consume him.
               "Thar whar er little prayer that I've hearn ther good missionarys say down at ther
                  Sault, that I wish I could think of now," communed the trapper with himself. "It
                  bergins somethin' erbout 'Our Father,' and thar's somethin' erbout 'heaven,' and
                  'fergivin' our sins,' and—but I disremember all ther rest. Perhaps ther Good Lord
                  knows what I mean, and will fergive me, tu."
               "FIRE!"
               The terrible word burst upon his ears, even while, good old man that he was,
                     trying ing in his rude, unlettered
                  way to lay his sins at the foot of the cross, and beg of the bright-winged angels
                  to swing open wide the golden gates for his soul to enter.
               "FIRE!"
               Like demons at the bidding of their master, the Indians rushed forward to light
                  the funereal pyre. The smoke curled up in little wreaths at first—then the flames
                  shot forth spiteful tongues of lurid glare—then the smoke grew stronger, more
                  dense, and rolled in inky clouds aloft, staining the golden lightness of the
                  sun—then there was a swirling, crackling, rushing sound, and the trapper was
                  enveloped in one sheet of living flame!
               But death could not come to him suddenly. The skill with which the resinous bark
                  and wood had been piled, prevented that. It would be a death of lingering
                  torture.
               "May the great and good Lord forgive them—me—and, and—" was heard even above the
                  roar of the flames, and the giant form of Ahmeek, the Beaver, was seen to totter
                  like the oak of many centuries' growth, when the axe of the woodsman has reached
                  its heart, reel and then fall backwards. Backwards into the sea of flame and
                  forest of living coals?
               Not so! a dozen strong hands had torn away the faggots from behind him, and on the
                  opposite side from where the White Dog was standing, cut the bonds and carried the
                  old man to safety. This, the wall of smoke and fire concealed, and even while
                  Shoon-ka-ska was straining his lungs with the cry of victory, he saw the almost
                  ghost of the chief, Ah-ne-mee-kee, start as if from the ground before him!
               "Traitor! Murderer! Seize him!" was all he heard, before he was powerless in the
                  grasp of many warriors.
               But other shades arose as if from the grave, to confront and appal him. There in a
                  triangle stood:— 
                     PITT MONCRIEF!
                     THE WITCH WOMAN!
                     THE SWALLOW!
                  
               
               He saw all at a glance—knew that he was betrayed, and with a howl of despair, and
                  a mighty effort of strength burst from those who held him, snatched a knife from
                  his belt, and rushed upon Moncrief.
               The Swallow saw it, and threw herself before her lover. So, also, did the witch
                  woman, and both would have fallen had not a man who appeared wrapped in a cloud of
                  smoke and glittering sparks, leaped wildly into the circle, swung a heavy rifle
                  above his head and bringing it down, crushed the skull of Shoon-ka-ska as if it
                  had been an egg shell!
               "May ther good Lord fergive me ef this am murder. I couldn't help it! I couldn't
                  help it!" and he fell fainting into the open arms of Pitt Moncrief.
               
               A few weeks after, a gay flotilla of canoes left the banks of the Michipicoten and
                  wended their way to the settlement at the Sault.
                  There Pitt Moncrief and the Swallow were married according to the rites of the
                  Christian church and the cabalistic ceremonies of the red man. Through much
                  sorrow, they had reached exceeding joy. But the happiness of the group was the old
                  trapper. Something had convinced him that it was not best for man to live alone,
                  and when he again returned to his loved cabin, he was accompanied by the
                  counterfeit Witch Woman, Wit-chi-ta, as wife.
            
            THE END.
