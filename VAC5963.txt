               CHAPTER I.
               FATHER AND DAUGHTER.
               THE eyes of the traveller to and from the land of gold have often rested upon a stately edifice that stands at a little distance from Panama on an eminence overlooking the sea, and the feet of the more curious and venturesome have penetrated the wilderness of foliage that surrounds it and found a massive structure, which at one time must have been of surpassing beauty, fast tottering to its fall.
               The upper story is in decay—the lower one a debris of ruins and the home of birds and bats and noxious reptiles. Through the glassless windows and lockless doors the wind moans pitifully. Upon the hearth-stones damp, thick moss has gathered and parasite vines taken root, reaching upwards and trailing their long arms like spectral things. The arch of the roof is broken—the rain falls unobstructed within, and the moonlight and starlight steals through as if fearful of entering amid so much desolation. The once luxurious and carefully tended gardens are a waste—the paths obliterated, and the rare flowers long since choked out by weeds. Ruin and decay have claimed all for their own, and in a few, very few years a mouldering mass will alone remain to tell of its once having been the abode of beauty and wealth—that its walls have rung with mirth and laughter, echoed with songs, and that the softer as well as the darkest passions of the human heart have been allowed to run riot there.
               Builded upon a hill of flowers the view from thence is incomparable. On one side slumbers the ancient city, towered and domed, and gleaming in the sun. On the others are Mount Bolivar and Mount Ancon, while the bay and ocean stretch away in front—a shield of burnished silver embossed with islands of emerald. Far to the northward can be seen, through the tropical haze, the eternal hills piled peak upon peak, and wrapped around with clouds—the haunt of the fierce tiger and the home of the swift-winged condor—an unbroken chain, with colossal valleys and glittering peaks colored by the matchless pencil of the artist, God!
               But, although surrounded with so much beauty—so much to win the eye and mind—it is shunned by all; it stands a melancholy ruin, and with whispered breath the curious inquirer is told that it is "haunted!" told that curses and love vows, rattling chains and sighs are ever to be heard there in the darker hours; and that unappeased ghosts will make it their abiding-place while a single vestige remains. Be that as it may, it is universally shunned, and all the wealth in the treasury of Mexico would not tempt the poorest peon to pass a single night near its walls—to rest but one short hour within its shadow.
               Yet it was far otherwise once. One hundred years ago the house was exquisite in its proportions, and exquisite in all its surroundings. All that money and taste could do had been accomplished there. Within, magnificent luxury reigned. To describe it would be to carry one back to the fabled palace of Montezuma, and the superb architecture and gorgeous decorations of the Toltecs in the height of their glory and their power.
               The house was large, flat-roofed, with a terrace running around the upper wall. The rooms were spacious—the ground ones opening directly into the garden, and those above upon a broad, covered veranda that effectually shut out the burning rays of the sun, while it admitted light and air. Rare paintings covered the brilliantly-tinted walls, and the cornice was carved and gilded with masterly skill. The floors, innocent of carpets, were mosaicked with many-colored woods, polished like a mirror. Couches of the most luxurious patterns met the eye at every turn, covered with showy satin, richly embroidered and heavily fringed. All that ease and comfort could desire was found there.
               Such was the almost palace home of Senor Alvarado Gonzales, a Spanish nobleman of the purest strain of Castilian blood, whose chief possessions were an unlimited amount of pesos and a beautiful daughter—the fairest girl in the country. At least so said fame, and for once it was scarcely to be questioned. Few if any would have dared to enter the lists against the lovely Inez where beauty was to win the prize.
               On a glorious evening in the middle of the eighteenth century the father and daughter were seated in one of the many vine-covered and flower-walled bowers that overlooked the sea. Before them the waters lay sleeping, almost rippleless; above them the sky, yet crimsoned with the sun, and behind the living green, lighted with many-hued blossoms and musical with the songs of myriad of mocking-birds.
               In person Alvarado Gonzales was tall and graceful, though strongly framed—in age, close upon his fiftieth year. His complexion was of light olive; his hair and beard long, dark and touched with silver. There was a fiery look in his flashing black eyes, and a determination in the contraction of the brow and lip that told him to be both stern and resolute—one that would scruple at no means to carry his ends, or crush those beneath him in the social scale, if they stood in the way of his advancement or wounded his pride, with as little remorse as he would a worm. If any soft emotion swept over his high-strung soul, it was love for his beautiful daughter. Yet even she would have been sacrificed upon the altar of vengeance if ever she dared to thwart his cherished wishes, or linked her destiny with one he deemed not to be a fitting mate for her wealth and rank.
               And Inez, although she had something of his tall figure, resembled her father in no other particular. Well, indeed, was she called the "Pearl of Panama"—a place at that time noted for its extensive and profitable fisheries for the "congealed moonlight," and consequently where such a comparison was of peculiar significance.
               Through the pure snow of her complexion the rich flush of the warm southern blood glowed with its softest crimson. Her lips were like the heart of the damask rose, and her eyes the liquid hazel that deepens at night and sparkles like jet. Her hair was the richest of brown, soft and glossy as silk floss and of wondrous length. There was a blending of spiritual lightness with womanly grace in her movements—a natural ease and elegance that rendered her particularly bewitching.
               
               In mind she was the perfect opposite of her stern and imperious father. Of her mother she had a very faint recollection. She had been called home to God during the earliest infancy of Inez. Gonzales might well be compared to the eagle, and his daughter to the dove. He was all fire, and she all tenderness. He was wrapped up in pride of birth, his long line of ancestry and immense wealth; and she thought as little of them, of the pearls that were braided amid her hair, or the diamonds that were flashing upon her breast and fingers, as the butterfly that flitted from bower to bower around her did of the crimson spots upon its wings of silken gauze.
               Hers was a heart formed to love, and when she did so it would be with an entire absorption of self. Her soul, like the aloe, would blossom but once—no new flames would ever spring from the same root. If opposed, something of her father's energy might awake within her—something of the sublime passion that sustains the martyr at the stake, and though she had not strength of will or nerve to resist long and successfully, yet she had sufficient to die for him she loved. But thus far, although nearly nineteen summers had showered their blossoms around her, she had walked "in maiden meditation, fancy free." Not that she had been without scores of would-be-lovers, but she knew nothing of that feeling which should render all others as naught.
               "By Saint lago!" said Gonzales, after sitting for a long time in silence and watching the smoke of his cigar, "by Saint lago! but that is a beautiful sight."
               "What, father?" asked Inez, leaving off toying with the flowers she had gathered in her walk thither and was deftly twining into a perfumed chain.
               "Are you blind or dreaming, child?"
               "Neither, father," was the smiling response.
               "Do you not see yonder vessel?"
               "Yes."
               "What can be more beautiful?"
               "It is so, indeed."
               "Few if any sights can equal a ship with every sail set, and dashing along with a favorable breeze."
               "How white the sails are, father."
               "They look so in the sun, and see how the red light flashes from the gilded ball at the truck."
               "It seems as if it were on fire! Where does she come from? May it not be from your native land?"
               "It may bring tidings from there—very likely it does."
               "And not come from Spain?"
               "I think not. Her build and rig have little that is akin to a Spaniard."
               "Then she comes from America."
               "Not so. I should say she was an Englishman. Yes, I am right, Inez," resumed he, after a pause. "It is an Englishman. There goes a gun and there flutters aloft the blood red cross of Saint George. Hark! Now you can hear the rattling of the cable. See how gracefully the headway is checked, and how she coquets with the anchor. By the cross, if ever I should be forced to labor for bread it would be upon the ocean."
               "There is little fear of that, father."
               "Little, indeed."
               With their eyes intently fixed upon the ship that appeared to slumber after her long voyage, so gently she rocked upon the water, Gonzales and the fair Inez sat watching the taking in of the sails until not a single one was to be seen. The circling of the hands upon the dial were not more regular than the movements of the man-o'-war's-men, and yet all was done with extreme rapidity. Trained as they had been each one knew his place, knew what was expected of him, and did it in the shortest possible time.
               An hour after, and just as the sun was sinking to cool its breast of fire in the calm depths of the Pacific and the Southern Cross beginning to flash its jewelled splendors from the ebon brow of night, a boat was lowered, manned and pulled rapidly ashore.
               "Let us go down and see them land, father," said Inez, suddenly breaking the silence.
               "What for, child?"
               "Who knows but it may be an old friend?"
               "Quien sabe?" was the only response, and they descended by the terraced walk to where they could not only see the forms but the faces as they stepped ashore.
               Gonzales knew the commander at the first glance, and hastened to meet him. His daughter, led by curiosity, also drew near, but singled out no one from the group until she heard a low whisper:
               
               "How very, very beautiful!"
               Then she looked around in astonishment and with something like fear, and saw the weather-bronzed face of one standing with his hand upon the tiller and gazing in rapt admiration at her. There was something in both his attitude and features that instantly fixed her attention. She felt that it was he who had spoken, and was turning blushingly away from the ardent though respectful looks, when the captain broke the charm by saying:
               "George Bright."
               "Ay, ay, sir."
               "I shall not go off to-night. When I wish to come on board in the morning I will signal you."
               "Ay, ay, sir."
               He touched his cap, Inez fancied more to her than to the commander, gave the necessary orders and the boat shoved off. Carelessly all eyes, except those perhaps of the beautiful Spanish girl, watched its progress. Intent only were they upon the regular sweep of the oars and the wake of phosphorescent brightness.
               Yet that little craft contained, for two of the number, at least, the motive power of the widely-varied passions of love, hope, anger, frenzy and despair!
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               GEORGE BRIGHT.
               WHEN the soft moon of the tropics was at the zenith and the stars shimmered down their golden haze until the placid sea appeared fretted with fire—when all was still on the decks of the Avenger, save now and then the shuffling feet of the anchor-watch as they changed positions, a man was leaning over the stern of the vessel, looking dreamily into the water. It was the one whom the commander had called "George Bright"—the one who had almost transfixed Inez Gonzales with his ardent gaze.
               The third son of an English nobleman, he had been educated for the ministry, but feeling that he was unworthy of such a holy place—being naturally of an ardent and roving disposition tion—scorning to eat the bread he had not earned, and blessed with a more liberal spirit than his purse-proud and aristocratic father, he rebelled against the authority that would have forced him to put on the "livery of heaven."
               A stormy scene had followed. The Earl of Buckmaster could not or would not understand the true manhood of his son, who doubted the justice of the law that gave all of titles and lands to an elder brother and left him little better than a beggar.
               "If I might have gone into the army, as my brother Alfred has done," he said, "I would have been satisfied."
               "You must be satisfied as it is," was the stern response. "The custom of our race for centuries is not to be broken in upon for the Eutopian dreams of a boy. The first-born inherits the coronet—the second finds a fitting place in the army—the third in the church."
               "Without proper qualifications for, or a love of it, sir?"
               "That has nothing to do with it. A Buckmaster has never yet brought shame upon the robes he wore. The living you will have will be a good one, and some day you may hope, through the influence I have at court, to find yourself a bishop."
               "That is making Christianity a mere trade," said the boy.
               "Hush, sirrah!" replied the earl, with his eyes flashing fire. "Hush, sirrah! Not another word. You know my mind, headstrong boy. If you dare to disobey me I will drive you from this house—will disinherit you. Go to your own room, and think calmly over what I have said. When you are in a proper frame of mind you can come again. Until that time I desire not to see your face. Remember, the church—or nothing!"
               A hard master to those beneath him and a time-serving sycophant to those above, there was no hope of the Earl of Buckmaster swerving one jot from his decision. This his youngest son well knew, and though it was hard to think of turning his back upon his home—to cut himself loose from those who loved him—to part from his mother and sisters who were very dear to him, it might be forever, yet he felt that stirring within him which demanded freedom. He was of age, and had a right to choose for himself, and so when all were sleeping he took the little money he could call his own and left, like a thief in the night.
               
               The world was all before him, and the choice of what he would do his own. Without difficulty he reached London, loitered there for a few days undecided, and then, forced by the want of means, and scorning to either beg or borrow, shipped as a common seaman on board his majesty's good ship the Avenger—the son of an earl in a menial's position!
               But promotion soon followed. His education made him the superior of those around him, his attention to his duties master of his profession; and after cruising around half the world, he was leaning over the stern and gazing into the water as fourth lieutenant.
               Few men could have been found more perfect in form or face than George Bright (that being the name by which he had entered himself upon the ship's books, having dropped his own when he turned his back upon the palace home of his proud father), or one more commanding in appearance and voice. His six feet of humanity contained all the bone and muscle necessary for a successful champion in the prize ring; his light curling hair hung gracefully around a head in which the intellectual faculties strongly predominated; his complexion was the pinky-white usual to his native land; his eyes blue, his nose straight, and the lips firmly set. In courage he was a lion, in tenderness a lamb. No one could surpass him in deeds of daring, and no heart melted sooner at the call of pity or the wail of suffering.
               For a time he had been thinking of the home he had left in transatlantic climes, and wondering if he had been missed during his long absence. Wondering if his father would not be glad to see him return once more and sit by the hearth-stone where generations of the Buckmasters had sat and drank the red, ripe wine. Then the vision of the beautiful girl he had seen arose before him, and he would learn more about her.
               "Never, even in my wildest dreams," he murmured, audibly, "have I seen the face of any one so ravishingly lovely. I wonder if she is the daughter of the haughty man with whom the commander spoke. What if she is? What matter who she is? It is nothing, can be nothing to me. She is evidently the child of wealth, and I—I—a poor sailor." And he almost gnashed his teeth at the bitterness of the thought, and of what he might have been had his father been less proud and the laws of England more just.
               Rousing himself he walked rapidly forward, saw that the men were awake; glanced at the rigging, to satisfy himself that everything was in its place; at the sky, to note the weather, and was returning again to indulge in his dreams, bitter though they might be, when the whispered words of one of the sailors caught his ear:
               "Her father is richer than any lord in all England," said the man, to his shipmate.
               "And she isn't married?" queried the other.
               "No; at least she wasn't when we were here before."
               "What is her name?"
               "Inez Gonzales; but she is almost always called 'Marguarita de Panama.'"
               "The Pearl of Panama," interrupted the mate, and then continued: "You have been on this coast before, Tom?"
               "Ay, ay, sir, even before the first plank of the Avenger was nailed to her ribs. I was here in the old Bulldog, whose bones are now bleaching in the Orkneys, sir."
               "And have been ashore, of course?"
               "Many's the time, sir; and a good place it is after living abroad for a long time. There isn't a pleasanter spot in the world than the garden of Don Alvarado Gonzales. What with fruit and flowers, it puts me in mind of what I have heard my old mother tell about Eden. You know what I mean, sir?"
               "Yes. Who is this don with the magnificent garden?"
               "He's the man the commander went home with, sir. If you have your glass you can see the house, now, peeping out from between the trees."
               "Let me see, Tom," continued Bright, with as much non-chalance of manner as he could possibly assume. "Let me see. You were in my boat when we went ashore, weren't you?"
               "Where would I be except at my place at the stroke oar?" And the old seaman looked up in surprise.
               "Certainly. I was thinking of something else, or I would not have asked so foolish a question. That was Gonzales that welcomed the commander, was it?"
               "Yes; and if you hadn't been so busy 'tending to your duty, sir, as you always are, you would have seen his daughter. My eyes! but isn't she beautiful!"
               The lieutenant needed no corroboration of what his eyes had already told him; but allowing the old seaman to continue with a freedom perfectly inconsistent with the usual order of the vessel, learned all that the man knew, or had heard or fancied, with regard to the Spanish girl. And yet when eight bells sounded and the watch changed, when he was released from duty, he went below muttering as he had previously done, and bemoaning the hard fate that forbade him to look upon her except according to the maxim that "a cat might look upon a king."
               A life on the ocean, its toils and dangers, yield at least one return, that of sound sleep; but that of George Bright was greatly disturbed. In every phase of his dreaming the graceful form of Inez Gonzales appeared. Now he was with her floating over the placid waters beneath the soft light of moon and stars; now walking with her on the shell-strewn beach, and now, with his strong arm twined around her, battling with the mad waves that were striving to drag them both down to the home of the ravenous shark and the terrible blanket fish. Truly sleep for him that night was not sleep, "but a continuance of enduring thought," and most gladly he heard the call that again summoned him to the active duties of life.
               Long before noon the boat was summoned from the shore, and again the young lieutenant was placed in charge of it. At the landing he found not alone him whose word was law when upon the deck of the ship, but Alvarado Gonzales and his daughter.
               "What news on board?" asked Sir Reginald Montcourcy, the commander of the Avenger. "What news, George?"
               "All is right, sir." And the jaunty hat was raised, displaying the almost golden curls—raised again, as Inez fancied, and not without truth, to her.
               "Your superior puts great confidence in you, sir," remarked Gonzales.
               "He is a man to be trusted," answered Sir Reginald.
               George Bright blushed at the praise thus bestowed upon him, and the eyes of Inez for the first time obtained a perfect view of his face. Before, she had always found his resting upon hers. And never before had she seen any one that came up to what her girlish standard of a man should be. In every respect he was the opposite of the olive Spaniards or swarthy Mexicans who came to her father's house. His face was as open as the day. Beneath theirs, hide it as they would, there was ever a sinister scowl. His was an assurance of open and fair dealing; theirs emblematic of treachery. His told that an enemy would be met openly; theirs of a dark night and a stab in the back.
               "George," resumed the commander, after they had taken their places in the stern sheets and the boat was shoved from the shore, the men lying upon their oars and waiting for orders, "this fair lady, George, and her father wish us to take them to the pearl-fisheries. After that they will go on board and dine."
               "Ay, ay, sir."
               "Have you ever been there, George? Do you know the way?"
               "It is my first visit to these shores, sir. Tom has been here before."
               "True, I remember. Go forward—no matter about your oar; stow it, man, stow it. Go forward and pilot us. Now give way."
               "Give way, men, with a will," repeated Bright.
               The esprit de corps is very strong in all seamen when in such a situation, and the little boat shot forward like an arrow, dashing tiny foam wreaths from its sharp prow and leaving a glittering wake behind, very much to the delight of Inez, who clapped her little hands in encouragement, and to the shame of the lazy peons whose boats they passed as if they had been snails.
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               PEARL FISHING.
               THE bay of Panama, even before the eighteenth century, was famous for its placeres or pearl-oyster beds, and annually yielded rich returns. Found only in tranquil waters, and generally at those points most sheltered by the elevated coast range of mountains, there is little of danger to the seekers therefor, above the waves. The risk attending their gathering is all under them.
               Although there is a little vessel of from twenty to forty tons in attendance, yet the fishing is prosecuted from light boats, the divers being for the most part half-caste Mexicans, although white men and negroes frequently form a portion of the crew. Their pay is, or rather was, a portion of the oysters—the holy Virgin coming in for her diez mo.
               
               To visit the scene of their operations (Gonzales being largely interested therein) was the purpose of the English gig, and very rapidly they came to where a number of the diving-boats were lying in close proximity to each other waiting for the Armadon to deal out to them a portion of aguadiente before venturing below.
               "It is a dangerous calling," said the Englishman, as he saw the lithe-limbed fellows preparing for a plunge.
               "Not so much so as is generally supposed," was the answer of the Spaniard. "Now and then they have a battle with a shark, but as a general thing they neither care for nor are in any danger from them. Give one of them his dried beef, a handful of beans, a little maize meal to manufacture into their everlasting dish atole, and now and then the pleasure of getting drunk upon aguadiente—the distilled juice of the mezcal plant—and they are superlatively happy."
               "Do I understand you that but few of them are killed?"
               "Very few. But what matter if they should be? Their lives are scarcely worth the poorest oyster they bring up."
               George Bright heard the sneering words distinctly—saw what a low estimate the proud Spaniard put upon human life, and from that moment a strong dislike of him grew up in his heart; albeit he saw by the flushed face of Inez that she disagreed with such sentiments.
               "They must be a brave set of fellows," continued the Englishman, "to venture so much for so little."
               "Yes—in their way," was the scornful rejoinder, again.
               "I have many a brave man on my decks—men that are lions in battle, and would march up to the muzzle of an enemy's cannon without a cowardly shiver. There is George Bright for one; but I doubt very much if even he would fancy such work as this. What say you, Bright?"
               "If duty required me, or to save the life of another, I should not hesitate," was the answer.
               "Such words denote a heart true as steel. They ring like a Toledo blade!" exclaimed the Spaniard, enthusiastically, while the eyes of his daughter more than echoed the sentiment as she allowed them to rest upon the face of the lieutenant.
               Then Gonzales addressed the men in their native tongue, and inquired why they were not improving their time. "You have forgotten our motto, Armadon," he said.
               "What motto, senor?" asked the man, almost withering beneath the fierce glances of his employer.
               "Make hay while the sun shines. It holds good upon the water as the land."
               "Better late than never!" muttered the man between his teeth, taking good care that his patron should not hear, as he turned away and gave directions to the buzos to immediately commence their diving.
               With their loins wrapped in a coarse species of baize, and armed only with a knife or a stick sharpened at both ends, and hardened in the fire to insert in the mouth of their terrible enemy, the shark, at the moment it is opened to swallow them, they took their places upon the gunwale of the boat, joined their arms over their heads, turned a graceful half somerset and dived beneath the waters.
               "It must be very cold, father," remarked Inez, with a shudder, as she saw the dark forms disappear.
               "Pshaw! they are tough as whalebone. Besides, they stay under but a short time. See, there is the first one returning already. What have you got, my man?"
               The diver selected the largest of the oysters he had brought, cleansed it with exceeding care and handed it to Gonzales, saying in a low voice:
               "This for the senorita."
               "A pearl for a pearl!" said the English commander. "You have a knife, Bright, open it for the lady. Where is your gallantry, man?"
               The lieutenant did so. It contained one of the larger pearls with a kind of purplish tint, which are esteemed valuable. With a low bow he laid it in the hand of Inez.
               "Keep it to remember Panama—and me," she said, returning it to him. "So brave a man as you have expressed yourself to be, and as your commander says you are, will not refuse this slight token of respect from Inez Gonzales."
               Unseen by any but her, George Bright touched it to his lips and then placed it in a safe repository—comparing it at the same time with the luminous eyes that were flashing softly upon him—eyes that had made a slave of his very soul forever! And how could it be otherwise? Sitting by her side, feeling the touch of her fingers—almost her warm breath upon his cheeks—drinking in her rare beauty—listening to the flute-like music of her voice, he forgot for the moment the great gulf that was between them—forgot that she was almost a queen by birth and wealth, and he—a poor seaman! But did he dare dream that love could lower the proud as it raises the humble? If so, one look into the face of Gonzales satisfied him of its falsity, in this case, at least; and he turned away with a sigh, to again watch the divers.
               "There are secrets of course connected with this business?" suggested the Englishman.
               "Yes, where the rich placers exist. There is one to the northward at La Paz, is it not, Armadon?"
               "Si Senor."
               "That has long been famous and yet remains unworked, I believe."
               "On account of the depth of the water?"
               "No. It is only ten fathoms."
               "Ten fathoms! Great Heaven! you do not mean that these poor men go down sixty feet into the depth of the ocean?"
               "They are poor indeed! May the Virgin keep them!" sighed Inez.
               "Certainly they do," answered Gonzales. "A skillful one will go beyond that depth and make light of it. The reason the long famous placer of La Paz has remained undisturbed is, I fancy, on account of its being equally famous for ground sharks."
               "Enough to make one fear, if they resemble in the least those I have seen caught off Saint Helena. Our nation never guarded that island more faithfully than do the ground sharks the water around it."
               "O, they are large and fierce enough without any doubt, but not a tithe as bad as the divers make them out to be. Any one of these fellows would tell you stories that would make your hair stand on end. Not content with having them swallow a man, knife, sharpened stick, oysters and all, they would almost convince you that the boat would be included in order to finish the meal."
               "Something like an old whaler, I fancy."
               "Even more so. Your countrymen 'spin the yarn' for pleasure—mine for profit. The greater the hazard the more the pay."
               "But, father," interrupted Inez, growing very pale at the bare thought, "you know that great, horrible ones have often been brought ashore."
               "Yes, child, now and then," was the careless reply; and he went on to scout the idea that any man brought up to the trade of a diver should be afraid of anything that swam.
               Not so with his daughter. She shuddered at every plunge, breathed a prayer to the Virgin for their safe return, and a sigh of relief as each one came up again, dripping like mermen, with his little store of anticipated wealth.
               "They must be very skillful swimmers," resumed the Englishman.
               "Scarcely to be equalled, senor. The men of the Sandwich Islands, as indeed all in the Pacific, I believe, are famous in that respect, and yet I would be willing to match almost any of my own against them."
               "For distance, speed, or going to the greatest depth?"
               "Either, senor. But I'll give you an opportunity of judging something of their skill."
               He directed that there should be a lull in the fishing—that all should rest and prepare to dive for a piece of gold he would throw into the pellucid waters.
               A general cry of joy followed the announcement. It was not often that they had so fair an opportunity of procuring the means of purchasing pleasure with scarcely an effort. Perchance, too, they were not unwilling to show the strangers their peculiar powers in an element that was as familiar to them as the land.
               "This," said Gonzales, holding up a doubloon in the plain sight of all, "is the prize."
               "And this," added the Englishman, also, exhibiting a bright piece of gold, "to the one who is second."
               "And this," said Inez, taking a little cross from the chain she wore around her neck, "to the one—who can get it."
               Lithe and eager as greyhounds when the deer first bursts into sight, the divers stood upon the gunwales of their respective boats and waited for the signal.
               "It will be one, two, three, and away you go," directed Gonzales.
               "May I compete for one of the prizes?" suddenly asked George Bright, to the intense surprise of all.
               
               "You!" exclaimed the Spaniard, his daughter, and the commander of the Avenger in a breath.
               "If there is no objection, senor."
               "None, certainly on my part," replied Gonzales; "and by Saint Iago! but I would like to see how an Englishman will appear in competition with natives." And a smile curled his thin lips at the certainty of an easy conquest over him.
               Bright touched his cap, threw aside his jacket, unfastened the handkerchief from his throat, removed his light shoes, drew a long breath so as to perfectly fill his lungs, and stood with braced nerves and sinews waiting for the signal.
               "By the cross, a man!" exclaimed the Spaniard, almost involuntarily. "I never saw one cast in so perfect a mould before."
               Certainly George Bright merited all that could be said of him physically, for his form was revealed in all its manly strength and beauty as he stood carelessly balanced with a seaman's skill upon the stem of the gig. He looked, as the Spaniard said, every inch a man, and shamed the poor, half-caste Mexicans into very pigmies.
               "Win any one of the prizes, George, and I will give you a chain of gold to link it to," said his commander. "Win, George. For the honor of old England, do not let these braggarts carry off every prize."
               "I shall win—one," was the confident reply. And the fearless flashing of his eyes and compressed lips told that with him the struggle would be for life or death.
               "To the test then. This promises more of sport, senor, than I anticipated. Be ready, men. One—two—three!"
               In an instant the sea was churned into a foam, as a score or more of bodies plunged into its depths simultaneously with the tossing of the stamped gold, and golden trinket moulded in the shape dearest to every Christian heart—no matter what his sect or creed.
               To distinguish between them was impossible. Diving, twisting, darting, they resembled more a school of porpuses at play than any other thing.
               "A dozen ounces to a basket of wine, senor," said Gonzales, "that your lieutenant, brave and active as he is, entirely fails."
               "Done," was the response, and with the word the men emerged again.
               Two of the most practised divers had secured the golden pieces, but where was the little cross? None of them had it, or it would have been proudly shown.
               "What!" exclaimed the impetuous don in wrath, "what! Let the gift of the senorita and the emblem of our holy religion remain at the bottom amid weeds and ooze? Dive again, all of you, and mind that you do not return without it."
               "They will not find it, senor," interrupted George Bright quietly, as he swung himself into the stern sheets.
               "Then you have it?"
               "Certainly. I had no other aim in risking both reputation and life in so unequal a contest."
               Both the Spaniard and the English commander were loud in their praises, and Inez looked up with a sweet smile and thankful expression of her lustrous eyes that was dearer to the sailor than the words she spoke, though uttered in that pure Castilian that drops in liquid melody from the lips of a beautiful and educated woman.
               "You are a brave man, Senor Bright," she said; "and to one like you the chain should go that has long sustained the cross."
               "Lady, I thank you, but the commander has already promised that—"
               "Nay, that matters not, for—but may the holy Virgin preserve you! Look, father! Look, senor! how pale he is!"
               All eyes were turned upon the lieutenant, and they saw, as Inez had said, that his usually flushed face was colorless—saw that his strong frame was trembling—that his lips were set as one in great pain, and that he was holding on to the sides of the boat to keep from falling.
               "Great Heaven, George! What is the matter?" And forgetting all difference in rank the commander of the Avenger sprang aft and sustained him in his arms.
               "I don't know—I can't tell. I dived with the rest—my only object to gain the cross of the fair lady; for the gold I cared nothing. I reached it—grasped it. Then something sharp stuck me in the side—it felt like a knife, and—and I cannot tell more. But I got it—got it, thank—" And he fainted away.
               A hasty examination showed that his suspicions were correct. A knife had been driven deeply into his side, just missing the heart. It was evident to all that one of the divers had wounded him, urged by either envy or malice or avarice.
               
               Then the eyes of the Spaniard flashed fire—his hands were clenched—his teeth ground together—the olive of his cheeks became purple, and he looked from one to the other of the Mexicans for some sign of guilt—some one upon whom to vent his terrible rage.
               "Caramba!" he hissed, with all the spite and venom of a serpent. "Caramba, traitors! But I will find out whose hand struck the cowardly blow against the stranger's life, and then let him beware! To the shore instantly, my good men."
               "The ship is nearer and we have a skillful surgeon on board," suggested the Englishman. "Better take him on board."
               "Not so. Pardon me for disputing your orders, senor, but the evil has been through my instrumentality, and I must remedy it to the best of my ability."
               "But the ship must sail to-morrow."
               "Then he is certainly far better off on shore. Come, my good men—a bright piece of gold to each—come show us how you can row to save the life of your countryman."
               Never before had their muscles been strained or their oars bent as they then were. Not a man in the boat but loved George Bright, and dangerous would it have been for the life of the man if they could have found out who had struck the foul blow. All the power of Gonzales, all the commands of him they were accustomed to obey, would have been futile to restrain them from instant vengeance. But the cowardly assassin was not to be distinguished from the rest, and the wrath that could not be vented upon a human victim was expended in driving the light boat forward.
               Bending over the wounded and insensible seaman were both the Spaniard and the Englishman, while the lovely and now tearful Inez breathed many a prayer to the Virgin as she stanched the blood with her handkerchief. To save her cross, or rather to win it, he had risked his life. Every glance of his eyes, every motion of his hand, and every tone of his voice had been most respectful, yet telling of worship; and her heart was filled with a far deeper tenderness for him than she knew or would have acknowledged.
               And so George Bright became the guest of Senor Alvarado Gonzales and his lovely daughter, and when the good ship Avenger spread her broad wings on the morrow and swept seaward the place of the lieutenant was vacant.
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               WHAT A MONTH DID.
               A MONTH slips quickly by. We look and the thirty days are there. We look again and they are gone, never to return.
               With George Bright the month after his having been taken to the mansion of Senor Gonzales appeared to have vanished like a dream. Carried carefully from the boat and given into the hands of the attendants of the wealthy Spaniard, he had been tended with skill, and though his wound would have proved dangerous under ordinary circumstances, yet the treatment and nursing he received, and his strong constitution baffled death. It was not long, therefore, before he was able to receive even lengthy visits from his host and daughter without injury to his body.
               With his heart it was very different. The spell that the glorious eyes had first cast upon him deepened with every breath, and before half the month had passed he was madly in love with the matchless Pearl of Panama. And love with such a nature is no child's play. It is all-absorbing. Every other passion and feeling and thought must bow to it. Truly it was with him— 
                     
                        "As if the thing beloved were all a saint,
                        And every place she entered were a shrine."
                     
                  
               
               Even in her absence she was kept constantly in memory by flowers, fruit, books and music. Each morning brought with it a bouquet of the rarest blossoms, a basket of luscious oranges, figs, bananas, grapes or guava, with "the compliments of the Lady Inez," and each evening, when the stars were making the heavens glorious with their spangles of gold, the melody of her voice reached his ears and stole upon his senses as the fragrance of the roses.
               "Senor Bright," said Gonzales, as he came into his room one morning earlier than his usual custom, "Senor Bright, I have obtained permission for you to leave your room. To one of your usual active mode of life it must be peculiarly unpleasant to be confined as you have been."
               "It is indeed; and yet I feel that I owe my life to my having been brought here where I could enjoy perfect repose. To you and your kind daughter I can never be thankful enough for the interest you have manifested in a stranger."
               "We have done no more than duty required. But as I said, I have obtained permission for you to enjoy the outer air."
               "I am extremely grateful."
               "And I am glad on your account especially, as I am called away from home. With this liberty the time will not hang so heavily upon your hands. My daughter must play the hostess to the best of her ability while I am gone, and will see that boats, horses—anything you may desire is at your service."
               "Once again accept my thanks, senor."
               "Let me warn you, however, not to overexert yourself. Our climate, although lovely, is a trying and dangerous one for strangers."
               "I shall not neglect your caution. My duty requires that I should rejoin my ship as speedily as possible."
               "In that respect you will have to exercise patience. It will be months perhaps before she returns again. But I trust the time will pass pleasantly here—at least not disagreeably."
               "Very far from it. How long will you be absent, senor?"
               "Two weeks at least. It is unfortunate for your comfort, perhaps, that it should be so, but I must do the best possible on my return to make amends for any inconvenience you may chance to suffer. I wish you a good-day and a speedy and perfect recovery, Senor Bright."
               Did our hero think that the time would pass wearily with him? Did he believe that the absence of Gonzales would make any great difference with his happiness? Did he fancy that Inez would not play the hostess sufficiently well to entertain him and attend to his comfort? Well it was that the haughty don could not see the quick bounding pulse and wildly beating heart—well that he could not read the thoughts that were darting like lightning through the brain—well that he had not the slightest idea of the magnetic influences of the spirit that was drawing the seaman and his daughter together as loadstone draws steel.
               Scarcely could the Englishman wait the departure of Gonzales before he arose and availed himself of the permission to leave his room. Descending the broad stairs he met Inez, and was led by her into the parlor and gently forced to recline upon one of the softest couches.
               "The sun is blazing far too hot, senor," she said, "for you to venture out now. Wait until it has lost something of its power. Then I will take great pleasure in showing you the gardens."
               "From which you have daily gathered the choicest flowers to grace my room. Ah! how can I ever even thank you?" And their eyes met and both suddenly dropped.
               "Flowers," continued the Spanish girl, as soon as she could drive back the curdling blushes from her cheeks and recover somewhat from her sweet confusion, "flowers are very dear to me, especially when I am deprived by sickness from rambling among them. With me they constitute almost a part of my religion. I am no pantheist, senor, but if ever I worshipped any God but the true one it would be one whose earthly representatives were flowers."
               "They are indeed sweet, and your ideal religion would be both beautiful and poetic. I believe no man, however hardened by toil or rendered desperate by misery, but loves some flower."
               "Then how very much you, whose life is spent upon the water, must miss them?"
               "We do indeed—at least I do, for I was born where the primrose and hawthorn and blue-eyed violet perfume the breeze."
               On this theme, dear alike to both hearts, they conversed for a time, then, after refreshment, as the sun was fast sinking, they strolled out to the gardened bowers that overlooked the sea.
               "Lean on my arm, senor," suggested the Spanish maid; "you must be still weak."
               "Lean on you!" replied George Bright. "That would indeed be reversing nature and making the oak lean upon the ivy."
               Yet he did not refuse to allow his strong arm to be drawn within her delicate one, and slowly they wandered, pausing often to pluck the buds and blossoms, to listen to some singing-bird or watch the flitting of some gaudy butterfly, until they reached the very bower from which Inez and her father had first discovered the coming of the Avenger.
               "Senor," said Inez, after they had taken their seats and remained for a time drinking in the surpassing loveliness of the scene, "senor, have you anything in your own land like this?"
               "Nothing! England has many a fair spot—many that are hallowed by time and the charms that romance has thrown around them, but there is not one in all her broad realm that can compare with this."
               The eyes of Inez Gonzales flashed their gratification at the willing homage paid to what she had always deemed was matchless upon the earth, and they continued talking of and praising its rare and roseate beauty until she felt that it was time to return within doors.
               "And must we go?" sighed her companion. "It appears altogether too much like enchantment to be willingly given up. Ah! one might well wish to remain here forever, and dream life away with one he loved."
               "But as the being you love is in England, it is nothing to you," answered Inez, with deep-drawn breath.
               "Not so," he replied, sadly. "Save those within the limits of my own family there is no one—unless perhaps some friend—that would cause me a single tear if the ocean was to sweep over it and blot it forever from the face of the globe."
               "What! No bright-eyed, rosy-cheeked girl who is waiting more than anxiously for your return—who smiles when the ocean is calm, and prays tearfully when the storm is abroad in its might?"
               "Not one. If George Bright were to die this very hour, there would be no widowed heart, such as you describe, to put on the weeds of mourning for him. No, there is no one in England to love me as you mean."
               "Not in England, but elsewhere, senor?'
               "Yes, there is one elsewhere that I love," he replied, in a low voice and with something like a shudder convulsing his strong frame. "But come, let us go in." He knew that he was treading upon very dangerous ground, and checked himself in time.
               "It is indeed time you were in. See how you tremble!" And again she offered him her arm as a support, and they walked slowly back to the house.
               The conversation of the garden was not resumed. Both felt its danger and instinctively shunned it. But when sleep had removed the strong shackles of the will, and the mind ran riot without the controlling influences of reason, each dreamed of and glorified the other.
               And so another and yet another week was added to the countless score that had gone on before—the little blocks that go to make up the temple of time—the stepping-stones by which the mortal soul reaches immortality! Day by day, almost hour by hour, they sat by each other's side—listened to each other's words, lived upon each other's smile, and it needed no prophetic eye to see what the result would be—for there could be but one! With both it was the first outgushing of nature. No world-worn feelings—no hackneyed emotions were reawakened into life. They had arrived at the very crisis of their fate without knowing it—had drifted so smoothly and pleasantly down the tide that they reached the rapids before noticing their danger. Then like a strong swimmer they struggled in vain, lifted their arms above the seething waters and called for help—but it was too late!
               To the Spanish girl the moments were ones of sweet torture. Sweet in the plenitude of affection—the promise of love that had become a necessity to her nature, and torture when she thought of her father and the future. Far better than her lover she knew how terrible would be his anger—how it would fall upon both when he found that one ranking no higher had dared to raise his eyes to his Pearl, and that she had given her heart to him. But George Bright had not yet told of his love, and it might be he would not do so. His position when contrasted with hers might keep him reticent no matter what his feelings might be, and she was far too proud to urge him to do so by any act of hers. But in her case the evil day seemed to be yet at a distance, and even more than he she put away the thought of it from her. If he had acted according to his nature he would have looked the matter squarely in the face, but she would have temporized to the end. One was as the oak that would meet the storm and defy the lightning unbendingly—the other the sensitive plant that would fold its leaves at the slightest premonition of danger, and bowing to the blast, cling to its mother earth until it has passed.
               But there is what we call fate in love as well as in the other actions of our lives. There is a fate that hurries on two hearts as certainly to destruction as the wind and tide drive the rudderless bark upon the breaker-guarded rocks. Platonic love is far more frequently talked about than seen, for it is not consonant with humanity. The passionate fires of two young hearts will never smoulder thus upon their altars. Their flaming incense can never be confined within such reason-swung censers. They never own such an iceberg for a high-priest, or so desolate paths as the ones leading to their shrine!
               Morning found George Bright listening to sweet music from the lips of the gentle Inez; evening saw him seated by her side looking far out upon the ocean—each, perchance dreaming "what star should be their home when love became immortal." But one twilight, when earth and air and sea appeared to have put on all of their Eden loveliness, the spell was suddenly broken.
               "Senor," almost whispered Inez, "see what a mighty bird that is. Often as I have been here, I have never seen one with such huge wings before."
               "Where?" he asked, recalled thus from his airy wandering, from ideal "castles in Spain" to the things of earth again.
               "There. Do you not see it?"
               "It is a ship," he replied, but so very low that she had to bend down her ear to catch the words.
               "A ship! The saints preserve us! If it should be yours!" and her hand fell on his arm and she clasped it nervously.
               "Then I should have to take my place again, and—and more than likely never see you again."
               "May the Virgin forbid! But—but—you have not been happy here and long to be away."
               "Happy! God knows I have never known what happiness was before. To remain here would be joy, gladness—to go away utter—utter misery."
               "Then why not stay?"
               "You know not the duty of an English seaman."
               "But would nothing tempt you?"
               "Yes, one thing—but I dare not speak of it. O! why did not the knife of the diver find my heart!"
               "Senor, what wild words are these? You will not—must not go. My father has gold in plenty and he will purchase your release."
               "And you—you, Inez. May I call you so?"
               "Now and ever."
               "Then hear me, Inez, darling. From the first hour I saw you I have loved you. To win but a smile from your sweet lips I risked my life to secure this little cross. To win you, would be heaven—to lose you, utter darkness. I know that you are above me as far as the stars are above the earth, and yet I have dared to lift my eyes to you—yet dare to ask you to give me a heart in the place of the one you have taken from me. Tell me, darling, what my fate is to be—the glorious happiness of a love returned—or the black despair of a love lavished in vain?"
               The answer was given by the lustrous eyes, the burning cheeks, the trembling fingers, and the throbbing bosom, although no word was spoken. With his strong arm he drew her towards him—hers was twined around his neck, each could almost feel the beating of the other's heart as their lips met in the first holy kiss—the signet of betrothal.
               "Mine ever!"
               "Thine ever!"
               That was all the bright stars, the sweet flowers, the perfumed breeze, the phosphorescent waves and the flitting bird could have heard had they listened ever so well. It was all the wealth of burning hearts condensed into two words—the entire volume of love in a single breath. And entranced they sat—her head resting upon his shoulder—his arm supporting her slender form until a step was heard upon the snowy gravel of the walk.
               "My God! My father!" screamed Inez, as she looked up and tore herself from the embrace of her lover, and flew like a startled dove to the house.
               "Senor Bright, follow me!" said Gonzales, in a voice perfectly calm, but it was that calmness that is far more terrible than the loudest anger.
               "Senor, I—"
               "I have seen and heard all. Follow me."
               There was no alternative, and the lieutenant did as he was commanded. He entered the parlor where he had spent so many happy hours with Inez—he saw around him the books they had read together—saw the music she had sung to him—saw the very chairs remaining as they had left them—saw the wreath her delicate fingers had last twined, and then by the lamplight he saw the face of her father wearing such a frown as he had never seen upon the face of man before.
               "Senior, I—" he began again, and was again cut short with the same icy, devilish politeness.
               "I know, senor, the honor you propose to do me and mine. I fully understand and appreciate it all. For days, while you thought me far away I have been watching you, and preparing to return that honor." He clapped his hands—a half dozen of his almost slaves entered, and he continued, "Conduct Senor Bright to the chamber prepared for him."
               In an instant the men had closed upon him, and, despite all his struggles and his strength, he was dragged down—down—thrust into an opening—a door was closed upon him, and he was left in darkness.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               DUPLICITY.
               THE good ship, the Avenger, came dashing into the Bay of Panama, throwing the spray from her prow—a thing of beauty, almost of life. Her anchor was sent plunging down through the blue waves—the cable rattled through the hawse-hole—the smoke of a gun arose from amidships—the report was answered by hundreds of echoes on shore—she swung gracefully round—the sails were furled and jibs brailed up—a boat put off, landing the commander on shore, and very soon he was standing under the sheltering roof of Don Alvarado Gonzales.
               "How is Lieutenant Bright?" were almost the first words of the Englishman.
               "That is a question, senor, that is beyond my power of answering," was the reply.
               "What do you mean? Is he not here? What has happened to him?" was asked, in quick succession and alarm.
               "I can only answer as before—I do not know. Take a seat, senor, and let me offer you a glass of wine."
               "By Heaven! You take things coolly! I ask you for my lieutenant—one whom I left wounded in your house—wounded by one of your men, and you answer that 'you don't know.' and offer me a glass of wine!"
               "My race has the reputation, senor, of being fiery in their temper, but hereafter we must yield the palm to you in that respect."
               "No matter about me. What of George Bright?"
               "Sit down and I will tell you all I know."
               Phlegmatic as the English commander might have been at other times he certainly was not so now. All his feelings were aroused. The icy suavity of his host not only perplexed but disturbed him. Often before had he enjoyed the hospitalities of the house, but never seen Gonzales so perfectly at his ease, so entirely self-poised. He saw that it would avail him nothing to cross his humor, and so reluctantly threw himself into a chair and raised a glass of wine to his lips—lips more ready to utter oaths than hollow compliments.
               "Senor, your health," resumed the Spaniard.
               "Yours." The bulldog nature of the Englishman was not easy to be appeased, and his utterance was almost a growl.
               "And now of your lieutenant—a splendid fellow—whom I—"
               "If you have any bad news, for Heaven's sake do not keep me in suspense. Is he dead? I judge so from your manner."
               "You will believe readily—knowing me as you do—that everything was done for him that was possible."
               "Then it is as I feared—the wound proved mortal."
               "I cannot tell that. He was rapidly recovering, as we all thought, when his impulsive nature led him to imprudence. Ah! the young, senor, the young will not listen to the advice of their elders until it is too late."
               "At least, you can show me where he is buried, that I may have some memorial placed over him. Never better seaman trod a deck."
               "That I cannot do." He was far too crafty to be caught in such a trap.
               "Not show me where he is buried! Senor Gonzales, there is something strange in this story. By Saint George! if there has been any foul play in the matter, there will be more thunderbolts flying about here than those that come from the heavens. The Avenger has a magazine full, senor, and there is not a man on board but would fight to the death for poor George Bright."
               "Foul play? What do you insinuate by that, senor?" demanded the Spaniard, starting to his feet and crushing the delicate glass he held, with well-assumed anger. "Do you dare even to hint that I, Alvarado Gonzales, would be guilty of such a thing either in thought or action? By the cross, such words are dangerous things to come from any man's lips to me, senor."
               "I insinuate nothing. But what am I to think? Let me recommend to you, however, the advice that you gave me but a short time since, to keep cool. But think not that you can alarm me, senor. If you came of a proud race I came of a fearless one."
               "Pshaw! We are both of us talking and acting like children. If you had but patiently waited until I had finished, it would have prevented all misunderstanding."
               "Very likely, senor—very likely. Now I calmly bide your explanation."
               "Your friend—I might say mine, also, for I became strangely interested in the young man—was rapidly recovering, when he very imprudently left his room and house during my temporary absence, despite all the servants could do—despite the prayers and tears of my daughter."
               "Was he in his right mind?" asked the Englishman, feigning a calmness he was far from feeling.
               "I fear not. He would and did go to the brow of the hill and then—yes, it must have been in a moment of delirium—plunged into the sea."
               "And was lost! God help him, lost!"
               "The most skillful divers were instantly summoned and endeavored to save him, but without avail. The under-current must have swept him away."
               "And his body, senor?"
               "Has never been found."
               "George Bright food for sharks! Who will tell his mother and sisters—for his hard-hearted father I care not—but who will tell the others that such was his fate? Not I! not I!" and the strong man bowed his head, choked with emotion.
               "It is very, very sad indeed," replied the Spaniard, drawing his handkerchief over his eyes, as if he, too, deeply regretted the loss. "Very sad, and the effect on my daughter has been terrible."
               "I was just going to ask of her."
               "She was carried home and has not been able to leave her room—scarcely her bed since. Indeed we have had serious fears for her reason."
               "I can well believe that such a shock would be terrible to one so young and tender-hearted, senor. But tell me when this sad occurrence took place?"
               "This is the sixth day since."
               "And everything possible has been done to recover the body?"
               "Everything."
               "And you have not discovered the cowardly wretch who struck the blow beneath the waters? By Heaven! he should swing from the yard-arm before he was an hour older if I could lay my hands on him."
               "Such justice would not have waited for you, could I but have found him out. Believe me, senor, you cannot regret this sad accident more than I do."
               More questions and answers of a like tenor followed. The evident sorrow of his host—the report of the illness of his daughter, and the recollection of the terrible anger shown by him when the discovery of Bright's having been wounded was made, almost convinced the English commander that the story he had heard was true. Still the manner, so different from what had hitherto been the case when he visited Gonzales, made it difficult for him to stifle suspicion, and though he took his leave with the greatest apparent cordiality he resolved to have other testimony.
               To have gone among the divers himself would have been of little use. They were little better than slaves to Gonzales—would both lie and swear as he directed; in fact mere puppets. Other means consequently must be resorted to; cunning must be met by cunning, and having summoned a seaman who was perfectly familiar with the customs and language of the natives he sent him on shore as a spy.
               But three days of investigation proved nothing. The craft of the Spaniard threw those in his way whom he had thoroughly posted in the story to be told, and furnished with means, they soon had the seaman hopelessly under the influence of aguadiente. To shield himself, therefore, he rehearsed the tale that had been poured into his ears, and thus convinced, the commander of the Avenger again turned his prow seaward to carry the sad intelligence of the untimely fate of George Bright to England.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VI.
               THE PRISON CELL.
               AS soon as George Bright somewhat recovered from the violent shock he had received by being thrown upon the stone floor, he partially raised himself, endeavored to collect his senses and reflect upon his situation.
               The distance downward he had been dragged convinced him that he was under ground, far beyond the reach of human ears or assistance, unless he could bribe those who attended him—if indeed any did so. That his death was intended he had not the slightest doubt, else why had such harsh measures been resorted to? The very worst he had anticipated was to be turned out of doors with violent words, perhaps blows. Now he realized that a deeper and more deadly vengeance was determined upon—that if he ever saw the light of day again it must be the work of his own hands.
               Vainly he listened for any sound. The silence of the grave was not more profound. There was evidently no one watching him, for he had heard the jar of the heavy door as it closed behind him, the creakings of the rusty bolts and the sound of retiring footsteps. Yet still he was determined to venture nothing by premature haste, and so he remained quiet until he knew that it must be the "middle watch," and that probably all within the house were sleeping. Then he took from his pocket a little match-safe, struck a light and began his investigations.
               Rapid and superficial as they were forced to be, he was soon convinced that the place of his confinement was a very small room—one, little if any better than a cell—that the walls were of extreme thickness—that it was damp and the air foul, for the little flame he held burned blue and soon expired. In vain he tried the door—the fastenings were too strong to admit even of its being shaken. Yet he did not give way to despair. Sounding the wall he fancied that he found a spot less firm than the rest, and with only a little pocket knife he began to dig away the mortar. If he could once get out it would go very hard if he could not fight his way to the upper air and freedom.
               But he was obliged to work cautiously and rest often. His late severe injury and sickness had enervated his strong frame, and the chilling damp around was constantly sapping his constitution. Once a day he was visited by some one—who he could not tell, and coarse food and water thrust within. At other times, too, he heard the echo of footsteps, and thus fettered it was long before he had loosened a single stone.
               Time, patience and toil, however, will accomplish wonders, and though his strength was almost exhausted, and the slender blade of his knife worn to the handle, yet at length he was able to remove a stone, and putting his head through the orifice, look out. But he could see nothing. All was gloom and darkness. Very rapidly the space was enlarged—he forced his broad shoulders through, dragged his body, and again standing erect thanked God for escape. Very short, however, was his time of rejoicing. Scarcely had he taken ten steps forward before a bright light burst upon his eyes almost blinding them, and he was seized again by strong, hands, while the voice he knew but too well—the voice of Gonzales, thundered in his ears: "Fool! fool! Did you think thus to escape my vengeance? To the deepest dungeon now with him, and there let him learn what it is for a base-born to love the daughter of Alvarado Gonzales."
               Once more the unfortunate man was dragged to a prison cell, and this time far more loathsome than the other. But they were not content with its strong doors and walls. They also loaded him down with huge chains, and secured him to a ring sunk in the middle of the solid stone floor. By the light of their flaming torches he was enabled to see before their departure the horrors around him; for the vindictive Spaniard lingered long enough to gloat over his misery, as he told him of the imposition he had put upon his commander, and the sailing of the ship.
               No ray of light could possibly penetrate from without. The walls were massive, and the door a single narrow one thickly studded with copper bolts. Everything was coated with green mould, and upon the floor were scattered skulls and partially-decayed skeleton frames—the horrible records, and the only ones, of the slaves who had before fallen under the wrath of the Spaniard or his father, and pined their lives away—starved, perhaps, in this living grave!
               Not a single article of furniture was within the cell—nothing to rest upon but the flinty floor—nothing to shield him from the icy damps; and chained there, all of hope departed with the Spaniard and his myrmidons. The ponderous door swung to—the last glimmer of the torches was lost to his sight—the echo of their footsteps grew fainter in the distance; and with a groan of intense agony George Bright threw himself down and realized fully that he was left alone with darkness, death and God!
               Ah! what terrible thoughts flooded his brain then! He raised his hands, brushed back the clammy curls from his throbbing temples and tried to pray, but his lispings sounded like the mockery of words. His heart was filled with desolation—his fearless spirit almost broken. He had nothing but fleshless skeletons for companions. Not a living sound was to be heard, not even the dismal wailing of the night wind or the death-watch in the wall. Anything, anything would have been a relief. At last, in the hopeless agony of despair, he fell backwards exhausted, upon the clanking chains and the disjointed fragments of those who had once been gifted with life and strength and hope like himself.
               But he was not dead. Death, though he would have gladly shaken hands with it, was yet far distant. It rarely comes to those who are waiting and praying for it, for, although all times are his, yet he chooses that time. No, he was not dead, even if all of sensation was gone. Organic life yet had action—the lamp of the spirit burned, but the bleached and mouldering skeletons around him were not less motionless.
               And long he lay thus—how long he had no means of knowing—lay in a trance, with the mystic machinery of the mind unchecked. As in his waking moments, so even in his dreams, the image of her he loved so well and for whose sake he was suffering so much, filled his thoughts. Fancy painted Inez Gonzales by him in all her peerless beauty. Her soft hand was clasped in his; her breath was warm upon his cheeks, her kiss upon his lips. There was no stern, angry father to part them. Then there appeared to steal in upon him the music of her voice—a voice dwindled to the very shadow of a sound—a spectral whisper amid the awful silence of that dungeon vault. Was it mere phantasy—simply mind delirium? Could it be reality? Again and again it came to him soft as the murmuring of the shell pining for its ocean home; and yet it had all the terrible distinctness of the rattling of the clod upon the coffin to the heart of the mourner, and, touched again, as with life, the poor, pale prisoner arose and listened. Sight was deprived him, but while life remained bearing would be his with the most fatal acuteness.
               Suddenly a little light flashed in upon him—a mere glimmer as of the moon at its first rising; and yet it penetrated the darkness like a blazing sun, and he saw, looking through the little, grated opening at the door, the reality of his dream—Inez Gonzales!
               "Inez," he whispered, as if afraid to trust the sound of his own voice. "Inez! My God! can it be true that you have dared all dangers and darkness to come hither?" And he dragged himself to the length of his chain and covered the little hand she held out to him with burning kisses.
               "Yes, George. How could I sleep else? Every hour since you were torn from my side have I watched—watched for this moment. May the saints be thanked that I have found you alive. Here is food—wine. Take it while you may. Alas! that I could not bring you more. But, George, George, what will they do with you? I dare not question my father—dare not even think."
               "I know not," he answered, as cheerfully as possible, for he would not tell her of his horrid surroundings, nor let the iron enter her soul, although it was driven to the very bottom of his. "I know not, darling."
               "Is anything given you to eat?"
               "Yes—every day."
               "Then they do not intend to starve you. O, may the blessed Virgin have mercy upon us both! When I but think of the terrible tales my old nurse used to tell me of these dreadful vaults, I fear that I shall go mad—mad! But come nearer, my dear one, that I may see you more plainly."
               "I cannot, dearest. My range of motion is limited."
               "What, chained! Father as he is I could call down all the curses of Heaven upon him!"
               "Stain not your lips with such things, my Inez. I am not worthy of a great love like yours."
               
               "Not worthy! If all the good in every man in Mexico was taken from them and moulded into one, he would not be one tithe as good or noble as you. But, George, dearest, is there, can there be no way of escape?"
               "Not without help from others. I am powerless."
               "Alas! and I also."
               "The bolts, cannot you draw them back?"
               "No, no! I tried over and over again, but in vain, to move a single one before I called you. But if I could do so double locks remain."
               "Who has the keys?"
               "My father, and he never parts with them except to old Pedro."
               "Cannot you tamper with him? Is he not to be bought for gold?"
               "As well might you attempt to hurl back the molten laya that bursts from Cotopaxi as to induce him to do anything contrary to my father's will. Body and soul he is his slave."
               "And there is no other?"
               "I can think of none."
               "Then Heaven help us!"
               "But you must be free. O, that I were but a man! But, George, my dear one, do not despair. Let us trust in the blessed Virgin. She will not forsake us."
               "Inez, you are trembling. Your hand is as ice. The chilling damps are too much for your delicate frame. Go; you might be discovered."
               "Yes, my body is very, very cold, but my heart burns like fire within me. But if I suffer, how must it be with you?"
               "Think nothing of me. I am a man. Take care of yourself, and believe that whatever comes I shall love you devotedly to the last."
               "And I you, even through the darkness of the grave—in heaven." And he felt her hot tears falling upon his hand.
               "O, this is terrible, Inez! Were it not for you—for what I know you must endure on my account, I would willingly close my eyes for the last time. But for you I will struggle on—love on—hope on, until the end. Yet one question. Is it true that my ship has been here and gone again?"
               "Yes, yes! I saw it from my window—saw the senor come and go, for I was not permitted to leave my room while he was here. Yes, it is too true. My father—O, that I could blot out the very name from memory forever!—O, that I could free myself from such terrible relationship!—My father deceived him—told him that you were dead. O George, darling, if it had been true I should have died too!"
               "And he will carry the news to England. Alas! how will my poor mother bear it! Inez," and he spoke with startling earnestness, "Inez, I must be free! It cannot be that a just Heaven will permit such love as ours to be blasted while yet in its springtime. Think of some means—some plan—some one you can trust."
               "George, precious, you wrong me. Have I not thought of it both by day and night? Ah! it has never been out of my mind."
               "Forgive me, I might have known it. But you can devise no means?"
               "None. Alas! none."
               "If the commander had but thought for a moment—even fancied—but that hope has gone. But, Inez, we must part now. Think on, plan on."
               "Trust me."
               "I do, as I do Heaven."
               "And I you. But I must go. If my father—any one should detect me in being here your hardships might be increased, and that, by any act of mine, would be more than I could bear."
               Again and again they tried to tear themselves apart, but in vain. Neither hand would release its clasping—neither lips cease to repeat their passionate kisses. It was like the tearing asunder of hearts. Vows the fondest and truest that could be uttered were given—love to death—love after it, to all eternity.
               "Go—God bless you!—go," murmured the prisoner, forcing himself at length to let go the little hand whose touch to him was as that of an angel.
               "The saints guard you!" was whispered back amid convulsive sobs.
               Yet still the beautiful, passion-swayed girl would have lingered had not a sudden gust of wind swept through the vaults and extinguished her lamp. Then she groped her way along through the darkness, reached the stairs and was about to go up when she saw to her intense horror, that her father and the old jailor Pedro were descending. Instinctively she shrank back into a niche in the wall, waited motionless until they had passed, and then flew to the floor above and to her own chamber.
               But they caught a glimpse of something—saw a shadow—heard the rustle of her dress, and both looked anxiously around.
               "What was that, senor?" asked the man, trembling with fear.
               "What, Pedro?"
               Gonzales, too, was not without superstition, but he was far too proud to exhibit any want of courage before his inferior.
               "I saw something white fly up the stairs, senor."
               "Pshaw! you are dreaming."
               "Not I, senor. I saw it plainly, and it did not open the door—I know I shut it when we came down—but went right through it. Great Heaven! if it should be a ghost."
               "You are mistaken, Pedro. The aguadiente you drank last night has affected your brain."
               "No, senor, and I have often heard groans and shrieks and rattling of chains, and seen spirits here before. May the Virgin and the holy Saviour pardon all my sins!"
               "Fool!" exclaimed Gonzales, striving to work himself into a passion so as to conceal his own feelings. "Fool! you are getting too old and nervous for your post. Unless you can control yourself, a younger and bolder man will have to take your place. Come, show your light, and let me hear no more of this nonsense."
               The cell of George Bright was opened. They saw him stretched upon the damp floor and apparently sleeping soundly. Fortunately the alarm they had received made their examination hasty and superficial. Had it been otherwise they could not have failed to discover the food and little bottle of wine Inez had brought, and then all the good results of her visit and the fright they had received would have been entirely done away with.
               "Senor, may I not bring a blanket to-morrow?" asked Pedro, as they were returning hastily up the stairs. "Ugh! it is so cold and wet down here."
               "Better attend to your own affairs. You said you were certain that you saw something white flitting up the stairs?"
               "Si, senor. As certain as that I am alive this minute."
               "Humph! Well, it was all imagination. Go and finish your nap, Pedro, and beware of your cups."
               The old man, whose nerves had indeed received a most terrible shock, hastened to obey. He was very glad to escape and be in more congenial society. The thoughts of the master ran in an entirely different channel.
               "Something white," he muttered between his clenched teeth as he paced uneasily up and down, pausing now and then to fill and drain a goblet of wine. "Something white! Pedro thinks it was a ghost. What if he should be right? But no, no; I must give way to no such foolish fear. More likely it was Inez. By Saint Iago! But that is well thought of, and must be looked to instantly." And he hastened to his daughter's chamber and demanded admittance.
               It was some time, however, before he was allowed to enter. Then he saw nothing to confirm his suspicions—made a blundering excuse and retired again. Still he was not satisfied until after he had questioned the maid-servant the following morning, and heard her swear by all the saints in the calendar that her young mistress had not stirred from her chamber. And she was honest in her belief—for she had slept the entire night!
               And the poor prisoner, too, had rested well. The visit he had received, the food and generous wine had worked wonders, and for the first time since his incarceration he had been blessed by an unbroken slumber of hours' duration and heavenly dreams of Inez Gonzales.
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               JOAQUIN.
               DAY after day Gonzales visited his prisoner and found to his astonishment that his health appeared to be getting better, instead of failing, as he supposed would be the case. This was an enigma that he could find no solution to, especially after having seen the frugal allowance of simple and coarse bread and water that Pedro doled out to him. But if he saw him days, Inez never failed of doing so and amply supplying his wants at night, and having made a confidant of her sleepy maid, she was able, especially after the fright Pedro had received, of doing so with comparatively little danger.
               
               To keep him thus, consequently, until death came in the course of nature, appeared to be putting vengeance very far off. He might die first—probably would, and then Inez being his sole heir would free him—take him to her heart and make him master of all his vast wealth. And that daughter he avoided altogether. There had been one stormy scene between them—all vituperation and oaths on his side and tears on hers. The priest had interfered—advised him to trust to time to cure the love she cherished for the English sailor, or in attempting to bend her heart to his will he would break it—and be daughterless.
               To carry out this plan he invited the most noted gallants to visit his house—but she scorned them all. He devised all manner of fetes—but she would not go to them. He talked to her of the foolishness of loving one who was dead, but she only smiled sadly; and at last, entirely out of patience, resolved upon the speedy death of her lover, believing that after she had seen his corpse she would be more willing to listen to what he called reason. But the manner of his death required thought. It was very easy for him to hire an assassin. There were plenty of bravos who would not scruple to do such a deed for money. But the mark of the stiletto would be there—there would be telltale blood—curious eyes might look at the corpse and curious tongues babble. No, he must devise some better plan than that, for he was determined that his daughter should have ocular proof that her love was useless, and there must be nothing connected with it that would turn her against him. He had explained to her that he was simply keeping her lover in confinement to guard against their meeting, and that he intended him no harm. And he fancied she believed him! Ah! how little he knew of the height and the breadth and the depth of a woman's love!
               But once resolved upon his course he was not long in concocting a plan that he was certain could not fail, and mounting his horse he rode swiftly away along the shore until he came to a little hut, before which were seen strewn about the various articles used by fishermen.
               The tide was out, the boat resting idly upon the shore, and a man was seated amid the debris of years of toil opening a few pearl oysters he had obtained surreptitiously, and throwing them into a rude trough for the sun to decompose, and reveal their glittering stores, if any.
               "What luck, Joaquin?" asked Gonzales, as he dismounted and threw his bridle-rein over a stake used to secure the boat.
               "Very little, senor," was the reply, as the Mexican lifted up his head and revealed a pair of piercing black eyes and a face lined both by age and the unchecked sway of all the baser passions. "Very little, senor. There was a time when the bay was free for all men's fishing—now the one who does the work gets the least of all."
               "Still you appear to do very well, without paying tithes to either your patron or the church."
               "Yes—but how? I must live as well as you, senor."
               "Certainly," was the conciliatory reply, though at another time Gonzales would have thundered his wrath at the manner in which his placeres had been robbed. "Certainly. It is but right that you should live. How came it that you did not get one of the gold pieces or the cross the other day, Joaquin? You are one of the best divers in Panama, and I thought you were certain of success."
               The man glanced up at him sharply from under his slouched sombrero, with a dangerous light in his eyes, but he made no response and Gonzales continued:
               "It was a shame to let that Englishman carry off the prize from you all—a burning shame!"
               "It was not my fault. I did try, senor."
               "I know you did; and when you could not get it by fair means, you let him feel the strength of your arm and the sharpness of your knife."
               "Me, senor?" And the diver started as if he had received a blow.
               "Yes, you. Did you think that I did not know it at the time? Why did you remain below longer than the rest if it was not to wash away the blood?"
               "He was a heretic, senor."
               That confession was enough for Gonzales. He had only fancied before that what he asserted was true. Now he knew it, and it gave him the complete control over the man that he desired to possess.
               "So he was, Joaquin; but you know the law would take your life for the act."
               "It was little I cared for the cross, senor. It was for your honor that I struck the blow."
               
               Now that his guilt was discovered, and justice stood threatening him, he cowered like a whipped spaniel in abject fear, and attempted to shuffle off his sin on his master's shoulders.
               "For me?" replied Gonzales, sternly. "For me? Never dare to mention my name in connection with the matter, or by the cross you will dearly rue the day. What! I permit such a deed! Well for you that others did not see as plainly as I did, or you would have swung from the yard-arm of the English ship without time even for confession or prayers."
               "Pardon, senor."
               "Well, you are an old and faithful servant, and I care not to have you punished, especially, as you say, this man was a heretic. But, Joaquin, be careful in the future."
               "I will remember, senor."
               "I came to warn you, but I had, also, another object. As the Englishman is dead—"
               "Dead! Would to God I had never touched him!"
               "You may well pray so. As I said he is dead, the ship has come and gone, and nothing more will be said of the matter, unless, remember, unless I should speak of it. But I will not do so if you keep your hands from blood hereafter."
               "Many thanks, senor." And a cloud was removed from his face, and a load from his heart.
               "And, Joaquin, you know every part of the shore and the islands, do you not?"
               "Every foot of them, senor."
               "And where the vampires breed and the tarantulas are to be found?"
               "As well as I know the path to my little ranche. Often have I caught them for the English and American captains."
               "And you think you could get me some?"
               "Si, senor."
               "A half a dozen of each would do. I want them to send to some friends who are curious in such matters. Can you get them for me to-day?"
               "Not so many, senor. It would take more time."
               "How long? I am in haste."
               "Six days, perhaps."
               "Well, here is gold for you. When you have caught them put them in secure cages and bring them to me. And, Joaquin, I would not have you say anything about it. I wish to surprise my friends. Do you understand?"
               "The diver cares nothing what becomes of the pearl after it has passed from his hands. Why should he for bats and spiders?"
               "It is well. Good-day, Joaquin. The sooner you can fill the order I have given you the better it will please me. And remember, never use your knife against a stranger."
               With this parting shot Gonzales mounted and rode home again, pondering deeply on what he had done and what he was about to do. And the poor Mexican he had left behind pondered also. Although he had kept his own counsel yet he had kept a strict watch as well, and was satisfied that the man he had wounded had never been carried out either dead or alive from the mansion of his patron. There could not have been a funeral without his having heard of it, for, although he did not belong to the Catholic church, there were enough of his countrymen to have buried the sailor with at least a show of mourning, and they would not have failed to do so. Reasoning thus he did not believe that he was dead, but that for some motive of his own—what he had no means of knowing—Gonzales had put him out of the way, for a time at least. He was not unacquainted by rumor, if by no other means, that there were strong places of confinement in many of the grandees' houses, and more than one had been missing within his recollection whose fate could never be traced. In his own mind, therefore, he settled the question that George Bright was still alive, and cursing the proud man who had attempted to lord it over him, he determined to find out the truth.
               But what could Gonzales want of blood-sucking bats and venomous spiders? There was no ship in the harbor by which he could send them abroad, and that any one residing there should want them was beyond reason. Very much was he perplexed, and long and anxiously he thought upon the matter. Then, being unable to satisfy himself, he turned to the unfailing resort of all his class at such times—the priest.
               "You have done well, my son, to come to me with your troubles and confess your sins," was the answer he received, "but trouble not yourself with the affairs of those above you. The church looks after all her children, and Alvarado Gonzales is no more to her than the poorest fisherman that casts his nets in the bay."
               "But, father, the vampires and tarantulas?"
               
               "Get them. You have received pay therefor, and you must honestly earn it. It would be stealing if you did not do so."
               "I will obey, father."
               "As you would hereafter receive absolution neglect it not. Go now—yet stay. How soon can you procure them?"
               "It may be days."
               "It matters not; but on all the pains and perils after death do you let me know before you take them to Gonzales."
               "Why, father?"
               "Question not, but obey. There are many means used that work together for a great good that you cannot understand. Go now, my son, benedicite! and remember that you bring me the first information, and that none other knows of it. Remember!" And the priest held up his finger warningly.
               This was a command that the poor ignorant diver did not dare disobey, and with a much lighter pocket, if not heart, he set out at once upon his dangerous quest. To accomplish it he knew that he would have to penetrate the haunts where in the thick jungle, the fierce jaguar lay in wait for its prey, and all that was loathsome and poisonous in reptile and insect life was to be found.
               Long after his departure the priest sat in deep thought. He knew far more than the poor fisherman the motives and passions of men—knew many of the secrets of the underground caverns in the home of the rich Spaniard. But he, also, was in a maze. Vampires and loathsome spiders were things that all men shunned—not made playthings of, and reflect as he would he could find no tangible reason for their having been required at that particular time. But thought only perplexed him the more, and taking his hat and staff he walked slowly towards the house of Gonzales.
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               FATHER BARTOLOME.
               VAIN were the inquiries of the holy father for the head of the household. He had gone abroad, so he was told, and would not return until late. But would Father Bartolome come in and rest? Yes, he would see the senorita, and very shortly he was summoned to the boudoir of the fair Inez.
               "Your blessing, santisimo padre," said the fair girl, as she knelt at his feet, and bowed her head almost to the floor.
               "You have it, my daughter;" and he gently raised her to a seat and continued—"It is long since you have been to the confessional, my child."
               "It is, father. Had I not been forbidden to leave the house, you would have had no fault to find with me."
               "Forbidden to come to confessional! Who dare set up their mandates against those of the church, my daughter?"
               "My father."
               The brow of the good old priest darkened—the color came and went in his wrinkled face, tinging the very roots of his long white hair with purple, for a moment, and then leaving face and brow as unflushed as before. But the revelation revealed the fiery heart that beat beneath the vestments, although forty years of ascetic life had striven to tame it.
               "You do well, my daughter," he continued, to obey your father—it is one of the commands of the church; and yet he should have strong, very strong reasons for the exercise of such authority."
               "He thinks he has, father. O, I am so glad you have come. I would have sent for you this very day. I am suffering so much. Will you listen, father."
               "Now and ever."
               In broken sentences and with many tears the fair penitent poured her tale of love into the ear of her father confessor. She described George Bright in all his manly beauty—threw around him the halo of love—told of their first meeting—of his wound and how he had received it—of their terrible separation in the garden—of his confinement in the loathsome cell—of her first and subsequent visits to him—told everything without the least self-exculpation.
               "He is a heretic," was the stern answer, after the priest had become fully acquainted with the matter.
               "But he is good, father, good, and I love him so!"
               "Love is a curse to many hearts. Daughter, you have not done well. You should have fled from him as from a serpent."
               "Father, can the flower turn from the sun? Can the magnolia close its cup to the dew, or the violet cease its perfume?"
               "These are but wild questions. Inez Gonzales, I charge ye to forget this stranger."
               "Bid me drive a dagger to my heart—bid me jump from yonder cliff into the sea, and I will do it. To forget or cease to love this man—I never can!"
               She had arisen with the words, and stood before him in all her dazzling beauty, with her cheeks red with the deep passion of her heart, and her eyes flashing as he had never seen them before. Was this she who had ever been unquestioningly his pupil? Was this the girl who had never had any will of her own? Almost with a sigh he looked upon her—upon the compressed lips and little clenched hands. She had thrown off the chrysalis of a girl and was a woman. Love had touched her with its magic wand, and she would shrink no more, but do and dare and suffer.
               "My poor child!" replied the old priest, compassionately, as he took one of her burning hands within his own, smoothed back the glossy hair from her forehead, and looked into the heretofore meek eyes. "My poor child, I fear you have shipwrecked your heart. Proud of his blood, his station and his wealth, your father will never forgive this young man for loving you. In his view of the matter it is the greatest of crimes."
               "Is it wrong to love?"
               "Ask me not the question. I cannot answer it. Ask it not. The saints and the blessed Virgin forgive me, but it brings back thoughts—thoughts burning as lava that I fancied I had trampled under foot forever."
               "Then even you did love once, father, and it cannot be sinful. Now! now! you cannot blame me;" and she clasped her hands and looked upward in thankfulness.
               "I did not say it was a sin. Love comes from the Godhead and goes whither it is sent. No, it is not a sin, but in your case it will be fatal!"
               "Fatal? Father, to whom?"
               "To both, I fear. Your lover will never leave his prison cell alive, and then you—"
               "Will die!"
               "It is as I feared. Yet human hearts have recovered from such shocks—the cloister is yet open, my child."
               "And so is the grave! Father, do what you will with me, but save—save him;" and she flung herself at his feet in all the wild agony of despair, clasped his knees, and looked at him with streaming eyes.
               "My daughter, I would save you. These hands baptized you, and, God willing, they would have blessed you in your marriage. But it cannot—cannot be. With a heretic, never!"
               "Father, if he should believe?"
               "It is vain talking thus, my daughter. Yet, tell me more of him—of how he is confined—of what your father has said."
               "And you will help him—gain his freedom?"
               "I did not say that. But sit down and calm yourself. Thought must be free from passion."
               With far more minuteness than before Inez Gonzales spoke of her lover. It was a theme she would never tire of. But when she came to tell of his prison, tears again choked her utterance. Vain, however, were all her efforts to obtain a promise from Father Bartolome that he would assist her lover to escape. Pity for the sufferings of the beautiful girl would have led him to do so, but duty to the church and the many favors bestowed upon him by her father forbade.
               But there was one thing that he saw plainly now. That was the reason why Gonzales had sent the diver Joaquin after vampire bats and tarantula spiders. They were to poison and suck the blood from the poor victim, whose only crime was loving as fair a piece of handiwork as ever trod God's footstool. Yes, in the darkness of the dungeon the little of life that remained was to be drained from him and his soul sent to eternity unabsolved. This was a terrible thought to the good priest, and though he saw no way to accomplish his object he was determined that it should not be so. And fain would he have gone home and thought over the matter, for there were so many differences to be reconciled—so much to be avoided—so many rugged spots to smooth. But Inez clung to him, and on her knees begged him to save the one who was dearer to her than life itself.
               "Be comforted, my poor daughter!" was all he could reply, with his voice trembling with emotion. "God knows what is best for us, and has given us all crosses to bear. Commit your lover to his keeping—trust in him. Have you faith to do so?"
               "Father, I have!"
               "My brave child! Then trust me, too, as the humble instrument in his hands. Come to me three days hence, or if you do not I will come to you."
               "And you will save him, father? O, tell me that and I will pray Heaven to bless yon!"
               "It is your duty to ever pray. I cannot promise now, but remember that I am your friend as well as your spiritual adviser. Come to me with all your sorrows, and you will find an open ear."
               "And, father, vuestra santidad—"
               "Nay, there is none holy but God."
               "Father, may I see him again—may I take him food?"
               "Stolen interviews are never to be encouraged, but in this case I may not deny you that poor comfort."
               "The saints and all the holy angels bless you!"
               "And pardon me if I do wrong."
               "And may I tell him, father, that you—"
               "Tell him nothing. Tell no one what has passed between us, and do not build hopes upon it either. I do not know as I can do anything. I cannot see my course clear. It will require much prayer and thought before I can decide. If he were not a heretic, then—"
               "Father! Father! he is not. He loves God as much as I do. Ah! is there only one road to heaven!"
               "We may not know, my daughter. Our church believes it is the only Catholic one—but—but we had better not talk of such things, at least not now. Neither your mind nor mine is in a fit state for such things. There may be more paths than one that lead to heaven. I hope there is God bless and keep you my daughter!" he said, as he raised his withered hands above her head and then passed quickly out. He dared not trust himself longer. His voice was broken and his eyes overflowing with tears. There were so many points alike in their history that he was completely unmanned. Alas! poor old man, do what you can—struggle as you may, you can never find forgetfulness until the sods of the valley lie heavily upon you."
               Necessity and years of practice had, however, taught him self-control, and once out of the presence of Inez he dried his eyes, resumed his habitual manner, and none who saw him would have suspected that so calm a face concealed a burning volcano within. And with the change returned his customary shrewdness—the lover had entirely vanished—the priest was himself again.
               "Where is Pedro?" he asked, of a passing domestic.
               "I will call him, father."
               "Do so. Has the senor returned?"
               "No, your reverence."
               "Then send Pedro to me. I will await him here."
               A few moments was given him for calm thought, and he made good use of it. Pedro, too, must confess. He could tell him all about the prisoner, and then he could act more understandingly.
               "Pedro," he said, solemnly, when the old jailor made his appearance, "why have you not been to confession?"
               "I was coming, your holiness, but—"
               "There can be no excuse in such matters. This very evening I shall expect you."
               "Yes, your holiness. But I told you true when I said I was coming, for I have some things that lay very heavy on my conscience."
               "I will await you two hours before the going down of the sun. Pass not another night in your sins, my son. Remember!"
               "I shall not fail."
               And he did not. Punctual to a minute he arrived, and rehearsed his story of the prisoner, and the ghost he had seen, and the groans he heard.
               "It must be exorcised," said the priest. "Pedro, have you ever stained your hands in blood?"
               "Never, father, never!"
               "But this prisoner, are you not freezing and starving him?"
               "I do as the patron bids me. The sin is his, not mine."
               Almost a smile played round the mobile lips of the old man as he heard the easy way sin was to be shifted from one shoulder to another, but he restrained himself and continued:
               
               "It is one of the holy precepts of our church, Pedro, that servants should obey their masters in all that is right—mind, I say right—but no further. And this poor man, what has he done?"
               "He has dared to love the senorita, father."
               "True, I had forgotten, and of course deserves punishment for so great and heinous a crime!"
               "The patron thinks so"
               "I suppose you have secured him beyond the chance of escape?"
               "He is chained to the floor."
               "How? By his arms and feet?"
               "No, your reverence, by a chain locked around his body."
               "A safe—very safe way, Pedro."
               "It is, your reverence."
               Blind and dumb to all but his master's bidding, the man failed to see the sarcasm hid behind the words of the priest, and consequently had no suspicion that he was telling of things altogether beyond the pale of the confessional.
               "Well, Pedro, I have no right, even if I had the inclination, to interfere with your master's purposes, but this poor man has a soul, and it is my duty to try and save that."
               "He is a heretic, father."
               "And so much the more to be pitied. Take him this prayer-book, Pedro, and if there is light enough for him to read it, much good may come to him. See, it is a simple book. Look at it sharp."
               "No, your reverence. Far be it from me to question your acts. But the poor fellow—I do pity him, father—can never see to read a single word."
               "Then leave him a bit of candle. Stay, I will give you one. By it you may be the means of saving a soul. Let me wrap it up for you. The good we do should be done in secret. There—give it to the poor man this very night. Go now. I would be alone."
               And again the tender-hearted priest sat and pondered, and again his lips moved, first in prayer and then to give utterance to his thoughts.
               "Surely it cannot be wrong. Love is no crime. Yes, I must save him, if I can. Once out of the power of Gonzales, and he can return to his own land, and Inez will forget him and be happy in the affection for some one that even her stern father will not object to. Poor child! how my heart bleeds for her!"
               From that hour he counted the moments until the coming of the diver Joaquin. And the second night he came.
               "Well, Joaquin?" he asked, eagerly.
               "The patron met me as I was coming hither and took the vampires and the tarantulas away from me, father."
               "Now may—" Good and holy man as he was, a curse almost arose to his lips. That simple action had caused the disarrangement of all his plans.
               "I tried to shun him, father, indeed I did, but could not"
               "I believe you, Joaquin. How many had you each of the vile things?"
               "More than a dozen. I never saw them so plenty or easily caught before. They seemed to come directly in my way."
               "The devil sent them!"
               With all speed, though kindly, Father Bartolome dismissed the chagrined man, took from a number of bottles one of peculiar shape and very carefully sealed, placed it in his bosom and started for the house of Alvarado Gonzales.
            
            
               CHAPTER IX.
               VAMPIRES AND TARANTULAS!
               "PEDRO, where have you been?" was the question asked of the old jailor, by his master, as he entered the house on his return from that of the priest.
               "To confession, senor."
               "And you babbled of him down below, I presume?"
               "He was not one of my sins, senor."
               How could he tell what had passed between the good father and himself without revealing that he carried a prayer-book about him which he had promised to give to the prisoner, as well as to furnish him with a light to read it by? But Pedro was far too Catholic for that. His master might glut his vengeance upon the body, but the soul should not be without a chance for safety. On that he was determined, and so, without telling an absolute untruth, he managed to evade a direct answer.
               
               "No," replied his master, haughtily; "but as you are so willing to throw all the blame upon my shoulders, mind that you do not talk of it at all. The priest need not know—you understand me—need not know of him down stairs, unless I choose to tell him. Have you seen or heard anything more of what you foolishly fancied were ghosts, Pedro?"
               "Yes, senor. Every night I hear horrible groans and often see a white figure, but the father says I need not fear, for they will never harm me as long as I do right."
               "So you told him about that?" continued Gonzales, waxing wroth. "By Saint Iago! but we'll soon have the old fool meddling with what is none of his business. Best for him that he keeps away or—"
               He did not think it advisable to tell his servitor what his intention was if the good father undertook to interfere in the management of his household. Yet he would take matters more into his own hands—keep others from knowing his plans, and by speedy means put the stout-hearted Englishman beyond the possibility of being saved by any one. With this resolution he dismissed Pedro, after what he had done, and a warning for the future. Then he hastened below by a private staircase and began the accomplishment of his devilish ends, for who, save there was something fiendish in their nature, would even have thought of such means as he had in view?
               Tired with long watching for his darling Inez, who had failed to come to see him for the two previous nights, the prisoner lay at full-length and was dreaming sweet dreams as he ever did of her.
               "Inez, my pearl of pearls," he murmured audibly, "nothing ever can or shall part us for—"
               His speech grew indistinct, but the proud Spaniard had heard enough. His brow was blacker than starless midnight, and if there had remained a single throb of compassion in his heart it was instantly banished.
               "Inez, my darling," again came softly from the lips of the sleeper. "I will yet be free, and then—"
               "Will you?" answered Gonzales, between his set teeth. "Will you be free? Yes before the sun shines again you will be free—but not as you think. Awake, senor!"
               "Who are you?" asked the pale prisoner, for, though his eyes were accustomed to the darkness, the bright flashing of the torch dazzled him for a moment.
               "Have you forgotten me so soon? I did not think that."
               "Gonzales!"
               "Ay, Senor Bright, and I fear I shall have to do something to keep myself more freshly in your memory."
               "Monster!"
               "A hard name, senor."
               He was using the same icy politeness with which he had received the commander of the Avenger on his last visit. His lips were tortured to a smile, but it was such an one as a serpent might wear while luring a bird to its poisoned kiss—the smile that preludes death!
               "Monster!" again repeated the prisoner, clenching his hands and striving to break his chains.
               "It is a very hard name, senor, especially as I came to set you free."
               "Set me free! Is it—can it be true that God has so softened your heart?"
               "Certainly. Now that the passion of the moment is passed, and I have had time for calm reflection, it appears hard that you should be kept here any longer."
               "And for no crime. If I did and do love your daughter, how could it be otherwise? No one could see her and not love her."
               "I thank you for the compliment, senor."
               "You see her only with the eyes of a parent. She is more beautiful than the sunlight to one long confined as I have been, and more bright than the stars would appear if they flashed amid the gloom of this dungeon."
               "Poetical!"
               "And true. Who, then, could help loving her as deeply and madly as I do?"
               "Madly? It is a good word. But do you in reality love her still?"
               "I do, and shall until death, come what may."
               "Such faithful love should not be without its reward. Can you believe, senor, that all you have been called upon to pass through was simply a test of your affection?"
               "Believe it? It appears incredible. It was very, very severe. Surely you could have found some other test."
               "Not that would have answered my purpose. It must have been so as not to leave a shadow of a doubt."
               "And you cannot doubt any longer, Senor Gonzales?"
               
               "I do not."
               "And you will set me free?"
               "Yes. I pledge you my word."
               "When? O, tell me when?"
               "This very night."
               "Thank Heaven!"
               If ever a fervent prayer was uttered it was that. It came from the very depths of the heart, and kind angels should have swiftly carried it—telegraphed it as it were by spiritual electricity, to the bright throne beyond the clouds.
               "Yes, this very night," repeated Gonzales, with the most sardonic of smiles, "and would you like to know how?"
               "What matter can that make, so long as I see the blessed sunlight and clasp Inez once again to my heart?"
               "Fool! Fool! Sunlight and Inez you will never see again. You shall be free from this dungeon only to find a place in a darker one. Can you guess what it is?"
               "No, no!" George Bright, lion-hearted as he was, felt so entirely stricken down by the change of manner and words that he had not power to utter more.
               "The grave!" And all the terrible passions of his nature blazed in the face of the Spaniard; his black eyes flashed like balls of fire, and his lips curled until the line of white teeth was plainly to be seen.
               "And you raised my hopes for this? Raised me almost to heaven, that I might—"
               "Sink the deeper into hell! You see Inez! You clasp my daughter again to your heart! O, fool! dupe! By the cross, I would strike her dead at my feet, only child as she is, before you should again even hear the sound of her voice."
               "My God! is this to be the end of all my dreams of happiness! Why did you not strike me dead?"
               "Because I intended that you should learn what it was to love my daughter—learn how terrible is the vengeance of a Spaniard."
               "Terrible indeed. O, that I had but five minutes of freedom and a cutlass in this good right hand! O, that my shipmates were but near and knew of this!"
               "You are as much dead to them as if the sod was already over you—and they believe you so. But have you no curiosity as to the manner of your death? Methinks if I were situated ated as you are, I should like to know how I was to leave the world."
               "No, I care not."
               "Then I will tell you. Listen. It will be a pleasant story. Do you see these cages? One is filled with vampire bats—the other with tarantula spiders. Pleasant, isn't it, to think how your blood will boil with poison and be sucked out—what a death of torture you will die and a horrible, bloated corpse you will be! Isn't it pleasant, senor?"
               "Man! man! But you are not a man. You are a devil in human shape."
               "Still more. You want to see Inez. That cannot be, but when these monsters have done their work she shall come and see you! I promise you that. Are you satisfied?"
               "Anything—anything but that. Do with me as you will—let me fester, rot, die here by inches, but, for the love of Heaven, never let her know my fate."
               "I must applaud your fine sense of honor, senor," was the sneering reply, "but she deserves punishment as well as you."
               "No, no, all the blame was mine—mine alone—let only me suffer."
               "You plead eloquently."
               "Do I? I wish my words were fire that they might burn into your soul, Senor Gonzales. But see me on my knees—see me in the dust at your feet, and hear me for her dear sake."
               "And feel me spurn you like a dog!"
               "But think, she is your daughter—your only child."
               "You do well to remind me of it."
               "But you will either drive her mad or kill her."
               "Either would be preferable to loving such a base-born as you are. By Saint Iago! but the blood of the Gonzales was never so insulted before. I would to Heaven that you had an hundred lives—that you could be made to die daily for years. Then, indeed I might fill up the cup of my revenge. Poor, poor slave that you have only one life."
               "Terrible man, have you no fear of Heaven? Remember God can see through dungeon walls—that his arm is mighty and—"
               "That one of his false priests may soon be meddling with this business. Now, senor, if it would make death more pleasant for you I will bring Inez to see you in the midst of your struggles. But no, she might be fool enough to fly into your arms even then. No, you shall not have the poor consolation of knowing that any one is near you. No, you shall die in darkness and alone!"
               "Fiend! Fiend!"
               "Better call upon the God you pretend to worship, and see if he can save you!" And with this almost blasphemy upon his lips Gonzales left the cell, after opening the cages, carefully closing the door behind him, and then fastening up the little opening so that there would be no possible means for the monstrosities of nature to escape.
               "Now, Senor Bright," he said, continuing his mock and freezing politeness. "Now, senor, you will have company in plenty—pleasant company! Hark! You can already hear the rustle of wings that will soon fan you softly to sleep, What glorious dreams you will have, and what a dainty feast the great spiders! Yes, your beloved shall see you. Aha! will she not like to kiss your swollen and blackened lips, and clasp your bloated and poisoned corpse to her breast! Wont that be a glorious betrothal!"
               Very much longer the Spaniard would have remained and gloated over the silent agony of his victim—silent, for he was far too proud to answer to his taunts—had he not heard the sound of footsteps descending the stairs, and hastening thither met Pedro.
               "What brought you here at this time?" he demanded sternly.
               "I am taking him something to eat. He has had nothing since last night, and must be hungry by this time, poor fellow, in such a dark hole."
               "I had thought of that, and have taken him his supper myself—taken him plenty. It will be long before he will need any more to eat, and henceforth, Pedro, I will attend to him, so you need not give yourself any more trouble. Let me see what kind of food you intended to supply him with. It strikes me that the simple diet I ordered agrees with him most marvellously well."
               Luckily for Pedro the basket he held in his hand had but the coarsest of fare and water. Had the prayer-book and candle he had promised to convey to him been concealed within the Spaniard would have cut him down in an instant. But a single look satisfied him his orders had been obeyed in that respect at least. Even more, it satisfied him that Pedro was faithful, and having reiterated his commands that no one was to visit the prisoner on any pretence, he returned up stairs, closely followed by his almost slave. Then he sought to cool his fiery temper by repeated draughts of wine—thus adding the fiercest fuel to the already raging flames.
               But Pedro, although he was stanch with regard to the physical, had the spiritual too much at heart, and was too profoundly under the sway of the priesthood to dare to disobey their slightest wishes, and having satisfied himself that he could safely do so, stole noiselessly down stairs again. Long before he reached the door of the cell, however, his footsteps were arrested and the very blood in his veins appeared to chill—his hair to stand upright—his limbs to tremble under him—his ears to ring as though an hundred anvils were beaten by as many hammers, and great drops of clammy sweat to start out from his forehead.
               In vain he crossed himself, muttered prayers and kissed the universal emblem of humanity upon the cover of the holy book he carried. Do what he would, his feet appeared to have been suddenly fastened to the stony floor. Often had he heard, or fancied he heard, horrible sounds, but those that now filled the gloomy vaults rendered the others as nothing. And all proceeded from the cell of the poor prisoner.
               There was a rustling as if the scales of a thousand serpents were clashing together—a rapid and fierce clanking of chains—groans and unearthly cries—indescribable noises all commingled together, as if all the ghosts in the world were let loose for a holiday and keeping high carnival within that little cell.
               But something at length impelled him forward. Like a boy whom night finds in the immediate vicinity of a graveyard, he was afraid to advance, and yet dared not remain where he was. So, nerving himself as best he might and clasping the holy book in one hand and the cross that was attached to his beads in the other, he crept at a snail's pace to the door and whispered:
               "Senor Bright." But his teeth chattered so that it was some moments before he could go on. "Senor, for the sake of the holy Jesus tell me what is the matter—tell me if you are still alive."
               "Alive! yes, Pedro," answered the prisoner, as soon as he recognized the voice. "Alive, but not likely to be so long. Your master has filled the cell with horrid vampires and tarantulas, and God only knows what other hideous and poisonous things, and they are sucking out my very heart's blood, fight them off as I may."
               "May the saints have mercy!"
               "The keys, Pedro. Get the keys and open the door, as you hope for salvation."
               "I cannot—cannot. The senor has them, and I am forbidden to even come to see you."
               "Then my blood will be upon your head."
               "For the love of the blessed Virgin do not curse me;" and the poor man trembled so violently that he was forced to cling to the heavy bolts of the door for support.
               "I am too near death for that, but hold out your hands for—"
               "Villain!"
               And Pedro found himself stricken to the floor by the heavy hand of his master!
               But there was no light, and before Gonzales could secure him he had dashed up stairs, out of doors, and was flying to the house of the good priest for safety.
               "Now howl your fill," said the Spaniard, to his victim. "Howl on! It is the sweetest music that my ears ever heard;" and having satisfied himself that the door remained unfastened he returned to his own brilliantly-lighted room.
               For a time the horrible sounds continued—then all was silence.
               "His body is drained to the last drop of blood," muttered Gonzales, with a terrible oath. "He is free! The work has been done far too swiftly, and now he may rot and fester until daylight, and then Inez shall see her lover!"
               To quiet his own fears he quaffed the rich, red wine until he sank back upon the couch stupefied and to dream such terrible dreams as were fit only for the thinking of the lost!
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               THE POWER OF KNOWLEDGE.
               "TO shrive the dying, bless the dead," is one of the most holy duties that can be performed by any man, and the good Father Bartolome, whose ears, hands and heart were ever open to distress in any form, was detained on his journey to the house of Alvarado Gonzales to send a parting soul rejoicing upon its journey to that other and better land.
               But after his functions were done to the uttermost limit, without haste and with many prayers and tears he turned sadly away to perform his duty to the living, and was walking rapidly towards the house of the proud Spaniard, when he saw a man rushing towards him in the darkness, out of breath, and with all possible speed
               "My son," he said, stretching out his hands to arrest his progress, "my son, why this unseemly haste? Is the hand of murder abroad?"
               "Father, good father, may the saints be praised that I have found you!" was gasped in reply, as the rapid race of the man was checked.
               "Then you were looking for me, Pedro?"
               "Yes, father."
               "Come then, rest and collect yourself, that you can talk plainly, and I act advisedly. First, why this haste?"
               "The senor, father, was—"
               "Senor Gonzales?"
               "Yes; he would kill me if—"
               "Hush! Such things must not be whispered where the winds can carry it to other ears. The church is near at hand. Come with me thither." And leading the way, they were soon buried beyond the sight of other eyes and the hearing of other ears.
               "Now, my son," said the good father, "tell me your story as briefly as you can. From what I already know immediate action is required."
               
               "It is, father—it is;" and Pedro rehearsed a disjointed tale of all he had seen, heard and knew—dwelling particularly upon the horrors of a poor man being confined with the bird and insect monsters of the gloomy forests.
               "The prayer-book, my son? Did you give him that?"
               "It is here, father. The senor struck me down even as I was in the act of giving it to him."
               "Ah! you knew not what a double life was contained in it—life for the body as well as the soul;" and unclasping it he exhibited to the astonished man two small files that had been concealed within. "These would have freed his limbs, and now he must fight the unequal battle loaded down with chains."
               "Pardon me, father, pardon me!" And poor Pedro sank upon his knees.
               "Nay, I do not blame you. A higher Power than man directs all things in this sin cursed world. Yet human means must be resorted to. The cross is my anchor, and by God's aid I will not fail yet. Pedro," he continued, more severely than was his usual custom, "you have often been absent from your master's house and returned thither at later hours than he knew of."
               "Father, I—"
               "Seek not to exculpate yourself now. I have no time to listen to it. Another day and I will hear all you have to say. Listen and answer without prevarication. Do you not know some private means of entering it without disturbing any one?"
               "Yes, father, I—"
               "Enough. Come with me."
               He hurried him away from the church to his own home, sought and secured about him some medicines from his little laboratory, and then they returned with rapid steps to the mansion of Alvarado Gonzales. Entering without difficulty they crawled almost noiselessly along—saw the master sleeping heavily—secured the keys from his pocket, and descended to the prison-vaults beneath. Descended amid the profound silence—could it be that of death?
               "Father, father," whispered Pedro, trembling in every limb, "I dare not go any further! This is too terrible!"
               "Poor fool!" murmured the priest, first contemptuously and then reverently. "When will this heathenish country be educated above insane superstition, and learn to put perfect trust in God? In thy own good time, O Lord!" Then he continued more loudly: "You are right, Pedro. You had better go back and watch the senor until I return."
               Very glad to escape, Pedro returned to the vicinity of his sleeping master, and consoled himself and quieted his fears after the same fashion—by filling himself to the brim with wine.
               Father Bartolome carefully descended the stairs, and in an instant after stood at the door of the prison cell. All was silence within. If a battle had been fought between the Englishman and the vile things that were his companions, it was evident to his discriminating mind that the latter had been the victors. With quick though trembling hands he unlocked and opened the heavy door, flashed in the light of his torch, and saw a sight that made even him tremble, strong-nerved and accustomed to horrors and death-bed scenes as he was.
               Crawling over the hands and neck of the poor man were the great, black, hairy, bloated spiders—bloated almost to bursting with human blood, while gently fanning his face with their wings and sucking away his life—if indeed any remained—were a couple of vampires, with others sailing slowly around waiting for their chance, or already filled to repletion, lying scattered around! It was such a sight as once seen can never be forgotten. The gloom of the damp cavern—the ghastly face of the prisoner lying upon his back with every particle of color gone, blanched to the most intense whiteness—the sickly light falling upon it, and the repulsive, venomous things busy at their horrid feast! Ah! long, weary years of penance and cloister solitude could never blot it out.
               But thought was banished now by action. With a wave of his light the good father drove the winged monsters from the cell, and heard them-whirl away with hideous noises through the open door. That he instantly closed. Then he crushed beneath his feet all the crawling things that he could find, and bending down put his ear to the lips and his hand upon the heart to ascertain if anything of life remained. "Dead! dead!" he sobbed, rather than uttered. "Dead, unshrived. Dead, and such a death! Horror!"
               Kneeling down he poured forth such a petition as had never before been uttered by human lips. Prayed and held the crucifix to his lips as if even after soul and body had dissolved their strange union, it yet had power to bless. Ah! such sublime faith has rarely, if ever, been equalled on earth; and although we may look for salvation from a different standpoint, surely it could not but be rewarded when those who have borne the cross shall be glorified with the crown.
               Again and yet again his examination for life was renewed—again and again his prayers repeated. If mortal life could not be renewed, life everlasting might be given; and yet he did not despair, for, following his petitions, he parted the still, mobile lips and poured in some of the spirit he had brought with him, rubbed the venomed stings with an unguent he had proved to be of marvellous power, and last of all took the curiously-shaped and carefully-sealed bottle, and poured some of the sparkling liquid upon the copper fetters. A sickening fume—a strange greenish-blue light arose as the fiery chemical ate into the heavy links, until they became as honey-comb, and he was able to part them as if they had been made of the finest thistledown that ever was tossed about by the breath of the tempest. Never was the result of study put to a better use; and when chains and shackles had parted he lifted him up and saw that though the form was limp and the lips not even stirred by a breath, yet a faint color was mounting to the cheeks, and that a nervous trembling was visible in the muscles that surrounded the mouth and eyelids.
               "Holy Jesus be thanked! The blessed Virgin be praised, he is not dead!" came with the most intense reverence from the lips of the priest, as he again administered the spirits and antidotes, and rubbed the poisoned punctures with the health-restoring ointment.
               In work and prayer more than an hour passed. Then life no longer fluttered faintly, but the little of blood that had withstood the terrible drain was quickened into action, and George Bright was able to sit up without assistance, although weak as a newborn infant.
               "Who are you?" he asked, looking wildly around.
               "No matter. I am a friend."
               "A priest, to judge by your dress?"
               "I am, and by God's providence have saved your life. But you must not talk—you are far too weak for that. Never came man nearer to death and survived than you, thanks to the saints. Nay, you need not speak. I know all."
               "I thought I was dying, but I fought to the last. O, it was horrible! horrible!" And he covered his face with his hands and silent tears rained swiftly down.
               "It was more than horrible, but Christ and the blessed Virgin—may their names be ever praised—sent me in time to rescue you from the dark fiends, and may it teach you to look up to them and ever bend the knee in penitence and prayer."
               "You a Catholic, and do this for me!" exclaimed the poor man, as the good father held up before him the emblematic cross.
               "All men should be what they deem 'Catholic' in religion. It is used by those who understand it not, as a term of reproach, and yet, my son, it simply means 'true.'"
               "I understand it. But you are a Roman Catholic?"
               "I am."
               "And yet have saved me from such a death as will haunt and render hideous my daily thoughts and nightly dreams if I should live a thousand years?"
               "Yes, I have done the act, and will do still more. I will, if the saints smile upon my poor efforts, set you entirely free from the power of the bad man who assumes to himself the power of the Godhead."
               "And Inez, Inez, does she know of it?"
               "She knows nothing of the peril you have been in, but it was she who first directed my thoughts to you."
               "Blessings upon her!—upon you—upon God!"
               The lips of the priest compressed and his face darkened as he heard the Deity mentioned the last of all, but he fully comprehended in what a whirl the brain of him who had uttered the words must be, and reserved his admonition for a more fitting period.
               "This night, or what remains of it, you must stay where you are. You are not strong enough to go, even if I had the means ready, which I have not. The Senor Gonzales is very powerful as well as revengeful, and it would be worse than useless to act until everything was prepared for your perfect safety."
               "And Inez, my darling, my adored?"
               "O, powerful love!" murmured the old man, forgetful for the moment that he had a hearer, "O, powerful human love, that can survive such a terrible trial—that can endure want, and misery, and pain—that can remain steadfast to the end—the last thought at death, the first with returning life." Then he continued aloud: "Inez shall know of your safety. Now, listen. The virus is yet circulating within your frame—you are not yet out of danger. Rub this often upon your slight wounds—slight, and yet with every principle in them that is antagonistic to life. Of this drink."
               "But should I be bound again?"
               "Resist not. It shall be but for a few hours."
               "If I was only armed, then—"
               "You would destroy life, even as Gonzales would have destroyed yours! Thank the saints for your safety, and—"
               "My safety may depend upon having the means of defending it."
               "True, but I have no weapons. But put your trust in God, and—"
               A hurried but stumbling step interrupted his further speech. It was that of the more than half-drunken Pedro.
               "Father, father, for the love of Heaven, come away!"
               "Why?"
               "The senor is muttering in his sleep—is awaking."
               "Then indeed it is time that I was away. Benedicite! my son;" and having again securely locked the cell he returned up stairs, gave the keys to Pedro to return to his master, and departed. But very much had he to think of and do, and the gold and vermilion of the morning sky found him without having rested or slept. Difficulties rose like mountains in his path—difficulties that conflicted with his sense of both religion and honor, and long hours of prayer failed to show him a way to surmount them. Yet it must be done, but how? Work by human means, and leave the rest to God! There was no other way for him; and with a heavy heart, though a firm trust, he proceeded to attend to his morning devotions.
               That done, he must see Inez at all hazards—must find some means of knowing constantly what was transpiring around the cell of the prisoner, and determine upon his after-action when the hour arrived for his freedom. Very little, however, knew he of what assistance others would require when Gonzales again awoke from his drunken slumber.
            
            
               CHAPTER XI.
               THE TEMPTATION OF HATE.
               ALTHOUGH the revengeful Spaniard was partially awake, yet Pedro (who was literally serving two masters) found little of difficulty in restoring the keys to the place where he had found them, and stealing away without detection. It required more time to clear the brain from its clouds, and to free the body from its stupefaction, and the bells upon the cathedral were chiming high noon before he arose.
               "Strange," he muttered to himself as he rubbed his red and swollen eyes. "Strange how heavily I have slumbered, and here, too. And what terrible dreams I have had! All that was horrible, and loathsome, and ghastly has been with me, and—"
               His eyes rested upon the empty bottles—a bat whirled blindly around the room, and he appeared to find a solution of the perplexity, although he could scarcely believe he had drank so much. But the keys were safe, and he was forced to be satisfied. Very little did he think that he had not been without the assistance of the wonderful capabilities of his servant in the drinking line. Yet, even if he had swallowed as much as he fancied but a few hours previously, he needed more now, and rushing to the door, called out savagely:
               "Pedro! Pedro!"
               "Here I am, senor."
               He happened to be passing at the moment on his way to escape, or Gonzales might have bellowed himself hoarse before he would have received any answer. As it was, he had the most hangdog look that can be imagined, and had the eyes of his master been as keen as usual he would have instantly noticed it, as well as that he had been drinking to excess. But the burning thirst within alone occupied his thoughts.
               "Why did you not come sooner, scoundrel?"
               "I came the moment I heard you call, senor;" and so he had, for the summons and the reply had been almost simultaneous.
               
               "You deserve a sound flogging, and—but no matter now. Take away these bottles and bring me a fresh one. Be quick about it, too."
               He appeared to have forgotten all about having stricken him down the previous evening, and well for his raging thirst that he did so. Had he even hinted at the matter it would have been the last order he would have had an opportunity of giving to the man. But Pedro was suspicious of him. "Caramba!" he growled between his set teeth, stanch Catholic as he was, and at the same time feeling for the safety of a small triangular dagger that was concealed in his breast. "Caramba! he had not better tempt me too far, or—" but he swallowed his anger (as he did half a bottle of wine), and complied with the order he had received.
               The generous juice of the vine ripened beneath Andalusian suns—a few oranges—a cool and perfumed bath, and then breakfast, restored Gonzales to his usual perfect calmness and self-control. An hour after and he could think and act as clearly as at any time in his life. Then he summoned a maid and desired to know of his daughter. "She had not left her chamber," he was told.
               "It is well. Inform her that as soon as I return from a short ride I would see her. You may add, also, that I have good news for her."
               "Si, senor."
               Soon he was mounted (after again seeing Pedro and renewing his commands that no one should visit the prisoner's cell), and rode slowly away. Meeting the priest he gave him a very liberal donation for the benefit of the church, talked a moment upon ordinary subjects, and then asked him for his blessing. "You have it, my son, upon all things you attempt that are right."
               The spirited horse of the Spaniard was lifted by and groaned under the deeply-driven spurs as he sprang forward, the impetuous rider noticing the sharp accent upon the last word, and reflecting whether or no he could have any knowledge of his nefarious deeds.
               "Right! right! What did he mean by that?" he breathed almost audibly. "It cannot be that he mistrusts me. No, it was only a cant word of the craft. Joaquin dare not betray me, for he is far too much in my power. Pedro has denied that he did so, and would not tell a lie for all the pearls in the Bay of Panama, or the riches of the Ind. Inez? She knows nothing to confess of any importance, even if she was inclined to do so. Pshaw! The wine I drank so foolishly last night has made a coward of me. But suppose he does know, what reason have I to fear him? He is nothing but a man after all." Thus reassured he rode easily, though swiftly forward.
               Vain, however, were all his efforts to quiet conscience. Proud and self-reliant as he was, he knew his own guilt, fancied that he was a murderer, and that every one he met knew it also and shunned him. Besides, the singular blessing of the good Father Bartolome would not be banished from his mind, and to relieve it somewhat, and at least to set one point at rest, he turned his horse and dashed towards the lonely hut of the fisherman Joaquin.
               The hut was there and the debris around it, but that was all! Boat, nets, oyster-troughs, everything of the least value was gone, and stung to the quick at what he considered such perfidy, he stood for a moment almost breathless. If Joaquin who owed him so much could turn traitor, why might not Pedro? That thought was the most bitter thrust he had yet received, especially as he now remembered the sullen looks of the man when he first saw him in the morning.
               "By the cross!" he exclaimed fiercely, "their lives are no more to me, or a hundred like them, than that of the meanest reptile that crawls the sod, and I would as soon trample them under feet. But they are mere tools in the hands of the false priest. Let him beware! Daggers and bravoes are plenty, and money will buy them. Ay, let him beware! No one ever yet thwarted the will of Alvarado Gonzales and lived! But Pedro—perhaps even my fair-faced and honeyed-tongued daughter are in the plot, and—the thought fairly made him foam at the mouth,—"what if the base-born Englishman was yet alive? Fool! Fool! that I have been. Now I remember that I saw a vampire in my own room this very morning. If that could escape why not the others as well? By Saint Iago! But there has been treachery somewhere. I gone, this infernal league could easily have set him free—more than likely have done so. And I did not even go to see if he was safe. Yes, fool, fool!"—and the horse was driven at its utmost speed, until he again stood with distended nostrils, panting flanks, reeking skin and quivering limbs, before his own door.
               
               "Send Pedro to me instantly," was his first command as he entered.
               "I am here, senor." So prompt had been his attendance that he appeared to have anticipated the order.
               "Who has been here since I was absent?"
               "No one, senor, except the men with fish."
               "Father Bartolome?"
               "I have not seen him, senor."
               "If he comes I wish to see him, remember."
               "Yes, senor."
               "My daughter, has she been abroad?"
               "I think not, senor."
               "Go and tell her maid to send her to me. Yet stay. Have you been below?"
               "You told me not to go, senor."
               "Right. Have you heard any sounds from there."
               "Nothing."
               "Have you listened?"
               "No, senor. I have been busy all day."
               "What were you doing there last night after I had forbidden you to go, Pedro?"
               "The poor man was groaning so, that I thought he was dying, and I was asking him that I might tell you."
               "Do you speak the truth?"
               "Could I be a true Catholic and lie?" And the fingers of the man rested upon a dagger as well as those of his master.
               For an instant it appeared as if Gonzales would have attempted his murder. Had he shown the least sign of guilt it would have been so, but a blank wall was less expressionless than his face, save that the firmly-set lips told of a stubborn will and uncontrolled passions. His eyes, too, drooped not, and his master, satisfied with what he would have called the ignorant stupidity of the man, repeated his order to have his daughter sent to him, and hurried away. And well it was that he did so, for in a hand-to-hand encounter he would more than have met his match.
               "The senorita will soon be here," was the answer returned to his summons.
               "It is well. Tell her to wait my return, in case I should be absent for a few moments."
               Deny it as he might, he was more than disturbed, and suspense becoming at length intolerable, he lighted a candle and descended to the vault below. A single glance satisfied him that the door remained locked. He crept nearer and listened. All was silence. Was death the only tenant of that dismal cell? Had the soul passed out amid darkness and horror? Of that he must be satisfied before he could steer his troubled bark further amid the breakers that threatened to engulf it. He crept still nearer and listened again. Then he ventured to call the name of the prisoner, and started back as if a thunderbolt had burst at his feet, or he had heard a voice from the tomb, when he was feebly answered.
               George Bright was alive then, and his plan had miscarried. How or why, he did not stop to determine. With the rapidity of lightning another and far more exquisite plan of vengeance was formed in his subtle brain. His daughter should kill her lover with her own hand!
               
               "Senor Bright," he asked, "how is it with you, poor man?"
               "I have had a terrible night, but God has safely carried me through."
               "And God has shown me my wickedness. Your sufferings have been as nothing compared to mine, senor. Pardon me—pardon me."
               "If what you say is true, I do, as I hope to be pardoned."
               "And that it is true I am going to prove to you. O, how very, very wicked I have been."
               "Prove it by opening the door then, and allowing me to leave this horrible place. May God keep you from knowing, even in your dreams, the fearful things you loosed around me—the more than mortal anguish you made me suffer."
               "And give to you a life of more than joy. Here, senor, is a bottle of wine I have brought you. Reach out your hand and take it."
               "Why not open the door at once, if you are sincere, and give it to me?"
               "What! you a lover, and ask me to do such a thing? Can you fancy no more exquisite happiness than this, man?"
               "Inez?"
               "Certainly. What would my doing as you wish be compared to having her open the door, loose your fetters and lead you to sunshine, the perfume of the sweet flowers, the glories of the outer air, and more than all, clasping you to her heart! Ah! senor, I fear your love has become cold, that you thought not of such a happy ending to all your trials."
               
               "It would indeed be like heaven after the days I have spent amid untold horrors and gloom. But, senor, senor, for the sake of mercy, do not mock me. Thus far I have battled against all like a man—that would be death."
               "I promise you on the honor of Alvarado Gonzales—I swear by the rood that before two hours have passed, my daughter shall be by your side."
               "Then farewell to all of misery, and welcome ineffable joy."
               "Restrain your raptures as well as you can until that time. But take the wine and drink."
               The prisoner took the bottle from his hand, but made no motion of placing it to his lips, and Gonzales continued:
               "What, afraid of this bottled sunshine? Do you think it is poisoned, senor? Do you think I would counterfeit repentance to bring you to your death? Ah, senor! if you knew the hours I have passed in tears and prayer you would no longer doubt me. Yet it is but natural that you should do so, wicked man that I have been. Give me back the wine, senor, and let me prove that no subtle drug is mingled with it."
               The Spaniard took the bottle, held up the light and showed him that it was full, placed it to his lips and drank, and then again held it so that he could see that it was half-emptied.
               "Do you doubt me now, senor?" he asked.
               "No, give it to me," and the prisoner also drank heartily.
               "Now take the light to cheer your solitude until I return with your fair deliverer."
               "Stay a moment. This wretched place—my dress—my—"
               "Pshaw! You are either the most strange or forgetful lover I ever saw. Your darling has seen you in all your manly beauty, and do you not think she will pity and love you more when her own eyes tell her what terrible sufferings you have passed through for her sake? Ah! Senor Bright, you have very much yet to learn of the heart of woman."
               "Go then. God be with you, and hasten your return!"
               "I will not be long, and Inez shall gather and bring with her the finest fruit and fairest flowers in the garden, as she used to do for your sick room. You cannot have forgotten them."
               "Neither have nor ever will. Yes, they will be very dear, and yet she—she is all my heart requires. One word from her lips—one glance of her eyes—one pressure of her little hand, will be dearer to me than all the world."
               "A lover-like and gallant speech! The wine has done you good already. Take the light, I know that every hour to you now must appear like a year."
               "Yes, go, go! God's blessing follow you if you do right, and his curses if you are playing me false."
               "Farewell then, senor, for a brief time. Then you shall pass from the darkness of despair to the sunshine of perfect joy;" and Gonzales went up the stairs muttering to himself "right—right." Almost the words of the priest!" And it was with some difficulty he could smooth his face so as to meet his daughter with a smile upon his lips.
               "I told you, my darling," he said, kissing her warmly, "or rather I sent you word that I should have good news for you on my return, and I have. Nay, no tears. Can you not guess what it is?"
               "No, father, unless—" and her heart gave a great bound, and then almost ceased to beat. Could it be that he had relented, and was about to set his prisoner free and sanction their love? The very thought was rapture too great for utterance, and she wildly cast herself into his arms and looked up through her tears into his face.
               "I guess your thought, my love. Dry your eyes, and let me see the brightest of sunshine upon your face."
               "Father, do you mean that you will set him free?"
               "No, you shall do it with your own hands."
               "I! I! my dear, dear father!"
               "Yes, you shall unlock the prison door, remove his chains, and lead him forth to happiness."
               Then her tears flowed far faster than before. She had become somewhat accustomed to looking at the dark side of the picture, and the reverse was almost more than she could bear. But her tears—pearly drops in the eyes of a pearl—were sweet and holy ones, and the bright orbs flashed through them like the sun through an April shower. But it was some time before she could realize that what she heard was true.
               "What I tell you, my darling," continued her father, "is true. You shall be the angel that unlocks the prisoner's cell, and leads him forth to light and happiness."
               "But when, my dear father, when?"
               "I promised that it should be within two hours."
               
               "You promised him! Then he knows it—you have told him!"
               "I have, and gave him light and wine to cheer his solitude."
               "And he said—?"
               "That you were more to him than all the world."
               "My darling—darling! Father, I know not how to bless you." But if kisses warm and gushing from a pure heart could have repaid him he would have been satisfied.
               "He would have changed his dress before you saw him, but I told him he would be dearer to you as he was then—"
               "An hundred thousand fold!"
               "Than if any other hand released him."
               "If any had done so I should have been angry! For my sake he has suffered, and who but I should give to him the blessed boon of freedom? But let us go now, my father, now. O, I cannot restrain myself another instant."
               "Impatient both!" muttered the Spaniard with contracting lips, and a wild fire lighting his eyes. "But the end will come soon enough!" Then he continued aloud: "Passionate love like his and yours makes one forgetful, and it is well that there should be some restraining power. Think, my love, if there is nothing you can take with you when you visit him that will be particularly pleasing after his long incarceration from the outer world. I mean something that—"
               "I know, father! Fruit and flowers. How dearly he loves both."
               "How swift the heart jumps to a conclusion! You are right, my child. Go and gather them—array yourself like a queen, as you are, and—"
               "In two hours, my darling father?"
               "In two hours."
               One kiss upon his lips—one embrace of her soft arms around his neck, and she fled to dress herself and gather fruit and flowers—would she find any she would deem fair and perfumed enough?—fled as a long imprisoned bird would to orange groves and balmy skies.
               And he? Five minutes later and he was riding away again towards the thick forests that framed the city with eternal verdure.
            
            
               CHAPTER XII.
               THE CHEMIST'S SECRET.
               LIKE a happy and a singing bird, Inez Gonzales flitted around the spacious and beautiful gardens, culling the choicest and freshest flowers, particularly those for which her lover had ever expressed a preference, until her little apron was filled to overflowing. Then she retired to the bower, where she had passed so many sweet hours with him, and listened to the declaration of his passion (she thought not now of their being torn asunder there), and began arranging them with flying fingers. That accomplished, she called one of the gardeners, and with his assistance filled a basket with the most luscious fruit—the purple pine-apple, the figs bursting with sweetness, the rich bananas, and the golden-globed orange, and having returned to the house and placed them where they would remain unwithered and cool, she proceeded to the preparation of her own toilet.
               But never had maiden a more difficult task, or girl a more capricious mistress. There was nothing rich enough—nothing that suited her. Dresses fit for a queen to wear she declared to be unfit to be seen, and jewels that might have graced the coronet of an empress, to be lustreless. Never had she looked so bad. The light was wanting in her eyes, and the rose bloom in her cheeks—her complexion, albeit pure as alabaster, was brown—her glorious hair faded, and, in short, everything was wrong. Valuable time was thus frittered away, and the heat and nervousness, while it added to her color, detracted from the usual grace and self-possessed poise so charming in all women.
               And yet, when at length she was forced to decide, and had put on a dress of the softest blue, had braided her hair with pearls and encircled her arms (bare from the shoulders and showing their exquisite roundness and perfect proportions) with the same milky jewels—when her little feet had been encased in the most dainty of slippers and she had finished her toilet with those "little nothings" that set off a beautiful form and face to its fullest attractiveness, she looked all that the most enthusiastic admirer could have claimed for her, and was well worthy of the proud title of the "Pearl of Panama."
               "Ah! my lady," said the girl, as she looked at her. "Ah! if some of the gallants were only to see you now, they would fall down and worship you."
               "Girl! girl!" answered Inez, stamping her little foot with vexation. "Girl, do you know what you are talking about?"
               "Of your beauty, senorita."
               "Pshaw! If it were possible to make it a thousand-fold greater, it would not even then be worthy of him!"
               "Of whom? The Senor Don Sabastien?"
               "Of him!" contemptuously. "Do you think that I would wish to look well for him? Don Sabastien, indeed!"
               "He is very rich and—"
               "Silence! We will not discuss the Senor Sabastien," replied Inez, suddenly recollecting herself, and that it was beneath her to talk thus with a menial. "Go, Delores, and bring me a bunch of the freshest magnolias you can find—a couple of half-open buds will answer."
               She happened to remember that some one had spoken one night of how well he loved their intoxicating perfume, and could she neglect anything that would make her attractive in his eyes? Besides, she would be alone to collect her thoughts. But the time hung heavily upon her hands, and she often glanced at the face of the clock, and watched the little gliding Cupid as he swung backwards and forwards at every tick, and often glanced out of the window to see if her father was coming, and listened anxiously for the beat of his horse's feet as he urged him homeward along the snowy shell and gravelled road.
               And where was that proud, revengeful father? Although he rode directly into the thick forest that surrounded the city, he did not penetrate into it, but merely used it as a shield against observation, and skirting around reached the extreme end, fastened his panting steed and entered a house upon whose door was a sign signifying that the testing and smelting of metals was carried on within.
               "Ah, Gubetta!" he said, for he had gone without ceremony to an inner room clouded with the combined fumes of acids and boiling metals. "Ah, Gubetta! still at work, trying to find some means to transmute the base into the precious gold?"
               "Yes, senor, at my leisure," was the reply.
               The man raised his head as he spoke from over the crucible he was stirring and anxiously watching, and revealed a face marked with a thousand lines of deep thought and midnight labor. A face swarthy and ghastly from the continued inhalation of poisonous gases, eyes blacker and more sparkling than anthracite, and hair once of the same hue, though now threaded with silver.
               "Your countrymen are famous for such studies, as well as for music and the arts," continued the Spaniard.
               "Alas! dear Italy! shall I ever see thee again, land of beauty and song? O, how I have toiled by day, and out-watched the stars by night, that I might do so!"
               "If the secret for which you have studied so long were once revealed, you would leave these shores then?"
               "Would I, Senor Gonzales? Would the little fish that has been drawn upon the land and lies panting and dying in the hot sun, go back to its native element, and wander once more amid the green bowers and cool coral caves? Ah, senor! such dreams have mocked me now and then. Often when some poor Indians have brought me the ores they found in the mountains, and the stones in the gulches they fancied were diamonds, I have thought that some day I might cease this searching after what I fear is not, and gather sufficient of the glittering dust to carry me thither—carry me home to die!" And the old man (for threescore with him was past) drew his hand over his eyes, and the tear-drops fell and hissed like serpents in the seething metal he was trying to vex into that precious ore for which man has toiled and bartered away his very soul.
               There was something so touching in the spectacle of one whose feet were on the verge of the grave, with the dirt crumbling from under them—who had wasted youth's prime and manhood's strength—who had endured heat and cold and hunger without a murmur, thus longing and weeping for the scenes of his childhood, that even the flinty heart of Alvarado Gonzales for a moment gave back a response. Out of his vast wealth it would have been as but a sand from the sea-shore for him to have sent the Italian rejoicing upon his way, and at another time he might have done so. Now, he was utterly selfish, and determined that he would make that holy feeling the means of accomplishing the end he had in view.
               "And you have never been able to gather a sufficient amount at any one time to carry you home?"
               "Never, senor. Since I was wrecked upon these shores I have toiled for that end in vain—toiled to sustain this wretched life."
               "And if I should tell you how to accomplish in an instant what you have labored for so many long years, what would you give me, Gubetta?"
               "You mock me, senor. You know that I have nothing to give but this poor wornout frame and the few equally wornout utensils of my calling. Senor Gonzales, this is all I have to show for years of the most intense thought and labor a man ever passed through."
               "Nay, my old friend," continued the Spaniard, "I do not mock you. I pity you far too much to do so. I do know a certain means of your procuring sufficient money to return to your dear native land, and keep you above the reach of want the remainder of your days."
               "The subtle alchemy that will burn the base metals into gold!" And the old man clasped his thin hands in ecstacy, and his eyes flashed wildly.
               "No, Gubetta, that I fear will never be found, but—"and his voice was lowered and took a far more impressive accent—"but the alchemy that will turn knowledge into wealth."
               "Knowledge, senor?"
               "Yes. You, who have solved so many of the mysteries of nature, are possessed of powers denied to the ignorant. To be plain, Gubetta, you have knowledge that I stand in need of—you wish to return to your native clime—I have gold, therefore we can barter. Do you understand me?"
               "I do not, senor," replied the old man, sadly, shaking his head. "I knowledge—you gold—barter? I thought it was you, senor, who was to tell me, not I you?"
               "You will sell me one of your secrets for the gold that will take you back to Italy, and keep you the rest of your days? Is it not so, Gubetta?"
               "Sell you one? I would sell all and ten times as many if I had them, senor."
               "Then we can come at once to the point, Gubetta. I have in this bag a thousand doubloons; they are yours the moment that you answer me one question, or rather that you give me something I have no doubt you possess."
               "A thousand doubloons, senor. O Italy! Italy! What would you have of me, Senor Gonzales? Say on. Do not torture me with hope."
               "Those of your profession, Gubetta, and more especially your countrymen, learn other secrets than the fusing and mixing of metals. Dangerous secrets I mean."
               "Dangerous, senor!"
               "Must I speak more plainly? Are you dumb, or do you not in reality understand my meaning?"
               "I do not."
               "Subtle poisons then."
               "Poisons!" And the old man dropped the rod with which he had been stirring the bubbling crucible and started back pale as ashes. "Poisons, senor, do you—dare you think that I—"
               "I know that you have more than once prepared curare, by a superior method, and sold it to the Indians to poison their arrows, and knowing this and that you come from a land of poisoners, dare assert that you are equally skilled in others."
               "Senor Gonzales, I—I—"
               "There is no use of evasion—no use of words. You want this gold, and I want a poison with which to anoint a knife so that the use of it will be certain death. Do you think that I am not familiar with the story of the blade that was so anointed on one side only? Come, your decision. Italy or nothing."
               A tremor almost like that of death ran through the frame of the old chemist. He staggered to a seat and bowed his head upon his clenched hands, his lips murmuring the while.
               "I do and must have it. There is a ship now lying in the bay with her anchor catted. She will bear you to France, and from thence you can easily find your way home. An hour, even less, and it will be too late."
               "I gave it once, senor, and—"
               "Must do so again."
               "Saw its effects. It was terrible! terrible!"
               
               "You need have no fears of such a thing now. Long before it is used you will be among the vines and the olives. But I will waste no more time. Tell me in a single word, do you want this gold—do you want to die under the sunny skies of your own beautiful Italy?"
               "Yes! yes!"
               "Then shall I have what I want?"
               "Yes."
               The old man staggered to his feet like one with the palsy—removed one of the rush mats that formed the floor of a back portion of the little laboratory, dug carefully away the earth, then lifted a stone, and from an opening beneath drew forth a copper vessel. Carefully removing the cover he searched among the contents, and at length singled out a box of the most minute proportions, and was about to hand it to Gonzales, when suddenly a strange light flashed in his eyes and an almost smile played upon his lips.
               "What is the matter with you, Gubetta?" demanded the Spaniard, who had noted the change.
               "I was about to play you false, senor, but I will not do so, for you give me the means to see my darling land once more."
               "Well that you did not, or—" and his fingers played convulsively with the jewelled handle of his dagger.
               "Take this," said the chemist, as he selected another box, "rub it upon the blade of a knife, and any one who eats that which is cut by it will die within an hour."
               "And there is no antidote?"
               "None known in this country—it is the poison of the Borgias!"
               "How long will it retain its virtue? for I may not have occasion to use it for months, years, perhaps never," asked Gonzales, as carelessly as he could.
               "For centuries."
               "Take your gold then and begone, if you would see your home. See the vessel is already spreading its sails."
               Without a word the Italian gathered a few things he considered valuable, requested his rich visitor to step without, and set the residence he had occupied for years on fire.
               "Farewell, senor," he said; "I will remember you when I am again home. Farewell, get away from here with all possible sible speed. There is danger in remaining." And he set the example, by hastening to the shore and bribing a fisherman to row him to the vessel that was even then slowly moving out of the harbor.
               The Spaniard did not neglect to follow the caution he had received, but after riding to what he considered a safe distance, halted until the late habitation of the chemist was blown up with a sound like thunder, leaving scarcely a trace behind. Then he rode to his daughter with fiery speed.
               "O father!" exclaimed the impatient girl, running to meet him and grasping his hand even before he had dismounted, "how very, very long you have been away."
               "I was unexpectedly detained, my child."
               "And I was waiting so long ago!"
               "I do not doubt it. Are you all ready?"
               "Yes."
               "The flowers and fruit, Inez? Surely you cannot have forgotten them."
               "Forgotten!" And she flew to bring them from their cool resting-place.
               Although gone but an instant, yet it afforded the treacherous Spaniard plenty of time to take a silver knife from his pocket and rub the blade with the poison he had received. That done he carefully replaced it.
               "See, father, are they not beautiful, and tempting to the taste?"
               "Very. By the way, Inez, here is a little present I have brought you. I fancied, that on so rare an occasion as this, one that had never been used before would please you."
               "O! how much I thank you. Come, father, let us go. How long the time must seem to him."
               "And heaven so near!" he replied, with a peculiar emphasis.
               But Inez failed to notice it. All her thoughts—all her heart was in the gloomy prison vault, and lighting the most massive taper she could find, she almost dragged her father down the stairs.
               "Give me the keys, father;" but she trembled so that he was forced to assist her, and as the door swung slowly open, was about to step within and remove the heavy shackles, when a strong arm thrust him aside, and a pair of them clasped Inez to the heart of the brave Englishman!
               
               A blow could not have staggered him more than the knowledge thus taught him that chains could be removed from the limbs of a prisoner even while he had the keys in his own pocket. But he was certain of the end, and could afford to wait. Had it been otherwise, he would not have hesitated to stain his hands in blood, for the raptures of the lovers were like tortures to him.
               With her arms locked around George Bright, Inez would have drawn him to the upper air, but he gently resisted. Not until he had cleansed himself and changed his dress, would he have her see him in the clear light. Perhaps she would never love him the less, but the memory would be always painful.
               "No, darling," he whispered, stealing a kiss at the same time. "No, an hour hence and we will take our old place in the rose and dahlia walled bower that overlooks the sea and—
               "My daughter, you have forgotten the flowers and fruit you brought."
               "Not I, father!" And her eyes fairly danced with happiness as she held up the beautiful blossoms in succession and crowned the deed by taking the nodding buds of the honey-sweet magnolia from her own bosom and placed them in his.
               "This is too much rapture to be real!" he murmured. "Senor, may heaven pour its choicest blessings upon you."
               Inez looked her thanks and blessings. She, too, could scarcely believe but that it was a dream and not reality. Seated beside her lover, forgetful of the rude surroundings; with her hand clasped in his, with her head resting upon his shoulder, her soft breath playing on his cheek, and her sweet eyes looking unutterable love, she had little time for words.
               "Daughter," again interrupted Gonzales, "let not your passion—sweet madness it might well be called—make you neglectful of your duty as hostess. Flowers are charming to the eye and their perfume delicious, but—"
               "I understand you, dear father." And she began emptying her basket of fruit and forcing him to eat, by the mild compulsion that made each mouthful even more luscious than the warm kisses of the sun.
               "Fie, Inez!" said her father, "how forgetful and unladylike you are. What! my child using her fingers, dainty although they may, whom—"
               "Hush, father!" And she drew forth the little knife he had given her, and sliced the golden fruit with the shining blade.
               Gonzales saw that the work was well done—saw that the late prisoner ate the pine-apple and banana thus prepared and given him, and was satisfied. But might not his daughter do the same? Far more than likely, and it must be guarded against.
               "There, my darling," he said, taking the knife and remaining fruit from her; "there, Senor Bright has eaten enough already. You will kill him with kindness if you continue."
               "But the knife, father. Give it back to me. He will not eat that!" And her merry laugh ran like the chime of perfectly-tuned silver bells through the gloomy dungeon.
               "I but take it to have engraved upon the handle the date of the deliverance of Senor Bright."
               "What a happy thought, my darling father!"
               "I think so. And now, my children, I will leave you alone for a brief space, while I go and make the necessary preparations for the return of the senor to light and sunshine."
               "And love, father."
               "Ay, love that will last unto death!"
               How rapidly the time passed with the lovers when they could give free utterance to their thoughts and emotions! With no eyes upon them—with no ear listening, they told of all they had suffered—that is, in heart, for George Bright was entirely and wisely reticent upon the subject of the monstrosities of nature that had been let loose upon him.
               "Ah! darling, darling!" whispered Inez, "how very much you have suffered, and for my sake."
               "Speak not of it, my Pearl of Pearls!" he answered, kissing away her tears. "It has been as nothing. One moment like this would be cheaply purchased by years of suffering."
               "Say not so. Ah! love, life has been as nothing—was not life without you. But now I hold you again within my arms—now your lips answer to my caress. Nothing but death shall part us now."
               "Nothing but death!" he repeated, little dreaming that it was already running through his veins like lightning.
               "And you are so very pale and weak. Lean on me. O! if you had died here!"
               
               "It was your love alone that kept life within me. Had it not been for that, I should have given way without a struggle." And his weight pressed more heavily upon her.
               "George, darling, what makes you tremble so?" she asked, in alarm.
               "Nothing."
               "But you do tremble."
               "The reaction from despair to joy—joy the greatest that ever came to a human heart, has been too much for me, I presume. But I shall be better in a moment, darling, do not fear."
               "Yet I do fear. May the saints have mercy! May the blessed Virgin look down in pity!" And then her shrieks for help rang through the vaulted apartments.
               "Don't, darling," he answered feebly, striving to retain an erect position. "But I am very faint. I—I—God bless you, my first and only love—I believe that I am dying."
               "And I know that you are!" replied Gonzales, stepping from a place of concealment. "Your hours are numbered. Inez, your love, has killed you. The blade of the knife with which she cut the fruit was poisoned! Aha! did I not tell you that your love would last until death!"
               Before the last words had been spoken, George Bright rolled upon the floor of the cavern, with Inez clinging to him almost as much bereft of life as he. With an oath her father tore them apart, lifted her in his arms, slammed the door after him and carried her to her own room—leaving him—his corpse—uncovered, for ravenous rats and all that was foul to feed upon until scarcely the bones would remain to tell of what had once been the human form divine.
               Never was human love more suddenly and lastingly ended! Death for one—and what but madness could there be for the other?
            
            
               CHAPTER XIII.
               THE PRIEST AND THE PHYSICIAN.
               FROM one fainting fit to another the distracted girl passed for hours, in despite of all the efforts made by the physician, who had been sent for, and the kind priest who was instantly summoned by Pedro, without waiting any instructions from his master. To watch her sufferings, listen to her moanings, unintelligible mutterings and maniac laughter, was terrible for all, and especially to the good Father Bartolome who loved her as if she had been his own daughter.
               Fortunately for Gonzales there was no one present who had any idea of the cause of Inez's sufferings, or could gain any tangible clue to it from what they heard, but the priest, and he had been trained to reticence from his youth. Revenge was not a part of the lessons he had learned, or the duty he inculcated, and if he premeditated any subsequent action, it was entirely locked within his own brain. Now all his fears and interest were centered in the loving and trusting daughter.
               Yet still he was as cool and clear-headed as when the tide of his life ran rippleless. In such an hour his training was of immense importance, and in learning to still the angry waters in the breasts of others he had obtained perfect mastery over those that ebbed and flowed through his own soul. Amid the wild excitement, consequently, that reigned through the entire house, his was the master mind, controlling and directing in worldly affairs as he had before done in spiritual. The rich owner kept himself aloof, for the surging hell in his heart would not admit the inspection of any eye. The hour of his triumph had passed. He had made his own child murder her lover; had driven her mad, for all time, if indeed she lived; and now conscience awoke with its terrible power, and he was suffering a foretaste of the eternal hereafter.
               In a moment of comparative quiet the priest stole softly from the side of the beautiful sufferer and summoned Pedro to him.
               "Where is your master?" he asked.
               "Locked in his own room and raging like a lion. Listen, father, how rapidly he walks about. For the wealth of the world I would not be in his place. What has he done, father?"
               "I know not, my son. Where is the prisoner?"
               "He must be below. Shall I go and see?"
               "Get a light and come with me."
               They found the corpse of the man lying as he had fallen—pale, motionless, ghastly. The good father knelt by his side and examined him critically. Then he arose with a heavy sigh, breathed a silent prayer and crossed himself.
               
               "He is dead—dead!" he murmured. "May God have mercy on the soul of Alvarado Gonzales!"
               "Did he kill him?" And Pedro, also, made an examination of the corpse, looking after the fashion of his class for stiletto wounds.
               "God alone can say, and it is for him to judge. Help me to carry him to the chamber he once occupied, and on your life let no one know that we have done so."
               "Then you do not think he is dead?" asked poor Pedro, shrinking back from touching a corpse.
               "Dead? Yes, the body is even now turning to loathsome corruption, but I tremble for the soul!"
               "But how can a man be dead when there are no wounds to be seen?" asked the literal Pedro.
               "Peace. Help me lift him up."
               Together they carried him up the stairs, and laid him upon the bed from which he had lately risen, and then the two removed his filthy clothes, and prepared him for burial. That done Father Bartolome locked the door, took the key into his own keeping, and directed Pedro to watch that no one attempted to enter, confident that his fears would restrain him from doing so.
               For another hour the priest watched by the bedside of the mind-wandering girl, with his eyes alternately fixed upon her and the physician—the others having departed. The strong opiates they had administered began to take effect, and she sank into an uneasy, though heavy slumber. Leaving her maid to sit near, he motioned the doctor to follow him, and conducted him to the chamber where the corpse was lying.
               A brief examination satisfied the physician, as it had already done the priest, that life was extinct, although the body still retained something of warmth. He had hoped that the decision would have been otherwise—hoped against hope, that he might discover some indication of life remaining that he had failed to see. But it was not so, and very sadly he heard the decision: "Apoplexy."
               "Are you certain, doctor?" he asked, tremblingly.
               "There cannot be a doubt of it."
               "But what could have caused it?"
               "Without knowing the history of the man, especially for the last few days of his life, I would not venture an opinion. He was a friend of Senor Gonzales, I think?"
               "He was." The conscientious priest was right, he 'was'—but the friendship was not of a recent date.
               "Sudden, emotion often produces death from apoplexy. An intense reaction from grief to joy has been known to be fatal A man as full-brained and blooded as this one, when in perfect health, would be a fair subject for it."
               "Then you think he was not poisoned?"
               "Poisoned, paudre! Poisoned in this house? You are enough of a medico yourself to know that all the symptoms are wanting. There is nothing even to hint at such a thing."
               "But is there not a single poison that would produce a death like this?"
               "Not without leaving certain traces—not one in the entire range of Materia Medica. But why these questions? Are you suspicious that there has been foul play?"
               "What! I accuse any one? Certainly not."
               He thus skillfully evaded answering, for his role was to play the part of the questioner—not to be questioned.
               "If you have any such fears, a post mortem might settle this matter; but I must have the authority of Senor Gonzales before undertaking such a thing."
               "Certainly. Let us return again to the senorita. Poor child!" And having taken the same precautions as before, he followed him, saw that she was still sleeping, and then, after a few whispered words to Pedro, left the house.
               But whatever his destination it was suddenly changed, for he met half a dozen seeking him who demanded his instant attendance upon a dying man who had barely escaped being drowned and was beyond the possibility of saving.
               "Ah! the life of a priest!" he sighed, as he found his cherished plans thus broken in upon. Still he increased his speed, and was soon in a little hut by the sea-shore, where a man lay stretched upon a few branches that had been hastily gathered, and who was evidently in his last mortal hour.
               "How did this happen?" he asked of a fisherman, who was standing near in dripping clothes retailing some news to a crowd of eager listeners.
               "I was taking him on board a ship, holy father, when a sudden squall struck the little sail and overturned the boat. It was with great difficulty I could save him as well as myself."
               "You did well," he said, aloud, and then murmured to himself self. "The hand of God is in this thing. Blessed be his holy name. The very man I was going in search of."
               "Is there any hope, father?" asked the fisherman.
               "None. His earthly days are numbered. Stand back, I would be alone with him."
               Such a request and from such lips was far more than a command would have been from other, and they willingly withdrew while he should perform the holy offices of his religion for the dying man. Kneeling by the side he began to question him concerning his faith, when he was interrupted, and bending his ear down he heard a confession that startled his soul to the very centre.
               "Have you told any one of this?" he asked.
               "No, father," was feebly answered.
               "It is well. Have you told me all?"
               "All! All! How very dark it grows! Father, I am dying."
               The priest held the crucifix to the ashy and trembling lips; they seemed to be trying to articulate a prayer. He bent down his ear—caught the words "Italy, blessed Italy," and death had robbed the limp form of every vestige of that subtle essence we call life and soul. Ah! how slender the thread—how very short the distance between time and eternity!
               Directing the men who came again at his bidding to carry the corpse up to his house that his subordinates might prepare it for burial, Father Bartolome turned his footsteps to the home of the physician with whom he had last parted. His head was bowed upon his breast, and there was a perplexed and troubled expression upon his face—a far deeper one even than when he had left the princely mansion of Alvarado Gonzales. There was a trembling of nerves, also—a twitching of the eyelids—a compression of the lips—a clenching of his hands, and a hurried manner much at variance with his usual calm demeanor. Evidently the confession he had heard from the lips that were now closed in death troubled him sorely.
               "Why, good father," exclaimed the physician, starting up in alarm, "what brings you here so soon after our separation? Is the senorita dead or dying?"
               "I have not seen ber since you did, doctor."
               "Then in the name of heaven what makes you wear so troubled a face? Is there a pestilence or earthquake coming?"
               "It is well," was the solemn response, "that the mercy of God withholds them. No, I came to talk to you of other matters. Listen."
               He briefly related what he had to tell while the physician sat with flashing eyes and a manner indicative of the most intense excitement. Then he started up—took down from his shelf a quaint, black-lettered old volume and pored for an instant over the contents.
               "By Santiago!" he exclaimed, as he jammed the covers together. "By Santiago! but it is so. Strange! strange!"
               "Show it to me."
               "There it is, letter and line." And while his visitor was reading he compounded some medicine, and continued, "Come, let us go. There may not be a single instant to lose. Strange! strange! The accursed poison of the Borgias and—"
               "God does, indeed, move in mysterious ways!" replied the priest, and not another word was spoken until they again stood by the bedside of Inez Gonzales.
               There was no apparent change, except that slumber had restored something of the roses to her cheeks. Her mind, though dream-swayed, was still under the influence of delirium, but her pulse was more regular, and her heart had ceased its wild leapings.
               "She is better. There is hope," whispered the physician.
               "God and the saints be thanked!" replied the priest.
               "And now to—" but he failed to finish the sentence, and they passed out together in silence.
               "The senor has been asking for you, father," said Pedro, who came from his post to meet them.
               "He must wait," was the stern answer; "and Pedro," and he whispered a few words in his ears, closing with the single one aloud, "Remember," as he passed on.
               It was true that Gonzales had been asking for Father Bartolome. The stings of conscience had been far too powerful for him to bear alone. Then he essayed aguadiente of the most powerful distillation, and found that, although it might fire the blood and quicken the beatings of the pulse and heart, yet it was no nepenthe for the mind. He rushed from the room and asked for his daughter. Was told that she was a maniac, and that her life was despaired of. Rushed back again and walked the floor, clenching his hands and wringing them until the blood started from under the nails, gnashed his teeth, tore his hair and cursed himself and all around. "That Italian, Gubetta!" he growled from between his set teeth. Had I never known him all would have been well. May God and all the saints curse him! May the ship sink with him and his accursed gold. May he—"
               "You are calling down curses on a dead man," interrupted the solemn voice of the priest, who had entered unnoticed. "He has already gone to either his reward or punishment. Better think of your own soul's salvation, Senor Gonzales."
               "Father, I—Gubetta dead—I—may Heaven have mercy upon me!" And he threw himself upon a couch and buried his face in his hands.
               "You sent for me, senor," said the priest, after he had permitted sufficient time to pass for the terrible whirlwind of passion and remorse to become somewhat stilled.
               "Yes, father. I would confess and receive absolution."
               "Not now. When you are in a proper frame of mind come to me and all the fitting consolations of the church shall be yours."
               "But I cannot—cannot endure this."
               "As ye sow even so shall ye reap, senor. Was this all for which you wished to see me?"
               "No, not all. But why will you not pardon me now?"
               "It would be a desecration of one of God's most holy ordinances. For the sake of my own soul I would not dare do it." And the old man trembled as he thought of the guilt that was crushing him down as beneath the lower millstone.
               "Then my daughter, Inez, what of her?"
               "If she dies, her blood will be charged to your account."
               "I—I—murder my own child!"
               "You have said it. No one but God knows as well as you do what transpired in the loathsome cells beneath."
               "What do you know of them?" asked the Spaniard, starting up with much of his old, fierce and fiery nature.
               "More than you think, senor."
               "And you know of him—him and that I—"
               "Of whom and what are you talking, senor?"
               "No matter—no matter. I thought you might know that," And again he stopped suddenly and in confusion.
               "I know," replied the priest with the utmost sternness, "that deeds have been done there that have made angels weep and even the devils blush for shame at having been outdone."
               "Old man, what do you mean? How dare you talk thus to me?" And a snake-like glare came into the eyes of the Spaniard, and his dagger was drawn forth and held threateningly.
               "I dare do my master's bidding," was the reply. A reply uttered without the trembling of voice, the blanching of the face, or the quivering of a muscle.
               "And what if I strike you dead at my feet?"
               "It will only add another murder to the one to be answered for at the judgment day."
               "Beware how you tempt me," was hissed forth.
               "Strike!" And the dauntless priest threw his breast forward, and placed his arms behind his back so as to offer a fair mark for the weapon.
               For a few moments they stood measuring strength—foot to foot and eye to eye. Those of Gonzales were like a tiger threatening its keeper—those of Father Bartolome like a saint looking to heaven. But the contest was unequal. Guilt can never outface honest virtue, although it may be sustained for a time by passion. First the hand of Gonzales was slowly lowered—his eyelids twitched nervously, and then the lids dropped, and he sank into a chair with a heavy groan. Pride, wealth, blood, all had gone to the wall before the unswerving trust in the majesty and power of God.
               "My son," said the priest, using the term for the first time since the commencement of the conversation, "my son, when you are yourself once more you may send for me. Before I go let me warn you to refrain from the wine-cup, for you have already exceeded all reasonable bounds."
               "This to me, insolent!" And Gonzales started again to his feet, but his eyes were averted and his dagger remained untouched. "Begone, false priest! Leave my presence! Leave my house, and that without delay." Like many another man, he was attempting to bolster himself up with anger.
               "I will leave your presence, senor, willingly, for I have other and holier duties to perform: but in your house I shall remain until it pleases me to go forth. May God still the wild tempest in your heart, and lead you to the cross;" and he passed slowly out, carefully closing the door behind him that the servants might not see their master.
               
               Again his footsteps were turned to the room of Inez, and again he found her sleeping, although more calm and healthfully. The narcotics she had taken held her now entirely within their control, and all that he could do was to pray that the clouds might be removed from her brain, and this he did long and fervently. Most truly he was gathering for himself jewels to be set in his crown of immortality.
               To remain there would have been useless. The physician had procured proper nurses, and given the most minute directions, as well as instructions that he should be instantly called if a change should take place, or if she showed any signs of awakening. And feeling thus that she whose sufferings alone would have made her very dear to him, was in perfectly safe hands, he visited the room where the corpse of George Bright lay and prepared himself to pass a long vigil there.
               To him there was nothing repulsive in death. He knew that it must come to all—that it was but the clearing away of the dust from the spirit—that, although man was but little lower than the angels, yet it needed the purification of the grave, the passing through the dark valley, to fit him to join the throng of the redeemed, "whose meanest garb was gold."
               And for hours he sat and gazed upon the calm, cold, motionless form and face. Marble could not have been more spotlessly white. Sometimes he almost fancied that the lips parted, or expression was taking the place of the unutterable blank. But it was mere brain delusion. The wing of a passing bird, the flutter of the curtain at the window had cast a shadow over the silent sleeper's face—that was all.
               Suddenly a new thought appeared to strike him. He arose, bent over the corpse, and looked as if he would impress every feature upon his mind, and then passed out of the room. "Pedro," he said, after he had pencilled a few lines, "take this to the doctor instantly."
               The physician came armed with a huge case, and the two went into the room and remained there a long time, calling frequently upon Pedro and the other servants for warm water, towels and all sorts of unheard-of articles—that is, unheard-of before in a case of death to them.
               "They are cutting him open," whispered Pedro to one of his fellows, "cutting him up to see what is the matter with him;" and he shuddered at the thought that one so good as Father Bartolome should lend his assistance in so foul a deed.
               And very soon the news reached the ears of Gonzales, who, worn out with the violence of his conflicting passions, had ceased his rapid walking—ceased his tiger-like raging, and stupefied somewhat with the quantity he had drank, was stretched at full length, and in nervous excitability was gnawing his finger nails to the quick much after the fashion of a dying man picking at the bed covering. It was the first mention that had been made by any one of the dead man in his presence—in fact he knew not that the corpse had been removed even then. But the intelligence that a post mortem examination had been or was being made struck upon his ears like a death-knell. He knew that the evidence of poison could not fail to be found.
               "Who dare do such a thing without express orders from me?" he demanded, springing to his feet in wrath.
               "The doctor and Father Bartolome," answered Pedro, who had taken good care not to venture within the door.
               "The false, treacherous priest? By the cross! but he shall rue it. Go tell him instantly to desist and come to me. Instantly, do you hear? No, stay. It would do no good. They would not listen to you. Hark! What sound was that? Go and see."
               Pedro did go more than willingly, but failed to return. The face of his master appeared more like that of a fiend than a human being, and fully twenty years seemed to have been added to his age since the previous day. The wrinkles upon his face had been deepened and quadrupled—his once raven hair was streaked with locks as white as snow—the olive of his complexion had changed to ashes—the lips were drawn back like one who had suffered intense torture—there was a wild, red glare in his eyes, and his proud form was bent and broken. He had become the very wreck of a man—burned, dried by the flaming volcano that was within his breast, and would never cease to vomit forth its destructive, seething lava as long as a particle of life remained.
               Impatiently Gonzales waited for a time. Then he filled to the very brim and swallowed down a huge goblet of aguadiente, and snatching a sword from its resting-place rushed down into the vault beneath, without even waiting to light a candle, although plenty of large wax ones stood near.
               "Where are you, treacherous priest?" he shouted. "By the cross you pretend to worship, but you shall rue the day that you crossed my path. Ho there! Come forth. What! hiding? By the light of heaven I'll tear the heart out of your bloated carcass;" and he flung the door open and dashed within.
               The ponderous oak and iron swung back again of its own volition, the spring bolt snapped with a report like a pistol, and Don Alvarado Gonzales was a prisoner in his own castle, and beyond the reach of human ears, call he ever so loud!
               No, Pedro did not return to his master. He found all the servants upon their knees in the grand hall of the mansion, gathered around the priest and imploring him for his blessing and for protection. Even the women watchers had left the bedside of their young mistress, and were shrieking in terror and moaning in fear. Of all these the good priest was the only one calm. With his tall form drawn to its utmost height, his hands clasped and his eyes turned aloft, he stood the central figure, firm in his belief and perfect in his trust.
               It was excessively hot. The air was calm and the sky cloudless. There was no indication of danger, and yet the ground appeared to undulate beneath them, and all knew that an earthquake was rocking the world from a central point to the circumference.
               One, two, three distinct shocks. Then a momentary stillness and they were thanking God that the danger was past, when a tremulous subterranean noise was heard, longer in duration, and far louder than thunder, and a crashing fall that told of the destruction of a portion of the magnificent building. Then the air gradually became less sultry—the earth ceased to tremble and rock, and the voice of the priest arose in thankfulness to God for mercy and deliverance.
               By degrees the men and women returned to their duties, and it was found that the portion of the house in which the room of Gonzales was situated and covering the prison cells, was a gigantic ruin. Satisfied with a hasty view, Father Bartolome sought and found that Inez, although awakened by the shock, was comparatively calm and in her right mind—went into the room where the corpse lay; and was also satisfied with the situation of affairs there. Then he turned his attention to the proud and revengeful master.
               Gonzales had last been seen in the part of the building that had fallen, and the priest was about to give orders for the clearing away of the debris, when a couple of fishermen (who had been upon the water during the gigantic convulsion of nature) arrived, and declared that they had seen a man rush from the house and throw himself into the sea, and that they judged from his dress it was the senor.
               This was the view taken of the matter, also, by the priest and physician. Surely nothing would tempt him to visit the gloomy dungeons again, and what more natural, then, that he should rush from the house and try to flee from the wrath of an avenging God? And the more he questioned the fishermen the more he was satisfied that they had told the truth. So the ruins remained untouched.
               What if many swore they could hear faint groans and shrieks, and horrid curses from beneath? Pedro, at least, would swear equally strong that it had been the case for years, and Senor Alvarado Gonzales, buried as he was for all time, was left to test in all its bitterness what a prison cell was, and what a death of starvation, made ten times as terrible by the ghosts and mind torture that haunt the death-bed of a murderer.
               With his fate settled, the priest and physician passed the entire night in the room with the corpse, although occasionally visitingt hat of Inez. A strange taste, but it was in the way of the profession of both, and Pedro asserted (and who could gainsay him?) that they were concluding their examination.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIV.
               RECOMPENSE.
               THOUGH Inez Gonzales did not learn the fate of her father without bitter tears, yet it could not be with either deep or lasting regret except as regarded his welfare in another world. He had outlawed himself to all human feelings—had severed the bonds between him and all that was dear to him—had stained his soul with the worst of crimes, and even if he had lived, would ever have carried the mark of Cain upon his brow. Yet it could not be otherwise than that so sweet a child as he had left should mourn and pray for him, and her firm friend and spiritual adviser made no effort to check her emotion until it had time to somewhat subside. Then he seated himself by her side, and in his kind and fatherly manner began to talk of her future.
               "My daughter," he asked, "what do you intend to do with all the vast wealth that is now yours alone?"
               "Give it to the church, father," she replied, with eyes looking through tears.
               "Give it to the church!" he repeated, in astonishment.
               "Yes, father, to you, for the church."
               "And what do you intend to do?"
               "Go into a convent, if I am deemed worthy."
               "Do you think you would be happy in the cloister? Think what you would have to resign."
               "I have thought, father. My heart is in the grave. All its blossoms are dead."
               "But might it not bloom again, when time has shed its healing balm around you?"
               "Never! True love is like the aloe. It flowers but once, and then dies."
               "Is this your final determination, my daughter?"
               "It is final and unalterable!"
               "And you have nothing to live for in the outside world?"
               "Nothing."
               A curious smile rested for a moment upon the face of the old man, but it was evanescent as summer lightning, and she failed to perceive it.
               "My daughter," he continued, "again let me ask if there is nothing that can change your determination?"
               "What should there be? What have I to live for, father?" She had never asked for her lover—never given a single direction as to what should be done with the corpse. Her faith in the priest was perfect, and she knew that he would do all things for the best. But now, when she was about to put a perpetual ban between herself and the outer world, he arose before her in all his manly beauty, and throwing herself at the feet of the priest she sobbed out, "father, when I am dead, promise me that I shall be buried by him—him!"
               "Rise up, my daughter, and listen calmly, and answer me truthfully as you value your own soul." And he gently lifted her again to a place by his side, and continued: "If Senor Bright was alive and well, would you, could you be tempted to shut yourself up within the walls of a convent?"
               "No, father; but do not tempt me with such thoughts."
               "I must know the truth."
               "And I tell it to you when I say that nothing would ever tear me from his side but death. But why these questions? Why that smile? Are you mocking me, or—"
               "Pedro," and the priest touched a bell.
               The door opened at the signal, and not the Mexican servant, but the lover of Inez entered, and in an instant they were locked fast in each other's arms.
               "Let me explain," said the priest, when their raptures had subsided sufficiently for him to command their attention.
               "Let me explain the happy chance that has brought this consummation about." And he did so, sparing the father of Inez as much as was possible.
               He told them of his having the supposed corpse carried up stairs—of his calling the doctor there—of his decision that he was dead, and that death had been caused by apoplexy—of his being summoned to attend a dying man—that it was the old chemist Gubetta, and that he told him he had deceived Gonzales and not given him poison, but a subtle drug that would throw one into a trance so nearly resembling death as to deceive the most rigid scrutiny—telling him at the same time of an antidote. Then he, also, related briefly of the time they had watched for the death slumber to pass away, and how he, under God, had been able to nurse him back into health. That done he wisely left them alone for a few hours.
               When the shadows were lying the softest—when the sun had lost much of its power—when the rose was breathing its perfume abroad, and the moon-loving ceres throwing open its cup of honeyed sweetness—when the sea lay like a silver mirror reflecting the stars that were flashing their light from the sky above—when the breeze was as low as the whispered words of angels—ay, for hours the lovers sat in the little flower-walled bower and talked of the future: the past they would blot out forever from their lives. Suddenly, however, the Englishman started up and pointed seaward.
               "Inez, my darling," he exclaimed, "there is my vessel, the Avenger."
               "You cannot be certain at this distance," she replied, laying her hand upon his arm playfully.
               "Not certain? Not know my own vessel? It would be impossible for me to be mistaken."
               
               "And if it should be, then—"
               "Would you go with me to my native land?"
               To the uttermost ends of the earth!" And she looked up into his eyes with ineffable love and confidence.
               George Bright was right—it was the Avenger; and scarcely had her sails been furled before the commander came on shore, and meeting the priest, who had purposely thrown himself in his way in order to explain, accompanied him to where the lovers were still seated.
               "What, George, and you, my fair Senorita Inez! Ah! allow me to offer my congratulations, for our good friend Father Bartolome has told me all. But I must call you George no longer."
               "Why? I do not understand?"
               "Because my once lieutenant, by the death of his father and brother, is now the Earl of Buckmaster; and, will you permit me to add, I know of no man who could wear the honors more royally, or will use the wealth more judiciously."
               But why linger when the story is told? The good ship carried away George and Inez, man and wife, for Father Bartolome had performed the ceremony and blessed them prior to their departure. He was the latest one they parted from, and though they visited Panama some years after they never saw him again, for he had passed to his reward.
               Before his death, however, he had turned all the property of Gonzales into money, and reserving one half for the church (as he had been directed by Inez and her husband), remitted the remainder to England, all the property with the single exception of the family mansion; and as the years have passed, and one after another has been gathered to their fathers—as the sun has glared and the rain fallen upon it—as the fingers of decay have torn it down piecemeal—and as it is shunned by all, it will be known while a particle remains, as the haunted house of Panama; very few, however, dreaming of the terrible tragedy that was enacted within its walls.
