            TO MY BROTHER-IN-LAW AND MOST KIND FRIEND, MR. J. H. BUTLER,

            PREFACE.
            Between the preface to a new book and the skillfully worded placard which ushers in
               some new medicine to the patronage of the public, there is this similitude—they are
               but seldom read. For most persons receive a new book as they would some new
               medicament—if it happen to please their taste and meet their present necessities,
               they swallow it complacently. If not, they throw it aside with indifference, perhaps
               disgust, reckless of the mental toil with which the writer, like the pharmacentist
               with his medical arcanum, may have heralded his freshly prepared compound of
               words.
            To those however who may glance over these few prefatory lines, the writer would say
               a few words. Of the number, there may be those, to whom some of the following tales,
               illustrative of Life in varied Phases, are familiar. To such, their merits, as their
               faults, are already known. To those to whom they may at least possess the charm of
               novelty, she would briefly say, that in these Pictures of Life sketched both in the
               sunshine of gladness, and in the shades of affliction, it has been her aim to impress
               each with some pleasing moral, and give to the play of Fancy, the beauty of virtue
               and truthfulness.

               NELLY, THE RAG-GATHERER.
               NEAR where Canal street now extends its range of fine ware-houses and commodious
                  dwellings—where, over the broad flaggings, youth and beauty trip so fleetly, and
                  the din of omnibus, cart, and cab is unceasing, there stood, about the year 1809,
                  a low, dark, dismal stone building, which had more the air of a prison than any
                  less equivocal residence. Upon the ground floor there were but two windows, and
                  those were boarded over, excepting one row of cracked and dirty panes at the top.
                  The windows on the second floor were always tightly closed by heavy wooden
                  shutters, once black, but now discolored by time and rain to a hue even more
                  dismal. The house stood a few rods back from the street, and was inclosed by a
                  board fence, so high as entirely to prevent any one from looking into the yard,
                  which was one mass of tangled weeds and filthy rubbish, where at every step the
                  miry soil yielded beneath the foot, or after a rain became as a loathsome,
                  stagnant pond.
               This part of New York was called the "Collect." It was then almost a swamp, and so
                  remained for many years. Of course, it was deemed unhealthy—the hot-bed of fevers and agues; and, for that reason
                  probably, while both above and below and on each side, the hand of improvement and
                  wealth was rapidly extending streets and erecting noble buildings, this, the
                  "Collect," remained almost an isolated spot—the rendezvous of thieves and
                  assassins—and rendered also even more famous by many idle tales of superstition,
                  so that this building stood year after year apparently untenanted, growing more
                  and more gloomy as time wore on. But it was not so. Every day there might be seen
                  issuing from the narrow gateway, an old, miserable-looking woman, in perfect
                  keeping with this abode. Her dress, although clean, was of the coarsest and most
                  scanty materials, eked out with shreds and patches of every shape and hue. An old
                  tattered shawl was thrown over her bosom, her arms were nearly bare, she wore no
                  stockings, and her slip-shod, ragged shoes, were fastened around her ankles by
                  twine or bits of rags. A straw bonnet, of most unseemly shape and color, was
                  pinched down over her face and tied under the chin by an old dingy black
                  handkerchief. Over her shoulders she always bore a greasy, brown bag, and in her
                  hand one of those long, wooden poles, with an iron hook attached to either end,
                  denoting her occupation as Rag-gatherer.
               Long used to stooping amid the dirt and rubbish, her form had become bent nearly
                  double, and day after day she might be seen prowling around the principal streets,
                  sometimes about the dry goods stores, or scraping every little rag and refuse from
                  the gutter and drains near the residences of the more wealthy citizens. So
                  miserable was her appearance, that frequently some charitable person, touched by
                  her decrepitude and poverty, would drop at her feet a few pennies, and even silver
                  coin, which Nelly, as she was called by the shop-boys and servants, would greedily
                  pick up, mumbling as she did so a few almost unintelligible words of thanks. Only
                  a few hours of each day did Nelly devote to her strolls, she would then return to
                  that wretched, dreary dwelling, and inspect and arrange her filthy store. The rags
                  she would wash and hang over the tall, rank weeds, meet to bear such fruit; and
                  if, perchance, any thing of more value had fallen to her luck, as was often the
                  case, it was carefully hoarded away. No one was ever admitted within those walls,
                  yet sometimes a beggar would waylay even this poor wretch as she entered her gate,
                  nor were they refused aid: if but a penny or a crust, the Rag-gatherer bestowed
                  her mite.
               Had she lived in the days of Salem Witchcraft, Nelly would assuredly have been
                  hung for a witch, nor did she even now escape suspicion of belonging to that
                  worthy sisterhood. As no light, however dim, was ever seen gleaming from those
                  dingy panes, it was averred by certain knowing ones, that the nights of poor Nelly
                  were passed in the society of the "Old Scratch;" and more than one
                  person testified that she had been seen sitting upon the top of the fence in the
                  shape of a large, black cat, glaring so frightfully, that the whole marsh became
                  illuminated by her fiery eye-balls. Others said the "Old Scratch,"
                  with proper politeness, occasionally returned these visits incog.,
                  and might be heard in dark, stormy nights, when the wind howled and the thunder
                  rolled, growling around the gate. That she had made league with this
                  same respectable gentleman, there was no doubt; her rags were assuredly transmuted
                  to gold and silver, for the chink of the
                  hard dollars and guineas was said to be heard as plainly as the ten-pin balls of a
                  neighboring alley. Sportsmen affirmed that frequently when they had come
                  snipe-shooting in the vicinity of the old Rag-gatherer's house, the snipes had
                  acted as if they were bewitched—paying no regard whatever to their shot, but
                  merely turning tail, with a hit-me-if-you-can air, flew lazily over the old fence.
                  As guilt is always more or less superstitious, these very reports rendered the
                  Rag-gatherer probably more secure in her castle, for even if she had
                  the luck of changing rags to gold, the thief preferred knocking a gentleman
                  genteelly upon the head in Broadway or the Bowery, to venturing into the den of
                  one so near to the devil; for, although performing his business in
                  the most faithful manner, he seemed to have a strong repugnance to facing his
                  employer.
               It was a chilly day in Autumn, that, as Nelly was returning from her daily toil,
                  her attention was attracted by a young woman who seemed nearly fainting upon the
                  damp ground, her head reclining against a rough stake or post, while crouched
                  shiveringly at her feet was a little girl, apparently about six years of age.
                  Nelly was not unfeeling—the heart which beat beneath that wretched covering was
                  more alive to pity than many which throb beneath a silken zone; so she stopped,
                  and in a kind voice demanded the cause of the poor woman's distress. In tones
                  broken by grief and pain, her little story was told in a few words. She was dying,
                  she said, of want—her husband, after a long sickness, had been buried only a week
                  before, leaving her friendless and forlorn—and that, unable longer to pay the rent
                  of a wretched cellar, the cruel landlord had thrust her forth with her child into
                  the pitiless streets to die—for die she knew she must, there was such a load upon
                  her heart; and were it not for her poor little child, she cared not how soon she
                  was laid at rest in the quiet grave-yard. Nelly spoke words of comfort to her, and
                  assisting her to rise, bade her lean upon her, and then taking the little
                  attenuated hand of the child in hers, she led them to her miserable abode. That
                  shelter which the rich man denied, the Rag-gatherer freely gave, and with
                  it—kindness! In her work of benevolence, it seemed as if renewed strength and
                  agility were given her. She placed her on her straw pallet—coarse, but cleanly,
                  she chafed her hands, and poured her out a cup of water, which she succeeded in
                  getting her to drink; nor, in the meanwhile, had she forgotten to give into the
                  hands of the famishing child a generous slice of bread. How tenderly she smoothed
                  the pillow of the poor young creature, and bathed her throbbing temples! But all
                  would not do—life was evidently ebbing fast away. Remembering there was a
                  physician not far off, she hastened with all her speed to summon him. There was
                  apparently a struggle with this disciple of Galen, at crossing the threshold of
                  one so miserable, for on tip-toeing, careful steps he entered—just glanced toward
                  the bed—pronounced the patient "well enough," and would have
                  retreated, but the long fingers of Nelly seized his arm with the grip of a
                  tigress—her black eyes flashed both with anger and contempt, as she said:
               "Stay! and fear not your services will go unpaid. Here
                  is gold for you! Save this poor woman, if in your power, for the sake of that
                  helpless babe!"
               Although the eyes of the doctor suddenly opened wide to the exigency of the case,
                  and although he felt her pulse, and
                  administered some soothing stimulant, it needed more than the hand of man to
                  strengthen anew the "silver cord." Ere morning she died, with her last breath
                  commending the orphan to the protection of the old woman. "As God reads my heart,
                  I promise you your child shall be as my own," whispered Nelly, bending over the
                  dying woman. "I will protect her and keep her from harm. All that one like me can
                  do, I will!"
               The mother fixed her eyes upon the good creature, tried to speak her thanks, and
                  then clasping her child to her bosom, her wearied spirit sank to rest. With her
                  own hands Nelly straitened the body for its final bed—from her hoarded gains she
                  purchased a decent coffin, and then, when all was ready, she called in a clergyman
                  to perform the last mournful rites. In an obscure corner of "Potter's Field" the
                  young stranger was buried—unwept—unknown!
               
               As the hearse disappeared, Nelly again bolted her door, and taking the weeping
                  child upon her knee, strove to comfort her. She gazed long and tenderly upon the
                  sweet face of the little orphan, and it was one which well repaid the scrutiny.
                  She was a gentle, timid child, with great delicacy of form and feature. Light,
                  golden hair, waved in silken ringlets over a brow and neck of dazzling
                  fairness—eyes of beautiful deep blue, seeming, from their mournful cast, to
                  bespeak at once your love and pity, and a rosy little mouth, inviting the kiss it
                  so sweetly returned. Her mother had called her Violet, and Nelly had asked no
                  other name. And now this poor old creature, so long an object of contempt, and
                  even contumely by the crowd, had found something upon which to lavish her pent-up
                  affections—a being more helpless than herself to
                     cherish—she so long friendless and unsightly to the eye, received
                  now the artless caresses of this pure, lovely child. The walls of her dwelling,
                  late so dismal and desolate, were suddenly filled with life and music! From the
                  day she had sworn to protect the little Violet, old Nelly seemed a changed being.
                  Her tones were now low and gentle, her foot-step noiseless, as if she feared her
                  happiness all an illusion that the least rudeness might dispel, or that the little
                  being she had so learned to love, was but a vision which a breath might dissolve;
                  and, old and decrepit as she was, her goodness made her lovely in the
                  eyes of the child.
               As Violet grew older, the old woman gradually with drew from her habitual rounds
                  and devoted her time more to the instruction of her young charge. She taught her
                  to read and spell correctly—guided her little hand in learning her to write, and
                  was continually storing her mind with lessons of truth and purity. Words of such
                  beauty seemed strange issuing from the mouth of one whose life appeared to have
                  been a scene of cruel toil and privation! She instructed her in all branches of
                  needle-work, even to the finest embroidery—yes, those fingers, used to plucking
                  the rags and rubbish from unsavory sewers, now threaded the variegated worsteds,
                  and beauteous buds and flowers glowed beneath her hand!
               Allow a few years to pass unnoted, and Violet is again before us. She had now
                  reached her fourteenth year, and still thought nor wished for other home than the
                  roof of the Rag-gatherer. Those four walls were the world to her, and there her
                  days had passed in peace and happiness. Nelly was usually absent many hours in the
                  day, and rarely returned at night. Where those were passed was a mystery she never divulged even to
                  Violet, who was employed the mean-while contentedly with her needle and in
                  perusing the very few books which the old woman had managed to procure. Day after
                  day, as she threw her bag over her shoulder to depart, Nelly would enjoin upon
                  Violet never to be seen at the windows above, and on no account to open the gate,
                  no matter how hard it was assailed, and without a murmur Violet had strictly
                  obeyed. But one day, and a bright sunny one it was too, when she could hear the
                  birds singing, and the insects chirping amid the grass, Violet, perhaps for the
                  first time, pined to be let loose from that dismal old building. She tried to sew
                  but the needle slipped away from her heedless fingers. She opened her books. How
                  tedious! She had read all that a thousand times. She then went into the yard,
                  where Nelly with her own hands had arranged a little garden for her darling, but
                  the flowers looked sickly and hung their heads, no more contented with their
                  position than Violet. All at once, she found herself close to the proscribed gate.
                     Ah, take care Violet! But what harm could there be in just
                  unbolting it for a moment? What harm in just looking into the street? She knew
                  there could be none, and so she timidly drew the bolt. The gate yielded to her
                  touch, and, half afraid, she stood within the dingy portal. It happened
                  unfortunately just at that moment, a party of gay young men were passing. Struck
                  by her uncommon loveliness they stopped and gazed rudely upon her. Violet
                  attempted to retreat, but one of them, with consummate audacity, seized her by the
                  arm, and addressed her with the most insolent language. In vain she struggled to
                  free herself. He swore he would have a kiss, and most probably would have
                  succeeded in his brave attempt, had not a smart blow across the eyes with a
                  rattan, nearly blinded him, and obliged him to release the frightened girl. His
                  companions had stood by laughing at the distress of Violet, and encouraging their
                  comrade to persist, but there was another spectator of the scene; a youth
                  apparently not more than seventeen, who enraged at their brutality, dealt the
                  blow, and then quickly drawing Violet within the gate, bolted it. Now gracefully
                  lifting his hat, he bid her be under no uneasiness, for he would protect her from
                  all insult. In the mean-while, smarting with rage and pain, the party on the
                  outside with furious knocks and gross language demanded admittance, and at one
                  time it seemed as if the old gate must inevitably yield to their violence; but,
                  tired at length of their fruitless efforts, they desisted, and, with oaths of
                  revenge, took their departure across the 'Collect.' The brave lad would have
                  waited the return of the old woman, but Violet begged of him to be gone, while in
                  her own artless manner she thanked him again and again for the services he had
                  rendered her. Reluctantly, therefore, he took his leave—to Violet, it was as if
                  the sun had suddenly disappeared from the heavens!
               As soon as Nelly came in she candidly related all that had occurred, to which the
                  former listened with much agitation, making no reproaches, but for more than an
                  hour remained in deep thought, evidently distressed at such an unlooked-for
                  circumstance. Suddenly lifting her head, she exclaimed:
               "Violet, you must go from me!"
               "What, leave you—do you bid me leave you? Ah, forgive your disobedient child. Never—never will I
                  again offend you!" cried Violet.
               "I am not offended, for you have but committed an act for which my own foolish
                  conduct must answer. I should have known better than to have caged you here so
                  long, poor child, but my motives were good. Now we must part—perhaps never to meet
                  again, for, when once you go forth into the busy world, when you leave these walls
                  behind you, the poor Rag-gatherer must no longer be remembered."
               Violet burst into tears, and sobbed as if her heart would break.
               "Send me away, and tell me I must forget you, too! Oh, I cannot—I cannot."
               Even Nelly herself shed tears, but her resolution was unshaken.
               "Listen to me, Violet," said she, "I know a lady who is not only rich, but, what
                  is far better, has the credit of being charitable. Indeed, more than once have!
                  experienced her kindness. To her I will now go. I will relate your little history,
                  I will tell her that though but the adopted child of a poor, lone woman like
                  myself, yet you are good and amiable, and your mind pure as falling snow. I think
                  she will at once receive you under her roof, and for the rest I fear not. You
                  would steal into her heart were it of marble."
               "But shall I never hear from you—never, never see you again? Oh, I had much rather
                  stay with you."
               "You may see me again, and you may not, but on pain of my certain displeasure,
                  never to a human being speak of or relate your past life—you must forget
                     itentirelytirely! Remember this, and promise me you will
                  not again disobey my commands."
               Violet gave the required promise, and the old woman continued:
               "You have never been called by any other name than Violet—you must now have one. A
                  precious and a darling child have you been to my old heart, and in remembrance,
                  you shall be called 'Violet Darling.'"
               The next morning Nelly came in bearing a bundle, which she handed to Violet,
                  saying:
               "Here, my love, are clothes more suitable for you than the coarse garments you
                  have on, I have seen Mrs. Ballantyne, the lady I spoke of, and, as I expected, she
                  is willing to receive you, not as a domestic, but as a companion. One so new as
                  you are to the world she thinks she can mould according to her own fancy, but be
                  not led, my dear child, to forget the lessons of truth and virtue I have
                  endeavored to instill into your mind. This afternoon, at four o'clock, you will be
                  sent for."
               Passing over the grief of Violet, at finding herself about to be separated from
                  the only friend she had on earth, we find her, at the hour appointed, waiting the
                  messenger from Mrs. Ballantyne.
               As her eye caught the figure reflected in the old cracked looking-glass, it was no
                  wonder she started with surprise. A neat white cambric, now took the place of the
                  faded, coarse calico she had previously worn; a blue scarf vailed her bosom, and a
                  little gipsy hat, tied under her dimpled chin with blue ribbons, shaded her
                  youthful, modest face. Thus attired, poor Violet fluttering, trembling, like a
                  timid bird, shrank from offered freedom.
               
               
               Mrs. Ballantyne was a gay and handsome widow. Her fortieth birthday had already
                  passed, but so lightly had time marked these mile-stones to the grave (as some one
                  has called them) that, to all appearance, she was as youthful as at
                  five-and-twenty. Her complexion, perhaps, had suffered, but the brightness of her
                  fine black eye was undimmed; her raven hair, still unsilvered, rested in rich
                  glossy folds upon her lofty brow; her mouth was small—teeth superb, and her figure
                  retained all its youthful elasticity and grace. Left a widow at an early age, Mrs.
                  Ballantyne, for several years, secluded herself entirely from the gay world. All
                  her thoughts—all her affections—centering in her only child, a lovely boy. Report
                  had said the married life of Mrs. Ballantyne had been far from happy; but, if so,
                  she certainly evinced all the grief of the most affectionate wife, for, even after
                  her son was old enough to be placed at school, she still persisted in her
                  seclusion, seeing none but her most intimate friends, and only relieving the
                  monotony of her existence by daily habituating herself to the exercise of walking,
                  in which, however, she as constantly refused all participants. These solitary
                  walks, so regular, and in all weathers, at last gave rise to many ill-natured and
                  unfeeling remarks, tending in the end to sully the pure fame of the young widow.
                  But even while the world whispered and wondered, Mrs. Ballantyne suddenly gave a
                  new impetus to their tongues and conjectural organs, by as suddenly renouncing her
                  former manner of life, and, casting aside her mourning weeds, stepped forth from
                  her darkened chamber a radiant, beautiful woman—gay—enchanting—spirituelle!
               
               With a taste as novel as it was exquisite, she furnished her splendid mansion; the
                  elegance of her equipage was the topic of the day; while balls, suppers, and
                  parties, followed each other in rapid succession.
               
                  It was now the dashing Mrs. Ballantyne!
               
               Her saloon was thronged with the elite of
                  learning and aristocracy. She patronized the fine arts, befriended the
                  unfortunate, and gave liberally to every charitable purpose.
               The same mystery, to be sure, still attached itself to her private affairs—certain
                  hours of every day she was invisible; but now the world deemed it
                  only an eccentricity, and as such it passed. Nor was she without her
                  admirers. Statesmen and heroes would gladly have laid their laurels at her feet,
                  and many a youthful lover worshiped at her shrine; but maternal love shielded her
                  heart from all other ties. Under all the apparent frivolity of her character,
                  there was much, very much, that was truly excellent and noble. Her son was never
                  forgotten—he was still the idol of her fondest hopes and affection. With talents
                  of high order brought into proper development by judicious instruction, Eugene
                  Ballantyne, at the age of seventeen, had nearly completed his collegiate course,
                  and had already evinced a strong desire to enter the ministry. His health,
                  however, having suffered from close application to study, it was deemed advisable
                  for him to make the tour of Europe ere he came to any definite determination.
               Such then was the person who was to receive the humble protegé of the Rag-gatherer. What a transition from the wretched
                  dwelling of the latter to the luxuriant abode of wealth and fashion, where the
                  very air seemed oppressed with its own fragrance! Yet the mind of Violet, appeared fitted for this refined
                  sphere—so strangely had old Nelly even in all her obscurity and poverty cultivated
                  this lovely flower. She was like the sweet lily of the vale opening its delicate
                  petals in the dark wild wood, yet when transplanted to the conservatory of rare
                  and choice exotics, then only appearing to have found its proper
                  sphere!
               It was the afternoon upon which Violet had taken a last farewell of her
                  childhood's home, with what sorrow has been shown, that Mrs. Ballantyne, seated in
                  her private apartment waited the arrival of her protegé. It was the month of June,
                  and it would seem Flora herself had showered this little retreat of the widow with
                  her most beautiful offerings. Vases of the most tasteful designs were scattered
                  around filled with choice roses—wreaths of fresh flowers were suspended over the
                  mirrors, and the transparent window curtains were looped with the same. The floor
                  was covered by an India matting, and in the centre of the room stood a small
                  Egyptian table bearing an urn, also of antique model, in which the rarest exotics
                  united their fragrance with the less brilliant flowers of our own clime. Upon this
                  table were choice prints—rare medallions—etchings, and the walls were also
                  decorated with gems from the first masters. Silken hangings of a pale rose color
                  drooped in graceful folds over a small recess, disclosing within the couch of the
                  fair mistress of this apartment, around which fell curtains of snowy muslin looped
                  here and there with the same beautiful bands as confined those at the windows.
               The dress of Mrs. Ballantyne was a pale green silk, ornamented with double
                  rosettes of pink satin. The sleeves were of the finest lace falling just below the
                  elbow, disclosing the beautiful contour of her arm, clasped at the wrist by a rich
                  bracelet of emeralds and rubies. Her glossy black hair was parted upon her
                  forehead and gathered in one heavy mass upon the top of her head, where it was
                  confined by a shell comb of exquisite workmanship. In her hand she held a
                  miniature of her son, who had that morning returned to college. Upon this her eyes
                  were fondly fixed, when a gentle rap at the door aroused her from her pleasing
                  employment.
               Bewildered at the beautiful scene before her, so novel, so enchanting; confused,
                  abashed, at the presence of the elegant woman who now kindly greeted her. Violet
                  stood trembling at the entrance, her cheeks suffused with blushes rivaling the
                  tints of the roses around her. One hand rested upon the polished moulding, the
                  other was partly raised as if to shield her eyes from so much splendor, and one
                  little foot just poised upon the marble sill, hesitating to bear its lovely young
                  mistress into a spot so strangely beautiful. Mrs. Ballantyne advanced and gently
                  taking the timid girl by the hand, led her into the apartment, and seated her upon
                  the tabouret at her side. She then removed the little gipsy hat, and the golden
                  curls leaped gladly forth from their unwonted thraldom, and nestled again around
                  their sweet resting place.
               At length Violet dared to raise her eyes; she met the encouraging smile, and heard
                  the gentle voice of that lovely lady, and her agitation suddenly calmed, her fears
                  subsided; she even smiled in return, and in a short time felt she was no longer a
                  stranger. Thus affable and kind were the manners of Mrs. Ballantyne.
               
               In simple language, and with artless grace, Violet related her little history.
               It was not an eventful one, nor had she tales of harshness to reveal, no
                  complaints of suffering, her path had been a lowly one but without thorns. The
                  goodness of poor old Nelly was her theme, and when told that she was no more to
                  see her and forbidden henceforth even to speak of her, the tears so lately
                  repressed again burst forth, until even those of her listener mingled with them.
                  Suddenly her eyes rested upon the miniature of Eugene. She started, blushed, and
                  faltered forth:
               "'Tis himself! Oh, madam, 'tis the same who tore me from the arms of
                  that bad man!"
               It was now Mrs. Ballantyne's turn to be surprised.
               "Are you sure? Why, this is the miniature of my son, of Eugene!"
               "Yes, madam, I am sure. Oh, I never can forget that face, never!"
               Mrs. Ballantyne certainly evinced more feeling than there was any necessity for,
                  and at length said:
               "Well, Violet, it may be so; but you must never speak of it again. Should you meet
                  my son, on no account betray your indentity with the Rag-gatherer's child! True,
                  she is an excellent old person, but it is fitting now you should forget her; your
                  station in life for the future must preclude all allusion to the
                     past; you are now Miss Darling, my ward, my niece, or any other
                  title I may claim for you!"
               The next news in the fashionable world was, that the eccentric widow
                  had adopted a beautiful young girl, lovely as Juliet, artless as Ophelia, but ere
                  more than one tantalizing glance had been obtained of her fair young face, she was
                  as suddenly removed to a distance from the city, and placed at school for the next
                  three years, during which Mrs. Ballantyne partially withdrew from her gay career,
                  and devoted herself more to literary pursuits, awaiting with great anxiety the
                  return of her son from Europe. At length the fond mother was made happy; she once
                  more pressed her darling child to her bosom. He returned to her in perfect health,
                  and the beau-ideal of manly beauty. She was not
                  now for the first time to know that his heart and disposition were right. Violet
                  also returned and met the same kind welcome.
               For the first time, Eugene and the fair ward of his mother met. No sooner did the
                  eye of the former rest upon the elegant girl presented to him, than a glow of
                  surprise and pleasure mantled his face. That sweet countenance was strangely
                  familiar to him—where had he seen it? Could it be? No! it was impossible—and yet,
                  how strangely like the poor girl, he once protected from insult; and Eugene stood
                  for a moment in perfect perplexity. Nor was Violet much less embarrassed, although
                  better prepared for the interview. When they were left alone, Eugene said:
               "Pardon my presumption, Miss Darling, but I cannot divest myself of the idea that
                  we have somewhere met before. Your countenance is so like one which I never can
                  forget that I saw several years since in a remote part of the city; it seems to me
                  there cannot be two such faces!"
               Violet blushed deeply; it was such a pleasure to know he had not
                  forgotten poor Nelly's child, and she would immediately have confessed herself the
                  same, when suddenly the stern injunction of Mrs. Ballantyne never to betray herself to her son returned to her, and
                  she checked the words already upon her lips. An awkward silence ensued, for she
                  had not acquired the tact of coolly shuffling off a mal-apropos subject, and as coolly taking up another. Poor Violet
                  was a novice in Belle-dom.
               But had she forgotten the benevolent Rag-gatherer? She had ventured to ask Mrs.
                  Ballantyne if she had seen her, but was repulsed with no satisfactory reply; and
                  many times she had stolen away from home and walked around the city, hoping she
                  might meet her early friend. In her researches she had discovered the old dwelling
                  in the 'Collect,' but as usual the gate was fast, and although she waited as long
                  as she dared, no one came out or entered. At length one day as she was passing
                  down Beekman street with Eugene, they saw an old decrepit woman busily gathering
                  up rags just thrown from one of the houses. Violet bounding from the side of
                  Eugene, rushed forward:
               "Look up, mother, look up, it is me, me, Violet."
               But the old woman without raising her eyes, mumbled:
               "Go away, go away, I tell you, would you destroy yourself!"
               "I have looked for you so long, so long, mother—must I never see you?"
               At this moment Eugene approached, and noticed with surprise the distress of
                  Violet.
               "Do you know this good woman?" he asked.
               "Oh yes, yes, she is my—she is—"
               Nelly suddenly raised her head and fixed her keen eye upon the agitated girl.
                  Eugene caught the glance, a glance so full of meaning.
               "Woman, who are you? What are you?" he exclaimed.
               Nelly made no reply, but lifting her bag hobbled off down the street. In silence
                  the young couple proceeded homeward. Eugene saw there was some mystery, but had
                  too much delicacy to press a disclosure, and in fact he was himself so much
                  agitated at the appearance of the old woman, as gave his thoughts sufficient
                  occupation.
               Thrown almost constantly together as was Eugene and Violet, no other result than a
                  mutual affection could be expected, prepared too as their hearts were by former
                  occurrences for love. Violet however was unconscious of the deep interest Eugene
                  had secured himself in her affections, until one day being alone with Mrs.
                  Ballantyne, that lady gradually introduced the subject of her son's marriage.
               "It had become now," she said, "her greatest desire to see him married; married
                  too, to one of birth, fortune and education. Not mere amiability or beauty, or
                  both combined, would please her; she never would consent, notwithstanding he was
                  so dear, to his uniting himself with any one whose standing was beneath his
                  own."
               As she listened, the vail which had hitherto screened her feelings even from
                  herself was removed, the color forsook her cheeks, her lips quivered, her frame
                  trembled, and unable to reply to the solicitous inquiries of Mrs. Ballantyne at
                  her sudden paleness, she hastily retired to commune with her heart upon this new
                  and painful disclosure. Happily, as she supposed, her secret was unknown, it
                  should remain locked in the innermost chamber of her heart, for never would she be
                  instrumental in inflicting one pang to
                  her kind benefactress, and Eugene—and here a crimson blush suffused her cheeks—no,
                     he never should suspect that her affections were his
                     unsought!
               
               For several days she avoided Eugene, but her very effort to appear at ease when in
                  his presence, only made her conduct seem the more strange.
               One evening at an hour earlier than usual she retired to her chamber, and burying
                  her face in the rich cushions of the lounge, for some time remained
                  in deep and painful thought. Eugene loved her! yes, his own
                     lips had declared it! But feigning an indifference she did not feel for
                  the mother's sake, she had nobly refused that love, and sacrificed
                  her earthly happiness at the shrine of gratitude! Occupied with her own sad
                  thoughts, she scarcely noticed the opening of the door, until a hand was placed
                  lightly upon her shoulder. Violet raised her head, and before her stood Nelly the
                  Rag-gatherer!
               To spring from her seat and throw her snowy arms around the neck of the old woman
                  was the work of an instant.
               "I told you, you might see me again, and I am here," said Nelly. "Now tell me,
                  child, what ails you, for you have been weeping."
               "Oh, nothing, nothing, dear mother," answered Violet.
               "You never told me an untruth when you were a child, Violet, don't begin now.
                  Something ails you, speak quick and freely, tell me all, for I must be gone, for
                  the first and only time I am allowed to speak with you."
               In a low and broken voice, Violet related all her distress and its cause. When she
                  had finished, how great was her astonishment, when instead of the sympathy she had
                  expected, a low laugh from the old woman met her ear.
               "Right, right, it is as I thought. Ha! ha! ha! the young
                  man loves you then! For all madam's fine riches her son would consort with a
                  beggar; good, good! Marry him, yes, marry him, who knows but
                     I may yet sip my tea from as dainty a thing as this,
                  ay, and my wine too!"
               Amazement for some moments kept Violet silent.
               "Is it possible you can be serious!" she at length said. "Would you have me repay
                  all the kindness I have received with such ingratitude?"
               "Ay, would I, if you call it ingratitude! But who took
                  care of you when you were almost a baby? Who saved you from dying in
                  the street? Who placed you here, I should like to know?"
               "Oh, I know you were very, very kind—never can I be grateful enough! But I cannot
                  destroy the expectations and blast the hopes of Mrs. Ballantyne by accepting the
                  hand of her son, even though he offer it!"
               "And you prefer that I—I who have toiled and worked for
                  you early and late—I, so old and so helpless—I who have
                  looked forward to this day as my reward; you prefer me to remain in
                  wretched poverty rather than to disappoint this fine proud madam by doing an act
                  which would give me comfort and a home!"
               "Oh, what shall I do? what shall I do?" cried Violet, wringing her hands. "I
                  cannot act as you wish, and your displeasure is dreadful to me?"
               "Foolish, stubborn girl," exclaimed Nelly, angrily, "take then the only
                  alternative. I have a right to command
                  mand you, and I will! Leave this house, leave all your splendor, your
                  fine carpets, your beds of down, and dainty knick-knacks; leave all,
                  I say and share with me the bitter dregs of life. I am old, and your white hands
                  must become as sallow and shriveled as mine in my
                     service! You must off with your satins and muslins, and don my
                     rags! Ha, ha, ha, and a dainty beggar she'll make!" added the old woman
                  to herself.
               No marble could be whiter than the face of Violet as she listened. For some
                  moments she remained immovable; her stony gaze fastened upon the old woman.
                  Fetching a heavy sigh, she at length said:
               "Yes, I will go with you; I will work for you; I will contentedly resign all this
                  splendor which should not be mine, when you my kind and earliest friend are in
                  misery and want. Oh, why did you send me from you! But take me with you, I am
                  ready."
               "No, not to-night. Tomorrow at nine o'clock be at the gate, you will find it
                  unbolted, in the course of the day I will be there," answered Nelly. She then
                  turned to depart, her hand was already upon the knob of the door, when again she
                  stopped:
               "It is not too late yet to retain all these fine things. Think before you again
                  decide, will you accept the offer of your lover?"
               "Never!" replied Violet, firmly.
               "Then you do not love him, or you would not give him up so easily. I don't believe
                  in all your fine talk about gratitude!"
               "Not love him!" exclaimed the poor girl, "not love him! Oh, heavens,
                  may the sacrifice I am making atone for my presumption."
               "Well, at nine o'clock then, since you will have it so!" added Nelly.
               "At nine o'clock," replied Violet.
               Violet was not alone in her trouble, for Eugene too had sought his mother and
                  disclosed his love.
               "And does Violet know your attachment?" asked Mrs. Ballantyne, hastily.
               "She does, my dear mother, but her conduct is inexplicable, for while at one
                  moment I think she returns my affection, the next she avoids me—nay, she has even
                  refused my love, although my heart tells me I am not indifferent to her. Why is it
                  so, mother?"
               "Why, because Violet is a rational girl. She has sense enough to understand how
                  very unsuitable any such thing would be; it is a pity though!"
                  answered Mrs. Ballantyne with more indifference than kindness.
               "Why unsuitable? Is she not all that is good and lovely? Oh, mother,
                  I can never be happy unless she is my wife!"
               "Oh, nonsense, Eugene; this is a mere boyish fancy," replied Mrs. Ballantyne, "or,
                  if not a mere fancy, it must be crushed at once, for you
                  can never marry Violet Darling!"
               "Mother!"
               "The daughter of a miserable rag-picker, a street foundling—a—"
               "Ha!" interrupted Eugene, "it is the same—the same. I was not
                  mistaken. I knew it!"
               "Yes, she is the heroine of your boyish exploit; as she seems to be also of your
                  present folly," answered his mother carelessly twisting a ringlet.
               "Mother, mother, don't speak so coldly; you should not have placed us together, for how could I
                  refrain from loving!"
               "Have you no pride," answered his mother, "or if you can so far
                  forget yourself, I cannot!"
               "Mother, I care not who she is, I care not for what has been, it is sufficient for
                  me to know her as she is, all that is most excellent both in mind and
                  disposition—all that is lovely in person! Dearest mother, if she consents, refuse
                  not my happiness!"
               "Leave me, Eugene; your folly distresses me. Tomorrow we will talk again upon this
                  subject."
               The morrow arrived; pale and agitated Eugene entered the breakfast parlor; Mrs.
                  Ballantyne was somewhat paler than usual, but Violet did not appear. Half an hour
                  passed and still she came not.
               "Poor thing, she may be sick. I think she was looking wretchedly yesterday," said
                  Mrs. Ballantyne, "I will go to her room."
               So saying she hastily ran up stairs, but in a few moments returned in great
                  agitation, exclaiming:
               "Eugene, she has gone! Violet has left us. Read that. Oh, indeed, I did not think
                  it would come to this!"
               As she spoke, she placed in the trembling hands of her son a note, which addressed
                  to herself she had found on the dressing-table. It simply contained a few
                  incoherent sentences, thanking Mrs. Ballantyne for her kindness, with prayers for
                  her happiness. "Make no inquiries for me," it concluded, "but think of me as of
                     one dead!"
               Seizing his hat, Eugene rushed to the door.
               "Stop, stop my son; where would you go?"
               "To the ends of the earth to find her; don't, don't detain me."
               "I know of but one place," continued Mrs. Ballantyne, "where she can have gone,
                  and thither I will accompany you. Yes, it is not impossible she may have sought
                  out the old Rag-gatherer again for whom she seems to retain as great a penchant as ever. How strange! If not there, I am sure
                  I know not where to look for her."
               The carriage was immediately ordered to the door, and the mother and son set forth
                  on their anxious search.
               At the appointed hour, poor Violet reached the gloomy abode of old Nelly. She
                  entered once more that desolate apartment, and with the first glance into that
                  darkened room, all the scenes of her early life rushed upon her mind with strange
                  tenacity. Every thing was so like, even to the little three-legged stool on which
                  she had eaten her bits of bread, and there in the self-same spot was the torn
                  primer from which she first learned to read. There hung the same wooden dipper,
                  and there placed against the dingy wall was the cracked and jagged platter used
                  when Nelly could afford the luxury of meat. The old straw-bottomed chair in which
                  the Rag-gatherer reposed her jaded limbs occupied the same corner; and above where
                  she herself had pinned them, hung her sampler, and a flower wrought in worsteds.
                  Was the last few years then only some delightful dream, and had she now awoke to
                  the bitter realization of her unhappy destiny? And poor Violet sat down and tried
                  to calm her emotion ere the old woman should arrive.
               An hour or more had passed, when she was aroused from her revery by the sudden
                  stopping of a carriage at the gate, and the next moment Eugene was at her side,
                  and the arms of Mrs. Ballantyne thrown around her.
               "My dearest Violet," she began; "I cannot lose you, never did I know before how inexpressibly dear you
                  are to me. Eugene, my son, I no longer oppose your wishes; don't speak to me now,
                  don't thank me yet, wait until we get home—I feel choked here. We must not leave,
                  however, without seeing poor old Nelly; I must try to make her more comfortable.
                  What a close room! Horrible! I will just walk in the scarcely less horrible
                  door-yard until the old woman returns. Heavens, what a miserable spot!"
               The conversation of lovers not being very interesting usually to a third party,
                  let us not listen.
               It was only a few moments, at least so it seemed to Eugene and Violet, when the
                  door opened and old Nelly appeared.
               "Ha! who have we here," she cried, dropping her bag upon the floor, "what fine
                  master is this?"
               Eugene sprang to his feet.
               "Who speaks?" he exclaimed.
               "Ay, and a carriage at the door, too," continued the old woman, not heeding the
                  interruption; "Ah, great honors these for a poor Rag-gatherer!"
               "Who are you, woman?' cried Eugene, seizing her arm. "Speak, who are you?"
               The old woman raised her head—their eyes met, "Good Heavens, my
                     mother!"
               
               A young romantic girl I married your father. He was very handsome—I fancied I
                  loved him. He was rich and of a high family. I was ambitious; and thus, crowning
                     both my love and my ambition, at the age of seventeen I became
                  mistress of one of the finest establishments in the city. Time flew on rapturous
                  wings for a season, and then, too late, I found I had sacrificed my happiness to a
                  man who had neither sensibility to appreciate my love, nor even kindness to repay
                  the sacrifice. I was not a happy wife. He was gay and dissipated. I reproached;
                  this tended to alienate even the slight regard he might have felt for me, and it
                  ended in a total rupture. Under our own roof we became as strangers!
               You were born, my dear son, and the dormant affections of my young heart sprang
                  into action. I felt I had not lived before! I pressed you again and again to my
                  bosom. I bathed your little face with tears of joy. This dear boy, my
                     child, my sweet Eugene, was to be henceforth the world to me. I
                  felt myself no longer a neglected wife. I no longer regretted the love of my
                  husband. I devoted myself entirely to you, and weeks would pass without beholding
                  your father; for strange as it may seem, he appeared equally indifferent to the
                  feelings of a parent as he had proved to those of a
                     husband. You were about six years old when he died a sudden and a
                  dreadful death, leaving his affairs in a state of much embarrassment. Still I
                  doubted not his fortune would prove very considerable; but, alas, when all was
                  settled, a mere pittance only was my residue! This news was like a thunderbolt to
                  me. I have said I was ambitious, but not until that fatal moment did I know how
                  much so. What could I do to avoid descending the ladder upon whose topmost round
                  my footing had hitherto been? And you, my fine, my noble boy, were you henceforth
                  to grovel through life a poor widow's son—toiling for your education, or your hard
                  earnings yielded up to support a helpless mother? No, my pride, and,
                  let me add, my affection, would not permit it! I could not use my needle for a
                     maintenance nance—neither would I
                  become a teacher, for the instant I condescended to either my
                  standing in society would be lost, and from this my proud heart rebelled.
               At length a bold and hazardous plan suggested itself. I remembered to have read
                  and heard of many instances where people had become rich—nay, even excessively
                  wealthy, by gleaning the rags and rubbish cast into the
                  streets by careless house-keepers and servants. The more I thought of this, the
                  more I was impressed with the certainty of success should I adopt
                  this same odious means of subsistence. For a time I acknowledge I strove to waive
                  an idea so inconsistent with my manner of life; but it haunted me night and day;
                  it became as it were a monomania—and at length I
                  determined upon the undertaking. Methought my greatest trial would be in parting
                  from my boy, for it was necessary to place you in some safe hands, as, of course,
                  I must now yield up that undivided care which had been both my solace and delight.
                  I placed you, therefore, at a small select school a few miles from the city, where
                  at any time one hour would carry me to you. This done, I set about my
                  arrangements. I engaged rooms in a highly fashionable boarding house, to keep up
                  the appearance of wealth, and as my widow's weeds of course precluded
                  my mixing in society, my time was consequently my own. With the half nearly of my
                  little fortune I then purchased this miserable, isolated dwelling.
               I found I could disguise my person without danger of detection; not even my
                  nearest friend would have been able to recognize me. A dark paint imparted a
                  sallowness to my complexion, and by using a little art in putting it on, I made
                  myself look a woman of seventy! From the hair-dresser I procured a gray wig, a few
                  hairs of which I allowed to escape from under my old torn bonnet; indeed, so
                  shocked was I at my appearance the first time I saw myself in the glass, that I
                  nearly fainted, and was even then upon the point of throwing off my wretched rags,
                  and renouncing forever a life so disgusting.
               I commenced my hazardous career. In this city there are many houses of elegant and
                  genteel appearance, where one can go with perfect freedom and do what, and as they
                  please—where for a bribe no questions are ever asked, nor need you fear betrayal.
                  I hired a small room in one of these, kept by an old Jew. It was my custom to
                  leave my boarding house as if for a walk, and repair to this dwelling; neither had
                  I any scruples at being seen by any chance acquaintance entering a house of so
                  respectable an appearance. I was always admitted by the old Jew; here I put on my
                  rags, and was let out again through a dark alley opening into the adjoining
                  street. Suffice it to say that at my first initiation I was so successful as to
                  confirm me more strongly in my purpose. Articles of value frequently rewarded my
                  gleanings of the sewers and drains—sometimes jewels, trifling amounts of money,
                  laces, ribbons, besides the common filthy rags, of no value excepting to the
                  paper-maker. After a fire especially my profits were not unfrequently over fifty
                  dollars; my wretched appearance too, awoke the charity of the passer-by, so that a
                  week sometimes would bring me several dollars. I would not have
                     begged, but what shall I say, I refused not that
                  which was thrust upon me. I each day brought my pack of unseemly gains to this my
                  castle. Here I would separate and arrange them according to their value prior
                     to disposing of them to those who
                  always stand ready to receive such merchandise.
               Strange as it may appear, in a few years I found myself rapidly growing rich, and
                  in my own name was able to invest the earnings of "Poor
                     Nelly" in Bank Stocks, &c. But I never felt secure. I had the
                  mortification to find that my frequent absence, so unaccountable and so
                  periodical, had awakened much suspicion; and I therefore determined to renounce my
                  seclusion of widowhood, and come forth again into the gay world, and resume the
                  station in society I had never lost, but from which I had only withdrawn for a
                  season; and I now felt my fortune was sufficient to keep me there! I
                  hired a splendid mansion—furnished it in the most elegant style—threw off my
                  weeds, and emerged from my chrysalis the gay and dashing Mrs.
                     Ballantyne—then still young, and as my glass told me, still
                  handsome! I thought now to avoid comment; but where will not the peering eye of
                  curiosity reach, or the tongue of slander defile! I found my mysterious conduct
                  still the theme of animadversion; so I determined to make mystery my
                     forte. I surrounded myself with
                     mystery; I walked as it were in a mist, and now
                     was only called eccentric! No one neglected my balls, my suppers, my
                  fétes—I became more distingué than ever.
               In the meanwhile I steadily pursued my vocation of Rag-gatherer, and
                  you can probably hardly credit me, when I say that I became even attached to this
                  manner of life. It seemed to me I had two existences, and those the very antipodes of society, and I delighted in doing justice
                  to both! As Mrs. Ballantyne I surrounded myself with
                  every luxury and elegance; as poor Nelly, I fared worse than the
                  street beggar. Without grimace I drank the dingy water from the rough wooden
                  dipper; in this I soaked the crust of stale bread to appease my hunger, and
                  stretched my limbs upon the hard straw pallet. I need not have done this; I might
                  have fared like a princess in my rags; but I gloried in identifying myself with
                     poor Nelly. And in the evening my lips pressed the exquisite
                  China, or the richly chased goblet; delicate comfits were prepared for my
                  fastidious taste, and I reposed myself upon cushions of satin and down! I became
                  again Mrs. Ballantyne. But you, my son, were still my idol; I saw you
                  coming forward in life all the fondest mother could wish, and I hugged the more
                  the pitiful calling which enabled me to place you where your father had
                     stood!
               
               Now a sudden fear seized me; I found the passion of avarice fast gaining upon me;
                  the very nature of my employment was conducive to its growth. I shuddered to find
                  myself actually gloating over any unexpected treasure which fell to my hands, with
                  the same delight I should have felt were I in reality the poor wretch I
                  personated. To break from its thraldom required a vigorous effort. I succeeded. As
                  an atonement for the duplicity (for so I must call it) practiced so long upon the
                  public, I now gave away large sums to charitable institutions, and sought out the
                  poor and miserable to relieve their wants, and in so doing, I felt happier than I
                  had ever done before. It was at this time, my dear Violet, that the hand of
                  Providence guided me to you, as if to confirm my good resolutions. When I closed
                  the eyes of your unhappy parent, I solemnly vowed within myself, and in the sight
                  of God, to take you to my heart as my own child, and that you should share equally with my son the
                  fortune which my conscience told me I had surreptitiously obtained. I soon loved
                  you, yet you were a constant source of anxiety to me. I formed the romantic
                  resolution of educating you entirely from the world; to keep your mind pure as
                  infancy; and then, when I had led your steps along the perfect path my fancy had
                  opened for you, when my work should be accomplished, the world should see my
                  prodigy—a perfect model of beauty, intelligence and virtue!
               You were ever a gentle, obedient child, and without a murmur suffered yourself to
                  be left alone all through the dreary night, and sometimes entire days. As your
                  mind expanded, how I delighted in my airy scheme! It was a pleasure for me to
                  instruct you, and for a time I relinquished entirely my street rambles, that I
                  might pursue your education. It was a wild chimera, of an imagination as wild, to
                  suppose you were always to be as contented in this dreary solitary dwelling until
                     I chose to lift the latch of freedom; it certainly proved so, for
                  at the age of fourteen the old garden could no longer content you. Your own act
                  destroyed the illusion, and it was for the best. As Mrs. Ballantyne I now received
                  you to my arms; but I trembled for my incognita.
                  I found you gazing upon me at times with looks so full of wonder; at the sound of
                  my voice you would sometimes start, change color, and appear so perplexed, that I
                  found if I wished to preserve my secret I must give my charge into other
                  hands.
               How happy I felt, my dear Violet, when I found you retained all your affection and
                  interest for the wretched companion of your childhood—the poor
                     rag-woman; that your elevated sphere had not made you forgetful of
                  your humble home; and although you disobeyed my injunctions by continually asking
                  in your letters about poor Nelly, it was an offence too dear to my heart not to be
                  overlooked.
               Need I say, my children, how truly I rejoiced when you, the two dearest objects of
                  my love, were brought together under my roof, to discover the mutual affection
                  kindled in your hearts! But I wished to probe the sincerity of your love, Eugene,
                  for I would not wreck the happiness of this dear girl as my own had been; and I
                  wished also to discover if you, Violet, had sufficient strength of mind—firmness
                  of principle—to renounce your own happiness, that you might not
                  distress her whom you knew but as Mrs. Ballantyne, and at the same time attest
                  your gratitude to your early friend, poor Nelly.
               The result has proved my expectations, and fulfilled my dearest wishes. Take her,
                  Eugene; she is indeed a treasure. The good I have endeavored to do, will, I trust,
                  in some measure atone for the double part I have enacted so many years. My future
                  life shall be devoted to deeds of charity.
               I have sold this wretched dwelling. Tomorrow the old walls will tumble down, and
                  with them forever disappears "Nelly the Rag-gatherer!"
            
            
               
               THE PERPLEXED STUDENT.
               A LESSON FOR BACHELOR BOOKWORMS.
               
                  CHAPTER I.
                  
                     
                        
                           "From woman's eyes this doctrine I derive;
                           They sparkle still the right Promethean fire,
                           They are the books—the arts—the academies
                           That show, contain, and nourish all the world."
                        
                     
                  
                  HORACE MANSFIELD was rapidly becoming a misanthrope—yet stay, that may be too
                     harsh a term to apply to my young hero, for, although shunning society, 
                        
                           "He hated not his fellow-men,
                           While from their close companionship he shrank,
                           And in wrapt converse with the dead, forgot
                           To wave the mystic wand which must reveal
                           The sources, whence flow streams of deeper happiness."
                        
                      For, with an almost hermit-like seclusion from the world did he shut
                     himself within the narrow limits of his study—seldom going thence unless to
                     stroll in meditative mood, with folded arms and eyes downcast, through the
                     adjoining forest. Earthquakes might shake the globe—thrones totter from their
                     base, and kings bite the dust—what then? To him it was no more than the sighing
                     of the autumnal blast, sweeping in its course from the monarchs of the wood
                     their gorgeous diadems!
                  Already at the age of twenty-three, he had never felt the passion of love, nor
                     looked with deeper emotion upon any of Eve's fair daughters, that he did upon
                     the painted butterfly glancing in giddy circles before him, and should either
                     approach too near, he would probably have brushed both from his path with the
                     same stoical indifference—pretty, harmless creatures, butterflies and
                     maidens!
                  Now this was a most unfortunate state of things for Mr. Mansfield, Senior. A
                     widower for many long years, and too much attached to the memory of the
                     departed to think of marrying a second time, he had suffered himself to look
                     forward with pleased anticipation to the period when Horace, his only child,
                     should be old enough to take a wife. Ah! the presence of a young charming
                     bride, how it would change all things at the lonely old Hall! What magic would
                     her sweet voice exert—how would her lightest footfall thrill his heart with the
                     gladness of other days! Bless her bright eyes and her sunny smile—already the
                     old gentleman doted upon this ignis fatuus of
                     his imagination.
                  How great then was his disappointment to find Horace, at the age of manhood,
                     too deeply absorbed by the Portias and Lucretias of ancient days, to bestow
                     even a thought upon living beauties—going back into the dim ages of the past,
                     and there falling in raptures over the virtues of a Cornelia, or the charms of
                     a Helen, and would take to his arms an old, musty, black-letter folio with more
                     delight than he would clasp the fairest copy of womankind. In vain the old
                     gentleman preached to his moody son—in vain tossing upon a sleepless pillow,
                     he, night after night, strove to devise some plan to draw him from his
                     studies—one day he would propose hunting ing, another, fishing; sometimes he would urge travel, or suggest a winter
                     in the city. But looking up with a dreamy air, Horace would only shrug his
                     shoulders, utter something between a yawn and a groan, and then plunge anew
                     into the labyrinth of by-gone ages, or puzzle his brains with some metaphysical
                     question. Besides, 
                        
                           "He was in logic a great critic,
                           Profoundly skilled in analytic;
                           He could distinguish and divide
                           A hair 'twixt south and southwest side.
                           In mathematics he was greater
                           Than Tycho Brahe or Erra Pater,
                           Besides 'twas known he could speak Greek
                           As naturally as pigs do squeak!"
                        
                     
                  
                  "Confound all books!" would the old gentleman exclaim. And indeed had books
                     been as rare as in the days of the worshipful Knight of La Mancha, how gladly
                     would Mr. Mansfield have emulated the zeal of the worthy curate and barber, and
                     consigned to the flames those silent yet sorcerous enemies to his hopes. But in
                     these "latter days," when, with the swiftness with which one wave chases
                     another, as the speed of thought, or the constant dropping of sand in the
                     inverted hourglass, the teeming Press sends forth her offspring, well he knew,
                     that from the glowing mass, another, Phœnix-like, would arise from its ashes,
                     and its name be "Legion!" Therefore smothering his fiery ardor, he once more
                     looked within his brain for some more effectual counter-charm to their
                     enchantments.
                  And no wonder the poor old gentleman was out of all patience, for it did seem a
                     thousand pities that such a fine, handsome young fellow as Horace, should be
                     thus wasting the freshness of his youth, encased like a mummy in a
                     catacomb!
                  And so one day Mr. Mansfield suddenly broke into this living tomb, making
                     considerable bustle, too, as he did so, by slamming the door, and kicking over
                     a huge Josephus—but bless you! the student heeded it no more than he would the
                     dancing of a thistle-down through the open window. Dragging a chair not very
                     gently to the table, the old gentleman seated himself facing his abstracted
                     son, where he might have sat unnoticed till doomsday had he not taken a pretty
                     sure way of making his presence known, namely, by suddenly sweeping his large
                     bony hand over the open page, and hurling the book under the table. It must be
                     confessed Horace was too well accustomed to this mode of salutation to express
                     any surprise, and, therefore, merely raising his head, with a long-drawn sigh,
                     he said—
                  "Well, father?"
                  "Now! tell you what it is, Horace," exclaimed the old gentleman, striking his
                     fist upon the voluminous mass of papers before him; "I can't stand this any
                     longer—this sort of life won't do for me. I have borne it as patiently as a
                     saint for as many years as you can count fingers and toes, and now there must
                     be an end of it. I ask you if you don't feel ashamed of yourself,—I ask you if
                     you are doing any thing to make your old father happy, perched up there week in
                     and week out, like a piece of petrified clay, when you should be looking out
                     for a wife, and gladdening my old eyes, ere death closes them forever, by the
                     sight of your happiness."
                  "Why, my dear sir, I cannot conceive of greater happiness piness than these my silent friends afford me,"
                     replied Horace.
                  "Nonsense—I know better; but I'm not going to argue the point with you,—it is
                     only a waste of breath, and I am tired of it. Only answer me one question,—will
                     you or will you not get married?"
                  Horace smiled, shook his head, and tracing a parallelogram on the paper before
                     him, replied:
                  "Methinks, my dear father, it would have been no greater absurdity for old
                     Thomas Aquinas to have doffed the cowl, and relaxed his stern visage into the
                     soft simper of a lover's smile, than for me to break from these rusty fetters,
                     only to yield allegiance to Love's rosy bondage."
                  "Fiddle-de-dee!—Then I tell you what I've a great mind to do,—fall
                     into the what-do-you-call-it bondage of Love myself," answered the old
                     gentleman. "Now, suppose I get a wife, Horace?"
                  "No doubt, father, a woman would be very useful in looking after the
                     house,—really, I think your suggestion most excellent."
                  "Look after the house, you iceberg!—Mrs. Dimity does that, don't she? No, I
                     want no wife that will be forever bustling about in the kitchen and pantry—I
                     want society, I tell you—I am tired of sitting like an old solitary badger, or
                     of smoking my pipe with the gravity of Robinson Crusoe, with only the cat at my
                     elbow, and for amusement counting the flies crawling over the ceiling,—I am
                     tired of it, I tell you!"
                  "Then, father, to be serious, why not get married? I really don't see how you
                     can do better," said Horace.
                  "You don't, well, I do,—for, after all, no pretty lass would fancy an old
                     fellow like me, and as for the elderly damsels, they would prefer their snuff
                     and tea;—no, no, I have a better plan than marriage in my head. Harkee, young
                     gentleman! I am going to rejuvenate these old walls; I will fill them with
                     beauty, with sparkling eyes and beaming smiles, angels and sylphs shall glide
                     amid its lonely chambers, and the music of glad voices ring like marriage bells
                     through these old elms!"
                  "Do you wield the wand of Prospero, my dear father, that you can thus at
                     pleasure summon such dainty spirits?" said Horace, smiling.
                  "You shall see, for tomorrow I start for New York, from thence I shall take a
                     trip into Jersey;—I have nieces by the dozen, young, glad creatures, as merry
                     as the birds, and it shall go hard but I will bring home such a charming flock
                     as shall make me young again. So, Mr. Horace, revel among your old tomes like a
                     bookworm, as you are, while I cry 'Vive la
                        bagatelle!'" Saying which, the old gentleman leaped up from his
                     chair, cut the pigeon wing with a great flourish, snapped his fingers in the
                     face of Horace, and then fairly danced out of the room with all the agility of
                     a boy.
                  Sure enough it was no joke, the threat which Mr. Mansfield had uttered, for,
                     that very evening, Pete was despatched to the village, three miles distant, to
                     book the old gentleman for the Albany stage, whence the steam-boat would bear
                     him to the city, and, at an early hour the following morning, the quiet woods
                     around the old Hall echoed, not with the merry peal of the huntsman's notes,
                     but with the doleful "Toot-toot-too-oo-ot-toot" of the tin
                     stage-horn, dolefully re-tooted on every side, and in a few
                     moments the lumbering coach itself, with its four lean, spavined attachées, appeared looming through the fog, and wheeled up with a desperate
                     attempt at display to the door of the Hall.
                  "Well, good-bye, Mrs. Dimity," exclaimed the old gentleman, slowly descending
                     the steps, and drawing on his gloves; "have an eye on the boy that he don't
                     starve upon his logical chips, and remember, too, to have every thing in
                     readiness, just as I told you,—see that the rooms are all well aired,—keep Pete
                     busy among the weeds, and look out for the strawberry beds, for there will be
                     dainty fingers busy there by-and-by,—and don't forget to send Pete down to the
                     village for Treble to come and tune up the old piano. There, good-bye to you."
                     So saying, he mounted to the roof of the stage, where he seated himself
                     comfortably by the side of the driver, then, with a chuckle and a significant
                     nod toward the still closed shutters of his son, he gave the word, "All's
                        ready." The wheels groaned and shrieked—the coach grumbled—Jehu
                     cracked his whip—the horses, looking sideways at each other, as if to say, "if
                     we must—we must, that's all," stretched their sinews to the task and the coach
                     was set in motion.
                  Mr. Mansfield once more waved his hand to the housekeeper, and then bracing
                     himself to bear the jolting of the crazy vehicle, was soon rattling over the
                     turnpike, en route for Albany.
               
               
                  CHAPTER II.
                  "MR. HORACE! Mr. Horace!—dear me, what a boy! I say, Mr. Horace, don't you know
                     your father is coming home this very blessed day, with all those city girls,
                     and yet here you sit, although it is past five o'clock, in your old
                     dressing-gown and slippers!—Dear me, Mr. Hor-a-ce!" and elevating her voice
                     almost to a scream, Mrs. Dimity, the housekeeper, approached close to the elbow
                     of the student, and placed her hand upon his shoulder.
                  "Ah, Mrs. Dimity, dinner is ready then,—very well, don't wait, I will be down
                     in a moment," said Horace, without, however, raising his eyes from his
                     book.
                  "Dear me! dear me! do pray shut up your book, Mr. Horace!" cried the good
                     woman; "why, bless me, they will be here in an hour! Do now, Mr. Horace, go and
                     shave yourself, and put on your new black coat and your satin vest,—why dearee
                     me, your beard is as long as any old patriarch's in the book of Genesis!—Come,
                     Mr. Horace, I have laid your clothes all out for you—Mr. Horace! Mr. Horace!
                     there, there!—Mercy on me, he don't hear no more than the dead!" And poor Mrs.
                     Dimity made a second attempt to attract the attention of the absent young
                     gentleman, by pulling his sleeve.
                  "Ah, yes; well, Mrs. Dimity, what were you saying?"
                  "Why that it is time for you to make yourself decent to appear before the
                     company," replied the housekeeper.
                  "For shame, Mr. Horace; why most young men would have been dressed an hour ago,
                     and all on tiptoe, like Prince Chorazzin in the fairy tale, to see your
                     beautiful cousins,—come now, throw away your book, do!"
                  "My good Mrs. Dimity," replied Horace smiling, "if you ever read Shakspeare I
                     would ask, 'What's Hecuba to me or I to Hecuba!' Yet I thank you for reminding
                     me of these expected guests, whom I had indeed forgotten."
                  
                  "Forgotten! dear me, did any one ever hear the like!" exclaimed Mrs. Dimity,
                     raising her hands in astonishment.
                  "How many of these cousins of mine do you expect?" asked Horace. "Mere
                     schoolgirls, I suppose."
                  "All I know is, your father said he would bring home a whole coach-load, if he
                     could get them," answered Mrs. Dimity, "and I have been all the week getting
                     the house in order for them—rubbing up the old furniture—cleaning the brasses,
                     whitening the linen, and filling the store closet with plenty of plum-cake and
                     ginger-nuts! I vow and declare, Mr. Horace, it is absolutely provoking to see
                     you take it so coolly, just as if your father was only going to bring home a
                     new brood of ducks or chickens!"
                  "They will gabble at fast, no doubt," said Horace. "I shall be glad, however,
                     if my father finds pleasure from their society, Mrs. Dimity; so far, their
                     presence will be a relief to me."
                  "Well, well, aren't you going to dress yourself?—Mercy on me, if you appear
                     before them in that dishabilly, the poor
                     things will think you are Valentine and Orson!"
                  "Rest easy, Mrs. Dimity—I will be in readiness to receive our guests. Don't
                     stop longer on my account, I beg," returned Horace.
                  "A-hem! hem!—just as sure as I live he will never stir a step if I
                     don't keep teasing him!" said the old housekeeper to herself, pretending to
                     leave the room, but stopping midway to watch the effect of her previous
                     admonition.
                  In another moment Horace had apparently forgotten everything but the page
                     before him, to which he now gave his most rapt attention.
                  "How beautiful!" he exclaimed abstractedly—"as A is to B, so is C to D—let me
                     see—as X is to Y—so is M to N—what harmony!"
                  "Dear, dear, only hear him!" cried Mrs. Dimity. "What is the use of spending so
                     much time if one can't learn? Poor boy, he is always puzzling over
                     A, B, and C—well, I don't know much to be sure, but thank Heaven, I do know
                     that AB spells ab, and CA spells ca! Mr. Horace!"
                     and this time the vexed old lady shook our hero not very gently.
                  "Ah yes, true—I had forgotten—well I will go now;" and most reluctantly the
                     student rose from the table, and casting 'a long lingering look behind,'
                     proceeded to the duties of the toilet.
                  Feeling that she had thus successfully acquitted herself of this
                     responsibility, the housekeeper now hurried to the kitchen to see if the supper
                     was in progress—the coffee boiling, and the rolls ready to put in the oven—from
                     thence she put her head into the dairy, to look after the fine, fragrant
                     butter, and the rich cream set apart for the table. The tea-room next demanded
                     her attention—lifting the fine damask cloth spread over the tea equipage, to
                     discover if the flies had dared to crawl within any chance opening, and were
                     now, little thieves, feasting upon the delicious cake, the dishes of ruby
                     quince, or the lumps of snowy sugar heaped so generously upon the social board.
                     Her next visit was to the parlor, surveying for, at least, the twentieth time
                     that day the proofs of her neatness and taste, displayed in its arrangement,
                     and every time finding a little something to do—a chair to move half an inch to the right, a
                     table to wheel a little more to the left—the curtains to be looped up or let
                     down—books to move, and the little china vases filled with pretty flowers to
                     re-arrange, so as to exhibit to greater advantage some favorite blossom; and
                     lastly, the notable old lady took a hurried and satisfactory inspection of the
                     chambers, and then hastened to her own little room to doff the homely dark
                     chintz gown for a more becoming attire, ere the arrival of Mr. Mansfield and
                     his young nieces.
                  A short time sufficed for her toilet, and Mrs. Dimity came forth arrayed in a
                     shining black silk petticoat, relieved by a short gown or negligée of white
                     cambric falling just below the hips, and ornamented with a broad ruffle neatly
                     plaited, and her gray hair combed smoothly back under a cap of the whitest and
                     stiffest lawn. But of all her earthly possessions, that which the old lady most
                     prized was the gold spectacles which Mr. Mansfield had presented her on
                     Christmas, and these she had now mounted, together with the large silver watch
                     once the property of her deceased husband. In this becoming and tidy garb, she
                     now paused before the door of Horace's chamber.
                  "I may as well give him a call," said she, "for just as likely as not he is off
                     in one of his absent fits again."
                  She listened a moment,—all was still—tap-tap-tap—no answer—tap-tap—"Mr.
                     Horace!"—knock, knock,—"Mr. Hor"—knock,—"ace!—Come, are you ready, Mr. Horace?"
                     And the good lady, now quite out of patience, shook and pounded the door as if
                     the house was on fire, and unconscious of danger, the inmate of the chamber
                     calmly sleeping.
                  "Yes, Mrs. Dimity, yes, yes, I am coming, I hear," said the voice of Horace,
                     aroused at length by the din.
                  Even as he spoke, the winding of the stage-horn proclaimed the approach of the
                     travelers.
                  "Mercy on me, here they come! There—the coach is now turning into the great
                     gate,—do make haste, do, Mr. Horace." And as rapidly as she could the old lady
                     descended the stairs, and throwing open the hall door, stepped out on the
                     piazza to receive them. Horace almost mechanically followed close behind
                     her,—but, to the horror of the worthy housekeeper, all her labor of speech had
                     been thrown away, for there he stood in the full glare of sunlight, still in
                        robe-de-chambre and pantouffles, his beard unshorn, his hair
                     disordered.
                  "Good gracious, Mr. Horace! Do go back—you look like a fright—pray go quick,—I
                     will say you are sick, or out, or any thing, only don't stand there in such a
                     trim."
                  But it was too late. The driver cracked his whip—the horses bounded forward,
                     and the crazy old coach drew up to the door.
                  Merry peals of laughter met the ear, and the music of young, girlish
                     voices,—bewitching little straw bonnets clustered together, and taper fingers
                     and snowy wrists rested upon the old brown sides of the coach—then suddenly
                     these were withdrawn, and fluttering vails thrown back, and out blazed a galaxy
                     of the most brilliant orbs, all fixed with mischievous glance upon the person
                     of our hero, standing ready to assist their egress from the stage.
                  Agile as sylphs, out they sprang upon the bright green turf, and gathered
                     around poor Horace, whilst Mr. Mansfield field, his good-humored face all in a glow of delight, slowly
                     dismounted.
                  "You need not laugh you little jades, I am not as young as you are!—Ah, Horace,
                     my boy, how are you?" cried the old gentleman. "Bless me, why don't you salute
                     your cousins? Never be bashful, man,—here, this is your cousin Kate, and this
                     is her sister, Lucy Mansfield, and here is my stately Constance, and this, the
                     mirth-loving Gabriella Lincoln, and this is roguish Bessie, and this
                     little—hey, where is Meg?—ah, there she goes, the gipsy, skimming over the lawn
                     like a lapwing?"
                  And each fair cousin in turn presented a rosy cheek to the salute of the
                     embarrassed Horace.
                  "Well, girls, welcome to Mansfield Hall," continued the old gentleman, as the
                     gay party tripped up the steps of the portico. "Here, Mrs. Dimity, I make over
                     these merry girls to you. Show them their rooms, if you please, and then let's
                     have supper, for this long ride over the hills has given me a pretty sharp
                     appetite. Hark ye, girls, you need not stop to beautify yourselves; there is
                     nobody here but your old uncle to see you, for as for your cousin Horace, he
                     will never look at you, or fall in love with you."
                  There was more than one arch glance cast toward the spot where Horace stood
                     leaning against one of the pillars, feeling, it must be confessed, a little
                     foolish at this blunt speech of his father,—and more than one little head was
                     saucily tossed, ere the fair girls disappeared with Mrs. Dimity into the
                     house.
                  "Nice girls, Horace, full of life and spirit!" exclaimed Mr. Mansfield,
                     slapping him on the shoulder. "Bless their sunny faces, why they have made me
                     young again!—Hark, did you ever hear such music as that?" as a joyous laugh
                     rang out upon the summer air from one of the upper windows. "Ah, I see you,
                     minx!" shaking his cane at a mirthful face peeping down upon him through the
                     fragrant sweet-brier, which clustered around the casement.
                  Horace quickly retreated into the hall, and passed on to his chamber, his ears
                     yet ringing with that happy, merry laugh.
               
               
                  CHAPTER III.
                  TEA was over ere Horace came down stairs, notwithstanding the repeated summons
                     of the housekeeper—and to his credit be it said, his appearance was now much
                     more becoming the society of such charming young ladies, than the negligent
                     attire in which he paid his first devoirs.
                  As he drew near the open door of the parlor, a skillful hand swept over the
                     keys of the piano, as if to test its tone and finish, and then, above the music
                     of gay voices arose the enlivening air of a waltz, and by the time Horace
                     entered the room, the whole bevy of fair girls were tripping it like so many
                     fays to the lively music,—all, except the charming musician, Gabriella, who,
                     with her head bent archly over one shoulder, while her fingers swiftly swept
                     the keys, nodded gaily to the dancers as they flew past her in the giddy waltz.
                     Round and round on twinkling feet they airily glide—forms all lightness—arms
                     entwining, and rosy lips parted with smiles that would vanquish St.
                     Anthony,—gently and lightly round and round they float. For a moment or two the
                     delighted old uncle contents tents
                     himself with humming the air, and beating time with hand and foot, then,
                     skimming into the circle, he throws his arm round little Meggie, and away they
                     twirl with the rest—twirling, whirling, rising, sinking, round and round—and
                     faster Gabriella touches the keys, and faster fly the merry waltzers. Now they
                     take a wider circuit, and nearer—ever nearer to the spot where Horace stands
                     entranced, they come circling on, their floating ringlets mingling with his
                     breath, and bright eyes gazing roguishly into his, as round and round they
                     circle past—while round and round in bewildering maze the brains of Horace are
                     circling too! Are these beautiful forms real he sees before him? Do such fair
                     beings indeed exist; and like the maidens of old who enticed the angels from
                     their pure abode, are these bewitching forms about to turn him from the
                     cloud-land in which he had so long loitered? But the gay measure suddenly
                     ceases,—and panting and laughing, each fair waltzer sank down.
                  "Whe-w-w—you good for nothing little rogues, you have made my old head spin
                     like a top—steady—steady—take care—there I am safe!" cried the old gentleman
                     plunging down upon a corner of the sofa. "Ah! are you there, Mr. Diogenes?—why
                     where's your tub?" addressing Horace.
                  And as if for the first time aware of his presence, six pair of bewitching eyes
                     turned full upon our hero.
                  "I have been a silent spectator of your enjoyment, fair cousins," said Horace,
                     bowing to the lovely circle.
                  "Indeed; but not a participator, of course," remarked Gabriella.
                  "Why of course not," added Kate "our folly can only be annoying to our
                     cousin."
                  "You wrong me, Miss Mansfield," said Horace; "I assure you that in the present
                     instance I believe the spectator enjoyed even more than the performers."
                  "And you'll dance with me next time, Cousin Horace, won't you?" cried little
                     Meggie, the youngest of the six fair girls, not yet in her teens, tripping
                     across the room, and catching his hand, "Come, Constance is going to play for
                     us."
                  "For shame, Meggie!" exclaimed Constance gravely, lifting her finger in
                     reproval—"how can you thus annoy your cousin!"
                  "Pray do excuse the child—she is very thoughtless—I beg you will not heed her
                     foolish request. Fie, Meggie!" added Gabriella.
                  "Never trouble yourselves, girls," exclaimed Mr. Mansfield; "not even the
                     charmed fiddle I read about when a boy, were it in the hands of old Orpheus
                     himself, could make our solemn scholar here cut a single caper!"
                  Horace felt exceedingly annoyed. "Is there not a charm more potent here, my
                     dear father?" he said, smiling at little Meg.
                  "Ah yes, you will dance—there, I knew you would. Constance—Kate—Cousin Horace
                        will dance!" exultingly cried the little gipsy.
                  Constance arose, and taking the little girl by the hand drew her away, saying,
                     at the same time, in a most grave and earnest manner, which her laughing eyes
                     more than half belied,
                  "Cousin Horace, as we are to be the guests of my dear uncle for some weeks, we
                     trust you will not out of any courtesy to us, neglect or forego those pleasures
                     so much more congenial to you—we know the study, not the drawing-room ing-room, is the spot where you most
                     love to be, and therefore to feel that our presence here compels you through
                     politeness merely, to forsake it, would cause us all much chagrin—is it not so,
                     girls?"
                  "True, Constance—I am sure my visit instead of being a pleasure, will only be a
                     vexation, if Cousin Horace sacrifices his own enjoyment!" said Kate.
                  "And so will mine—indeed it will!" cried another.
                  "And mine," added a third, "and besides, our dear uncle is so kind, and has so
                     many plans for our amusement, that I really don't see any necessity for Cousin
                     Horace to waste a single moment upon us!"
                  "You see how it is—so banish all restraint, and let not another minute of your
                     valuable time be thrown away," said Constance in a grave and decided
                     manner.
                  "And here," cried Kate, demurely handing him a little silver candlestick, "is a
                     light—and now do, dear cousin, return to your books, and give yourself no
                     trouble about us."
                  In vain Horace tried to speak—in vain he essayed to refute the charges they
                     were heaping upon him—his tongue refused all utterance. He looked to his father
                     for assistance—but just at that moment the old gentleman was engaged in a
                     desperate battle with a horned-beetle, which with flying handkerchief he was
                     chasing from corner to corner—and so poor Horace suffered himself to be bowed
                     and courtesied out, by his kind considerate cousins!
                  Then—such a peal of joyous mirth as followed him up the study stairs! what
                     could it mean? "Ah, doubtless," he thought, "they are laughing at some droll
                     sally of my father."
                  Poor Horace!
                  Sleep was almost a stranger to his eyes that night—his pillow haunted by the
                     strangest visions. Was he bewitched? for the room seemed filled with light airy
                     figures. 
                        
                           "They stood beside his head,
                           Smiling thoughts, with hair dispread!
                           The moonshine seemed disheveled."
                        
                      Or, if he closed his eyes, he saw them still floating around him, and
                     bright eyes like shooting stars were continually darting across his vision,
                     while like the murmur of forest brooks were the gentle voices whispering in his
                     ears. And when at length he slept, he dreamed of the glittering harem of the
                     Vailed Prophet—of the bewitching Zelica, and of the still more fascinating
                     indwellers upon Calypso's enchanted isle.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  A SUNBEAM stole a kiss from the brow of Horace and awoke him, while at the same
                     moment a chorus of merry voices came up from beneath his window, reminding the
                     half-bewildered student that it was not all a dream—the visions of the
                     night.
                  Yes, there they were, the whole happy troop, in the most bewitching morning
                     dresses, enjoying to their bent this lovely summer morning in the country.
                     Without a saddle, bonny Kate had sprung upon the back of his favorite pony,
                     playfully patting his arched neck and coaxing him to a fleet gallop over the
                     greensward—and now away, away they bound across the lawn, shaking down the
                     glittering dew drops from the old elms, and the long beautiful hair of Kate
                     floating in luxuriant abandon on the soft breezy air. Constance, the stately,
                     dignified Constance, mounted on the brink of the horse-trough, is clapping her
                     hands at the gambols of some half-dozen little porkers in the pig-sty, and
                     tossing green apples into the voracious mouth of Madame Mère. Gabriella, with her neat pink gingham carefully tucked up
                     around her cunning little ankles, has seated herself upon the milking-stool,
                     taking a lesson from the tall, laughing Irish girl, while at a little distance
                     Bessie and Lucy, surrounded by a noisy chattering brood of fowls, from the
                     stately turkey to the tiniest unfledged chicken, are scattering among them
                     handfuls of the yellow grain, which they have just brought in their aprons from
                     the corn-crib. A merry shout—and from a little thicket out springs merry
                     Meggie, with a long fish-pole trailing after her, and in her hand a bunch of
                     shining trout, while with a loud "halloo" the old gentleman
                     himself follows close behind her, crying out—
                  "Ah, you mischievous monkey, will you spoil my best rod, and run away with my
                     fish to boot!"
                  "New times these, Mr. Horace!" said Mrs. Dimity, close at the elbow of the
                     student, ere he was aware of her presence—for be it owned, his senses were all
                     absorbed by the novel and beautiful scene from his window, where concealed by a
                     half-closed blind, he had been looking out upon the cheerful abandon of his fair cousins. "Dear me, it makes me
                     think of my young days, Mr. Horace, just to see and hear them pretty creatures!
                     I thought I'd just look in to see if you were fit to be seen, for breakfast is
                     almost ready. Now, don't go down in that old dressing-gown again. Hark—ha, ha,
                     ha,—well I do declare, just hear them happy young things! Oh, Mr. Horace, look
                     out there, and study them beautiful works of God, and let your old books writ
                     by men's hands alone. Bless their hearts—well, well, I must go down, or that
                     careless Bridget will send in the broiled chickens wrong side up. Now do pray
                     put on your coat like a Christian, and brush your hair—so,
                     there!"—and suiting the action to the word, by pushing her own gray
                     locks on one side, the good lady hastily patted down stairs.
                  When Horace entered the breakfast parlor, they were all assembled around the
                     table, and all busily discussing their plans for the day's amusement.
                  A seat had been reserved for him between his father and Meggie, and with a
                     cheerful smile, his hair brushed so, after Mrs. Dimity's model,
                     Horace advanced to the breakfast table. His morning salutation was returned
                     with the most bland politeness by each smiling girl, and the conversation his
                     presence had but slightly interrupted, resumed.
                  "Uncle, I am of Kate's mind," said Constance. "A sail on the lake this lovely
                     morning will be perfectly enchanting. I will take my sketch-book, for I know
                     there must be some charming scenes for the pencil."
                  "Do you propose a sail this morning?" asked Horace.
                  "We have thought of it," replied Constance, with a slight bend of her queenly
                     head.
                  "Now is it a very romantic spot, uncle?" said Kate with an arch face; "is it a
                     sweet place for lovers? Are there any melancholy willows sweeping the
                     translucent surface with their graceful branches?"
                  "Plenty of them, you jade, and plenty of golden pickerel erel and fine speckled trout, which is more to
                     my fancy," answered Mr. Mansfield.
                  "And mine too," cried Gabriella; "so while Con' draws from nature for the
                     entertainment of the imagination, I will draw those same fish from the bosom of
                     the lake for the better entertainment of our appetites!"
                  "At what hour do we go?" asked Bessie; "for my part, I am impatient to be
                     off!"
                  "About nine, I think," replied her uncle. "We will row to the opposite shore,
                     ramble about awhile, lunch, and be back in time for dinner. Put up some
                     gimcracks, Mrs. Dimity, for the girls, and something a little more substantial
                     for me."
                  "Excuse me, father," interrupted Horace, "if I suggest the afternoon as the
                     best time for the sail; the shadows which then rest upon the lake and the woody
                     slope beyond are most beautiful, and will present more attraction for my
                     cousin's pencil than the hour you propose."
                  "Why, the girls prefer the morning, you see, Horace, and it makes not a jot's
                     difference to me," answered Mr. Mansfield.
                  "Nor to me certainly," continued Horace; "any hour you prefer, fair
                     ladies."
                  "O, of course, it can make no difference to you!" said Gabriella twirling her
                     spoon.
                  "Not in the least," chimed in Kate; "for you will most probably be wandering
                     amid the Pyramids, or searching out the source of the Nile, or gliding down the
                     yellow Tiber, while we 'float merrily, merrily, merrily float o'er the waters
                     blue' of this beautiful lake uncle tells of!"
                  "But, my dear cousin, I have no idea of such extensive sive wanderings as you
                     propose for me," replied Horace smiling, "for I intend to devote the morning to
                     your society."
                  "Oh, no—no—no!" chimed in every voice; "indeed you must not think of it!"
                  "Have you so soon forgotten our conversation of last evening?" asked Constance
                     reproachfully.
                  "I assure you it will indeed be a happiness, a relief, a—"
                  "No—not a word, not a word; now really we will all take the stage tomorrow
                     morning and leave the Hall and our dear uncle, if you still insist upon
                     regarding us in the light of strangers!" exclaimed Kate with the greatest
                     earnestness.
                  "You mistake me entirely, I assure you—"
                  "No—no—no, we will not hear of it!"
                  Again Horace looked to his father for help in this perplexing dilemma, but the
                     nose and chin of the old gentleman were buried in his coffee cup, his head
                     thrown back, and his eyes most pertinaciously fixed upon the ceiling.
                  Up sprang the lively girls. "Come, away for our bonnets, come!" cried
                     Gabriella.
                  "Dear cousin Horace," whispered little Meggie, coming close to him, "do go with
                     us, now won't you? Do!"
                  "Meggie, Meggie!" said Kate, putting her head in at the door, "come this
                     moment, and don't be teasing in this manner; really you should have been left
                     at home!"
                  "Clever girls, Horace, and make themselves at home just as I want to have
                     them," exclaimed Mr. Mansfield. "Now some silly conceited things would have
                     taken airs upon themselves, and not been contented with an old fellow like me
                     to beau them about, when such a nice
                     young man as you were to be had; no—no—these girls understand themselves; don't
                     you enjoy it, eh?"
                  "Perhaps, father, it will be more polite in me to make one of your party this
                     morning?"
                  "Pooh, nonsense! don't trouble yourself; you know what Constance told you."
                  "True, but that was fastidiousness. I am sure you would prefer my going."
                  "Not at all. I am convinced at last that society is really irksome to you, and
                     now, my dear boy, I am going to let you do as you please. I have plagued your
                     life out for half a dozen years, urging you to marriage and all that sort of
                     thing, but henceforth, you are free to enjoy your silent friends up stairs to
                     your heart's content."
                  "Come, uncle, we are ready. Good-bye to you, cousin, and a pleasant time!" said
                     Kate, with a mischievous glance at Horace, who stood biting his lips with
                     ill-con-cealed vexation.
                  It was very ungrateful, doubtless, in Horace not to feel himself perfectly free
                     and comfortable, when his cousins had taken so much pains to make him so; but
                     somehow, he never found himself so ill at ease, and instead of going up into
                     his study and sitting down to his books, as he undoubtedly should have done, he
                     strolled forth into the garden, and from thence into the little grove beyond.
                     But go where he would, he could not get rid of his tormenting thoughts; or, if
                     for a moment they turned into their wonted channel, his eyes were sure to rest
                     upon some dainty footprint in the moist gravel, and whew, they
                     were off again in a tangent!
                  Poor fellow! it was no place for him where such witching spells were cast on
                     every side; and so he once more sought his study, where surely no such
                     fantastic visions could gain an entrance. Ah, it was quite a relief to him to
                     repose himself once more within its quiet limits; and turning over the pages of
                     Euclid, he endeavored to fix his attention once more upon his favorite pursuit.
                     And to prove the practicability of a course which may seem so
                     impracticable, his progress shall be faithfully reported.
                  "How perfectly absurd it is for those girls to act as they do!" he exclaimed,
                     rapidly whirling over the leaves. "Ah here it is—let me see,—let AGKQ be two
                     similar—there is something uncommonly interesting about
                     Gabriella—parallelopipeds, of which AB and—what superb eyes Kate has—and,
                     and—let me see—KL are two homologous sides—the wife of Cæsar could not have
                     been more haughty than the proud Constance—the ratio of—of—and what a queenly
                     step—ratio of—where was I?—AG, no—A—no—confound Euclid—away with it!"
               
               
                  CHAPTER V.
                  "HOW far did you say it was to the Glen?" asked Gabriella, as they rose from
                     the dinner table.
                  "Only three miles," replied her uncle. "I will order out the old carriage, and
                     we'll be there just time enough for a pleasant stroll among the rocks and the
                     babbling brooks, as Kate would say, and drive home round by the borders of the
                     lake by moonlight—there will be romance for you!"
                  "It will be charming!" cried Kate; "dear, what a nice uncle you are!" and clapping her two little
                     hands upon his cheeks she gave the old gentleman a hearty kiss.
                  "Did you find a subject worthy of your pencil this morning?" asked Horace,
                     bowing to Constance.
                  "I sketched one or two pretty views," she replied, turning away.
                  "Will you allow me to look at them?" said Horace, laying his hand on the
                     portfolio she had carelessly thrown down.
                  "They are not worthy your notice, but such as they are, you are welcome to
                     inspect them," answered Constance coldly, drawing forth one or two landscapes,
                     and placing them in his hand.
                  Horace started with surprise and pleasure as his eye rested upon those
                     beautiful and vivid representations of the scenery with which he had been
                     familiar from childhood. They were the work of no unskillful hand,—taste,
                     genius, culture, were indicated in every line, and he was about to express his
                     pleasure, when Meggie, running in from the piazza, cried—
                  "You are going with us to the Glen, are you not cousin? Say yes, do!"
                  "Well, yes," replied Horace, drawing her to his side and kissing
                     her; "certainly I will go with you, and I will gather you some beautiful wild
                     flowers which grow high up among the rocks."
                  "Cousin Horace, you will spoil that child by allowing her to tease you in this
                     manner. Meggie, be still! I am astonished at you, for you know very well the
                     impropriety of your request," said Constance.
                  "Why so, my fair cousin?" replied Horace. "Her request is certainly a very
                     flattering one to me, and with your leave I will avail myself of it to join
                     your party to the Glen."
                  Constance hesitated, when Gabriella, with a half-pouting air, exclaimed—
                  "Indeed, I see you are already wishing us away from the Hall, Mr. Mansfield,
                     for you continue to insist upon that which you know would mar our
                     enjoyment as much as it would yours—is it not so,
                     Constance,—girls, is it not so?—There, you hear they all agree with me; and
                     now, unless you really wish us gone, never, never say another word about going
                     with us any where. Come, girls, that we may not detain our cousin
                     any longer, suppose we adjourn to the parlor, and have a little music."
                  And gaily nodding a good-bye, each fair lady glided past the more than
                     half-angry student, leaving him alone to "chew the cud of sweet and bitter
                     fancies."
                  "This is ridiculous!" he exclaimed aloud; "however, your wishes shall be
                     gratified. I will no further trouble you with my importunities, fair ladies!"
                     So saying, he turned upon his heel and strode with a lofty air through the long
                     hall, unconscious of several pairs of wicked laughing eyes peeping at him
                     through the half-open door of the parlor.
                  Suddenly a strain of delicious music breathed around. He paused. The very air
                     seemed trembling with melody, as a rich voice, modulated to the sweetest
                     intonations, warbled rather than sang, like a skylark on its upward flight, one
                     of Beethoven's most exquisite melodies. Horace had no power to move; he stood
                     as if spellbound.— 
                        
                           "Right hard it was for wight which did it hear,
                           To weet what manner music that might be,
                           For all that pleasing is to living ear,
                           Was there consorted in one harmonie."
                        
                     
                      Then the strain melted away "like the
                     sweet south that breathes upon a bank of violets." Another moment the keys were
                     swept with a rapid hand to a lively prelude, and a gay Venetian barcarole was
                     sung in the same sweet accents, to which one or two other birdlike voices
                     warbled a merry chorus.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VI.
                  A WEEK passed. Every day some party of pleasure was arranged by uncle and
                     nieces without the least reference to Horace, who, true to his word, kept
                     himself aloof from the society of his cousins.
                  There were sailing parties, and rides, and rambles among the hills, by day,
                     while at evening, delicious music charmed the ear of the student as it swept up
                     to his desolate nook—or the sprightly measure of waltz or cotillon told of the
                     gay scene going on below, in which he was forbidden, as it were, to join.
                  Not that he wanted to—oh no, not he—for he was never more bent upon study! Poor
                     fellow! how he would pace the floor, book in hand, striving to fix his thoughts
                     upon its pages—how for hours would he sit with head inclined, poring over all
                     sorts of odd figures, some of them the queerest things, for all the world like
                     the tiniest fairies—but then that must have been all fancy, as of course no
                     such. "airy nothings" could find "habitation" here. Then such a chattering, and
                     laughing, and constant tripping up and down stairs, and through the long
                     winding passages, and away out upon the lawn, and under the grave old trees;
                     why it was as if a whole flock of wild geese were for ever circling about the
                     premises, and it was terribly annoying! To make matters worse, he was
                     continually haunted by one particular pair of dark melting eyes following him
                     wherever he moved—and one particular voice, whose gentlest intonation set his
                     heart in a perfect furor,—leaping, trembling, fluttering,
                     bounding, longing to escape from its prison, and fly all enraptured to bask in
                     the light of those beautiful eyes—the eyes of the queenly Constance.
                  One day little Meggie tapped at his door, and putting her pretty face timidly
                     within, asked if she might enter and sit awhile with Cousin Horace. Dear little
                     soul, her presence was like a sunbeam to the moody scholar; he kissed her rosy
                     cheek, and drew a chair for her close beside his own, listened delighted to her
                     childish prattle, and brought forth all his store of pictures for her
                     entertainment. The morning passed pleasantly to both, and from that day the
                     little maid seemed to prefer the society of the grave Horace to joining in the
                     rambles of her sisters and cousins. They soon grew very cosy together, Meggie
                     chatting continually, and whenever she made her sister Constance the theme, it
                     was wonderful how patiently the student laid down his book and listened,
                     without once chiding the little chatterbox. When Meggie was absent he devoted
                     the most of his time to writing, scribbling, and then tearing up whole sheets
                     of closely written blank verse or rhyme, and then beginning again, and again
                     destroying. He might have been writing a poem of almost endless cantos, but as
                     he always carefully locked within a little escritoire the labors of his pen,
                     the fact remains undecided to this day.
                  But one morning a mischievous zephyr flew in at the window and stole a stray leaf of the student's
                     poetry, and wafted it to the feet of little Meggie. She slyly seized it and saw
                     that it was addressed to her sister Constance. Children are such matter-of-fact
                     creatures! she saw no poetry at all in the matter, only as the
                     paper was addressed to Constance, why of course it must belong to Constance, so
                     she said never, a word, but slyly hiding it in her bosom, took occasion to trip
                     out of the room unobserved by Horace.
                  But it was not long ere the poet missed the precious document. In vain he
                     sought among his papers, turned over sheet after sheet, rummaged his books,
                     under the table, upon the shelves,—in vain, nowhere could he find it.
                  Now, if by chance he had about that time visited the little summer-house at the
                     foot of the garden, he would have discovered that very paper in the fair hand
                     of Constance herself, who, with glowing cheek, was intently perusing its
                     hurried characters. Again and again she read it, and then pressing it to her
                     lips, and to her beautiful eyes, all humid with tears, she placed it in her
                     bosom.
                  Not many days after this, Mr. Mansfield and his nieces in a joyous mood met in
                     the little grove.
                  "Come, girls," exclaimed the old gentleman, "I think our business is
                     accomplished, and now we may give the reins with a little more freedom; yes,
                     yes, I've watched him, and I'll lay you a wager the poor fellow is as
                     completely sick of his books as one could wish. Why he is actually pining away
                     into a very shadow for the pleasure of your society, you mocking little
                     gipsies!—And now what say you, shall we withdraw our liege commands,—shall we,
                     Constance?"
                  A crimson blush mantled her features. It was surely a very simple question, but
                     one which seemed very difficult to answer. At length she replied—
                  "If you really think it would give our cousin Horace pleasure, uncle."
                  "If it would—you know it would, minx! Ah, I've seen it; you know he follows you
                     with his eyes wherever you move; and don't he listen as if under some siren's
                     spell whenever you open your lips,—don't he, hey?—ah? no wonder
                     you blush!"
                  "Yes, and he writes verses, too, uncle!" exclaimed naughty little Meg.
                  "Hush, hush, child, nonsense!" said Constance quickly, endeavoring to check
                     her.
                  "Ah, Con' dear, and some other folks are given to nonsense too; let me see,"
                     and drawing from her reticule a small folded paper, Kate, with an arch glance
                     at her cousin, cleared her voice and began 
                        "Deem not the heart you—"
                     
                  
                  "Kate, Kate!" cried Constance springing up, every feature glowing with
                     indignation. Then snatching the paper from her hand, she tore it in pieces, and
                     bursting into tears fled from the group.
                  "Wh-e-w-w-w! what's all this, hey,—why what's the matter with my
                     grave Constance?" cried the old gentleman.
                  "O nothing, nothing, uncle, only that your grave Constance is in love with your
                     grave son, and our phlegmatic student fallen in love with Constance, that's
                     all!" replied Gabriella with a merry laugh.
                  "Ha, I thought so! Kiss me, you jades, every one of you, for I am the happiest
                     old fellow above ground," exclaimed Mr. Mansfield catching Kate in his
                     arms.
                  
                  But Meggie stooping down, slyly collected the fragments which Constance had so
                     indignantly scattered upon the fresh, bright grass, and hid them in her
                     bosom.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VII.
                  THE next morning almost at break of day, Mr. Mansfield, wrapped in his
                     dressing-gown, and his face swathed with a large red handkerchief, knocked at
                     the door of Horace's sleeping-room.
                  "Horace, it is very provoking, and I am sorry to disturb you, but I have a most
                     tormenting toothache—zounds, what a twinge!—and I promised the
                     girls last night that I would go with them this morning before breakfast to the
                     Glen; but this deuced tooth, ugh!—and I fear the poor things will
                     be sadly disappointed. Now, my boy, if you could leave your
                     studies just for an hour or so—ugh!—and take my place—"
                  "Certainly, my dear father," cried Horace, springing out of bed with great
                     alacrity.
                  "Constance, you see, has set her heart upon sketching something or other which
                     she thinks will be prettiest at sunrise; but it is a pity to disturb you!"
                  "Don't give yourself any uneasiness upon that head," said Horace, rapidly
                     throwing on his clothes. "I shall be very glad to be of service to my
                     cousins."
                  "Perhaps after all it will be better to postpone it until tomorrow, only it is
                     such a beautiful morning," said the old gentleman in a husky voice, and drawing
                     the handkerchief still closer around his mouth.
                  "O no, on no account should they be disappointed, and it is as you say, such a
                     beautiful morning!" exclaimed Horace with uncommon earnestness, drawing on his
                     boots.
                  "Very well, my son, very well—then I'll make myself easy and go to bed again,
                     only I hate to break in upon your studies just to humor the whims of those
                     giddy girls. Well, give my love to them, and do, Horace, try to be as agreeable
                     as you can, and not be thinking too much of your confounded
                        books—zounds, I shall go crazy!—Well, well, cold iron will
                     relieve me!"
                  So saying the old gentleman withdrew, but had no sooner closed the door, than
                     he threw off the handkerchief, and indulged in a hearty but silent laugh, while
                     at the same moment the roguish faces of Gabriella and Kate peeped from an
                     opposite chamber. Then placing a finger significantly on their lips, with a
                     knowing nod to their uncle, they stole softly down stairs, when, no longer able
                     to repress their glee, their musical laugh mingled with the morning song of the
                     birds.
                  "Ha! ha! ha! there they go! Caught at last, Mr. Philosopher!" exclaimed Mr.
                     Mansfield as he saw the party setting forth on their excursion. "Here, old
                     lady; look out there; what do you see?"
                  "Why bless me if that ain't Mr. Horace!"
                  "To be sure it's Mr. Horace: and now let me tell you, Mrs. Dimity, there will
                     be a Mistress Horace ere six months are come and gone. Now what do
                     you think of that?"
                  "Well, well, now if that ain't a sight, to see Mr. Horace a talking and
                     laughing with them pretty creatures! Dear me, dear me, I have lived most long
                     enough!" cried the good woman.
                  
                  "No you haven't—what do you tell that story for? I tell you, you have got to
                     dance at his wedding yet, you silly old woman!"
                  As Mr. Mansfield's toothache obstinately continued for several days, why of
                     course Horace was obliged to forsake his books entirely, and devote his time to
                     his cousins—a necessity which on the whole, seemed very agreeable all round;
                     and when at length the old gentleman thought it prudent to join the circle,
                     Horace still kept his place, probably from right of possession,
                        possibly from inclination.
                  Four weeks of this pleasant visit were already flown, and in one more, the
                     charming visitors were to bid farewell to Mansfield Hall and their kind old
                     uncle.
                  To Horace this announcement seemed as the parting knell to all his happiness.
                     He loved Constance, His soul was filled with her image. She was the idol before
                     whom all his thoughts bowed down, and for whose happiness life itself were too
                     slight a sacrifice. But he dared not tell her this; for in the lofty bearing of
                     Constance, in her reserve, and evident avoidance of his presence, he read not
                     only indifference, but scorn!
                  Ah, little skilled was he in the heart of woman!
                  It was the evening previous to the departure of the cousins. Dell and dingle
                     had been visited for the last time, the last sail upon the beautiful lake had
                     been taken, the last ramble to the favorite Glen; and now with saddened hearts
                     and countenances, the party once more assembled upon the little portico to talk
                     over past joys, and to anticipate joys as bright in future visits to the old
                     Hall.
                  Turning suddenly to Horace, who was slowly and thoughtfully pacing up and down,
                     Gabriella said,
                  "Now, Cousin Horace, just listen. Do you agree with Kate that love can make a
                     poet out of a dull, prosy scholar?"
                  "Why not, coz, since 'Love can transform an oyster?'" replied Horace
                     smiling.
                  "Ah! but answer me seriously now. Do you believe one of your prosaic scholars
                     could be suddenly transformed, through the power of Cupid, into a scribbler of
                     verses—a rhyming sentimentalist?"
                  Horace was embarrassed, while Constance drew up her beautiful head with an air
                     of disdain, as if the subject in debate were certainly a very foolish one, and
                     unworthy any one's attention.
                  "Why you know, dear Kate," said Horace, at length, "what the greatest poet the
                     world e'er saw has said— 
                        
                           'Never durst poet touch a pen to write,
                           
                              Until his ink be tempered with Love's sighs!'"
                        
                     
                  
                  "Ah, true; well listen then, for here is proof conclusive!" And drawing from
                     her bosom those very verses for which Horace had so often and so vainly sought,
                     and which lately reposed so near the heart of Constance, Gabriella commenced
                     reading them.
                  Imagine the consternation of the student; vainly he attempted to snatch them
                     from her hand; but springing upon one of the seats, the mischievous girl held
                     them above her head, while she continued to repeat them with the most affected
                     sentimentality.
                  Constance arose, and walked off with the step of a Juno.
                  Horace was provoked—he was really angry—mortified—and it was in no very gentle
                     accents that he let his displeasure be known.
                  "What must she think of me! Good heavens, how much she must despise me! Fool, fool that I have
                     been!" he exclaimed, as he strode rapidly back and forth the portico.
                  "Nay, dear cousin, never vex yourself about my proud sister Constance,"
                     whispered Meggie, stealing his hand and kissing it; "here is your revenge,"—and
                     as she spoke, she slipped into it the tell-tale fragments she had so carefully
                     gathered up.
                  It was yet light enough for Horace to recognize the writing of Constance, and
                     to see his own name traced in the same delicate chirography!
                  To the privacy of his own apartment did he hie with speed of thought, and there
                     patiently, no, rather impatiently, dispose and arrange every tiny fragment,
                     until he had deciphered enough to fill his soul with rapture. Leaning from the
                     window he courts the gentle evening breeze to fan his fevered brow, ere he
                     again trusts himself to join the group below. He hears the cheerful, happy
                     voices of his cousins, and the hearty good-humored laugh of his father—but afar
                     down the winding path of the shrubbery, he catches the gleam of a white dress,
                     slowly moving amid its deepest shades. Well did his heart tell him to whom that
                     fluttering robe belonged, and in another moment he had joined Constance in her
                     solitary ramble.
                  We will not intrude upon this interview, but content ourselves with the
                     knowledge, that in the bright month of September, just three months after this
                     moonlight ramble, a happy bridal party drove up to the door of the old Hall,
                     where stood the worthy housekeeper to welcome them, her eyes filling with tears
                     of joy as she pressed to her honest heart, the happy bridegroom and his
                     beautiful bride.
               
            
            
               GAITY.
               
                  CHAPTER I.
                  IT was already three o'clock, P.M., in the month of November, 1769, that a
                     party of four persons might be seen riding swiftly along the beach, opposite
                     the town of Stonington. The afternoon was cold and gloomy, the wind blowing
                     almost a gale; and the waves, as they 'rolled and broke with violence upon the
                     beach, seemed threatening, in every receding surge, to sweep off both horse and
                     rider. The persons mentioned consisted of three men and one female, the latter
                     evidently a prisoner. The elder of the party was a stout-built man, apparently
                     of some sixty years. His dress denoted him above the common peasantry; he wore
                     a cloak with scarlet facings, which, as the wind blew aside, it could be seen
                     that he was armed with sword and pistols. His countenance was stern, his brow
                     knit until the large eye-brows nearly met; and, as he now and then glanced upon
                     the female, he compressed his lips until the blood seemed ready to start. The
                     two others were much younger, and were appareled after the fashion common to
                     young men of that period, and, like the elder, they were also armed. The young
                     female, who rode between the two last-mentioned persons, could not, from her
                     appearance, be more than eighteen years of age. Her face was the hue of marble,
                     her eyes downcast, and her whole bearing evincing ing deep dejection. Her dress was a dark
                     riding-habit, fitting closely her slender figure, and a small beaver-hat and
                     plume.
                  The young men kept close to her side; indeed one held tightly her bridle rein,
                     while the elder personage rode on a few feet in advance.
                  Heedless of the wind and the dashings of the surf, the party galloped swiftly
                     along. For some time not a word was spoken, until turning a rocky point, where
                     all further progress seemed impossible, and with nothing to impede the view of
                     the raging sea; the young girl now, for the first time, raised her head, and,
                     in a voice of terror, demanded:
                  "Father, dear father, where are we going? Where will you take me?"
                  "That you will soon know," replied the person addressed; then, suddenly reining
                     in his horse, he said, speaking to the young men:
                  "Here I shall leave you. Remember, Walter; and you, too, Basil; act no woman's
                     part. As for you," turning as he spoke to the trembling girl, "take your
                     father's last words—his curse!"
                  "Father, father, curse me not!" she shrieked, springing from her horse, and
                     clasping the knees of the speaker: "curse not your child!"
                  "Off, serpent, off!" cried the old man, spurning her with his foot; "kneel not
                     to me—think of your poor, distracted mother—of the disgrace and wretchedness
                     you have brought to our once happy fire-side! Again I curse you—yes, may
                        the curse of an outraged father ever ring in your ears!"
                  The girl uttered a piercing scream, and sank senseless upon the sands. For a
                     few moments her father sternly regarded her prostrate form; gradually his
                     features relaxed, he became much agitated, and at length large tears rolled
                     down his cheeks.
                  "Oh, my God," he ejaculated, "is it come to this! My daughter, my child, my
                     child!"
                  Stooping down, he imprinted a kiss upon her marble brow; then, turning to his
                     sons, he said:
                  "Walter, Basil, hear me; forget my weakness; remember, this erring child must
                     not, shall not be forgiven! Yet treat her kindly; be not too rough
                     with her gentle nature. As for me, I shall never see her more!"
                  Thus saying, he turned his horse, and rode swiftly away, in the same direction
                     from which they came.
                  The two young men, in the meanwhile, appeared totally unmoved by the scene they
                     had just witnessed; and, notwithstanding their father's injunctions, were
                     striving, by no very gentle means, to restore consciousness to the unfortunate
                     girl.
                  "Pest, she will never come to, as I see," said the one addressed as Walter;
                     "one would think these drenching surges would bring her back."
                  "Perhaps it were better she should never revive," replied the other. "Minion!
                     but see, she opens her eyes. Come, madam, rouse yourself! No more swooning, if
                     you please! Come, get up," (seizing her rudely by the arm,) "we have something
                     of a journey yet to go to-night, which may not prove quite so pleasing to your
                     fancy as the one you undertook with your Indian lover."
                  The girl slowly arose; her face became the hue of scarlet, and, turning her dark hazel eye upon
                     the youth, she said:
                  "Basil, is it from you I hear those cruel words? Do you, too, cast
                     me off? Do you no longer love me?"
                  "Love you," replied Basil, with a look of bitter scorn,
                        "love you! No! I hate you!"
                  "Fie, Basil, for shame," interrupted Walter; "you are too bad. Remember, our
                     father told us to treat this wretched girl with kindness."
                  "Did he, did he!" cried the poor girl. "Bless you, Walter, for those words.
                     You, then, do not hate your poor sister?"
                  "No, Gaity, I do not hate you; yet still, for the disgrace you have brought
                     upon us, I could plunge this dagger into your bosom! But come, Basil; see, the
                     rain is already beginning to fall, and the Sound looks too rough for our
                     passage."
                  "The more fitting our errand," replied Basil. "Neither thunder, rain, or old
                     Ocean's self, though she chafe the very skies in her fury, shall stop me, until
                     this dainty lady is in security."
                  So saying, and lifting Gaity into the saddle, he seized her bridle-rein, and
                     the party once more galloped rapidly forward for about a quarter of a mile.
                     Here they halted, and dismounting, led their horses a few yards from the beach,
                     where they fastened them to some rude stakes of what had probably once been a
                     fisherman's hut. They next proceeded to unmoor a small boat, and then
                     approached Gaity, who, with pale and alarmed features, had watched their
                     movements.
                  "Where will you take me?" she cried, recoiling from their approach. "O, will
                     you drown me! Alas, I am not fit to die!"
                  "Drown you," interrupted Basil; "no, drowning would be too good for you! Come,
                     step in;" then rudely pushing her into the boat, where Walter was already
                     seated, they put off upon the angry waters.
                  The rain, which had been threatening some time, now poured in torrents, while
                     the winds and waves tossed the frail bark like an egg-shell; every sea, as it
                     came rushing and roaring down, seemed ready to engulf them. After two hours of
                     hard labor they reached the shore of Fisher's Island, and after some little
                     difficulty effected a landing. Securing the boat, they then each seized an arm
                     of their sister, who, speechless from terror, was passive in their hands; and,
                     turning from the shore, plunged directly into a narrow path which led into the
                     interior of the island; now lifting Gaity in their arms over tangled heaps of
                     underbrush, or pulling her swiftly forward over the level ground. In this
                     manner they proceeded for nearly an hour; at length they stopped. Here, on the
                     borders of a thick forest stood a solitary house; it was evidently much
                     decayed, part of the roof had fallen in, and most of the windows appeared to
                     have been newly boarded up. On one side it leaned to a deep chasm, washed below
                     by a swift-running stream, whose hollow murmur struck horror to the soul.
                  Leaving Walter and Gaity, Basil now approached the house, and, passing his hand
                     through one of the broken sashes, drew forth a rusty key, which he applied to
                     the door; it turned slowly on its hinges and the party entered. Nothing could
                     exceed the desolation within but the desolation without. The room was empty,
                     not a vestige of furniture to be seen,
                     while the rain beat in at the broken casement.
                  On one side was a flight of rickety stairs; up these the young men groped their
                     way, bearing the almost insensible form of Gaity in their arms. With the aid of
                     flint, Walter now struck a light. It seemed, indeed, as if Misery and Want
                     might here have chosen their abode, so utterly desolate, so wretched did every
                     thing appear.
                  Poor Gaity, pale with alarm, overcome with fatigue, and her garments drenched
                     with rain, had sunk into the only chair the room contained, the very image of
                     wo; when Basil approached, and, with a low bow, said, in a voice of biting
                     sarcasm:
                  "Welcome, mistress, to your future home."
                  Gaity raised her drooping head, looked from one to the other of her cruel
                     brothers; no ray of pity beamed on their dark features, and, with a shudder
                     which convulsed her whole frame, the miserable girl fell senseless to the
                     floor.
               
               
                  CHAPTER II.
                  BEFORE the wigwam had disappeared from the forest, or the bow of the savage
                     been unstrung, a few English families had made their settlement near the
                     borders of the Mystic river, Connecticut.
                  On this very spot had been enacted one of the most dreadful tragedies that ever
                     occurred in that fierce struggle with the Indians in the earlier settlement of
                     the country try—ours for might, theirs for
                        right! Here it was, in the darkness and silence of the night,
                     when the Indians were all sleeping in fancied security, that a party of English
                     soldiers, commanded by Captain Mason, stole suddenly upon the Pequot fort,
                     bringing death and destruction in their van. No warning had the doomed savage,
                     save the dying howl of a faithful watch-dog, while, at the same moment, a heavy
                     fire was poured in upon them. Then the cry of Owanux! Owanux!
                     (Englishmen! Englishmen!) mingled with the terrific war-whoop, resounded
                     through the fort; but it was too late! On every side they were surrounded,
                     escape was impossible, and, horrible to relate, the order was at length given
                     by the English to fire the fort, and hundreds of men,
                     women and children perished in their wigwams!
                  "And, indeed," says the historian, "such a dreadful terror did the Almighty let
                     fall upon their spirits, that they would fly from us into the very flames."
                  But, at the period this tale commences, not a trace of this cruel war remained.
                     Small villages and clustering cottages skirted the banks of this pretty stream,
                     and finely-cultivated farms stretched far in the distance. Now and then a few
                     solitary remnants of the Pequot tribe would wander through the soil of their
                     fathers; for it was then no rare thing to see these sons of the forest, who
                     were generally treated with kindness by the whites, although that feeling of
                     hostility and revenge, which had burned so furiously in the breasts of both,
                     was not at that early period quite subdued, and occasional disputes, together
                     with many petty acts of pilfering committed by the Indians, when under the
                     influence of "fire water," (for which, as is well known, their
                     thirst was insatiable satiable,) only
                     served to keep alive the flame of discord.
                  Basil Trevor was from a noble family of England, but being a younger son, was
                     consequently dependent upon the church, army or navy for his support.
                     Preferring, however, to seek a fortune in the new world to either, he bade
                     farewell to friends and country, and embarked for America; bringing with him
                     all that pride of birth, and high and lofty bearing which marked his descent.
                     Disappointed love might, perhaps, have somewhat influenced his decision, as it
                     is well known his final determination to seek a foreign land was not made until
                     the Lady Edith had been forced into a marriage with a wealthy baronet.
                  To America, then, came Basil Trevor at the age of three-and-twenty. He landed
                     at Boston, where, after tarrying a few weeks in company with others who, like
                     himself, had left the shores of England to find a home in America, he proceeded
                     to the fertile region of the Connecticut. Pursuing his researches, he reached
                     the neighborhood of the Mystic, and delighted with its romantic scenery, and
                     the promising aspect of the soil, obtained a large tract of land on its
                     borders. Here, shut out from the world, careless for fortune, Trevor resolved
                     to seek for happiness amid the scenes of nature.
                  Under his persevering industry and energies, the "wilderness soon
                        blossomed as the rose." Fields of corn, of waving wheat, rich
                     clover-pastures, now flourished where once the great Sassacus stepped in his
                     pride and might; and, in due time, a neat cottage took the place of the rude
                     log-hut which first sheltered the young adventurer.
                  As if on purpose to requite his unwearied industry, the obliging baronet broke
                     his neck at a race-course, and Edith became a widow! This news was transmitted
                     by some kind friend in the first ship, and, in less than a week after it was
                     received, behold Basil Trevor a passenger in a vessel bound for London! He
                     arrived safely in England, and hastened, with the speed of thought,
                        imbodied in four post-horses, to the baronial
                     castle of his dead rival—a scream of delight, and Edith is fainting in his
                     arms! The marriage ceremony was performed without delay, and the lovely bride
                     accompanied her husband to his new home.
                  But, alas! her tender nature was not suited to the hardships, the privations of
                     this new life. Reared in the abodes of luxury, with every indulgence which
                     wealth could give, lavished upon her, she could illy meet the trials she was
                     now called upon to sustain. Fortitude, affection, or kindness forsook not the
                     pure temple of her heart—but her health yielded. She pined gradually away; her
                     foot lost its lightness, her form became almost ethereal; and, although the
                     dark eye sparkled and the rose tinted her cheek, after a few years she sank to
                     rest with the summer flowers, leaving one sweet bud to shield, in its balmy
                     beauty, the heart of the lone husband against despair.
                  Bitter, indeed, was the grief of Trevor at this sad bereavement; and yet, in
                     one year after the death of Edith, he become the husband of another. Deem him
                     not heartless, inconstant, or ungrateful; so soon to yield another the place where once the lovely Edith rested in
                     her gentleness and beauty!
                  The rough nature of man was not suited to the nurture of so fragile a plant as
                     the little Edith. The gentle hand of woman was required to cherish and defend
                     the frail blossom from the many ills of childhood. No kind mother or
                     sympathizing sister had the bereaved husband to take the babe to their bosoms,
                     and, therefore it was, he offered his hand to the daughter of one who had
                     emigrated from the mother country about the same time as himself.
                  A kind and gentle being was Gaity, and in her the sweet babe found indeed a
                     mother; and, although as years rolled on, other and closer ties were woven
                     around the heart of Mrs. Trevor, she never for a moment loved the little Edith
                     less fondly, or suffered those new ties to weaken that chain of sympathy which
                     bound her to the motherless child.
                  A blooming family grew up around Mrs. Trevor, of which the little bright-eyed
                     Gaity was the youngest and cherished favorite. Her slightest wishes were to her
                     fond parents as laws, while her two brothers and Edith were never wearied of
                     devising amusements for this dazzling pet. Although as beautiful as the first
                     blush of morn, Gaity was a wayward and stubborn child, to which, undoubtedly,
                     the extreme indulgence of those around her was only adding new vigor. She was,
                     however, kind and affectionate in her nature, to which feelings she yielded
                     with all the impetuosity of a spoiled child; no matter by what excited, a bird
                     a flower, a pet lamb or kitten, all in turn called forth her devotion. Dearly,
                     too, did she love her sister Edith, whose winning manners, and kind, persuasive
                     words often possessed an influence over the willful child, which naught else
                     could effect.
                  As before mentioned, the Indians were then no strangers to the soil. Often
                     parties of from fifty to a hundred would encamp in the adjacent woods, and
                     there tarry sometimes for months; their baskets, brooms, moccasins, and other
                     articles of traffic, finding a ready sale in the houses of the whites.
                  Unlike most children of her age, Gaity fearlessly attached herself to these
                     dwellers of the forest, who, in return, manifested, by their uncouth gestures
                     of delight, and many little presents of ingenious fabric, their fondness for
                     the little white maiden, or, as they usually styled her, "the little
                        Sloe-blossom." Springing like a fawn to the arms of the savage,
                     Gaity would cling fondly to them; sometimes passing whole days amid their
                     wigwams, in unrestrained freedom, playing with the little papoose, weaving
                     rushes with her small taper fingers, or learning to adorn the smooth bark with
                     the quills of the porcupine.
                  This wandering tribe were generally accompanied by a venerable Indian, claiming
                     to be the son of the great Sassacus himself. Whether this assertion might be
                     considered as truth is uncertain; but there was a quiet dignity in the manners
                     and bearing of the old chief, which might well warrant the assumption. He mixed
                     but little with his tribe, his wigwam was remote from theirs, and his time
                     generally occupied in hunting the game, which, even at that early period, was
                     beginning to be considered a rarity; or in his birch canoe, accompanied by his
                     grandson, Onowahoo, a lad of twelve, would softly glide where the umbrageous
                     woods over-canopied the river, and
                     there, with a composure which "old lzaak" might have envied, ensnare the
                     silvery trout which frequented its waters. The results of these labors or
                     pleasures often found their way to the table of Mr. Trevor, being usually left
                     after nightfall upon the door-stone, in the most quiet manner, by Monatahqua
                     himself, who took this method to manifest his gratitude for various kindnesses
                     received at the hands of Mr. Trevor.
                  Between Gaity and the young savage Onowahoo there had always existed the
                     warmest friendship. He brought her the most beautiful bird's-eggs, the greenest
                     moss, the clearest pebbles, to adorn her little play-house; and would spend
                     hours in weaving baskets and other ingenious articles to give her pleasure,
                     while, in return, Gaity shared with him her nicest treasures, and, with her own
                     little hands, knit gay comforters and leggins, to keep him warm through the
                     cold winter.
                  Twice had Onowahoo saved the life of Gaity.
                  There was within a few miles of Poplar Grove, (the residence of Mr. Trevor,) an
                     extensive pond, which, at certain seasons of the year, resembled a floating
                     garden, so thickly was it covered with that fragrant and lovely flower, the
                     pond-lily, resting in snowy purity so beautifully in its light green shallop on
                     the glassy surface of the pond, peeping over, too, half-bashfully, as if to see
                     itself mirrored therein in graceful beauty. Gaity had coaxed her father, by
                     many well-timed hugs and kisses, (which the little gipsy knew very well when to
                     apply,) into permission that she might accompany Monatahqua and Onowahoo upon
                     an excursion to this beautiful pond. They accordingly set off through the
                     forest, Gaity hand in hand with Onowahoo, laughing, chatting, and singing ing
                     her little songs, half-English, half Indian. When the little "Sloe-blossom"
                     seemed weary, Monatahqua would bear her in his arms over the rough places; and
                     the Indian boy, running at her side, pluck the ripest berries to allay her
                     thirst, and occasionally the happy party would rest together under some shady
                     tree. In this manner they reached the pond; here they found a canoe, secured at
                     the water's edge, in which they were soon seated, gliding gently to that part
                     where the lilies seemed in the greatest profusion. As they approached it, Gaity
                     clapped her hands in ecstasy, and exclaiming:
                  "Some for ma'ma—some for Edith," reached over too hastily to pluck them; she
                     lost her balance, and sank amid the lilies; which first yielding gently to
                     their lovely burthen, then formed a fragrant pall above her. Another moment,
                     and she was safe in the arms of Monatahqua; the next, a shower of lilies fell
                     around her from the hand of Onowahoo, who had again plunged in to divert the
                     terror of the trembling child.
                  At another time, when Gaity had been as usual rambling for hours in the forest,
                     she became weary, and, throwing herself under a tree, lay for some time tracing
                     pictures in the light fleecy clouds as they floated above, and in trying to
                     count the green leaves frolicking and dancing to the soft wind around her head.
                     On a neighboring tree a golden oriole had perched himself, swinging, with the
                     most enviable security, upon the very extremity of a large bough, pouring forth
                     his rich notes in one delicious gush of melody; these, too, did the little
                     maiden try to imitate; but at length the clouds floated dreamily away, the
                     leaves moved to a more gentle measure, and the song of the oriole grew ever fainter and
                     fainter. The child slept.
                  It being near noon, Mr. Trevor himself went in search of his truant child. He
                     soon discovered her, and advanced gently to awaken her; but, conceive his
                     horror, on approaching nearer, to discover a large rattlesnake coiled within a
                     few feet of the sleeping innocent! He dares not advance—he fears to move, least
                     he may arouse the reptile—his very senses seem to be forsaking him, from terror
                     at the danger of his child; when, suddenly, he sees Onowahoo approach. The boy
                     drops noiselessly amid the deep grass, and glides to the spot where poor Gaity,
                     unconscious of danger, is so calmly sleeping. Already, with head erect and eyes
                     glittering in Iris hues of beauty, the snake seems about to dart upon its
                     victim, when at that instant, with a rapid bound, Onowahoo seizes the venomous
                     reptile by the neck; it coils its length in slimy folds around the naked arm of
                     the brave boy, who, nothing daunted, compresses the throat of his victim ever
                     tighter and tighter until death ensues!
                  It is not strange, then, that Mr. and Mrs. Trevor were much attached to the
                     preserver of their darling child. Earnestly did they entreat Monatahqua to
                     leave Onowahoo with them; promising that he should be treated as a child, and
                     receive the same education as their sons. But Monatahqua pointed to the
                     woods:
                  "'There is room for the red man there," he said; "the cabin of the pale face
                     would fetter the limbs of the Indian. The foot of Onowahoo must be fleet as the
                     deer of the forest."
                  A period of six or eight months had elapsed since the last visit of the old
                     chief, when, one morning, he suddenly ly entered the sitting-room of Mr.
                     Trevor, leading Onowahoo by the hand. He was attired in much splendor; a bright
                     scarlet blanket, adorned with wampum, was thrown over his shoulders; his
                     leggins were of many-colored cloth, and fancifully embroidered; and his brows
                     were decorated with a variety of variegated feathers.
                  With a cry of delight, Gaity sprang to his side, and then, flinging her arms
                     around the neck of Onowahoo, pressed his dark cheek with her rosy lips. With a
                     low, guttural laugh, Monatahqua passed his hand over the golden locks of Gaity,
                     and then advancing to Mr. Trevor, he said:
                  "Chief, Monatahqua goes to the spirit-land; his Great Father calls him. The
                     ears of Monatahqua are open; he will go, for now the war path is hidden under
                     the thick smoke of the calumet! Take, then, my son, that I may depart in
                     peace."
                  Without waiting for a reply, the old chief then turned and walked with dignity
                     from the room; leaving Onowahoo standing motionless as a statue, with Gaity
                     still clinging around him.
                  It was the last visit of Monatahqua. He was never seen more.
               
               
                  CHAPTER III.
                  THE young Indian lad received a joyful welcome from each member of Mr. Trevor's
                     household, and was uniformly treated with kindness by all, save the two boys,
                     Walter and Basil; who were, perhaps, envious of the superior strength and agility displayed by the
                     Indian, especially in all games pertaining to forest life. Onowahoo, however,
                     was ever taciturn and reserved, seldom departing from the characteristic
                     gravity of his race, and never mixing in the sports of boyhood, except to
                     please the whims of the little wayward Gaity. The habits of his fathers clung
                     closely to him; and, notwithstanding the instructions and earnest persuasions
                     of his present friends, "the Indian was an Indian still."
                  In the meanwhile the days of childhood flitted away, now gay, now tearful; as
                     the lark soars to heaven, its wings gemmed with the dews of morning, or as
                     rose-leaves scattered by rain; and Gaity, now no longer a child, was forced to
                     "put off childish things."
                  Edith had already been sent to Boston, to receive those advantages of education
                     which could not be obtained at the Grove; and the time had now arrived when it
                     was deemed advisable by her parents that Gaity also should go from home for the
                     same purpose.
                  Farewell, then, to frolic and mirth! Poor Gaity! with bursting heart, streaming
                     eyes and pouting lip, was obliged to clip down her buoyant spirits to the
                     narrow confines of a school-room.
                  From this time, for a period of two or three years, the sisters only revisited
                     their home at intervals of six or eight months. Gaity retained all her wild
                     impetuosity of character; and no bird, released from its wiry prison, ever
                     winged its way with more gladness to its native woods than did Gaity upon these
                     occasions fly back to the well-remembered haunts of childhood. Every nook and
                     dell again felt the pressure of her light footstep; the meadow-brook again
                     mirrored the bright, happy face of the maiden, and once more the woods
                     resounded with her merry, ringing laugh.
                  Upon these occasions Gaity was seldom unaccompanied by Onowahoo; for her
                     brothers, Walter and Basil, felt no sympathy in the feelings of the young girl,
                     scorning those scenes in which the heart of their sister took such delight;
                     while, at the same time, they taunted and ridiculed her fondness for forest
                     life, styling her the "Indian Princess of the Grove!" Edith although justly
                     alive to the beauties of nature, found full occupation in assisting her mother
                     in the household duties. Thus Gaity and Onowahoo were thrown much together.
                  High beat the heart of the young Indian at those traits in Gaity's character,
                     so similar to his own wild nature. He watched her graceful form, bounding like
                     a fawn through the forest glades, and her speaking, animated countenance with
                     delight. Nor is it to be wondered at that Gaity found a pleasure in his
                     society, which, unknown to her innocent heart, constituted more than half the
                     charm of her daily rambles.
                  Edith was the first to perceive the unhappy results of this constant
                     companionship and affinity of tastes. She was inexpressibly shocked at the
                     discovery, and gently warned Gaity against indulging or encouraging feelings so
                     inimical to the happiness of both.
                  Crimsoned with blushes, Gaity, with a wild laugh, kissed the pale cheek of her
                     sister, assuring her she need be under no uneasiness, and then added with a
                     haughty tone and sparkling eye, that if she did love Onowahoo, she
                     would rather have a lodge in the wilderness with him than to reign
                     queen of England's realm.
                  But this conversation with Edith removed at once the vail which had wrapped her heart in such
                     blissful security, and with true feminine modesty, she now absented herself
                     almost entirely from the society of Onowahoo.
                  This sudden change of conduct was to him as a death-blow; for he at once
                     divined that she had discovered his daring love, and now avoided him from anger
                     at his presumption. He hoped to have buried forever his fatal attachment in his
                     own breast, and thus been able to enjoy, from day to day, the melancholy
                     happiness of beholding the object of his hopeless love; for never, even in his
                     wildest dreams, had he for a moment indulged the thought that the fair daughter
                     of the proudest in the land, the beautiful child of his benefactor, could love
                     the lone Indian, or feel other than pity for his degraded race! Fearing now he
                     had drawn upon himself her indignation and contempt, he resolved to depart
                     silently from the Grove, never to return.
                  It was but a few days after the painful discovery of the true state of her
                     feelings, that Gaity, pale and dejected, stole out alone into the forest. She
                     had not gone far, when, through an opening in the trees, she perceived Onowahoo
                     approaching. His step was heavy, his eyes downcast, and his whole manner
                     plainly denoting the wretchedness of his mind. He advanced slowly to within a
                     few paces of Gaity, when, suddenly raising his head, he saw the object of his
                     thoughts standing before him. He would have turned, but Gaity advanced a step
                     to meet him, and, in a voice of kindness, said:
                  "Why is the countenance of my brother so sad?"
                  Onowahoo for a moment gazed mournfully upon her, then, pointing upward, he
                     replied:
                  "As yonder cloud, now floating in the heavens, will soon fade and vanish away,
                     so must Onowahoo depart from the presence of the Sloe-blossom."
                  In a low, trembling voice, Gaity answered:
                  "Would Onowahoo leave the Sloe-blossom to droop alone in the forest? Where
                     would her brother go that Gaity might not follow?"
                  A gleam of delight sparkled for an instant from the eyes of the Indian; he then
                     rejoined:
                  "Onowahoo goes beyond the homes of the pale-face, that when his great Father
                     calls him, he may go to the happy hunting-grounds with his red brothers."
                  "What bird has sung in the ears of Onowahoo?*
                      Is the hand of my father closed? Has the tongue of my mother spoken
                     false, or the Sloe-blossom turned away from her brother, that he leaves
                     her?"
                  
                     
                     *It is said the Indians called tale-bearers, or those who
                        spoke falsely, "singing birds."
                  
                  Onowahoo shaded his eyes with his hand, and answered, with a low
                     and mournful tone:
                  "Onowahoo must no longer look upon the Sloe-blossom."
                  In a moment Gaity now comprehended the motives of the Indian. She made no
                     reply, while Onowahoo turned sadly to leave her; then, with a quiet dignity,
                     foreign to her usual manner, and determination speaking in every feature, Gaity
                     held out her hand, saying, in a voice of firmness:
                  "No, Onowahoo must not go alone! See, the Sloe-blossom puts
                        her hand in his!"
                  The happiness of these unfortunate lovers was a dream too sweet to last; and
                     bitter, indeed, were the scenes to which they finally awoke.
                  
                  Edith saw with grief her worst fears realized. Vainly did she warn her sister
                     against the wrath of her father and brothers, should they discover her
                     attachment for Onowahoo. Him she urged to fly immediately from the Grove, to
                     leave Gaity forever, and thus save her from the terrible indignation which she
                     knew would await her; but, notwithstanding all her cautions, all her
                     entreaties, the lovers willfully shut their eyes to the danger they were hourly
                     incurring, and, in one unguarded moment, all was discovered.
                  Gaity attempted no concealment of her feelings; but, with firmness and
                     decision, at once openly acknowledged her love for the Indian.
                  No words can paint the wrath of Mr. Trevor, as he listened to this avowal. It
                     seemed as if that deep affection which had ever been, as it were, the
                     well-spring of his existence, was at once suddenly and for ever dried up,
                     choked, obliterated! The wretched mother and Edith wept in agony, while Walter
                     and Basil, with fury flashing from their eyes, deeply reviled and insulted
                     their sister, who, with cheeks flushed with indignation, her form raised to its
                     full height, stood proudly in the midst, making no reply to their insulting
                     language, except by looks of the most perfect defiance. At length, seizing her
                     by the arm, her father dragged her to her chamber, thrust her rudely within,
                     and locked the door.
                  They went in search of Onowahoo.
                  "Dog! Indian! Slave! Away with you!" cried Mr. Trevor, "Away! If, at the
                     setting of the sun, you are found within the limits of my land, your scalp,
                        according to your own fashion, shall hang from the nearest
                     tree!"
                  Onowahoo was about to reply, when Basil suddenly approached, and, raising his
                     arm gave the Indian a blow across the face. The next instant he was prostrate
                     on the ground, the knee of the savage on his breast, and the knife already
                     gleaming before his eyes. Mr. Trevor and Walter rushed upon Onowahoo, who,
                     shaking them off with Herculean strength, threw down the knife, and stood, with
                     flashing eyes and dilated nostrils, confronting his foes.
                  "The knife of Onowahoo will not drink the blood of a coward," he said; then
                     turning to Mr. Trevor, he continued:
                  "Chief, you were the friend of Monatahqua—you have been the friend of
                        Onowahoo—it is written on his heart! There is now a cloud on
                     the face of the chief; but his words are laws to Onowahoo. His shadow shall not
                     be on the land at the setting of the sun."
                  So saying, he walked slowly away, and soon disappeared in the depths of the
                     forest.
                  
                  For weeks the unhappy Gaity was kept a close prisoner in her chamber; no person
                     was allowed to see her. Even the entreaties of her distressed mother or Edith
                     could not move the stern father to relent.
                  While thus, for the first time, the harmony of that happy household was broken
                     by the rough hand of discord, Edith received a pressing invitation from a young
                     friend in Boston, that she would officiate as bridesmaid at her approaching
                     nuptials. She would gladly have declined, but her parents both urged and
                     insisted upon her going. Hoping the void created by her absence might induce
                     her father to forgive her sister, she at last consented. Without out being allowed to bid poor Gaity farewell,
                     Edith departed, bearing a heart of sadness, to scenes where joy and happiness
                     reigned.
                  Edith judged rightly. Mr. Trevor did, indeed, miss the society of his
                     daughters—the gentle, lovely Edith, and that other bright and joyous girl,
                     whose presence had ever been to him as the morning star; and a few days after
                     the departure of the former, the door of Gaity's chamber was unbarred, and she
                     was led forth to freedom. But it was such freedom as rendered the
                     walls of her prison a heaven in comparison!
                  The cold and chilling looks of her father fell like a blight upon her young
                     heart, crushing the germ of duty, which would have led her to have flown at
                     once to his arms, to implore his forgiveness. The countenance of her mother, it
                     is true, flushed with joy; tears started to her eyes, and she would have folded
                     the pale, heart-stricken girl to her maternal bosom, but a look from her
                     husband "froze the warm current of her soul," and she remained
                     passive. There were her brothers also to greet her—but how! not with looks of
                     pity and forgiveness, but with 
                        
                           "Hard unkindness, altered eye,
                           That mocks the tear it forced to flow;"
                        
                      and poor Gaity that night returned to her chamber, more miserable than
                     when she had left it.
                  She threw open the window, and looked forth, with tearful eye, upon the scene
                     now, like herself, so changed from the bright spring-time of happiness—the sear
                     and yellow leaf had already fallen upon her young heart. It was now November.
                     The autumn leaves, whose brilliant liant variegation had draped the forest with
                     such gorgeous magnificence, were now (fit epitome of the idle passions of
                     mankind) whirling rapidly past her window, soon to mingle with the clods of the
                     valley. The moon was at her full;—while, at a little distance, the river,
                     gleaming through the thick shrubbery on its banks, spangled the dark outline of
                     the forest. Heedless of the chilly night-wind which blew around her, Gaity
                     remained for some time absorbed in mournful revery, when she was suddenly
                     aroused by a slight rustling beneath her window, and, almost at the same
                     moment, an arrow fell at her feet. Joy irradiated the face of the maiden, for
                     well she knew from whose hand it sped! She hastily raised
                     it—affixed was the ring she had given to Onowahoo!
                     She now leaned from the window and looked eargerly around, and soon discovered
                     the form of her lover reclining against a tree a few paces distant. Gaity
                     repressed the cry of delight which mounted from her heart to her lips, but,
                     clasping her hands together, tears of joy fell over her pale face.
                  A second arrow was now thrown in; around it was a paper, on which was
                     written:
                  "At midnight, Onowahoo, by the river-side, will watch for the Sloe-blossom. The
                     canoe floats empty in the stream; a horse, fleet as the wild deer, paws the
                     opposite shore. The ring will whisper 'yes' to the heart of
                     Onowahoo."
                  Alas! not a moment did the wretched girl deliberate, but, with trembling
                     fingers, she once more fastened the ring to the arrow, and dropped it from the
                     window. Onowahoo glided to the spot, and, as he recognized the token of assent,
                     he looked up to the pale, beautiful face of Gaity, bending over him in love and
                     truthfulness; then, sinking for an instant upon his knee, the Indian pressed
                     the ring to his lips and disappeared.
                  It is not surprising that the reserve and apparent scorn she now met from those
                     in whose eyes she had ever been worshiped as an idol, by whom she had been so
                     tenderly caressed, flattered, and indulged; her every wish, however trifling,
                     gratified almost before it was expressed; should have filled the undisciplined
                     heart of Gaity with mingled grief and indignation. At that critical moment,
                     when still writhing under the insulting looks of her brothers, the feigned
                     indifference of her father, came Onowahoo, offering love—happiness—freedom!
                  
                     Her error was great! So was her temptation!
                  
                  Oh, parents, beware how you treat the first offences of inexperienced youth!
                     Crush not the hearts of your children with a brow of iron; withhold not from
                     their repentant lips the kiss of forgiveness; nor let the tongue speak those
                     "bitter words that kill!" No, rather take them to your arms in
                     pity; whisper of love and pardon; and, as the gentle dew falls from heaven to
                     enrich and fructify the earth, so let the words of tender admonition sink into
                     the heart of your child, to nourish the seeds of virtue and good resolves.
                  The heart of a child must, indeed, be formed of "sterner stuff," which can
                     resist the holy influence of that pardon hallowed with tears from
                     the lips of an aggrieved parent!
                  Had such been the conduct of Mr. Trevor, what days of anguish, of misery beyond
                     description, would have been spared!
                  Too much agitated to reflect upon the momentous step she was about to take,
                     Gaity hastily selected a few articles from her wardrobe, changed her light
                     dress for a traveling-habit, and, at the appointed hour, stole softly down
                     stairs. As she reached the door of her mother's bed-room, she stopped—her whole
                     frame shook with emotion; then the pang of remorse
                     shot through her bosom. Alas! was she about to leave for ever that kind,
                     affectionate mother, the tender nurse of her infant years; that being from
                     whose lips no words but those of kindness had ever fallen; and was she thus to
                     leave her! Edith, too, that beloved sister! should she never more meet the
                     glance of those mild eyes, ever beaming with sisterly affection! Gaity
                     trembled, her purpose faltered, and she would fain have returned to her
                     chamber; but, at that moment, the stern, reproachful look of her
                     father seemed fixed upon her! Again her ears seem poisoned with the
                     contemptuous language of her brothers! No longer did she hesitate; but, softly
                     unbarring the door, fled swiftly along the path which led to the river.
                  She had not proceeded far when she was joined by Onowahoo. They spoke not—but
                     one look, as their eyes met, told all! the pain and suffering they had mutually
                     endured, and the happiness of the present moment.
                  They soon crossed the river, and sped swiftly on through the night. Soon after
                     daylight, they arrived at the little village of Westerly, on the borders of
                     Rhode Island. Here the fugitives deemed it necessary to tarry a short time, in
                     order to recruit the almost exhausted strength of their panting steed.
                  It happened, unfortunately, that Walter Trevor had left the Grove late on the previous afternoon, to
                     attend to some law business in Stonington. A witness residing in Westerly was
                     required; and Walter, therefore, rode over very early in the morning, (a
                     distance of five miles,) and arrived at the inn only a few moments after the
                     unfortunate lovers!
                  Then the storm burst in fury over their heads!
                  Walter, foaming with rage, instantly called upon the authorities of the village
                     for aid. Onowahoo was secured and strictly guarded as a runaway Indian; while
                     Gaity was conveyed to a small room in the upper story of the inn, Walter
                     himself keeping guard on the outside.
                  In the meanwhile, an express was sent off to inform Mr. Trevor of the capture
                     of the fugitives. In a few hours the unhappy father, pale with rage and
                     mortification, arrived, accompanied by Basil.
                  A short time sufficed for their arrangements. Onowahoo was immediately sent
                     off, under a strong guard, to Boston, from thence he was to be shipped to the
                     West Indies, and there sold as a slave.
                  At that time Fisher's Island was uninhabited, unless it might be by the
                     occasional visits of fishermen, and, for their convenience, a few rude shelters
                     had been thrown up near the water's edge; but, in the interior of the island,
                     stood the remains of a large building, said to have been occupied by several
                     families of whites, who had fled thither for security during the Pequot war;
                     they were, however, at length discovered by the savages, and every soul
                     inhumanly murdered. Since then it had been uninhabited, and was fast crumbling
                     to decay. To this desolate spot did Mr. Trevor resolve to bear his
                        child! With a terrible oath, the infuriated father swore he
                     would never forgive her; she had disgraced herself and her family; the proud
                     name of Trevor was now indelibly stained; and there, then, far from the face of
                     man, from the sound of a human voice, should she forever bury her shame!
                  Having decided upon this cruel course, Walter and Basil immediately left to
                     ascertain the exact location of this miserable building, and to furnish it with
                     such articles as might be necessary for bare existence, taking with them, at
                     the same time, an old, half-crazed woman, who for years had roved at large in
                     the neighborhood, under the name of "Crazy Nell." Mr. Trevor procured this
                     woman to take charge of his daughter. As a reward, he poured into her skinny
                     hand more gold than had ever yet met her greedy grasp, while, at the same time,
                     he so wrought upon the terrors of the miserable woman should she refuse, or
                     prove unfaithful to the trust, that, cowed with fear, trembling as if she
                     already felt the knife at her heart, Crazy Nell was borne off by the brothers,
                     a companion for the young, beautiful, and noble minded, but
                     misguided Gaity!
                  On the afternoon of the second day all was prepared; the wretched Gaity was
                     dragged from her prison, placed on horseback, and, with Walter and Basil riding
                     close to her bridle-rein, the party set off to bear Gaity to her future gloomy
                     abode. Here the reader followed her at the commencement of this veritable
                     story.
                  
                  When Gaity recovered from the swoon, into which it will be remembered she had
                     fallen, she found herself alone. A few wet branches were smouldering in the
                     fire-place. A tallow candle flickered in fitful shadows upon the wall, rendering the darkness even more
                     horrible. The wind howled mournfully around, and the rain still poured in
                     torrents; while, to add to the terrors of the scene, a heavy peal of thunder
                     now shook the ruinous building to its foundation.
                  "Basil! Walter!" shrieked the poor girl. But there was no answer. Her voice
                     sounded strange in that lone room. Again she called—still no answer. At last
                     the door slowly opened, and Crazy Nell, her form bent nearly double, tottered
                     into the room. With a sort of half-dancing motion, she advanced to the bed,
                     while Gaity, affrighted, shrank to the wall.
                  "Did the little bird sing?" cried the old woman, fixing her glassy eye upon
                     her. "What will the pretty birdie have?"
                  Reassured by the kindness of her tones, Gaity exclaimed, clasping her hands in
                     entreaty:
                  "O, tell me where I am? Where is Basil? Where Walter?"
                  
                     
                        
                           "Gone—gone—gone—the brothers are gone,
                           And the birdie is left in the cage all alone!"
                        
                      sang, or rather screamed the hag.
                  "O, let me out quickly from this horrid place!" shrieked Gaity, now overcome
                     with fear, springing from the bed and rushing to the door.
                  "Ha! ha! ha!" laughed the old woman, hobbling after her, "fold your wings,
                     pretty birdie; 
                        
                           "Gone—gone—gone—the brothers are gone,
                           And the birdie is left in the cage all alone."
                        
                     
                  
                  The wretched girl sank nearly senseless upon the floor, and gave herself up to
                     her misery. Crazy Nell seemed somewhat moved by the heavy sobs which burst from
                     her sorrowing heart, and, after watching her a few moments with apparent
                     wonder, she patted her gently on the head, saying, "Poor bird—poor
                        bird!" and then, hobbling away, seemed to busy herself in preparing
                     some refreshment for the exhausted girl. Her well-meant kindness, however, was
                     vain, and, after an attempt to swallow the morsel of food the old woman placed
                     before her, with despair at her heart, Gaity threw herself upon the wretched
                     pallet.
                  At length sleep, that angel of peace, who in tenderness listens to the
                     lamentations of the afflicted, took her gently to her bosom, and she slept
                     calmly until late the following morning. When she awoke the sun was shining
                     brightly in; hastily springing from the bed, she flew to the window, and looked
                     out upon the scene. This window (and the only one) was boarded up, with the
                     exception of one solitary pane of glass, which was directly over the deep
                     ravine before-mentioned; and the stream, swollen by the late storm, now brawled
                     furiously over its rocky bed. On every side she was surrounded by a deep
                     forest. She attempted to open the window; it was fastened; she then tried the
                     door—that was also secured. At that moment from some dark corner emerged Nell,
                     gibbering, and dancing as before. Throwing herself at her feet, Gaity implored
                     her to release her; entreating her, while the tears rolled down her cheeks,
                     that she would suffer her to quit that abode of misery and desolation; but,
                     although the old woman appeared to comprehend, and even sympathize in her
                     grief, she only shook her head, saying:
                  "No, no, pretty birdie!" and then, as if it might be a means to frighten her
                     from her wishes, added, in a voice
                     of affected terror, pointing to the woods, "Indian in the woods—take
                        care!"
                  Gaity soon found all attempts at escape were impossible. What, then, was to be
                     her lot? Was she brought there to die? No, it could not be; her
                     father would relent; she should be forgiven. Onowahoo, too—yes, they should all
                     be happy once more! Such were the sunbeams which occasionally lit up the dark
                     prison of Gaity. Alas, poor child!
                  At the end of a week, Gaity one morning saw Basil approach the house. Uttering
                     a scream of joy, while she beat the window with her little hand, she cried:
                  "O, Basil, dear brother, take me away! Take me to my mother! Take me
                        home—home—home!" she shrieked, louder and louder, as she saw
                     him turn from the house.
                  
                  Yes, that cruel brother, after depositing a basket upon the door-stone, walked
                     rapidly away, without casting even one look to where the pale
                     despairing face of Gaity was watching him; and whose voice of agonizing
                     entreaty reached his ears, even through the walls of her prison.
                  He disappeared. Then hope forsook the heart of Gaity!
                  Every week either Basil or Walter would leave a basket of the coarsest
                     provisions at the door, never entering the house, or bestowing either word or
                     look upon the unhappy sister.
                  The place at last was reported to be haunted. Shrieks, groans, and horrid
                     laughter were said to have been heard issuing thence, by fishermen whom
                     accident had led thither. Some even went so far as to assert that those very
                     witches, supposed to have been executed nearly a century before,
                     here assembled and held their midnight orgies, in contempt of fire and faggots!
                     While by others it was believed a maniac was there confined in chains!
                  At any rate, the island soon became deserted, no one caring to approach its
                     shores after nightfall.
                  
                  After leaving his daughter, as already described, Mr. Trevor returned home; but
                     it was only to meet with a new and more severe trial. He found his wife in the
                     agonies of death. She had been for some time gradually sinking under that fatal
                     disease so incident to our climate—consumption; and this sudden shock of her
                     darling child's elopement had caused the rupture of a blood-vessel, and Mr.
                     Trevor only arrived in time to receive her last breath.
                  Great as was his grief at this sudden bereavement of an amiable and beloved
                     companion, it lessened not his wrath against his disobedient child. On the
                     contrary, those feelings seemed only to be augmented, and again and again he
                     cursed her, as the destroyer of her mother!
                  Edith was still in Boston. Who should break to her these heavy tidings—a
                        mother dead! a sister banished! As soon, however,
                     as the last sad rites were performed, Mr. Trevor resolved to go himself and
                     bring Edith back to her desolate home. Accordingly, the next week he departed
                     for Boston, and soon returned with his child, now his only comfort.
                  Absorbed in grief at the death of her kind mother, and at the uncertain fate of
                     Gaity, Edith moved mournfully around those walls once echoing with the merry
                     laugh and song, now so silent, so
                     dreary, as if the shadows of the tomb already darkened them.
                  Who that has lost a near and dear friend by death but has felt that
                     indescribable sickness of heart, which rends the soul to agony, as they view
                     those scenes once hallowed by the presence of that loved form, whom now the
                     dark portals of the tomb enclose! Scenes where the beloved one moved in health
                     and gladness; the vacant chair by the fireside, the seat left void around the
                     family board, the closed book, the favored flower, the thousand nameless
                     associations connected with those now lost and gone! Oh, does it not seem that
                     the hand of death is already tearing our heart-strings; loosing our hold of
                     this world, so glorious in its grandeur and beauty, but where, alas! Death and
                     sorrow stalk side by side, plucking the choicest treasures from our garnered
                     affections, and ruthlessly cutting down the lovely flowers which adorn our
                     garden of happiness.
                  Pity, then, poor Edith!
                  She mourned as an affectionate child, the death of a kind mother, whom on earth
                     she should see no more—yet sainted, as she believed, in heaven. But not for
                        her did she weep those tears of bitterness; not for
                        her was that silent grief gnawing at her heart; no, it was for
                     that other, her only beloved sister, the discarded Gaity; cast out
                     in her youth and loveliness, an alien for ever from her father's house!
                  From neither her father nor brothers could Edith learn any thing concerning
                     her; in vain she implored them to tell her where the wretched girl might be; on
                     her knees she begged to be allowed to go to her, but, with a frown, and words,
                     such as he had never before used to this gentle girl, Mr. Trevor forbade her
                     ever again to mention the name of her sister, or, on pain of his lasting
                     displeasure, seek to know where she was.
                  Nothing daunted, however, from her purpose, Edith resolved she would find her
                     sister or perish in the attempt. Feigning, therefore, the most perfect
                     indifference as to the fate of Gaity, (contradicted by her pale cheek and
                     sunken eye,) she no longer mentioned her name, but appeared to give all her
                     attention to the many household duties which now devolved upon her.
                  She soon noticed that, on a certain day of every week, one of her brothers left
                     the Grove and remained absent during the day; that no questions were ever
                     asked, either as to where they had been or of the business which had called
                     them thence. She was sure their absence was in some way connected with her
                     ill-fated sister, and she resolved, difficult as it might prove, to follow
                     them. For that purpose, she obtained permission of her father to pass the day
                     with a young friend residing about a mile from the Grove. This was the day she
                     knew one of her brothers would be absent. Instead, therefore, of going to her
                     friend's, she hastened to the cottage of one of her father's tenants, whom she
                     knew to be strongly attached to herself and Gaity. To him she unfolded her
                     plan, and found in honest Jacques a faithful assistant.
                  As soon as Walter passed the cottage, Edith, disguised in a large cloak and
                     bonnet, mounted behind the old man, and started in pursuit; keeping, however,
                     as far behind as was practicable. The same dreary road was passed over with
                     which the reader is already acquainted. Walter fastened his horse as before,
                     while Edith and her companion,
                     passing behind the shelter of some large rocks, watched his proceedings, the
                     noise of their horses' feet being happily drowned by the roaring of the
                     surf.
                  Walter unmoored the boat, and put off in the direction of Fisher's Island. It
                     was there, then that the unfortunate girl was a prisoner. It was,
                     however impossible for them to proceed further; they, therefore, returned with
                     all speed.
                  Happy that her plan had so far proved successful, Edith determined, that, if
                     possible, not another day should pass without renewing the search, and
                     confident that her sister was on the island, she retired that night to rest,
                     with the blissful anticipation that on the morrow she should fold her beloved
                     Gaity to her bosom.
                  Again she asked permission for a day's absence, and her father, delighted to
                     find her once more evincing a disposition to mingle in society, gladly
                     consented.
                  With the faithful Jacques, Edith was soon traveling the route of the preceding
                     day. Arriving at the beach, they found the boat concealed among the rocks. It
                     was soon launched, and trembling with anxiety for the result, filled with evil
                     forebodings, Edith seated herself by the side of Jacques, and they were soon
                     rapidly nearing the Island.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  IT was now May. The long, dreary winter had passed; once more the trees put
                     forth their leaves; gaily the birds warbled amid their branches, filling the
                     air around with their sweet melody. The beautiful flowers, too, sprung up with
                     the bright green grass, and all nature rejoiced in the glad presence of
                     spring.
                  But alas! there was no spring in the heart of the poor forsaken Gaity. Her
                     slender form had wasted away until it seemed too frail to support its lovely
                     burthen; her cheeks were sunken and colorless as marble; her beautiful hair had
                     lost its brightness, save where the silver thread already gleamed unnaturally
                     among the tresses of the doomed girl. Her eye, too, now shone with a strange
                     and terrible brilliancy.
                  Whether it was the mental suffering she ever endured for her wretched lot,
                     uncertainty as to the fate of her lover, the reflection, too, that she was an
                     outcast from her family, with a parent's curse ever ringing in her ears;
                     whether it was this, or the constant companionship of that most hideous old
                     crone whom her father had placed about her, which harrowed her soul to madness,
                     is difficult to determine—but the fatal reality was accomplished—Gaity
                        was a maniac!
                  
                  Much physical suffering, too, had the poor girl endured. Compelled by hunger to
                     eat food from which her father's menials would have turned away in scorn; at
                     times almost perishing with cold, and shut out from that pure air where, like a
                     bird, she had ever roved in freedom; alas! it is no wonder that Reason forsook
                     her throne.
                  For hours now would the poor girl pace with rapid steps around the walls of her
                     prison; shrieking wildly, and calling, with the most piteous lamentations, on
                     her father—on Onowahoo to release her. Again, with wild dance and song, she
                     would exhaust her feeble strength.
                     Sometimes she would fancy herself again flying with Onowahoo from her father's
                     roof; or that she was listening to that heavy curse; for on her knees, while
                     she would beat her breast and weep, she would pray her father not to curse her.
                     It was not always thus; there were times when, for a few hours, Reason resumed
                     her empire; yet who can tell whether the mental struggles she then endured were
                     not more dreadful than even the raving paroxysms of insanity!
                  It was during one of these lucid intervals that Gaity one morning saw two
                     persons approaching the house, and one a female. With what eagerness she
                     watched them! as they drew near her heart throbbed tumultuously!
                  "Edith! Edith!" she shrieked, as she recognized the light step of her
                     sister.
                  Edith eagerly raised her head to that solitary window, revealing the spectral
                     face of Gaity, glued, as it were, to the glass. With a joyful wave of the hand,
                     and a cry of delight, Edith now flew to the door. It yielded not. She knocked;
                     again and again, and shook the latch convulsively. No answer was given, but she
                     could hear the sobs and prayers of Gaity, beseeching some one to unbar the
                     door. The sturdy Jacques, however, waited for no permission, but, seizing a
                     billet of wood, he soon beat in the boarded casement, and springing through the
                     opening, he drew Edith carefully within. The next moment Gaity had fainted on
                     the bosom of her sister!
                  It were a vain attempt to describe the feelings of Edith, at the situation in
                     which she found her sister.
                  "O father, cruel father, is it you have done this?" she exclaimed.
                  Pressing the insensible form to her breast, she kissed that pale, altered face,
                     while tears of pity and indignation streamed down her cheeks.
                  At last, with a low moan, Gaity opened her eyes, and fixed them upon her
                     sister.
                  "Gaity, dear Gaity, have I found you at last!" sobbed Edith.
                  "Who calls Gaity?" she replied, springing from the arms of her sister, her eyes
                     flashing with insanity. "Who calls Gaity? Gaity is dead. They buried her with
                     Onowahoo under the dry leaves. Ha—ha—ha! You are late to the bridal." Then,
                     advancing on tip-toe to Edith, she said—"Come, I am ready! Hush! tread softly!
                     Don't awaken mother, she sleeps. There, now row quickly! See! the Sloe-blossom
                     will gladden the lodge of Onowahoo!"
                  She then seized the hand of Edith, and hurried her up the creaking stairs.
                  "Here is another birdie, Nell," she cried in evident delight. "Ha—ha—ha!
                        She is caged too!"
                  "Oh, my God, this is indeed terrible! Gaity, dearest Gaity, don't you know me?"
                     cried Edith; "have you forgotten me!"
                  But Gaity made no answer; apparently, her mind now wandered to the scene of her
                     capture, for, with a horrible shriek, she now called on Walter for mercy.
                  "Bind me—bind me—but, O! Walter, take off that chain
                     from him—from Onowahoo. Have you no mercy? No—no—no!"
                  In this manner her ravings continued for more than an hour, when at length,
                     perfectly exhausted, she sobbed herself to sleep in the arms of Edith, who, as
                     she became more quiet, had folded
                     her to her bosom, and wept over her in agony.
                  She now endeavored to obtain some information from the miserable old woman; but
                     it was in vain. Apparently alarmed at the sight of Edith, she had crouched down
                     in a corner, and to all her questions only answered:
                  "Go away—go away."
                  Long did the heart-stricken Edith watch by the side of the poor manaic, and the
                     shades of night were already falling when the sufferer opened her eyes.
                  The fit had passed off, and Gaity, now bursting into tears, threw her arms
                     around the neck of Edith, murmuring, in a low, tremulous voice:
                  "It is no dream, then, dearest Edith? You have come to take me away? You will
                     carry me to my mother? (Alas, she knew not that dear mother was dead!) "Dear
                     Edith, O take me home!"
                  "Yes, dearest Gaity, you shall go home, but not to-night. Tomorrow, dearest, I
                     will come for you."
                  "To-night, to-night," interrupted Gaity, "O let me go to-night. Do not leave me
                     again," she cried, clinging tightly around her. "O no, let us go—now—this
                     moment!"
                  Edith, at length succeeded in calming the agitation of Gaity, and, after
                     assuring her that the next day she would return, and that she should go with
                     her to her own dear home, she tore herself away from her embraces, and with a
                     bleeding heart left the island.
                  On reaching home, Edith went immediately to her father's room, where he usually
                     spent his evenings alone.
                  Concealment was vain. Throwing herself into his arms, she cried:
                  "Forgive me, father, but I have seen her—I have seen Gaity!"
                  Speechless with astonishment, Mr. Trevor gazed into the pale face of Edith, now
                     bathed in tears, who, sinking on her knees and clasping his hand in hers,
                     continued:
                  "O, father, father, forgive her! I conjure you, by the memory of my own dear
                     mother, whose name I bear, and of that kind and gentle being who now looks down
                     from heaven upon the sufferings of her child; O, I beseech you to forgive her.
                     She is dying, father—yes, Gaity is dying! Father she is a manaic!
                     O, bring her home, she can no more offend; bless her and forgive her, ere she
                     dies. O, father, bring her home, or let me go and die with
                     her!"
                  The heart of Mr. Trevor was melted; he folded his child to his breast, mingling
                     his tears with hers. Edith again urged her suit, and related every circumstance
                     of her visit to her sister, only interrupted by the heavy groans which now
                     burst from the bosom of the repentant father.
                  "Your brothers have deceived me," he said; "they have always assured me the
                     poor child was well, and that in all their conversations with her she had never
                     manifested any repentance for her misconduct."
                  "Alas! father," interrupted Edith, "they have never seen her—have never spoken
                     with her!"
                  Basil and Walter were immediately summoned, and after vainly attempting to
                     equivocate, at length confessed the part they had acted.
                  
                  "Out upon you!" exclaimed the miserable father. "What! are you human? Did I not
                     entrust that wretched girl to your charge, bidding you treat her with kindness?
                     Inhuman brothers! you have murdered your sister!"
                  There was no sleep at the Grove that night, and ere the dawn of day, Mr.
                     Trevor, accompanied by Edith and Jacques, had set out for the island.
                  Swiftly now was the boat propelled to the shore, and with rapid step Edith flew
                     along the path conducting to the lone abode of Gaity, followed by her father,
                     trembling with agitation at the thought of so soon meeting the victim of his
                     pride. As they approached the house, Edith looked up at the window where she
                     had before seen the pale face of Gaity. She was not there. They entered the
                     house—the silence of the grave rested upon it. Edith now rushed up the ruined
                     staircase. The room was empty. In vain she called her beloved sister—echo alone
                     replied. Filled with apprehension they now left the house and entered the
                     forest, calling distractedly upon the name of Gaity. For some time their search
                     proved fruitless, when, suddenly, the faint sound of a voice reached their
                     ears. Hastening eagerly in the direction from which it proceeded, Edith soon
                     distinguished the tones of Nell, as if in entreaty, saying:
                  "Come home, pretty bird; come home, birdie!"
                  Gently now, lest she might alarm her sister, Edith advanced. Seated on the
                     ground, her head reclining against a tree, was Gaity. Her eyes were closed as
                     if in sleep, while a sweet smile rested on her lips. Wreathed amid her long
                     hair, which fell around her as a pall, was a garland of wild-flowers, and her
                     lap was full of these frail blossoms, just as in happy days of childhood she
                     had plaited and woven them into garlands. One arm hung listless at her side;
                     the other lay across her lap, the long slender fingers still grasping the
                     flowers. Over her bent the old woman, as if trying to awaken her.
                  "Gaity, dear Gaity, we have come," cried Edith, springing to her side—but there
                     was no answer.
                  
                     She was dead!
                  
                  Oh the agony of that moment! The grief and destraction of the faithful sister!
                     The horror and remorse of the father! repenting, now too late—the
                     victim was far beyond his cruelty or his kindness!
                  From what incoherent words they could gather from the old woman, it appeared
                     that Gaity had stolen out early that morning through the broken casement left
                     by Jacques. When the poor girl found herself once more inhaling the pure air of
                     heaven, with her foot again pressed on the green-sward in freedom, she screamed
                     with delight. Like a bird, she flew from spot to spot, singing the songs she
                     used to warble in childhood, clapping her hands in ecstasy, and stooping to
                     gather the wild flowers which sprung up in her path. In this manner she reached
                     the forest; and now the image of Onowahoo was brought, by association, to her
                     wandering mind. With child-like glee she called him to her, and then, as if
                     carried back to those scenes where so much of her early life had been spent,
                     she laughed and chatted as though the companion of her youthful sport was even
                     now at her side. After awhile she appeared to weary, and, calling Onowahoo to
                     sit beside her, she threw herself under a tree, and for some time, laughing and singing by
                     turns, amused herself in entwining the wild flowers she had gathered amid her
                     hair.
                  Death came now in mercy, disarmed of all his terrors. Gently he laid his hand
                     upon her innocent brow, and she sank into his arms as a tired child on the
                     breast of its mother, happy in the delusion that her lover was at her side; and
                     that the trees, the birds, and the flowers were the same that had surrounded
                     her in infancy.
                  Her remains were borne from the island, and placed at the feet of her mother.
                     The flowers she had loved so well sprung up around her grave, nourished by the
                     tears of her mourning sister, who daily visited the spot where, released from
                     all suffering her beloved Gaity reposed.
                  Nearly a year had passed since the death of the ill-fated Gaity, when, one
                     morning, Edith as usual bent her steps to the spot so sacred to her affections.
                     She started, as she drew near, to perceive some person already there, kneeling
                     by the grave of Gaity! She softly advanced—
                  "Onowahoo!" she exclaimed, springing to his side.
                  He raised his head slowly, revealing indeed the features of Onowahoo, but so
                     worn with care and suffering that it was almost impossible for
                        another than Edith to have recognized him.
                  "The Sloe-blossom sleeps," said he, in a low, musical tone; "she hears not the
                     voice of Onowahoo!"
                  "She is in heaven," replied Edith; "she hears you there."
                  The Indian raised his head, and looking upward, as if he really saw the angel
                     form of Gaity bending over him, remained for a few moments silent, then turning
                     to Edith, he said:
                  "Onowahoo departs for ever. He has seen the spot where the Sloe-blossom lies
                     withered, and the heart of Onowahoo is crushed beneath."
                  Stooping and plucking a violet from the grave, he was about to depart, when,
                     with all the kind sympathy of a woman's heart, Edith took from her neck a
                     little chain, woven from the hair of Gaity, and, placing it in his hand,
                     said:
                  "The trees of the Sloe-blossom will bind the wounds of Onowahoo."
                  He made no reply, but, pressing the chain to his lips, waved his hand to Edith,
                     and turned into the path which led to the forest.
                  
                  Mr. Trevor never recovered from the shock sustained by the death of Gaity, and
                     lived out the remainder of his days a prey to remorse and wretchedness.
                  To such as may be interested in the fate of Edith, it may give pleasure to
                     learn that she afterwards became the wife of one who held a high office under
                     Washington, and who distinguished himself nobly in the war of the revolution,
                     and that the devoted sister was recompensed, by many years of happiness, for
                     the sorrows she had endured in early life.
                  Walter and Basil Trevor, although they openly espoused the cause of the
                     Americans in the great struggle for liberty, were detected in several nefarious
                        transactions with the British
                     fleet, which for some time lay off and on the harbor of Stonington. Held up to
                     the scorn of their own countrymen, they were compelled to join the British, and
                     soon met the death they merited.
               
            
            
               THE POET LÍ.
               A FRAGMENT FROM THE CHINESE.
               
                  
                     
                        Do not draw upon you a person's enmity, for enmity is never
                           appeased—injury returns upon him who injures—and sharp words recoil
                           against him who says them.
                     
                     —Chinese Proverb.
                  
               
               ON the green and flowery banks of the beautiful Lake Tai-hoo, whose surface bears
                  a thousand isles, resting like emeralds amid translucent pearl, dwelt Whanki the
                  mother of Lí. The mother of Lí! Ah, happy distinction—ah, envied
                  title! For where, far or near, was the name could rank with Lí on the scroll of
                  learning—receiving even in childhood the title of the "Exiled Immortal," from his
                  skill in classic and historical lore!
               Moreover, he was of a most beautiful countenance, while the antelope that fed
                  among the hills was not more swift of foot. Who like Lí could draw such music from
                  the seven silken strings of the Kin! or when with graceful touch his fingers swept
                  the lute, adding thereto the well-skilled melody of his voice, youths and maidens
                  opened their ears to listen, for wonderful was the ravishing harmony.
               Yet although the gods of learning smiled upon this youthful disciple of Confucius,
                  poverty came also with her iron hand, and although she could not crush the active
                  mind of Lí, with a strong grip, she held him back from testing his skill with the ambitious literati, both old and young, who annually flock to
                  the capital to present their themes before the examiners. For even in those days
                  as the present, money was required to purchase the smiles of these severe judges.
                  They must read with golden spectacles—or wo to the unhappy youth who,
                  buoyant with hope and—empty pockets, comes before them! With what
                  contempt is his essay cast aside, not worth the reading!
               Sorely vexed, therefore, was poor Lí—and what wonder—to know that he might safely
                  cope with any candidate in the "Scientific Halls," yet dare not for the lack of
                     sycee (silver) enter their gates, lest
                  disgrace might fall upon him.
               Yet Lí was of a merry heart—and, as all the world knows, there is no better
                  panacea for the ills of fortune than the spirit of cheerfulness. Thus, although
                  poverty barred the way to promotion, it could not materially affect his
                  happiness—no more than the passing wind which for a moment ruffled the surface of
                  the lake, yet had no power to move its depths.
               Now it happened that one day taking his nets Lí went down to the lake, and as he
                  cast them within the waters, not knowing any one was near, he broke forth into a
                  merry song, which sent its glad burthen far off to the lips of mocking Echo, like
                  Ariel, seeming to "ride on the curled clouds." Now it also chanced, that within a
                  grove of the graceful bamboo, which skirted the path down which Lí had passed on
                  his way, walked the great Mandarin Hok-wan.
               "Hí! by the head of Confucius the fellow sings well!" he exclaimed,
                  as the song met his ear, (for, as we have said, Lí had a voice of rare melody,)
                  and forthwith issuing from his concealment, Hok-wan seated himself upon the bank
                  and entered into conversation with the young fisherman.
               If the mere melody of the voice had so charmed the mandarin, how much more was he
                  captivated by the wit and learning of the youth, who, thus poorly appareled, and
                  humbly employed, seemed to share wisdom with the gods! Hok-wan stroked his
                  eye-brows in astonishment, and then bidding Lí leave his nets, he bore him off as
                  a rare prize to his own house, where he that day feasted a numerous company.
               First conducting Lí to an inner apartment, he presented him with a magnificent
                  robe richly embroidered, together with every article necessary to complete the
                  toilet of a person of distinction, and when thus appareled, introduced him into
                  the presence of his guests. And truly Lí walked in among them with all the
                  stateliness and hauteur of a man who feels that he is conferring an honor instead
                  of being honored, as no doubt Lí should have considered himself, in such an august
                  assemblage of grave mandarins. With what an air he seated himself at the
                  sumptuously loaded table! where, according to Chinese custom of the higher
                  classes, the various dishes of meats, soups, fish, preserves, etc., were all
                  nearly hidden by large bouquets of beautiful flowers, and pyramids of green
                  leaves.
               And now no sooner had Hok-wan delivered with all customary formality the speech of
                  welcome, and drained to the health of his guests the tiny goblet of crystal,
                  embossed with gold, than rising to his feet, and joining his hands before his
                  breast, in token of respect to his host, Lí called a servant, and bidding him take a part from all the good things
                  spread before him, said:
               "Carry these to the dwelling of Whanki, the mother of Lí. Say to her that as the
                  sands on the lake shore, countless are the blessings of the gods, who have this
                  day smiled upon her son. Bid her eat—for although from hunger he should gnaw his
                  flesh, and from thirst drink his blood, yet not one morsel of this banquet shall
                  pass the lips of Lí unless his aged mother be also sustained by the same
                  delicacies."
               At hearing which, all the mandarins, and Hok-wan himself, loudly expressed their
                  admiration. Such is the esteem which the Chinese entertain for filial piety.
               This duty discharged, Lí attacked the dainties before him like a hungry soldier,
                  yet seasoning all he said and did with so much wit and humor, that the guests laid
                  down their chop-sticks and listened with wonder. With the wine, Lí grew still more
                  merry—his wit cut like hail-stones wheresoe'er it lighted, and at his jovial songs
                  the grave dignitaries forgetting their rank, (somewhat washed away by copious
                  draughts of sam-shu,
                  *
                  ) snapped their fingers, wagged their shorn heads, and even rising from the
                  table embraced him familiarly. At length, when after an interval of a few hours
                  their hilarity was somewhat abated, during which the guests walked in the
                  beautiful gardens, or reclining upon luxuriant cushions, regaled themselves with
                  their pipes, or in masticating their favorite betel-nut, Lí made bare his bosom
                  before them, and to their astonishment they found it was only a needy scholar
                  whose praises they had been shouting.

                  A needy scholar!
               
               How firmly they clutched their fobs, lest a candareen
                  *
                   might jump into the pocket of the needy scholar. But of advice they were
                   as profuse as grasshoppers in August.

               "Go to the capital—go to Kiang-fu" (Nankin the ancient capital of the empire,)
                  "thou wilt perplex the learned—thou wilt bewilder the ignorant!" said one.
               "Hí! this fellow Lí will yet stand with honor before the emperor,"
                  cried another.
               "Appear boldly in the 'Scientific Halls' before the Examiners," said a third, "and
                  never fear but thy name shall be cried at midnight from the highest tower in the
                     city,†
                     as the successful Lí with whom no other candidate can compete!"

               "When the wind blows over the field does not the grass bend before it!" said
                  Hok-wan. "When the great Ho speaks will not inferiors obey! the learned
                  academician Ho is my brother—to him then you shall go—one word from him, and even
                  the judges themselves shall cry your name."
               "Ivory does not come from a rat's mouth, nor gold from brass clippings," thought
                  Lí, as he listened to these remarks—"a few candareens now would be better for me
                  than all this fine talk—truly I must be a fool not to know all this stuff before.
                  Yet by the sacred manes of my ancestors, I will go to the capital,
                  and that, too, ere another sun ripens the rice-fields—furnished with a letter to
                  the illustrious Ho, I may dare admittance."
               
               Giddy with wine, and with the excitement of high hopes for the future, at a late
                  hour Lí was borne in a sumptuous palankeen to the humble dwelling of Whanki.
               The poor old soul at first knew not the gay gallant who stood before her, so much
                  had the gift-robes of the mandarin changed his appearance.
               "Heigh-yah! but, Lí, thou art as fine as a magpie," guoth she,
                  raising her head from the pan of charcoal, over which she seemed to be simmering
                  something in a small dish—"Heigh—and now I look at you again, I see
                  you have drank of that cursed sam-shu—forever
                  abhorred be the name of I-tih!*
                   With all thy wit dost thou not know the wise saying of Mencius—'Like a crane among hens is a man of parts among fools!' (It may be
                  inferred, I think, that the good old Whanki was something of a scold.) And while
                  thou hast been guzzling, see what I have prepared for thee—what had I
                  to do with birds-nest soup, and with shark's fins, and with pigeon's eggs from the
                  table of Hok-wan! My poor Lí will be too modest to eat with the great company, I
                  said to myself, and I will not eat them, but warm them up to comfort him when he
                  comes back—look, here they are," (lifting the dish from the fire) "and yet thou
                  comest home like a well-fed, stupid swine!"
               
                  
                  *The god of intoxicating liquors.
               
               "Now tush, mother," answered Lí, "if thy son has been drinking with fools, they
                  wore fine feathers—and now embrace me, for I am going to the capital."
               "Lí, thou art drunk—go to bed—the capital indeed! Ah, cursed, cursed I-tih!"
                  exclaimed the old woman.
               But when at length Lí convinced her that he was neither drunk nor crazy, but in
                  reality about to start for Nankin, as a candidate for honors in the Scientific
                  Halls, and with a letter to the great Ho in his pouch, Whanki knocked her head
                  reverently before the shrine of the household gods in token of gratitude.
               The remainder of the night was passed in preparations for the journey, and just as
                  the golden ripples of the lake danced in the rays of the rising sun, Lí tenderly
                  embraced his aged parent, and set forth on foot for Nankin, more than a hundred
                  miles distant.
               "Ah, the blessed bug," quoth the old woman, gazing after him so long as she could
                  catch a glimpse of his large bamboo hat, "he will not want for rice any day—no
                     sycee has he in his pockets, but such a
                  tongue in his head, as will bring him food and honors."
               Whanki was right. In every hamlet he passed through—in every cottage by the
                  wayside, Lí found a shelter and a welcome—the good people considering themselves
                  amply repaid for their hospitality if the young stranger would but touch the
                  strings of the pipa, or recite to them odes from
                  the Shoo-king.
               In this manner he reached the capital, and crossing the marble bridge over the
                  great canal, upon the eastern side, entered the city at the Gate of Extensive
                  Peace. Going into the first barber's shop which offered, Lí carefully plucked
                     out his beard, (hear this, ye exquisites of modern days!) shaved
                  his head anew to the crown, and platted his long black hair with red ribbons. Then
                  entering an adjoining tavern, he exchanged his dusty, travel-worn garments for the
                  rich dress presented him by Hok-wan, which he had preserved with great care for
                  the occasion, and holding up his fan, to shield his eyes from the sun, stepped forth into the busy streets, to
                  look for the dwelling of the illustrious Ho.
               And next, within the Hall of Ceremony, in the elegant mansion of Ho, behold Lí in
                  the presence of the great man himself—for with the same audacity which marked his
                  behavior at the dinner of Hok-wan, had Lí given the door-keeper a vermilion card,
                  leading Ho to expect a visitor of rank. Advancing three steps to meet him. Ho bows
                  low to his stranger guest—then with graceful ease Lí also advances three steps,
                  and bows still lower—Ho again gravely steps forward and makes another
                  salutation—upon which Lí again does the same—with a still lower bending of the
                  body, Ho once more advances—whereupon Lí, nearly touching the marble pavements
                  with his forehead, steps forward yet another three steps! By this time their
                  united and solemn paces had brought them near the couch upon which visitors are
                  expected to repose themselves. And here again the same formalities were gone
                  through with, as to who should first be seated thereon. But being
                  seated, Lí at once burst forth with such a flow of with and fancy, that Ho was
                  completely captivated ere he knew the name or business of the daring youth!
               Now this was a capital stroke of Lí. For the academician cared not so much for any
                  dignitary under the Emperor Supreme, as he did for a man of learning, or even for
                  one who could tickle the moments as they flew with witty jests, provoking
                  laughter. Ho saw at once that Lí not only possessed this recommendation, but that
                  his knowledge could also ring on as many topics as there were bells to the
                  Porcelain Tower. When, therefore, he had perused the letter of Hok-wan, which,
                  after securing his ground, Lí put into his hand, and after having listened to the
                  history which the youth gave of his hard struggles, of his poverty, and earnest
                  desire to come before the judges on the day of examination, than Ho, embracing
                  him, bade him be of good cheer.
               "Now, by the sacred Budha!" he exclaimed, "learning like thine shall win its crown
                  without the aid of propitiatory gifts, save to the gods themselves. Know, O Lí,
                  that Yang and Kau, who enjoy the smiles of the great emperor, are this year the
                  examiners. To them shalt thou go, with no favor but my name—humble as it is, it
                  shall cause thine to be enrolled among the literati of the Imperial Academy.
               No doubt Ho manifested great vanity in this, in so much as hinting that his
                     "humble" name could balance with gold in the scales of avarice!
                  Nevertheless Lí was delighted, and immediately set about piling up such a cloud
                  castle as spread over his whole heaven of glory.
               And now the day of examination approached, and confident of success, Lí boldly
                  presented himself for admission.
               Offering the memorial of Ho, which was to insure him, as he supposed, the favor of
                  the judges, he was much surprised to see those great men, Yang and Kau, after
                  turning over the missive with elevated noses, expressive of their contempt, cast
                  it from them with scorn.
               "Heigh! the academician Ho thinks to cheat us with bubbles! He sends
                  us a scrawl devoid of meaning, to bespeak our favor for an upstart without degree
                  or title! Yes—we will remember the name of Lí!" Saying which they
                  cast looks of bitter disdain upon the needy scholar.
               
               Then commenced the tedious formula of the examination. The candidates, hundreds in
                  number, were all obliged to undergo the strict search of the officers in
                  attendance. Their robes, pockets, shoes, and even their nicely platted queues were
                  examined, to see they had not secreted some essay or composition of some kind,
                  which they might substitute for one written on the spot without preparation, when
                  the examiners should command them. This done, they were all seated on long benches
                  with their paper and pencils ready for the trial—the doors and windows in the
                  meanwhile being closely barred and guarded, that no one from without should have
                  the power of smuggling any written paper into the hands of the students.
               At a signal gun the theme for composition was given out, and like the velvet feet
                  of butterflies, the pencils of the rival candidates glided smoothly and fleetly
                  over the tinted paper. With perfect composure and ease, Lí wrote off his essay in
                  the most beautiful characters, without a single erasure or omission—handling the
                  subject with great skill and judgment, and gave it into the hands of Yang.
               "Heigh!" said Yang, without giving himself even the trouble to glance
                  over it, but drawing his pencil derisively over the fair and beautiful characters,
                  "I remember the name of Lí! What stuff is here—why the fellow is only fit to grind
                  my ink!"
               "To grind your ink!" quoth Kau, "say rather he is only fit to lace my
                  buskins!"
               And laughing loudly at their own wit, the great judges Yang and Kau turned their
                  backs upon the unfortunate Lí.
               Overwhelmed with mortification and rage, he rushed to the lower end of the hall,
                  and there was obliged to remain until evening, as not until then could the doors
                  be thrown open to give egress to any one. Here he had the vexation of listening to
                  the jibes and sneers of those around him, and of seeing others promoted to honors,
                  who were as far inferior to him as owls to eagles! What a bitter day for poor Lí!
                  and when at length dismissed with renewed contumely from the Scientific Hall, he
                  rushed into the presence of Ho, swearing loudly that he would one day ride over
                  the necks of the proud Yang and Kau, "and by the head of Confucius when I
                     do—Yang shall grind my ink, and Kau lace up my buskins! he cried
                  with bitterness.
               Ho was terribly indignant at the treatment of his protégé, as well as incensed for the insult he imagined his own
                  dignity had received. But, although he was himself high in favor with the emperor,
                  Yang and Kau stood still higher, therefore he dissembled his anger, lest his head
                  might pay the forfeit, should those two powerful courtiers incense the emperor
                  against him.
               When he found Lí preparing to return home, he embraced him kindly, and bade him
                  tarry yet another year in the capital.
               "In the end thou wilt surely succeed, O Lí. The next year the examiners will not
                  be the same, and thou may'st then be certain of success," said Ho. "Remain with me
                  until the time comes round—thy days and nights shall roll off bright and rosy as
                  morning clouds—wine, wit, and music, yes, and the smiles of women, shall make thee
                  forget the insults thou hast received."
               But Lí remembered his aged mother, sitting solitary in her humble home by the side of the lake, and his
                  resolution strengthened.
               "Know, O Ho, that an old mother waits for Lí afar off. Summer and harvest will
                  come, but Whanki has no one to sow her rice, and desolation will sit in her
                  dwelling. The fish sport and gambol amid the waters of the lake—Whanki has no
                  strength to draw them forth, therefore hunger and death will await her! What
                  profit, O wise Ho, should I gain if my aged parent suffered! Would not the gods
                  curse the race of Lí!"
               "Noble youth, take this purse—it is heavy," exclaimed Ho—"hasten to relieve the
                  necessities of thy mother—a happy mother in so dutiful a son—then return without
                  delay and await the examination. I promise thee, thou shalt not this time lack a
                  present for the greedy judges—though by Budha, I would like to give it them at the
                  dagger's point!"
               Accordingly Lí bade farewell to his generous friend, promising to return as
                  speedily as possible.

                  WITHIN the "Tranquil Palace of Heaven," Hwant-sung sat upon the Dragon's
                     Throne, with all his court prostrate before him.
                  There was evidently "something rotten in the state of Denmark," for the clouds
                     which vailed the august features of the Celestial Monarch were black as
                     night—thunder might soon be expected, and low in the dust his humble courtiers
                     awaited the outpouring of his terrible wrath.
                  Before his footstool knelt the Premier Yang, bearing in his hand an official
                     document inscribed with curious hieroglyphics.
                  "By my ancestors," exclaimed the emperor, with a wrathful look from one to the
                     other of his trembling courtiers, "a wise court is sustained by the bounty of
                     Hwant-sung! say rather a pack of idiots, asses, dolts, fatted dogs! What! shall
                     we become a jibe in the mouths of foreign nations! Shall barbarian kings mock
                     the court of Nankin! Hi! Is there not one then of my learned
                     counselors—not one of my renowned warriors can decipher me this scroll!
                     Tremble, then, ye hounds! Yang, I command thee to make known to us the purport
                     of the missive which the foreign ambassadors have brought to our court."
                  At this order well might Yang turn pale—for there was no more meaning to him in
                     the characters on which his eyes were fixed, than in the slimy trail which the
                     green lizard draws upon the sand. Over and over he turned it—now on this side,
                     now on that—watched narrowly and jealously meanwhile by all around—for when was
                     one high in favor with princes also the favorite with the mass! At length, nine
                     times reverently knocking his head before Hwant-sung, Yang said:
                  "Let not the displeasure of Earth's Glory, before whose frown the whole world
                     stands affrighted, annihilate his slave that the gods have not granted him
                     power to do the will of his majesty in this thing. He cannot read."
                  Then did Hwant-sung call up one after another of those whose scholastic lore
                     was famed throughout the empire. In
                     vain. Not one could understand the mysterious scroll. At which becoming
                     exceeding wroth, Hwant-sung swore that unless within three days his ministers
                     could make known to him the signification of the embassy, their
                        offices and salaries should all be taken from
                     them—and if in six days they were still in ignorance, their death
                     should release the empire from so many stupid owls!
                  Then did the academician Ho humbly present himself at the foot of the
                     throne.
                  "Will the emperor deign to open the ears of graciousness while the humblest of
                     his slaves speaks? Know then, O mighty sovereign, there arrived last night at
                     my house a man in whom all knowledge seems to centre. His mind, keen as the
                     lightning, penetrates the most hidden mysteries—there is no science, no art,
                     which he hath not already mastered. Command then that he appear before thee to
                     make plain that which doth perplex thy majesty's servants."
                  Hwant-sung rejoiced greatly at this information, and bade Ho bring the learned
                     scholar at once into his presence.
                  But when Ho, eager with joy, related to Lí the good fortune he had secured him,
                     that audacious youth positively refused compliance with the commands of the
                     emperor! offering as an excuse, that as he was but a poor scholar, without
                     title or degree, he dared not presume to appear before so much majesty.
                  With this answer then the unhappy Ho returned to the palace, not doubting but
                     the rage of Hwant-sung would vent itself not only upon Lí, but also upon
                     himself.
                  Kneeling before the monarch, Ho exclaimed reverently—
                  "Will your majesty once more graciously listen. At the last examination, this
                     man of whom I have spoken was turned from the Scientific Halls in disgrace—his
                     essay rejected by the Premier Yang and the General Kau. Will it then please
                     thee to bestow some favor upon Lí, that he may with more propriety come into
                     this august presence?"
                  "It shall be done," exclaimed the emperor. "We confer upon Lí the title of
                     Doctor of the first degree, together with the purple robe and yellow girdle. Go
                     bring him before us."
                  With this mark of royal patronage, Ho retraced his steps with all the alacrity
                     of a lover, and made known to Lí the gracious favors of the emperor, supposing,
                     doubtless, that the student would rejoice as one long blind now suddenly
                     restored to light, or as a famished man at a feast. But lo! coolly putting on
                     the robes of office, as if he had just cast them aside, with the air of a
                     prince, Lí signified to the great academician Ho his readiness now to obey the
                     mandate of the emperor.
                  Entering the hall of audience with all the grace and ease of a man bred in
                     courts, Lí advanced to the throne, and after paying the customary homage, rose
                     to his feet and looked proudly around upon the assembly of grave men and
                     gallant courtiers.
                  The knees of the Premier Yang smote each other as he recognized the youth he
                     had treated with so much contumely now suddenly brought into notice—and well
                     did Kau now remember the name of Lí—and it seemed as if hot pins tore his flesh, into
                     such agitation did that name now throw him.
                  Hwant-sung received the new doctor with condescension, and placed in his hand
                     the document which he was required to make plain.
                  But Lí, casting a meaning glance upon Yang and Kau, said:
                  "Can an indifferent scholar like myself presume to know more than these learned
                     men! Know, O mighty emperor, thy servant was deemed unworthy of favor by thy
                     commissioners Yang and Kau—surely, then, they must be more wise than Lí."
                  Charmed with the boldness of the youth, the emperor graciously smiled upon him,
                     and motioned the two mortified examiners to withdraw.
                  Then standing erect, his head thrown back, yet in an attitude of careless ease,
                     Lí opened the important missive, and without even glancing his eye over it to
                     understand more fully its nature, read it aloud from beginning to end, in a
                     clear, melodious voice.
                  It proved to be a demand from the king of Po-Hai, couched in the most insulting
                     language, requiring the emperor to restore a part of Corea, consisting of no
                     less than a hundred and eighty towns, and also demanding tribute from the time
                     of its "usurpation" (as the memorial expressed it) by the emperor
                     of the Tang Dynasty. Thus, but for the skill of Lí, the empire would have been
                     plunged in irretrivable disgrace through the ignorance of its ministers.
                  The countenance of Hwant-sung grew black as midnight as he listened to this
                     insulting claim, and but for the bold remonstrance of Lí, he would have ordered
                     the bearers of the embassy to instant death.
                  "May it please your majesty to summon the boorish ambassadors before us," cried
                     Lí boldly, "I will myself confer with them, and teach them how to respect the
                     mighty Emperor Hwant-sung."
                  Immediately, therefore, the ambassadors were brought before Lí, who conversed
                     with them in their own language with the same haughty bearing as if he himself
                     were emperor, interpreting as he did so to the indignant Hwant-sung. At length
                     Lí dismissed them, saying:
                  "Tomorrow his sovereign majesty, to whom your prince is but an earth-worm, will
                     indite an answer to your insulting embassy. Retire—and tremble as ye walk!
                     Thank the gods that the gracious emperor deigns ye to live."
                  The audience chamber rang with acclamation, as the ambassadors obsequiously
                     withdrew in compliance to the orders of Lí, and all the courtiers pressed
                     forward to compliment the young doctor—while the emperor, embracing him,
                     conferred upon him at once the rank of academician, and ordered apartments to
                     be prepared for him in the palace of the Golden Bell.
                  With continued graciousness, he also directed a sumptuous banquet to be got in
                     readiness, and at which all the learned men and wits of the court were expected
                     to appear. Wine was poured for the guests by beautiful young girls of the "golden lilies"*
                     —ravishing music swept around them, while at intervals of the feast, the
                     emperor sent from his own apartments a choice theatrical corps for their
                     entertainment.
                  
                     
                     *Small feet.
                  
                  
                  Now did it seem that all the trials of Lí were over, his poverty but a dream
                     long past, and that now upon the pinnacle to which his ambition had pointed
                     from early youth, he stood ready to hurl back in the teeth of his enemies the
                     disgrace which, only a few months before, they had heaped upon the name of
                     Lí.
                  The feast wore on even into the night—the wine circulated freely, and in the
                     same breath the courtiers exalted the name of the emperor and of the young
                     academician. What wonder that under the attendance of such charming cup-bearers
                     Lí should have drank more freely than was consistent with his new dignity! How
                     from such hands could he resist the tempting goblet!
                  The result was, that when the next morning the emperor repaired to the Hall of
                     Audience to treat with the embassy from Po-Hai, the academician Lí was not in
                     attendance—nay, did not make his appearance until after being twice summoned by
                     royal mandate!
                  The courtiers whom Lí had feasted the night previous, shook their heads and
                     looked significant. The Premier Yang and the General Kau resumed their usual
                     boldness of demeanor, for no doubt this upstart, this vagabond Lí, would find
                     the anger of their Celestial Monarch more than his head was worth—decapitation
                     would certainly follow such contempt of royalty!
                  To be twice summoned—what audacity!
                  At length Lí walked carelessly into the hall—his dress somewhat disordered, and
                     his feet thrust negligently into slippers. But for those who were hoping his
                     ruin, what rage to see the emperor not only extend his own royal hand in
                     signification that he would raise him from the ground, but also condescend to
                     inquire after his health!
                  "I think, learned doctor, the wine was to thy fancy, yet methinks the fumes are
                     still troubling thee! Ere we proceed to our public duties I would have thy wits
                     clearer."
                  Saying which, Hwant-sung ordered a plate of hot-spiced fish-broth to be brought
                     from the royal kitchens, that its effects might dissipate the evils of last
                     night's debauch.
                  And when with unprecedented condescension their sovereign even took the
                     chop-sticks, and himself cooled it for the palate of Lí, amazement almost
                     turned them to marble.
                  When his majesty deemed the senses of his new favorite sufficiently restored,
                     the ambassadors were summoned into the hall.
                  Upon the top of the platform, near the foot of the "Dragon's Throne," was
                     placed, by the order of Hwant-sung, a cushion or divan of the Imperial Yellow,
                     embroidered with gold and silver, and upon a tablet formed of mother-of-pearl,
                     and richly set in a band of emeralds, was a cake of perfumed ink—a sheet of
                     flowery paper—a hair-pencil set in a gold tube, together with a small
                        jade stone, with which to rub the ink.
                  Waving his hand condescendingly to Lí, the emperor spoke:
                  "Ascend the platform, learned doctor, and repose thyself upon the cushions at
                     my feet, while I indite to thee our answer to these slaves."
                  "May it please your majesty," replied Lí, "my feet are not in proper dress to
                     approach so near the 'Glory of the
                     earth.' Will it please thee to command new buskins to be brought thy servant,
                     that he may with decency ascend the platform."
                  This bold request was no sooner proffered than it was granted. And then, with a
                     significant glance to the spot where stood Yang and Kau, pale with rage and
                     envy, the audacious Lí again addressed the emperor:
                  "The humblest of thy slaves would not be officious—but he has one more request
                     to lay at the feet of his gracious sovereign. At the examination this year, thy
                     servant was repulsed by Yang, and turned from the Scientific Halls in disgrace
                     by Kau! Will it therefore please thee to command the Premier Yang to
                        grind my ink, and the General Kau to lace my
                        buskins!"
                  Never, perhaps, was an audience-chamber so insulted! even the awe which, in the
                     presence of the Celestial Monarch, rendered the courtiers less men than
                     jackals, failed in this case to suppress a murmur of indignation which passed
                     from one end of the hall to the other.
                  But Hwant-sung, well pleased to punish the injustice of his commissioners,
                     immediately ordered them both to approach and do the bidding of Lí!
                  To disobey was death. They wanted courage to die, therefore preferring
                     disgrace, they obsequiously advanced. Kneeling, Kau laced the buskins of
                        Lí, who then ascended the platform, and while reclining at his ease
                     upon the soft cushion at the feet of the emperor, Yang stood at his side
                     assiduously rubbing his ink!
                  
                  Thus did Lí accomplish his revenge, and triumph over his enemies!
                  Taking the pencil, he now, with rapid and easy strokes, proceeded to indite the
                     answer, which the emperor vouchsafed safed to the Po-Hai embassy, and while he
                     did so, Hwantsung bent over him in astonishment, beholding the characters which
                     he traced with so much rapidity to be identical with those which had so
                     perplexed his court.
                  Then standing erect upon the right hand of the "Dragon's Throne," in clear
                     distinct tones, Lí read aloud the imperial answer—the ambassadors trembling
                     with fear as they listened.
                  "And now return," exclaimed Lí, "and teach your king that foxes may not war
                     with lions, nor the cuckoo steal into the eagle's nest! He is like a vexed
                     grasshopper striving to combat the mighty chariot about to crush him, or like a
                     fly in the jaws of the dragon! When the mighty Hwant-sung, at whose name fear
                     sits in the hearts of all nations, shall send a handful of men to seize upon
                     the petty territory of Po-Hai, blood shall flow a thousand Li!"*
                     
                        
                        *Leagues.
                     
                  
                  Kneeling reverently before the throne, and knocking their heads in token of
                     submission, the ambassadors then withdrew to relate to their king that the
                     "Celestial Empire was upheld by an Immortal from the skies!" who stood ever by
                     the throne of the Dragon, and to whom all men did reverence.
                  From that day the star of Lí was in the ascendant, and for many years he
                     enjoyed the undivided confidence of the emperor, and attained a rank in the
                     scale of letters, which renders the name of Lí celebrated in Chinese
                     literature. Many volumes of his beautiful poems and other works are still
                     preserved in the Imperial Libraries.
               
            
            
               
               LITTLE WINNIE.
               EVERYBODY said little Winifred Orne never would be married; for she was too poor,
                  too homely, and too wild—and of course what everybody says must be
                  true, as we shall endeavor to prove. To account for this wonderful prevision, it
                  must be owned the doom of single-blessedness did seem as it were shadowed forth in
                  the person of little Winifred. Everybody said she was poor, and she was so—solely
                  dependent from her earliest years upon the begrudged charity of a step-aunt, and
                  no sooner was she old enough to run up and down stairs, go of errands and wipe
                  dishes, than she was made to feel that the bread of dependence was ground in a
                  species of treadmill, upon which she was ever employed. I am wrong to
                  say she was made to feel so—for so cheerful was the sunshine of the
                  breast, which the Almighty had implanted within her—so light and merry her little
                  heart, that the idea of hardship never occurred to her—but at every
                  call, every bidding, away flew little Winifred, as light as the humming-bird—all
                  smiles, all brightness.
               Then everybody said she was so homely—true enough, unlucky little
                  sprite! Her complexion could not be compared to the rose, or the lily—it more
                  resembled the saffron flower; and then her eyes—mercy upon me, what large gray
                  eyes; And her mouth—and those great white teeth. Certain it is, no one could see
                  them without involuntarily thinking of poor little Red-Riding Hood's apostrophe to
                  the disguised wolf—"Granny, Granny, what great mouth—what great teeth you've got!"
                  and then answered the sly wolf—"So much the better to eat you, my
                     dear!" And that obstinate little nose of hers would turn up as if in
                  such scorn, no one ever saw such an impudent nose—that of the famed Roxana, which
                  overturned the Turkish empire, was no nose at all in comparison! If there was any
                  thing which could redeem all this—it was her hair; which fell around
                  her as some thick golden fleece, so soft—so silky—but then it was the most
                  rebellious hair ever tormented poor damsel! Did she subject it to the confinement
                  of ribbon or braid—it was sure to make its escape; or if she gathered it up with
                  her little comb, like rich golden tassels glittering in the sunlight, some part of
                  it was sure to fall dancing over her shoulder as she tripped away upon her many
                  duties. Her foot, too, was so very small, that when her beautiful cousin glanced
                  down upon it at times with a look of scorn—poor Winifred would look, and say too,
                  as if in apology, "Dear me, I wish it was larger!" and many a tap on
                  the ears, and many a shake by the shoulder did she receive from her
                     kind aunt, because her little hands were not able to hold the same
                  weight as a young giantess. And then her little, short, chubby, round figure,
                  always reminded one of a Dutch doll, dressed after the fashion of the ancient
                  belles of New-Amsterdam!
               Again, everybody said she was so wild! and so she was. Never was
                  there such a romp, especially for a girl of thirteen! Only to think of her walking
                  into the parlor one evening and saying:
               
               "Please, aunt, may I go to training tomorrow?"
               
                  She, thirteen years old, to training! The look of dismay
                  with which her aunt regarded her at that awful question—the pushing back of her
                  spectacles! and then the horror of her fastidious cousin—letting fall, in her
                  propriety-shocked-nature, the elegant double cut Cologne!
               "Farmer Smith is going tomorrow morning with Betsey and Nancy in his wagon—please,
                  aunt, let me go!" continued the persevering gipsy.
               There was no answer vouchsafed—but there was a rush, a rustle, a sound
                  assimilating to the idea of a pair of boxed ears, and then, sinking
                  back in the chair, Mrs. Orne exclaimed:
               "Oh, that girl will ruin my temper!"
               She could not even step without first giving those little feet of hers a twist and
                  a shake which would have called forth the admiration even of the most inveterate
                     Polka-r; and then she was a perfect mocking-bird—the first sound
                  in the morning was the voice of Winifred, mingling with the lark and the robin,
                  and the last notes at eve, as the little songsters folded their plumed crests
                  under their bright wings, were trilled in cadence with those of the merry maiden.
                  But she was not content with mimicing the more sweet warblers of the grove—not
                  she—for even the crow, and the cat-bird, and the owl, found a scholar! in short,
                  her little voice was ever ringing like the dew-drops tinkling among the bells of
                  the lily of the valley.
               But it will never do to spend any more time upon the portrait of such an elf—as
                  the Daguerreotype man says: "Miss, that will do!"
               But there were two Winifred Ornes. And not more dissimilar the beautiful
                  garden-rose and the most humble wild-flower, than were these two cousins. At a
                  very early age they had both been consigned to the kindness of a paternal uncle;
                  but under very different auspices. The rose was an heiress and a
                  beauty—the wild-flower a dependent and ill-favored!
               (We will call the latter Winnie, to distinguish her from the elegant
                  and lofty Winifred, who was six years her senior.)
               The figure, the movements of Winifred were all gracefulness, which, with the
                  dazzling purity of her complexion, her brilliant, dark, hazle eyes, superb teeth,
                  fairy mouth, and luxuriant brown hair, combined to render her one of the most
                  lovely girls, not only in the village where her aunt, (now a widow) resided, but,
                  even the most fashionable and élite circles of
                  the metropolis seldom display a more brilliant belle than was Winifred Orne. Pity
                  that one so fair and lovely should have lacked those attributes which would have
                  rendered her beloved! for as the beautiful waxen fruit, which at first sight is so
                  tempting and pleasing to the eye, she was as deceitful and heartless. She was as
                  proud as she was charming—peevish as she was graceful—haughty and overbearing to
                  every one as she was rich; and especially to her little cousin Winnie, who seemed
                  destined for her peculiar amusement, exactly as some poor kitten for the torturing
                  hands of a spoiled child.
               Both orphans—it would have seemed more natural that winifred with all the means
                  she possessed for doing good, would have delighted to share her wealth with her
                  poverty-doomed cousin; or at least that her helpless situation, the perfect
                     abandon of her lot, subjected as she was to the taunts, caprices, and
                  over-exacting duties of her harsh, ill-natured aunt, would have elicited some
                  pity, some kindness. But it was not so—she looked upon her as something even below
                  a servant; and perhaps it was partly owing to the sly insinuations, the bitter
                  taunts of the beautiful Winifred, that the heart of the aunt grew so cold and
                  unfeeling; and in proportion as she was cruel to the unfortunate little Winnie,
                  she lavished every indulgence, all her love, upon the rich heiress. But it was the
                  hand of Winnie which swept and arranged the large commodious chamber of the
                  beauty, and decked it with the fairest and freshest flowers—her hands which
                  prepared the delicious breakfast of ripe berries and cream for the delicate palate
                  of her cousin—her nimble little fingers that plaited the luxuriant
                  tresses—arranged the toilet, and adjusted the wardrobe of the indolent girl—never
                  rewarded by pleasant word or smile; but if, on the contrary, she ventured upon any
                  lively remark, or allowed her buoyant spirit to break forth in song, she was
                  always checked with:
               "Do, pray, shut that ugly great mouth of yours, and if you have finished, go about
                  your work."
               "Here, Winnie!" screamed Mrs. Orne from the kitchen, and "Here,
                     Winnie!" cried Winifred from the parlor, and from parlor to kitchen flew
                  the cheerful girl never sullen, though weary, never impatient, though continually
                  thwarted. If ever she thought of riches, it was when she saw the beggar driven
                  from the door; or, sometimes, as she looked upon the beautiful dresses and
                  splendid ornaments the cousin often received from the city, and then down upon her
                  own faded, patched and scanty calico, she would think it must be a fine thing to
                  be rich—but no shadow of envy darkened her brow, and in a moment the little gipsy
                  was off amid the flowers and birds.
               She was a sly little witch, too! Very well did she know where the old coverless
                  volume of Shakespeare was hidden—or where Ivanhoe and Kenilworth lay perdu amid a heap of old meal-bags; and, when seated
                  in her little garret-room, with a heavy task before her, how nimbly flew her
                  fingers up and down the tedious seam; her eyes now and then glancing with a
                  peculiar, meaning smile, upon some odd corner or basket, or upon her own little
                  cot-bed, from which she knew she could slily draw forth the Sketch-book, or some
                  other favorite volume, if she only finished her task before "Here,
                     Winnie!" sounded in her ears.
               Poor child! her reading was all done by stealth, and hours when she should have
                  been recruiting her over-wrought frame by sleep, she might be seen perched up in
                  her little bed, her elbow resting on the pillow, her small hand supporting her
                  head; her beautiful hair, which nearly swept the floor, pushed away from those
                  great eyes, pouring by the light of a miserable candle over the enchanting page;
                  while her little white foot, escaping from the scanty bed-covering, beat a
                     pas-seul to the throbbings of her delighted
                  heart.
               Naughty girl! what would aunt say if she should chance to catch you!
               In the chamber of Winifred all the new novels of the day, the magazines, annuals,
                  books of beautiful paintings and engravings were scattered around in profusion;
                  but sly, indeed, must be the peep which poor Winnie obtained! Luckily, her eyes
                  were large, and the hurried glance she
                  now and then caught of flowers, landscapes and beautiful faces, were delineated,
                  according to her self-taught skill, within a little book of coarse, white paper,
                  which she managed to obtain from old sweetmeat covers and discarded wrappers.
               But Time never stands still, and, with but little variety to the inmates of Mrs.
                  Orne's dwelling, he brushed the years carelessly behind him as he flew, until he
                  brought round the period when the heiress had attained her twenty-third, and
                  Winnie her seventeenth year.—The sparkling beauty of the one was in no degree
                  impaired by this lapse of time, while truth compels the admission, that
                     everybody said poor Winnie was just as plain as ever; those great
                  eyes and that large mouth still remained! She had grown tall, however, and the
                  buoyancy of childhood subsided into a more quiet cheerfulness; and could any one
                  have fathomed that depth of feeling which lay hidden, as in a well, in that pure
                  heart of hers, what truthfulness, what unaffected goodness was there! But no one
                  ever took that trouble; and, for any thing her aunt knew or cared, provided she
                  fulfilled the routine of her daily tasks, she might as well belong to the Maelzel
                  as the human family.
               It was rather strange, too, that the lovely Winifred, with her great personal
                  attractions, rendered, doubtless, in many eyes so much the more brilliant for the
                  gold they commanded, should have remained thus long unsought, unloved; and in this
                  opinion there is no doubt she herself perfectly concurred, for her mind was now
                  continually wandering to a future of single blessedness; and, to the exclusion of
                  her prayers, she might now be often heard repeating:
                     
                        "They don't propose—they wont propose,
                        For fear, perhaps, I'd not say 'yes'—
                        
                           Just let 'em try—for, heaven knows,
                        I'm tired of single-blessedness!"
                     
                  
               
               But about this time Mrs. Orne received a letter from a distant relative, residing
                  in or near New Orleans, stating, in true mercantile phrase, that he had consigned
                  to her care, not a bale of goods, but a nice young man, his invalid son, who,
                  being recommended by his physicians to try the climate of the north, was booked
                  and shipped for the port of Boston, and, provided his kind kinswoman could receive
                  him, would come to hand [accidents excepted] in a very few days.
               
                  Receive him! to be sure they would, for was he not five-and-twenty,
                  and sole heir to one of the most valuable estates at the south, including scores
                  of wooly-heads! Indeed, as Winifred observed, hard, indeed, must be
                  the heart which could resist such an affecting appeal to sympathy!
               The best chamber in the house was, therefore, immediately prepared, Winnie ordered
                  to keep out of the way, (for it is always difficult to account for the taste of a
                  young man,) and, in due time, pale and languid, Sydney Cleveland arrived, was met
                  at the door with the utmost cordiality by Mrs. Orne, while Winifred, blushing like
                  a half-blown carnation, suffered herself to be surprised by the interesting
                  invalid in arranging a vase of the sweetest flowers upon his snowy toilet. The
                  large black eyes of Cleveland beamed with sudden animation, as he followed her
                  graceful retreat from his chamber, and a flush of pleasure suffused his pale
                  countenance as he learned this most lovely girl was to be his daily companion.
               
               From this time there was nothing left undone which could contribute to the comfort
                  and amusement of the invalid. There were delightful little rides, in which
                  Winifred, with her delicate, gloved hands, performed the graceful charioteer; and
                  quiet and shady walks, while the nicest and most dainty comfits, jellies and
                  syllabubs were continually tempting the fickle appetite of the young southerner;
                  all of which, as Mrs. Orne assured him, were prepared through the kindness and
                  skill of Winifred. It surely would have been very ungrateful in Cleveland not to
                  have been happy in his present situation, where his comfort alone
                  seemed to form the sole anxiety of his hospitable friends.
               And all this time he had never once seen Winnie! although she was ever occupied in
                  preparing those very delicacies for his comfort, (as the reader has probably
                  surmised,) for which her beautiful cousin received such full and ample credit. Nor
                  yet was Cleveland in love with Winifred; an omission on his part for which he
                  himself could not refrain from surprise; for when, like some beauteous sylph, she
                  first appeared before his entranced vision, he had placed himself in Cupid's
                  calendar, for several days at least, as "fathoms deep in love." But these first
                  impressions soon passed away. That she was beautiful he could but acknowledge, and
                  very kind also he believed; yet there was something more than beauty required to
                  touch such a heart as his, and he very soon discovered that this was all the claim
                  which she possessed to his admiration.
               It happened one afternoon that Cleveland strolled forth for a solitary ramble in
                  the adjoining woods. For some time he sauntered leisurely along, absorbed in the
                  quiet beauty of the scene, listening to the divine melody of nature uplifted from
                  every blade of grass, from every flower, and swelling in delicious cadence through
                  the forest trees, when his ears were suddenly saluted by one of the sweetest
                  voices he thought he had ever heard, reading aloud with the most graceful and
                  correct intonation. Softly advancing in the direction from which the voice
                  proceeded, and cautiously putting aside the branches of a large sycamore, who
                  should he behold but our wild, thoughtless Winnie! Yes, seated like a little dove
                  amid the tall brake, and nodding star-flowers, partially reclining against the
                  mossy trunk of an aged tree, was Winnie! her golden hair unfettered by comb or
                  ribbon, sporting with the soft wind among the wild flowers and fragrant herbage; a
                  volume of Shakspeare in her hand, and at her feet a little wicker basket lay
                  upset, from which, as if glad to make their escape, rolled forth the rich, ripe
                  blackberries, hiding themselves under the mushrooms and broad-leaved clover, as if
                  for a fairy banquet; or rolling merrily down the flowery bank, swam off triumphant
                  on the bright dancing waters of the little brook. No doubt Winnie had been sent in
                  a hurry to gather those very berries for supper; and was this
                  despatch!—careless girl, sitting under a tree, and, like a young Siddons of
                  nature's own teaching, declaiming from Shakspeare!
               She had just finished Portia's eloquent appeal to the Jew, when a golden oriole
                  perched himself upon the topmost bough, of the very tree that concealed Cleveland;
                  and, as if he felt himself called upon to contribute his share for the general
                  entertainment, plumed his little wings, smoothed his downy breast with his bright
                     bill, and after a low trill of the
                  sweetest notes, gushed forth into a strain of the most enchanting harmony. No
                  sooner had the last note fainted on the balmy breeze, than Winnie, throwing back
                  her head, and lifting those great eyes to the giddy perch of the oriole, echoed
                  every note, every thrill of his beautiful song, with a truth and melody almost
                  startling. Master Oriole seemed not in the least offended at this liberty, but
                  hopping back and forth a moment on one leg, nodded his bright crest to Winnie, as
                  if to say, "Try it again, will you?" and once more, his little
                  breast, swelling with pride, poured forth his delicious notes.
               But now, other notes, less "linked in dying sweetness," were added to
                  this agreeable concert.
               "Winnie, Winnie!" screamed a shrill voice, and Mrs. Orne herself appeared upon the
                  scene.
               Did not Winnie spring to her feet? and did not she hasten to raise the careless
                  basket, and recover the truant blackberries?
               "What have you been doing, I should like to know?" said Mrs. Orne; "here it is
                  almost sun-down, and you are wasting your time like this, when you have those
                  rice-cakes to prepare for Mr. Cleveland's supper."
               "Indeed, aunt, I am very sorry," answered Winnie, "I had no idea it was so late.
                  But I have every thing ready for the biscuits, and Mr. Cleveland shall have them
                  in time."
               "What is this—a book! Oh-ho, this is the way you spend your time, is it, Miss
                  Winifred?" and snatching it from her hand, Mrs. Orne tossed it into the brook,
                  saying:
               "There, I wish I could drown all the hateful play-writers in the same manner."
               Winnie looked long and wistfully at her treasure, as it floated over the
                  glistening white pebbles and mossy boulders, then, with a heavy sigh, turned and
                  followed her aunt along the shady path leading directly to the house.
               Wrapped in amaze, had Cleveland witnessed the foregoing scene. He had listened,
                  entranced, to the fine reading—watched the animated countenance of Winnie, and
                  felt every nerve thrill with delight at her bird-like notes of surpassing mimicry;
                  and, then, like some ugly screech-owl, the voice of Mrs. Orne had dissolved the
                  charm. He heard her address the unknown girl, not only as a menial, but as an
                  inmate of her house and kitchen, while she, in return, had called Mrs. Orne
                     "Aunt." What could this mean? He had seen the vehemence with which
                  the book had been thrown into the stream; and it was the recollection of this
                  which first recalled him to himself. Hastening to the brink of the little brook,
                  he soon succeeded in recovering this (doubtless) priceless treasure of the young
                  girl; and, wet as it was, he could not refrain from pressing it to his lips; then
                  carefully wiping it with his handkerchief, he placed it in his bosom, determined
                  if possible to solve the mystery, and restore the book to its rightful owner.
               Curiously did Cleveland pry in at the back windows and doors, as he returned to
                  the house, and with an air of great abstraction did he take his seat at the
                  neatly-spread supper-table. But there were those promised rice-biscuits, whiter
                  than snow, and there those identical blackberries, sprinkled over with fine
                  powdered sugar! For some
                  reason they were the sweetest and the best, both biscuit and berries, he had ever
                  tasted, nor could he refrain from descanting upon their merits with true epicurean
                  fluency.
               "Yes," said Mrs. Orne, looking at her lovely niece, "our dear Winifred excels in
                  making these little niceties."
               "And these berries," continued Cleveland, fixing his eyes upon Winifred, "is it
                  possible you ever scramble among hedges and briars, at the risk of
                  wounding those delicate fingers?"
               "As you see," interrupted Mrs. Orne, pointing to the dish, "she considers the risk
                  as only adding to the pleasure of catering for the tastes of her friends."
               Cleveland made no answer—a peculiar expression passed over his countenance, and
                  then, as if determined to probe their falsehood to the utmost, he said, taking the
                  Shakespeare from his breast:
               "By the way, my dear madam, the nymphs and naiads of your groves and streams, must
                  be more than usually intellectual; for, see what some of these elfin sprites left
                  floating on the silvered surface of their fountain home. I found it near to a
                  beautiful water-lily, probably the canopied throne of some naiad queen; who,
                  summoning her beauteous elves around her, had just been charming their ears with
                  the history of Titania and her 'gentle changeling.' "
               For a moment Mrs. Orne lost her self-possession—but it was only for a moment—then
                  turning to Winifred, she shook her finger at her playfully, saying:
               "Ah, ha, little book-worm, you are caught! Now, of what, or whom were you
                  thinking, that you should thus have abused poor Shakspeare—sending him adrift
                  among the lilies and water-cresses?"
               Cleveland turned quickly, to witness the effect of this speech upon the party
                  addressed.
               Perfectly calm, and without the least pertubation, she replied:
               "Why, my dear aunt, I suppose I must have dropped the book into the stream,
                  unconsciously, in my musings; although, as to whom my abstraction was
                  owing, I must retain as my own secret." And here a gentle sigh, and a glance upon
                  Cleveland, at once solved the riddle.
               "Then you—you like Shakspeare; and you—you have—been reading in the woods to-day?"
                  stammered Cleveland, as if, in reality, he was the guilty one.
               "Oh, I dote on Shakspeare!" cried Winifred, "and always take his delightful muse
                  with me in my solitary rambles; I have been thus indulging to-day. I am so glad
                  you have found the precious volume! I feared, through my carelessness, I had
                  irrecoverably lost it!" And here she reached forth her snowy hand for the
                  book.
               "Permit me to retain it," said Cleveland; "after this conversation, it is of
                  peculiar value in my eyes!"
               Winifred blushed, and after a few pretty little coquetries, suffered her lover (as
                  she now felt assured he was) to replace the volume next his heart.
               It is a copy-book maxim, but yet not the less true, that "Patience and
                     perseverance overcometh all things;" and, therefore, by patience and
                  perseverance, Cleveland, at length, formed an acquaintance with the poor, despised
                  Winnie!
               And now, was it not really ridiculous, that the elegant Cleveland, the rich Southerner, the accomplished
                  man of talent and education, should have steeled his heart against the charms of
                  the beautiful heiress, only to fall in love with such a girl as Winnie? passing by
                  the magnificent bird of paradise, as it were, to take to his bosom the humble
                  little brown thrush!
               Nor did he conceal from Mrs. Orne and Winifred, his admiration (although he spoke
                  of no warmer sentiment) for their lowly relative; but their sordid minds, could
                  not, for a moment, imagine that one so poor could be more than as a passing shadow
                  in his thoughts. Health again revisited the frame of the young Southerner;
                  sparkled in his eye, and glowed upon his cheek; and it was with regret that, as
                  the autumn advanced, he prepared to leave the quiet village for the bustling
                  scenes of New Orleans.
               The morning of his departure, he found himself for a moment alone with the
                  unsuspecting object of his affection. Taking her hand, he said:
               "I shall write you, dearest Winnie, immediately upon my arrival at New Orleans,
                  and make known to you all my hopes and projects; then, if, as I trust, I am not
                  indifferent to you, by the blessing of God, I will soon return and claim you as my
                  bride. Do not forget me, dear Winnie!"
               Winnie made no answer, but timidly raised those eyes, now positively beautiful,
                  swimming in tears to his. He read their language aright. For one moment, he held
                  her to his heart; the next, she had vanished, and Cleveland turned to receive the
                  farewell of Mrs. Orne and Winifred; upon which affecting occasion, the latter
                  chose to resort several times to her smelling-bottle to sustain her fainting
                  frame.
               How frail the promises, the oaths of man!
               Poor Winnie! Weeks and months rolled away, each succeeding the other in melancholy
                  tediousness: but no letter, no message ever came from him who had won the treasure
                  of her young heart's pure affection. Too guileless herself to suspect guile in
                  others, she ever pardoned and exculpated his negligence. There were a thousand
                  unforeseen circumstances, she was aware, which might have prevented the speedy
                  fulfillment of his promises. She should yet hear from him!
               What then must have been her feelings when Mrs. Orne one day informed her that her
                  perjured lover, the faithless Cleveland, had months since made proposals of
                  marriage to her cousin Winifred—that they were accepted—and that the preparations
                  for so happy and desirable a union must commence immediately. And what a show of
                  triumph flashed from the eye of the haughty heiress, as she glanced upon the
                  pallid features of her cousin; and what importance stood forth starched and stiff
                  in the folds of Mrs. Orne's turban, and in the shining gold spectacles, as she
                  made the announcement!
               And how did Winnie bear it—do you ask?
               Why bravely—and like a sensible girl as she was! True—her step became less
                  fleet—and that happy expression which had ever beamed on her features, seemed
                  somewhat subdued. The rescued Shakspeare was laid aside, and all the birds of the
                  forest might have warbled on un-imitated by her once sportive voice—yet was she
                  ever cheerful—ever ready and willing to assist in preparing the costly trousseau of the happy bride elect. She it was who made the rich loaves of
                  wedding-cake—her pure taste which suggested the ornaments for the same; and not
                  until all the arrangements for the wedding were perfected, even to the placing of
                  the chair for the officiating clergyman, did Winnie with faltering voice, in the
                  dusky twilight, make known her one only request—viz: that she might absent herself
                  from the festive scenes. This being exactly what her aunt and cousin most desired,
                  she received a ready permission to do as she pleased.
               Bright rose the sun the morning the bridegroom was expected to arrive—like fairy
                  jewels wrought by moonlight, the dew-drops hung glittering on leaflet and
                  flower—bright, glancing butterflies shared with the golden-dusted honey-bee the
                  sweet nectar from the heart of the rose, and the lily's cup—and the birds gaily
                  rustled among the branches, sending forth from their leafy bowers their
                  heart-cheering notes.
               At length a carriage passed rapidly down the street, and drew up at the door of
                  Mrs. Orne; while from it, elate with love and happiness, young Cleveland sprang
                  eagerly forth. With bridal favors most becomingly arranged, and her new lace cap
                  phalanxed by triple rows of white satin bows, Mrs. Orne met him at the door with
                  open arms, and in the most affectionate terms bade him welcome.
               "My dear aunt,(for so I may now call you,) this is indeed kind," exclaimed
                  Cleveland—"I almost feared the result of my application. But where is my sweet
                  Winifred?"
               There was a visible perturbation in Mrs. Orne's manner, as she replied:
               "She was so much overcome by your arrival, that she was obliged to retire for a
                  few moments—she is all sensitiveness, dear child! but I will hasten and send the
                  little trembler to you."
               Mrs. Orne now left the room, and in a few moments, rustling in white satin and
                  blonde, (for the ceremony was to be consummated almost immediately,) Winifred
                  tripped blushingly into the room.
               "My dear cousin," cried Cleveland, advancing to meet her and raising her little
                  hand to his lips, "and you, then, are the first to greet me! Thank you, thank you,
                  but where, where is our dear Winnie?"
               "Winnie! Winnie!" replied Winifred, turning even paler than the pearls which
                  clasped her beautiful throat, "I really don't know."
               At this moment Mrs. Orne returned.
               "Ah, you are here, little coquette! but I will not disturb such halcyon
                  moments—only to beg of our dear Sydney to partake of some slight refreshment after
                  his ride; eating, however common-place, I believe is not yet banished
                  from the code of lovers."
               Winifred blushed and turned her eyes languishingly upon Cleveland, who, in evident
                  perplexity, looked from one to the other, and then again demanded:
               "Surely Winnie must know of my arrival! where shall I find her, Miss Orne?"
               "Indeed I know not that I am accountable for her freaks," replied Winifred, and
                  with a toss of her pretty head she left the room, followed in dignified silence by
                  her aunt.
               "What can this mean!" thought Cleveland, and after waiting a few moments, eagerly
                  listening to every step that approached the door, he strolled out into the
                     garden, but no Winnie made her
                  appearance, and continuing his walk he soon found himself near the wood where he
                  had first seen her. As if confident he should here find the object of his search,
                  he hastily advanced, and there indeed in the very spot where he had first beheld
                  her, pale and tearful, knelt Winnie! Her hands were clasped as if in prayer, and
                  with an emotion it were difficult to describe, Cleveland heard his own name
                  pronounced in the most tremulous accents; as if she was interceding for his
                  happiness.
               "Winnie, dearest Winnie," he cried, rushing to her, and clasping her to his
                  bosom—"what means this—why are you so sad?"
               "Mr. Cleveland, sir, let me go, I beg of you," answered Winnie, trembling in every
                  limb, "why do you insult me?"
               "Insult you, dear Winnie! what mystery is here! are you not my own,
                  my promised bride! then why these tears? why shun me thus? do you repent of your
                  engagement?"
               "This is more than cruel," cried Winnie, bursting from him, her face glowing with
                  indignation—"such language from you—from you, in a few
                  moments to become the husband of another, is too contemptible."
               "The husband of another! do I hear aright! for God's sake, Winnie,
                  dearest Winnie, explain your words!" exclaimed Cleveland.
               And perhaps while we leave the perplexed Cleveland listening to the tremulous
                  words of our Winnie, we may as well solve this apparent mystery. We must do it
                  quickly, however—for already the eyes of Winnie are sparkling with love and
                  happiness, and her cheek glows like the rose, as reclining on the arm of Cleveland
                  he leads her to the house where the bridal guests are already assembling.
               That Cleveland had written to Winnie as he promised is true, and very well did
                  Mrs. Orne and Winifred know, as they took it from the hands of the postboy, for
                  whom this letter was intended! At first their rage and mortification prevented all
                  action—but growing more calm, these worthy relatives determined to destroy the
                  happiness of Winnie by a bold act, and build that of the deceitful Winifred upon
                  the ruins! And this too could be done with perfect safety for the present at
                  least; for although she knew the Winifred Orne thus addressed had no allusion to
                     her, she resolved to take the advantage of owning the same
                     name! And what if a storm did arise at the denouement! They flattered themselves the net would then be too
                  secure for their victim to escape, and that in spite of Cupid and justice, the
                  heiress would find herself at length Mrs. Sydney Cleveland.
               And thus the plot was woven. The most affectionate letters were returned to New
                  Orleans, both from Winifred and Mrs. Orne; and, perfectly unconscious of the gross
                  deception passed upon him, Sydney Cleveland at the appointed time departed for the
                  North to claim his bride.
               How he was received the reader already knows.
               But the results!
               Why, that Mrs. Orne and the treacherous Winifred, even in the presence of the
                  gray-haired minister, and the assembled guests, were forced by the resolute and
                  indignant Cleveland to acknowledge the base part they had acted; and that then,
                  even as she leaned on his arm. in her
                  neat gingham dress and plain muslin cape, the holy man blessed and made them
                  one!
               The cake remained uncut, the guests departed—Mrs. Orne raved; and, buried in her
                  superb blonde vail, reckless of satin and jewels, Winifred had the pleasure of
                  performing several hysteric and fainting fits solely for her own amusement, while
                  far on their route to the city, Cleveland and his dear little bride were borne
                  happily along.
               And now everybody said, they always knew Winnie would be married
                  before that proud and haughty beauty!
               And everybody was right.
            
            
               THE WIDOW AND THE DEFORMED.
               
                  PART I.
                  MR. OAKLY was a rich man. Stately dwellings and noble warehouses were his; he
                     owned large and flourishing farms, and the sails of his ships whitened the
                     ocean. No man enjoyed a higher reputation on change; no merchant's opinion was
                     more quoted or depended on; no man's integrity considered more spotless. Blest,
                     too, with an excellent wife, the world pronounced Mr. Oakly a very happy man.
                     But where the mere surface of things forms the criterion of judgment, the
                     world, wise as it is, is very apt to be mistaken. Mr. Oakly was
                        not a happy man. Neither was he a favorite with the multitude;
                     and had not the magic of riches surrounded him, he would have had fewer
                     professed friends, and many more open enemies—for his manners were arrogant and
                     repulsive, while his deeds of charity were but as a feather in the scale with
                     his power of being charitable.
                  Mr. Oakley had paid a great price for his riches—no less a jewel than his own
                     peace of mind. He might count over his heaps of gold, and talk about the just
                     reward of long years of industry and economy, and try to cheat even himself
                     into the belief that his prosperity was but his deserts, yet well he knew that
                     the foundation of his fortune was based on crime. Flatter himself, then, as he
                     would, the whispers of conscience told him louder than the jingling of coin
                     that it was mockery all! His only
                     child, too, was miserably deformed and lame; thus it proved, with all his great
                     wealth, he was neither an enviable or a happy man.
                  Mr. Oakly, with his family, were spending the warm months at his delightful
                     country-residence on the banks of the Susquehanna; and there our story takes us
                     on a sultry August morning. Breakfast is just over, and now, while Mr. Oakly
                     breaks the seals of various letters which the postman has just brought to the
                     door, Mrs. Oakly listlessly looks over the city journals.
                  "So John is dead at last!" exclaimed Mr. Oakly, with something of relief in his
                     tone, and throwing down upon the table a dirty-looking letter, with a huge
                     black seal. "Died a pauper! Well, I expected it, and so might he, when he
                     refused compliance with the wishes of his friends."
                  Mrs. Oakly looked up with some surprise.
                  "Of whom were you speaking, my dear—a relative of yours?" she inquired.
                  "Only my brother," replied her husband coolly.
                  "Your brother—and died a pauper! You amaze me! Pray how did it happen?"
                  "It happened, and justly, too, through his own folly and imprudence," cried the
                     cold-hearted man—for even had his brother been the basest of criminals, he was
                     his brother still. Death should have inspired some faint shadow of grief, if no
                     more.
                  "The fact is," continued Mr. Oakly, "John was too much favored in early life.
                     He was my father's idol, and, to my disadvantage, favor after favor was heaped
                     upon him. Although younger by several years than myself, he, was
                     sent to college, I was kept at home—he had choice of
                     a profession, I was forced to measure off tape and calico by the
                     yard. He became dissipated, was wounded in some rowdy frolic, fell in love
                     with, and married a girl of low family, who took care of him during his
                     illness. Such conduct highly exasperated my father, who vowed that unless he
                     would abandon this low connection forever, and return home, he not only would
                     disinherit him, but would never see him more. John refused the terms; the
                     consequences were as my father had said, who shortly after died. I was his only
                     heir, and, of course, as such, was bound to hold all my father's views sacred;
                     and as he never forgave my ungrateful brother, consequently, neither did
                     I."
                  So much for Mr. Oakly's version of his brother's history. We shall see, bye and
                     by, how far it may be depended upon.
                  "But were you not aware of your brother's destitute situation?" said Mrs.
                     Oakly, somewhat reproachfully.
                  "Why, not exactly—at least I—I did not know it for a fact. But,
                     what then—suppose I did; he chose his own path—what had I to do with it?"
                  Mrs. Oakly shook her head and sighed.
                  "Did your brother leave any family?"
                  "Yes, so it seems—for here comes a begging letter from some country scribe,
                     whereby it appears he has left a widow and two children—girls, too; but read it
                     yourself."
                  Mrs. Oakly took the letter.
                  "SIR,—Your brother, Mr. John Oakly, was buried yesterday at the expense of the
                     parish. Upon his deathbed he requested that notice should be forwarded you
                        of the event, and some assistance
                     solicited on behalf of his destitute family. He leaves a widow, in delicate
                     health, and two small children, both girls. As they are without any means of
                     support save the little which the mother can earn by labor, I trust this appeal
                     to your sympathy will not be in vain."
                  "Well, my dear," said Mrs. Oakly, looking inquiringly at her husband, as she
                     finished reading.
                  "Well!" echoed her husband, "what concern is it of mine if they do starve! It
                     was all owing to his connection with this same woman that his misfortunes fell
                     upon him; and now do you think I am going to encourage her arts by aiding her
                     in her justly deserved poverty—no, not I, Mrs. Oakly."
                  "Revoke that cruel sentence, I beseech you, Alfred," said his wife; "you surely
                     will not let this appeal to your sympathy pass without notice; do not, I
                     entreat you, let the poor little ones suffer for their parent's fault!"
                  "Really, Mrs. Oakly," cried her husband sarcastically, "really, I hope I may do
                     as I please with what is mine. Those who have no money of their own, and never
                     had a cent in their lives, may well cant upon charity."
                  There was evidently a bitter meaning couched under these words, for Mrs. Oakly
                     colored deeply, and tears filled her eyes, though she made no reply, but
                     throwing open the window upon the lawn, was about to step forth, when the nurse
                     entered the room, leading by the hand a poor deformed little girl apparently
                     about two years of age. The sight of his only and unfortunate child appeared to
                     awaken a new train of ideas in the mind o Mr. Oakly. For some moments he walked
                     the room in deep thought, now looking at the child, now at his wife, and then
                     again resuming his measured tread. At length motioning the nurse, with her
                     charge, to leave the room, he approached his wife, and in a much less arrogant
                     manner, said:
                  "My dear, a new idea has occurred to me, which, if I mistake not, may be
                     productive of much good, not only to ourselves, but also to those for whom your
                     sympathy appears so foolishly urgent. The more I consider of my purpose, the
                     better I think of it. My brother, it seems, has left two little girls—very
                     well. Now I propose taking the youngest of these children as our own—"
                  "This is indeed noble of you my dear husband!" exclaimed Mrs. Oakly.
                  "In lieu of our own poor Agatha," said Mr. Oakly.
                  Mrs. Oakly screamed, and clasping her hands, sat pale as marble, looking up
                     into the face of her husband.
                  "Nay, my dear," said he, taking her hand with some tenderness, "I dare say you
                     will feel very badly at first, but only consider the benefits which will arise
                     from the exchange. Agatha is a poor, unhappy object, and as long as she lives,
                     will be a sorrow and reproach to us. It will be very easy for me to induce this
                     woman, my brother's widow I mean, to yield up one of her own children to me,
                     upon the condition that if she will take all future charge of our poor Agatha,
                     her own shall be brought up in every tenderness and luxury. There is one
                     proviso, however, to which I shall require oath—that is, the transaction is to
                     remain forever secret—she is never to claim her own child, but on the contrary,
                     to acknowledge Agatha as hers."
                  
                  Mr. Oakly paused, but his wife made no reply. It seemed as if surprise and
                     grief had deprived her of speech.
                  "We can pursue our plan the better," he continued, "as we have always kept
                     Agatha secluded from observation. It will be very easy for us now to give out
                     word that she is under skillful treatment. By degrees we can report of her
                     wonderful improvement, until at the end of some months or even a year, we can
                     produce our adopted child in proof of our assertions."
                  "But why is it necessary to do this?" cried Mrs. Oakly, falteringly, "why not
                     keep our own poor unfortunate, and at the same time adopt one or both of your
                     brother's children? God knows, Alfred," she added earnestly, "I will be a
                     mother to them—I will cherish and love them; but, oh, not so tenderly as my own
                     poor Agatha!"
                  "Nonsense, nonsense!" interrupted Mr. Oakly, hastily, "don't you see how much
                     disgrace and trouble you will save yourself by my arrangement."
                  "Disgrace, Alfred! and from our innocent babe!"
                  "Hear me, if you please. You will have the double satisfaction of knowing that
                     she will be well provided for, and kindly treated, while at the same time she
                     can never trouble you by her agitating presence."
                  "And to such a woman as you have described your brother's wife to be, would you
                     confide so precious a trust?" said Mrs. Oakly, hoping this appeal might arrest
                     her husband's views.
                  "Why not? She may be well enough for our purpose; her kindness I can secure by
                     money. As to any refinement, or education, it will never be of much importance
                     to Agatha. She will never be called upon, it is likely, for any display of
                     accomplishments, poor thing—to eat, sleep, and read verses in the Bible, will
                     fill up the measure of her days better than any thing else."
                  This cutting and cruel remark aroused all the mother. Rising to her feet, she
                     said, slowly and emphatically,
                  "Alfred Oakly! can you speak thus lightly of your own flesh and blood! Now,
                     shame upon you! God has given us this unhappy child; she is our own to love and
                     protect. Were she the loveliest babe that ever fond mother circled to her
                     heart, I could not love her more. I might be proud of such an one; but
                        love—oh, I could not so deeply, so tenderly!"
                  "Well, there we differ, Mrs. Oakly; it is precisely because she is such a child
                     that I am anxious to be rid of her," replied the heartless father. "Understand
                     me, my dear, I wish no harm to poor Agatha; it is for her good, I assure you,
                     that the change should be made. What answer, then, have you to my plan?"
                  "That I will never consent to it," she replied, firmly.
                  "Very well—you will not. Then it must be done without your consent. I am fixed;
                     neither your refusal, or your tears, will avail any thing; so you may as well
                     make up your mind to yield, madam, without further argument." So saying, Mr.
                     Oakly turned coolly on his heel and left the room.
                  Now wo to the poor wife—for well did she know her husband's unfaltering
                     determination. If it was possible for a woman to be too amiable, Mrs. Oakly was
                     so; while her husband, far from appreciating such a character, ruled over her
                     like some petty despot. Her only hope now rested upon the belief that the widow
                     could never be induced to give up
                     one of her children for the unfortunate Agatha.
                  "O, would she were ten times more repulsive!—my poor child!" cried the unhappy
                     mother, "Ishould still love her, but she would shrink
                     from an object so unsightly."
                  
                  It was at the close of a chill, rainy day, near the middle of September, that a
                     handsome traveling-carriage drew up at the door of a small inn, in a retired
                     country town. Such an occurence was rare; and no sooner, therefore, was it seen
                     entering the long street of straggling houses, than it was followed by a noisy
                     set of barefooted urchins, yelping dogs, and idle loungers, so that by the time
                     it reached the inn, a motley assemblage was formed around it.
                  As the carriage stopped, the glass was let down; a thin, sallow face looked
                     sharply forth, and a voice not the most gentle, demanded,
                  "Here, some of you—can you tell me where one Widow Oakly lives?"
                  The landlord, who by this time had reached the scene of wonder, imperatively
                     thrust aside all other aspirants to the honor of answering the stranger, and
                     himself began.
                  "The Widow Oakly—ah, yes. The Widow Oakly you said, sir?"
                  "To be sure I did. I ask you to direct me to her residence."
                  "Certainly, sir. Well, you see the widow lives in that small house yonder, on
                     the bank of the creek—that is, she has a room there; an honest little woman,
                     but poor—very poor!"
                  "Drive on!" cried the gentleman, sternly, without deigning further notice of
                     the loquacious landlord.
                  The driver cracked his whip, and the spirited horses obeying the impulse,
                     dashed through the crowd at the imminent risk of trampling some of the throng
                     under their feet.
                  "There, I told you," cried the landlord, "there was something uncommon about
                     them Oaklys, poor as they are; and now you see what a grand coach comes after
                     them. Run down there, Jimmy, my boy, and find out what it means."
                  And not only Jimmy, but a dozen others set off on full trot in the rear of the
                     carriage.
                  In the meantime the object of so much curiosity had reached the house pointed
                     out as the residence of the widow; and carefully mincing his steps across the
                     muddy pathway, Mr. Oakly rapped loudly at the door with his gold-headed cane,
                     for knocker there was none. After several repetitions of the same, each more
                     vehement than the last, the door was finally opened by a middle-aged woman,
                     whose red face, and scowling brows told she was in no very pleasant frame of
                     mind. Around her head was tied an old black handkerchief, through which, in
                     several places, her grizzly hair shot up like "quills upon the fretted
                     porcupine."She was slip-shod, and stockingless—her dress drabbled and torn.
                  "Well," she exclaimed, not at all daunted at sight either of the carriage or
                     its owner, "what's all this rumpus—what do you want, that you knock a body's
                     house down about their ears?"
                  
                  "Is there a Mrs. Oakly lives here?" inquired the gentleman, involuntarily
                     retreating a step or two.
                  "Well, if there is—what do you want?" said the woman, surlily.
                  "That is my business," answered Mr. Oakly, looking daggers. "If there is such a
                     woman here I must speak with her."
                  "Then go round to the other door, and knock that down too," replied the woman.
                        "Eh, maybe you are one of her husband's relations. I've heard
                     tell he had powerful rich ones."
                  Mr. Oakly turned away without deigning reply to this half interrogatory.
                  "Eh, she continued, her voice becoming shriller and shriller, "and
                     a plaguy proud set you are, I'll be bound. You can ride in your coach, can you,
                     and let your brother, as maybe he was, die on straw. Ho-oo-t!" she
                     shrieked, her face inflamed with anger, as she found her taunts unnoticed,
                        "ho-oo-t away with you off my door-steps—did you ever hear of
                     Dives and Lazarus? Your gold wont keep your back from scorching,
                     old Dives. Faith I should like to have the basting of you myself!" Saying which
                     she boxed the ears of the nearest unlucky wight who stood grinning with the
                     rest at her eloquence, and then giving him a shake, which nearly sent his head
                     off, she slammed the door, and retreated.
                  Her last words were inaudible to the person they were intended for. Glad to
                     escape from such a virago, he had hastily bent his steps around to the back
                     entrance of the domicil. Here he knocked several times, but as no answer was
                     given, he ventured at length to lift the latch, and enter.
                  It was a low, dark room in which he found himself, little better than a cellar.
                     I fancy it would have been impossible even for those who dwell upon the charms
                     and romance of poverty, and who, with well-fed stomachs, in slippered ease, on
                     Turkey carpets, descant so eloquently upon this theme, to have found aught
                     charming here. The floor was broken and uneven; two low windows, which could
                     only boast of three whole panes between them, the rest being patched with
                     paper, or their places supplied by rags, through which the rain had forced its
                     way, and now trickled in long streams across the floor. There were two chairs,
                     a low bedstead, miserably furnished, a pine table, and some few articles of
                     crockery and cooking utensils of the poorest kind.
                  Upon an old quilt, thrown down upon the floor in one corner of the room, two
                     little children, entwined in each other's arms, were sleeping. At this sight
                     the knees of Mr. Oakly trembled, his teeth chattered, and for a moment he
                     leaned for support against the wall—for a voice seemed whispering in his ear,
                        "Look, wretch! thy brother's children—this is thy work!"
                  And perhaps it will be as well here as elsewhere, here in the scene of that
                     brother's death, to relate the events which led to so sad an end.
                  In Mr. Alfred Oakly's summary of his brother's life, there was some truth, but
                     not the whole truth. John was the favorite of his father; for
                     beside that his mind was of a much higher order than his brother's, his
                     disposition and deportment were also far more amiable and respectful. Mr. Oakly
                     preferred not sending both his sons to college, so he very wisely resolved it
                     should be the younger, as one whose talents would most honor the expense. This excited the envy and jealousy of
                     Alfred, and from that moment he resolved to work his brother's undoing. It
                     happened that at the same college—and in the same class with John Oakly, was a
                     wild, dissipated fellow of the same name, who was continually getting into
                     disgrace. Accident furnished Alfred with this clue, which he determined should
                     lead to his desired wishes. By degrees whispers of misconduct began to reach
                     the father's ears. Then came letters to corroborate these rumors, filling the
                     heart of Mr. Oakly with sorrow. Letters, too, were continually being received,
                     demanding money, which, if forwarded, it is unnecessary to say never reached
                     its destination. Mr. Alfred took good care of that; for, of course, the letters
                     his father received, purporting to be from his brother, originated in his own
                     wicked mind, while those actually penned by John, as also his father's, were
                     suppressed by the same crafty power.
                  When Alfred first originated this scheme, it is probable he had no idea its
                     success would result in so much misery; his desire was as much to be revenged
                     on his father, for his partiality to his brother, as upon his brother for being
                     the object of that partiality; but when once he had entangled himself in the
                     meshes of deceit, he could not break through without sure detection of his
                     wickedness. The father and son met but once after the latter went to college.
                     He was then received with coldness and reproaches. Conscious of his innocence,
                     John was too proud to make any explanations, and left his father's roof in
                     bitterness. Soon after Mr. Oakly went abroad, as wretched as his son, leaving
                     Alfred in sole charge of his business. The constitution of John was never
                     strong; and no doubt the unmerited treatment of his father hastened the work of
                     disease. He commenced the practice of the law, but in pleading his first cause,
                     unfortunately ruptured a blood-vessel, and was borne from the court-room to his
                     lodgings in apparently a dying state. Through the kindness and careful nursing
                     of the lady with whom he boarded, he at length partially recovered; or it may
                     be that the beauty and gentleness of Louisa, her only daughter, contributed
                     somewhat to his restoration. Certain it is, a mutual affection sprang up
                     between them, and, though in no situation to marry, the death of her mother a
                     few months after, by which Louisa was left alone and destitute in the world,
                     brought the event about.
                  And now love and poverty were henceforth to bear them company on their
                     life-journey—for a final blow was put to any expectation which John might have
                     indulged secretly of a reconciliation with his father, through the machinations
                     of his brother. It seems the other John Oakly had, in the meanwhile, absconded
                     with a girl of low character. Of this fact Alfred availed himself, and
                     communicated the same to his credulous father, who immediately wrote to his
                     youngest son, that unless he renounced at once, and forever, the disgraceful
                     connection, he would disinherit him. This letter, as referring to his darling
                     Louisa, the most amiable and lovely of wives, filled John with indignation and
                     anger. He answered the letter in terms which nothing but his feelings as a
                        husband could excuse—and the rupture was complete. Mr. Oakly
                     soon after returned home in miserable health, and died, cutting off John
                     entirely in his will, and leaving the whole of his property to Alfred. This event the latter communicated
                     to his brother, generously enclosing a fifty dollar note, with the
                     assurance that as his father had died so incensed against him, out of respect
                     to that father's memory he must decline all further intercourse with him.
                  When sickness and poverty meet, the path of life's pilgrimage is hard. Too
                     unwell to practice his profession, John attempted writing, but this at best was
                     precarious, beside that the exertion again brought on pain in the side, and
                     difficulty of breathing. He had fine talents, and had health permitted, no
                     doubt might have succeeded as a writer. Sometimes he would dictate, and his
                     faithful Louisa commit his ideas to paper; but this could not continue. New and
                     precious cares were added, which required all her time, so that this resource
                     was abandoned. He soon grew so feeble as to be unable to leave his room. A kind
                     physician recommended country-air, and through his assistance the unfortunate
                     couple, with their two little ones, were enabled to reach a small country town.
                     Here living would be cheaper, and hope whispered to Louisa that by industry and
                     economy, she might support comfortably her dear husband and little ones. Poor
                     girl! on offering herself as a seamstress, the good people looked at her with
                     surprise—they did all their own sewing. She offered to teach painting or music,
                     at very low rates; but they laughed at her, and wondered what she thought they
                     wanted of such foolish fashions. At last she was thankful, for her children's
                     sake, to be employed even in the most menial offices, if thereby she might get
                     them bread. Once did John Oakly address a letter to his brother, in which he
                     stated his ill-health and destitution. It was never answered. Again, on his
                     death-bed, did he give to the clergyman who attended his last moments his
                     brother's address, requesting him to write when he should be no more, and crave
                     that assistance for his babes, which, while he lived, was refused to
                        him.
                  
                  The result of this appeal is already known.
                  The unfortunate widow met with little sympathy from her rough neighbors. Not
                     that they meant unkindness or uncharitableness, but each one was too busy with
                     their own affairs to give more than a chance thought to a poor widow and a
                     stranger. They were themselves industrious and frugal; and it was difficult for
                     her even to get a day's work from such economical, thrifty people.
                  And hither now had the rich man come—and on what errand? Not to sympathize—not
                     to succor or relieve, but to prosecute his own selfish views, both cruel and
                     unnatural.
                  But to return. We left Mr. Alfred Oakly gazing upon his brother's sleeping
                     babes. The opening of a door aroused him; he turned, and the wan countenance of
                     the widow met his view. She did not look to be more than three-and-twenty. She
                     was tall, and her figure slender and delicate, but her small feet were bare,
                     her garments coarse. On her sunken cheeks there was no trace of color, and the
                     lines of suffering too plainly drawn around her beautiful mouth. Her dark eyes
                     were large, but their brilliancy dimmed by tears of sorrow, and her long, raven
                     hair—that splendid hair that had once been the admiration of all—was now combed
                     carelessly back from her high brow, and concealed by a plain muslin cap. The
                     man of the world was abashed, and the widow the first to break the silence.
                  
                  "I presume I speak to Mr. Alfred Oakly," she said.
                  The gentleman bowed, but had his life depended upon utterance, he could not
                     have spoken. Their mother's voice, though low, at once aroused the sleeping
                     innocents, and springing from their hard couch, they bounded to meet her. At
                     sight of a stranger, however, the youngest, not two years old, hid her face in
                     the folds of her mother's dress, but the elder looked up inquiringly into his
                     face, and then raising herself on her little toes, and putting back her sunny
                     ringlets, said, "Me will tiss you."
                  Mr. Oakly did stoop to those little rosy lips, and even lifted the
                     little creature for a moment in his arms; but that was all—he placed her on the
                     floor again, as cold, as unimpassioned as ever.
                  This little scene overcame the fortitude of the mother; folding both little
                     ones to her bosom, she burst into tears, and for many moments wept bitterly.
                     This gave Mr. Oakly time to recover himself. He would fain have believed the
                     tears of the widow called forth more for effect than for real grief; but there
                     was something too lofty and pure in her pale countenance to encourage such base
                     thoughts. At length feeling himself bound to say something by way of
                     consolation, in a husky, faltering voice, he began. The words "we must all
                     die—sorry—death—unfortunate—in heaven—" being alone intelligible.
                  As if indignant with herself for having given way to her feelings in the
                     presence of one so heartless, Mrs. Oakly instantly dried her tears, and with
                     something of scorn on her features, listened to this lip-language—for well she
                     knew the heart had little to do with it.
                  "I have come here," he continued, "as the near relative of your late husband,
                     to remove you from this miserable spot. You must leave this place, madam; it is
                     entirely too poor and wretched for you."
                  "Wretched and poor as it is, on that bed your brother died!" said
                     the widow, pointing as she spoke to the low, miserable bedstead.
                  Mr. Oakly was evidently put down. After a moment's silence he added,
                  "It is my intention, as my brother's widow, to treat you with every
                     kindness."
                  "Your kindness, sir, comes late," replied Mrs. Oakly, "and will prove but
                     thankless. He whom it should have rescued from the grave, is now beyond your
                     cruelty; and to me, therefore, your kindness, as you term it, is
                     little else than cruel."
                  The brow of Mr. Oakly contracted with anger, but the object he had in view was
                     too important to be thwarted by a woman's reproaches; so, dissembling his
                     mortification, he continued.
                  "I wish you to remove from here at once to a pleasant town which I shall name
                     to you; and it is also my desire and intention to adopt your youngest child as
                     my own."
                  "Separate me from my children! No, that you shall never do!" cried the widow,
                     pressing them to her bosom.
                  "Do not be so hasty in your decision, my dear madam," said Mr. Oakly, blandly,
                     "but listen to me with reason. This child shall be most tenderly and carefully
                     brought up. My wife will love her as her own; and her education shall be the
                     best which the city can give. You yourself shall not only live in comfort,
                        but also have ample means to
                     educate your other daughter as you could wish. Nay, more; I do not ask you to
                     give me your daughter without an equivalent. Now," continued he, drawing his
                     chair still closer to Mrs. Oakly, and taking her hand, "I want you to listen to
                     me—neither do I wish you to give me an answer to-night; you shall have time to
                     reflect upon my proposition, and to consider well the immense benefit which
                     will result to yourself from conceding to my wishes, or, in case of refusal,
                     the poverty and wretchedness which will still surround you and these poor
                     babes, aggravated, perhaps, by the thought that you might have spared their
                     tender frames, but would not."
                  The countenance of the widow flushed with indignation; she spoke not, however,
                     but turning her full dark eye upon him, prepared to hear what further this man
                     had to say.
                  "It has pleased the Almighty," he continued, "to give me one child, now nearly
                     three years of age; but this child he has blasted with the most hopeless
                     deformity. You have two beautiful children—then give me one, and receive to
                     your maternal care my poor, blighted Agatha."
                  "And are you a father! and can you talk thus easily of severing
                     the holy bond of parent and child!" interrupted Mrs. Oakly. "Have you not a
                     wife—is there no mother to be consulted in your most unnatural
                     scheme!"
                  "Yes—an unhappy mother; but she has already consented. Aware that in perfect
                     retirement her poor child can alone know happiness, she is willing to yield her
                     up to your gentle treatment, and will in return bestow her love and tenderness
                     upon your own babe. Reflect, you will still have one lovely child to console
                     you, while the future welfare of both your children will be secured by the
                     sacrifice; furthermore, there will be the heartfelt pleasure of knowing that
                     through your watchful care an unfortunate being is made happy."
                  "Do you know aught of the pleasures of duty, that you talk so
                     feelingly?" said the widow, scornfully.
                  "Nay, reproach me not thus; look at your two children, those little beings
                     confided to your care—can you see their little frames wasted by hunger, or
                     sinking through toil; or, should you die, what then is there for them but a
                     cold and bitter lot of poverty and death—or maybe a fate worse than death. You
                     shudder; then why hesitate, when by simply yielding to my wishes you are all
                     made comfortable and happy. I see you are moved. I have but one stipulation to
                     make, should you consent, as I think you will; it may alarm you at first, but
                     upon reflection you will see its propriety. It is this—you are to promise
                     solemnly never to claim your child, but to acknowledge poor Agatha to be
                        yours, and never, on any account or any emergency, divulge this
                     important secret. Do not answer me," said he, hastily, as he saw the widow was
                     about to speak; "take time to consider my views—I will call at an early hour in
                     the morning for your reply. Good night!" Then kissing the half-frightened
                     children, the plausible brother of poor John Oakly softly closed the door, and
                     once more entering his carriage, returned to the inn.
                  It is difficult to conceive the pain and agitation with which this interview
                     filled the breast of the poor widow. Doubts distracted her; and decision either
                     way filled her with dread. One moment she resolved to spurn the offered ransom from poverty, the next, as her
                     eyes dwelt on her helpless little ones, doomed by such decision to years of
                     toil and want, she wavered, and almost consented to part forever with her
                     darling Louisa, if by the sacrifice their comfort might be secured. Then her
                     mind wandered to the poor, cast-off Agatha, whom, perhaps, cruelty and
                     harshness might destroy. She had well divined the father's selfishness, and
                     should she refuse the charge, he might entrust her to other hands less
                     faithful—for already she felt her heart warm toward the unfortunate.
                  Unconscious of their mother's distress, the children had once more fallen
                     asleep. Softly removing the little arm of the youngest from her neck, she
                     carefully placed them on her humble bed, and then kneeling down beside them,
                     she prayed that strength and resolution might be given her that she might
                     decide justly and wisely. Mournfully the wind sighed around that dismal
                     dwelling; the rain beat against the shattered windows—but she heard it not,
                     knew it not. Through that long, long night, without lamp or food, unto the
                     dawning of another dismal day, the widow remained on her knees by the bed-side
                     of her beloved children. Years seemed added unto her by the sufferings of that
                     night.
                  Her decision was made—made with an anguish which mocks at consolation.
                  Blame her not, fond mother, as, surrounded by all the comforts of life, you
                     fondly circle your own dear babes to your bosom, and think no power but death
                     can separate you from them. Blame her not, that in poverty and destitution, in
                     forlornness and widowhood, to save her poor infants from a lot so wretched, she
                     at length with grief too deep for tears, decided to yield up forever to
                        another, her youngest born—her darling Louisa.
                  
                  To a pleasant seaport town, many miles distant from the scene of the preceding
                     chapter, and still further removed from the residence of Mr. Oakly, our story
                     now takes us. We must allow, too, for a flight of years, which shall be as
                     noiseless as those circling so swiftly around the head of the young and
                     happy.
                  With the exception of one long street, consisting mostly of mechanics' shops, a
                     few stores, a ropewalk, and a tavern, the dwellings, clustered here and there
                     in a most picturesque and delightful manner. The land rising rather abruptly a
                     few rods from the shore, and slightly undulating, gave to each little cottage a
                     distinct and pretty appearance, each with its little garden-plot of
                     bright-green vegetables and brilliant flowers, some half-hidden behind the huge
                     brown trunks of forest-trees, others mantled with the vine or honey-suckle. To
                     the south and west, the horizon rested upon the bosom of the majestic ocean;
                     northward towered hill on hill until the blue sky kissed their dark summits;
                     while to the east stretched a beautiful vista of finely cultivated fields, and
                     glowing orchards, with the spires of distant villages proclaiming—God
                        above all!
                  
                  It was the hour of noon, on a bright June day. A band of happy, sportive
                     children were just let loose from school, and with whoop and huzza, with
                     careless laugh, and merry song, away bounded the gay young things, happy that
                     the four brick walls of A B C-dom were behind them, yet now and then glancing
                     back with a look of fondness to their school-mistress, as she slowly crossed the play-ground to her own
                     residence. In the path before her gayly frolicked a beautiful girl of perhaps
                     ten summers, the very embodiment of health and innocence, skipping, dancing
                     onward, light as any fairy, or with sunny smiles bounding back with a flower
                     and a kiss for the child her mother was so tenderly assisting. This poor little
                     creature was not only very lame, but was terribly hunchbacked, and otherwise
                     deformed. Although really older than little Ruth Oakly, (for in the
                     school-mistress the reader finds the widow,) she was not taller than most
                     children at five. One little hand was clasped in her mother's, (she knew no
                     other mother,) who, with the most tender care, guarded her steps, now and then,
                     as the eyes of the child were lifted to hers, stooping down to kiss her, and
                     encouraging her in the most endearing terms. The other hand held a wreath of
                     flowers, which she had woven for her dear sister Ruth.
                  As they entered the gate opening upon the nicely graveled walk leading up to
                     the cottage-door, Ruth ran and brought a little arm-chair on rollers, softly
                     cushioned, and placed it on the grass beneath the shadow of a large apple-tree,
                     whose pendant branches, nestling down amid the sweet clover, thus formed a
                     beautiful bower for the children's sports.
                  "There, Gatty," cried Ruth, flinging herself down at her feet among the clover,
                     "now let's play the story you were reading this morning. You shall be queen,
                     and I will be the little girl that was never happy; would it be wrong, Gatty,
                     to play you were never happy—would it be telling a lie; for you
                     know, Gatty, dear, I am very, very happy—are n't you?
                  "Yes—very happy," said Agatha, thoughtfully, "but, Ruth, I cannot be queen, you
                     know—how I should look! No, you must be queen; and see, I have made this pretty
                     wreath on purpose for you. I will be the ugly old fairy, and ma'ma shall be
                     Leoline, that was never happy—for, Ruthy, do you know I think dear ma'ma is
                     sometimes very miserable. I wonder what makes her cry so; for every night when
                     she kneels down by our bedside I can feel the hot tears on my cheek as she
                     kisses me."
                  "Ah! and so can I—poor ma'ma!" said Ruth, and both children remained sad and
                     thoughtful, the arm of Ruth thrown across the lap of her sister, whose little
                     hand, still clasping the wreath, rested on Ruth's shoulder. At length Agatha
                     spoke, but her voice was low and broken.
                  "Ruth," said she, "maybe ma'ma weeps for me, because—because—I am not more like
                        you"
                  "How like me?" said the little girl, raising her eyes to the sad face bent over
                     her.
                  "Why you know, Ruth, you are so straight and so pretty, and can walk so nicely,
                     while I—I—"
                  "You are a thousand times better than me, dear Gatty," cried Ruth, springing up
                     and throwing both arms around her weeping sister—for it was almost the first
                     time she had ever heard Agatha allude to her deformity; "indeed you are a great
                     deal prettier and better. Oh! how many times I have heard dear ma'ma say she
                     wished I was as good as you."
                  "Ruth," said Agatha, laying her hand on her sister's arm, and looking earnestly
                     in her face, "I am a frightful looking child, am I not?"
                  
                  "You, Agatha!" exclaimed little Ruth, "you
                     frightful!" O, no; don't everybody love you, Gatty, dear?"
                  "Everybody is very kind to me," said the child, unconsciously
                     making the distinction—"but then, Ruth, sometimes I hear people say, 'O,
                        what an ugly little thing!' 'Did you ever see such a fright?' and
                     then sometimes the children call me a spider, and say I have arms
                     like an ape, and cry, 'Hunch-Bunch, what's in your
                        pack?'"
                  "O, stop, dear Agatha!" said Ruth, tenderly kissing her, "don't talk so—pray
                     don't! it is only rude stranger children that say so; it is because they don't
                     know what a sweet, dear child you are."
                  "I pray to God every night," continued Agatha, "to forgive them, for they don't
                     know what it is to be lame, deformed, and helpless; and I pray God to make
                        me good and amiable, too, that I may forgive
                     them."
                  "Don't cry, Gatty, dear," sobbed Ruth, and then both little heads sunk lovingly
                     together in a paroxysm of tears.
                  When Mrs. Oakly came to call the children to dinner, she was surprised to find
                     them both weeping and sobbing bitterly. There was never any concealment from
                     their mother; so Ruth, in a simple, earnest manner, related the conversation
                     between Agatha and herself. Mrs. Oakly was grieved to find the mind of her
                     hitherto happy child dwelling on a subject so hopelessly calamitous. Raising
                     the poor little girl in her arms, she fondly kissed her.
                  "My darling," said she, "is it not better to be good and lovely in your heart,
                     than to possess the most beautiful form, and yet be wicked, and have no love
                     for God and his commandments? My dear little girl, listen to me; it was the
                     will of the Almighty to strike you with lameness, and to render your frame less
                     pleasing to the sight than that of other children; but reflect how many
                     blessings he has also granted you. Suppose you were blind; suppose you could
                     never look upon the face of your dear little sister Ruth, or your ma'ma's;
                     could not see the beautiful flowers, nor the grass, nor yonder ocean, which you
                     now so much love to look upon, or the beautiful blue sky above you; or, Agatha,
                     what if you were deprived of speech and hearing. Ah! my child, do not sorrow
                     any more, for you see how good God has been; you must not let the speech of
                     thoughtless children thus disturb you—will you promise me, Agatha?"
                  "I will try, dearest ma'ma—I must not promise, for I may be wicked
                     again, and forget that God is so good," answered the child.
                  Mr. Alfred Oakly had so far fulfilled the promises he made the widow as to
                     remove her from the wretched spot where he had first sought an interview with
                     her to the home she now occupied. He had purchased the cottage, which was
                     pleasantly located, and presented her with the title deed. He had furnished it
                     neatly, adding also a piano, and a small collection of books, to the other
                     equipments. Half yearly she recived a stipulated amount of money, which, though
                     small, would, with economy, have been sufficient for her support, had she
                     chosen to avail herself of its uses. But this sum she considered sacred to
                     Agatha. In case of her own death, she saw how utterly hopeless and dependent
                     her situation would be, and she nobly resolved not to encroach upon it any more
                     than was absolutely necessary, for the first six months. She therefore exerted
                     all her energies to support herself
                     and the children, independent of this allowance. In this laudable endeavor she
                     found the piano one great resource. She gave lessons in music, also in drawing
                     and painting, and was engaged as teacher in the village school, in which
                     capacity she was much beloved and respected both by parents and children.
                  Thus years rolled on. Although she still grieved for her darling Louisa, and
                     wept in secret those tears of which none but a mother may know the
                     bitterness, still she was most fondly attached to the unfortunate little
                     Agatha, while the affection subsisting between Ruth and the poor deformed was
                     truly lovely to witness. There could not be a much greater contrast than in the
                     looks of these two children, although their dispositions were in perfect
                     harmony. Ruth possessed a rich olive complexion, with cheeks which might vie
                     with June roses, they were so bright and glowing; her eyes were black and
                     sparkling; and her raven hair closely cut to her beautifully rounded throat,
                     was parted on top of her finely formed head, and waved over each temple in one
                     rich, glossy curl. Her figure, tall for her age, was light and graceful. The
                     complexion of Agatha, on the contrary, was dazzlingly fair, save where dashed
                     by the small, violet veins; her large, deep-hazel eyes possessed that peculiar
                     brightness and intensity which usually designates those who suffer from like
                     causes; long ringlets of light-brown hair, fell around her almost to the ground
                     as if to hide within their beautiful redundance the misshapen form of their
                     little mistress. But it was the expression of her innocent face which called
                     forth the pity and kindness of every one; that look, so gentle, so confiding,
                     as if pleading with every one to love her though she knew how hard it would be
                     to take to their hearts a helpless deformed little object such as she was.
                  Incapable of joining in the sports of other children, Agatha devoted a great
                     portion of her time to reading, of which she was passionately fond; and
                     possessing a retentive memory, she was better informed, perhaps, at ten years
                     of age than most children at fourteen. She had a great taste for drawing and
                     for music; these Mrs. Oakly had assiduously cultivated, knowing what a source
                     of comfort and amusement they would afford her, and also contribute to draw her
                     from dwelling too much upon herself and her misfortunes, which would only tend
                     to sour and destroy her happiness.
                  From its proximity to the sea, and consequently advantages of sea-bathing, the
                     village in which Mrs. Oakly resided was, in the summer season, a frequent and
                     favorite resort for invalids.
                  There was a certain wealthy bachelor of the name of Sullivan, who, for two
                     successive seasons, had made this his place of residence. Every one granted his
                     claim to invalidism the first season, but when with robust frame, and fresh,
                     healthy countenance, he appeared the second, people shook their heads, and
                     talked of hypochondriacs. By and bye, it began to be whispered
                     about that Mr. Sullivan was often seen coming from the little cottage of the
                     Widow Oakly; and at last it was asserted that he was soon to bear off their
                     good school-mistress as his bride. This was all true. Mr. Sullivan was
                     talented, agreeable, good looking, and rich; one who, in his youthful days,
                     need not fear the frown of any damsel, and who now, in the prime of manhood,
                     might still have won the fairest. But the heart of the handsome bachelor seemed
                        invulnerable nerable, for nearly
                     forty years resisting all the charms of beauty. He came to the sea-shore to
                     restore his head, and lost his heart. 
                        
                           "When I said I should die a bachelor,
                           I did not think I should live to be married,"
                        
                      thought he, blushing like a school-girl at his ridiculous plight.
                  The acquaintance between Mr. Sullivan and Mrs. Oakly commenced by means of the
                     children. He one day met them on the beach as they were gathering shells, and
                     being always interested in children—a sure sign that his heart was good—he
                     stopped to speak with them. The beauty and vivacity of Ruth charmed him, while
                     her unfortunate little companion filled him with deep sympathy and pity. By and
                     bye he found himself thinking less of the children and more of the mother,
                     until in fact he made the astonishing discovery that he was in love.
                  Mrs. Oakly, now in her thirty-eighth year, had preserved her beauty through all
                     the troubles and vicissitudes of her life. There are some forms and faces we
                     see, upon which time appears unwilling to lay his withering hand—and Mrs. Oakly
                     was one of these. The rose yet lingered on her cheek; her eyes were still soft
                     and brilliant; her mouth had not lost its freshness, nor her teeth their pearly
                     hue, while the dark hair folded over her fine brow was as thick and glossy as
                     in the days of girlhood.
                  You may be sure the bachelor was not for any long delay in the matter—that
                     "Happy's the wooing that's not long a doing," was precisely his idea—so he made
                     proposals at once, and was accepted.
                  The evening previous to her marriage, Mrs. Oakly addressed a letter to Mr.
                     Alfred Oakly, informing him of the event, though she entered into no
                     particulars, not even giving the name of her intended husband. All the request
                     she made was, that he would continue to place the same amount of money which he
                     had previously forwarded to her, in some safe deposit, for the benefit of
                     Agatha; that should she survive those whose happiness it was now to do for her,
                     she might not be entirely thrown upon the cold charity of the world. Not one
                     word did she breathe of her yearning for her own precious Louisa; she felt he
                     would not understand her if she did, so she coldly bade him farewell.
                  The marriage was solemnized in the widow's own little parlor; after which, amid
                     the tears and blessings of the villagers, Mrs. Sullivan departed with her happy
                     husband for his beautiful residence near Lake George.
               
               
                  PART II.
                  WE will now return to Mr. Alfred Oakly, and learn how the world in the interim
                     has fared with him. Prosperity at the helm, his richly freighted vessels
                     careered over the wide ocean, no devastating fires destroyed his dwellings, no
                     whirlwinds uprooted his forests, no blight or mildew stole over his fields to
                     nip the golden harvest, and yet, with all this, there was many a beggar who
                     gleaned the refuse from his kitchen, who knew more of happiness than did this
                     cold, selfish man. In the first place his wife had never recovered from the shock to her affections in being
                     forced to yield up her unfortunate child—not only her health but her temper
                     suffered severely. Toward her husband in particular this change seemed pointed,
                     and as much as she had loved him previously her coldness was now proportionate.
                     Unhappily, too, for Louisa, the innocent cause of this rupture, it extended
                     itself even to her, and thus childhood, that rainbow-tinted period of life was
                     to her clouded and joyless. Her father, stern and morose, secluding her from
                     playmates of her own age—her mother seldom greeting her with a word of
                     affection or a smile of encouragement—her caresses met by both with coldness,
                     and all the winning graces of childhood frowned down with disfavor. Her
                     education, however, went on as though her frame were formed of iron. There was
                     a stiff governess, whose cold gray eye was ever on her, to watch that she did
                     not loll in sitting or stoop in walking—that her toes turned out and her elbows
                     turned in—that sheneither spoiled her mouth by laughing (little danger!) nor
                     her eyes by crying. Then came the music-master with commands for six hours
                     daily practice for those little fingers—and the dancing-master, saying
                        "Ma'amselle, you must be very gay—you cannot never learn de
                     dance ven you do look so vat you call fat-i-gued." Then came the
                     drawing-master, and the professor of languages; nor were these all to which her
                     mind was tasked, for besides, were those branches which her governess professed
                     to teach—her governess, Miss Pinchem, with whom in comparison Miss Blimber of
                     Blimber Hall would have shrunk into insignificance!
                  Poor little Louisa!
                  She would sometimes wonder if the little children she read of in the Bible had
                     to learn all such things to make them good—for Miss Pinchem was great on
                     goodness—always beginning and ending her exhortations with, "Now, Miss Louisa,
                     you must be good, and not raise eyes from your book"—"You must
                     play that tune with more scientific grace, Miss Louisa, or you will not be
                        good"—"You must turn out your toes if you want to be
                        good"—"You will never be good if you don't
                     pronounce better"—in short there was a great deal of goodness on Miss Pinchem's
                     wiry tongue, let people say what they would, and though Louisa wondered
                        what made Miss Pinchem good!"
                  No sooner had Mr. Oakly accomplished his object in ridding his sight of the
                     poor deformed, than he would fain have held himself excused from all obligation
                     to the widow—but he dared not act out his wishes, fearful in such case that she
                     would claim her own, and thus betray his disgraceful secret. When he received
                     Mrs. Oakly's letter informing him of her intended marriage, his apprehensions
                     were anew awakened. Could it be possible she would keep the secret from her
                     husband? Doubtless she would scorn the intimation that so unsightly a child as
                     Agatha was her own offspring, and thus to preserve her maternal pride forfeit
                     her word! O! a thorny pillow was that Mr. Oakly nightly pressed! How often in
                     his dreams did the pale corse of his injured brother rise up before him, and
                     ever in its fleshless arms it bore the shrunken form of Agatha! But as month
                     after month rolled on, swelling finally to years, and hearing nothing further
                     from the late Mrs. Oakly, he felt more at ease, so much so that he entirely
                     forgot her request relative to the
                     future advantage of his discarded child! an oversight very natural to such a
                     man!
                  Louisa reached her seventeenth year, and as the bud gave promise so proved the
                     flower, beautiful indeed and lovely. Mr. Oakly was really proud of this! He
                     mentally contrasted her light elegant figure with the probable
                     appearance of Agatha, and congratulated himself that he had not to bear about
                     the shame of acknowledging the latter! Still, he did not love
                     Louisa—strange that he almost hated her for possessing those very attributes of
                     loveliness for which he had preferred her above his own offspring!
                  When Louisa emerged from the seclusion of the school-room to the brilliant
                     circles of fashion, she was caressed, flattered, adored. Wealth and beauty
                     tripping hand in hand seldom fail to win favor, and brought a throng of
                     admirers to the feet of the heiress, who, however, did not seem easily moved;
                     and many were the suitors to her favor who met with a kind but firm refusal.
                     But, beware, Louisa, your affections will be held by your tyrant father just as
                     much enslaved as your person; and now, wo to you, should they centre where he
                     does not approve.
                  
                  Moonlight, golden, twinkling stars, fragrant zephyrs, sweet from the lip of the
                     lily, soft music from tinkling leaves, a murmur from the rippling river, and
                     through the winding shrubbery, slowly along the path tesselated by the
                     moonbeams, which glist through the leafy curtain, Louisa is straying—but not
                     alone. A youth is by her side, one whose arm her own encircles, who clasps her
                     willing hand in his; one whose whispers are of love, and to whom her own voice,
                     gentle and low, speaks of hope and happiness in return.
                  Ah! foolish, foolish Louisa! what are you thinking of? Only a poor painter—and
                        you in love! True, he has talent, worth, grace, refinement,
                        but—no money! And you, unfortunate youth, why did you love this
                     beautiful maiden. Know you not that man of heartlessness and pride, her father,
                     would gladly crush you to the earth for lifting your eyes heavenward to his
                     daughter; that he would sooner buy her winding-sheet than that she should don
                     her wedding-robe for thee! And yet, even now, closer and closer
                     are you both riveting the chain, drawing heart to heart, which no hand but
                     death can loose.
                  It was the second summer after Louisa's initiation into the gay world that the
                     Oakly family were once more assembled at Oak Villa, their annual resort during
                     the warm months of July and August. With no taste for reading, a mind not
                     attuned for meditation, and the querulousness of an ungraceful old
                     age gradually stealing upon him, Mr. Oakly found the time drag most wearily on
                     amid those quiet groves. In this extremity an idea suddenly flashed across his
                     brain, which he eagerly caught at, as it promised to relieve somewhat of that
                     tedious vacuum between those hours when such a man and happiness may alone be
                     said to look each other in the face: viz., the hour of meals—and this was to
                     summon an artist to the villa, for the purpose of decorating the walls of the
                     saloon with the portaits of its inmates. He had not thought of it before, but,
                     quite luckily, it now occurred to him that he already had the address of a
                     young artist in his pocket, for whom some friend of struggling genius had solicited
                     patronage. Now he could kill two birds with one stone, as it were, secure the
                     plaudits of the world by taking the artist by the hand in so flattering a
                     manner, and at the same time pull away the drag from the wheels of time. He
                     looked at the card—"Walter Evertson,"—and to Walter Evertson did he immediately
                     address a letter, requesting his presence at the villa.
                  He came—a fine, handsome youth of three-and-twenty, with an eye like an eagle,
                     and hair dark as a starless night—a dangerous companion, we must allow, for the
                     gentle Louisa. He was met with condescending affability made most apparent by
                     the master of the house, and by Mrs. Oakly, who seldom manifested much interest
                     in any thing, with cool indifference. No wonder, then, that he turned with a
                     thrill of pleasure tingling his heart-strings, to the gentle Louisa, whose
                     manners, at once so courteous and refined, offered so agreeable a contrast.
                  There are some, perhaps, whose hearts have never yet felt the power of love,
                     who rail about love at first sight as a theory too ridiculous to dwell upon—a
                     chimera only originating in the heads of romantic school-girls and beardless
                     shop-boys; very well, let them have it so; I only assert that both Louisa and
                     the artist, at that first interview, were favorably impressed; and that a brief
                     intercourse under the same roof cemented their young hearts with all the
                     strength of a first and truthful affection. Love (himself a sly artist) traced
                     each on the other's heart in fadeless tints. Sincere and unselfish was the love
                     which Walter Evertson had conceived for Louisa; a love which he intended to
                     bury within his own throbbing breast—for he dared not flatter himself that it
                     would be returned—she, the heiress of thousands—he, the poor, unfriended
                     artist. Vain resolve! It was the evening with which this chapter commences,
                     that, in an unguarded moment, he had revealed to her his love, and received the
                     blest assurance of her own in return. But their cup of joy was even then
                     embittered by the consciousness that her father, in his cold, selfish nature,
                     would tear their hearts asunder, even though he snapped their life-strings.
                  In the meantime the business which had brought him to the villa was being
                     accomplished. Mr. and Mrs. Oakly saw themselves to the life on canvas, and now
                     it only remained to consummate his work by portraying the features of Louisa.
                     Delightful, yet difficult task! Mrs. Oakly had so far aroused herself from her
                     usual lethargy, as to insist that the figure of Louisa herself should be but
                     secondary in the picture about to be executed. She was tired, she said, of
                     those stiff, prim figures on sombre-tinted ground, looking out from gilded
                     frames with eye-balls ever coldly glaring upon one, and would have a large
                     painting of rare design and skill—woods, fountains, birds, and flowers, to
                     relieve the form and face of Louisa from this dull sameness. Various were the
                     sketches brought forward for her approval; and whole days, which Evertson
                     wished might never end, were spent in vain endeavors to settle upon some one of
                     them for the purpose. Accident, however, at length furnished the desired
                        tableau—although it would be doing
                     injustice to Evertson to imply that he lacked talent or originality—fine as
                     were his sketches, they failed to
                     please Mrs. Oakly, because—she would not be pleased.
                  One morning Louisa strolled out alone, and unconsciously pursued her ramble
                     until she reached a beautiful meadow fringed with fine old trees, whose
                     branches bent down to meet their dark, leafy shadows in the bright waters of
                     the Susquehanna. Birds were singing merrily, butterflies sported their golden
                     wings, and the grasshopper chirped, blithely leaping through the tall grass.
                     Here and there, where the rays of the sun had not yet penetrated, were the
                     gossamers of elfin broidery—mantles dropped by fairies on their merry rounds in
                     the checkered moonlight beneath those old trees; there was a drop of bright
                     nectar, too, left in the cup of the wild-flower, and the large, red clover-tops
                     were sparkling with dew-gems. I cannot assert that Louisa saw all the beauties
                     of this fine morning; for, absorbed in pleasing thoughts upon which we will not
                     intrude, satisfied as we ought to be that the artist occupied a full share, she
                     seated herself beneath one of those shadowing trees, and resting her chin
                     within the palm of her little hand, most likely, I am sorry to say, heard
                     neither the warble of the birds, the cheerful chirping insect, or saw the
                     bright glancing river, with the little boat which was just then dancing over
                     its silver ripples.
                  The sound of voices approaching in the opposite direction suddenly broke in
                     upon her trance, and she then, for the first time reflected that she had passed
                     the boundaries of her father's land. The estate adjoining had lately been
                     purchased by a wealthy Englishman, it was said. For many weeks repairs had been
                     going on in the old mansion, which for several years had been tenantless less;
                     and the family were daily expected to arrive. That they had now done so was
                     Louisa's conclusion. The voices drew nearer; but, trusting to the thick foliage
                     for concealment, she remained perfectly still; when apparently within but a few
                     paces of her the party stopped.
                  "What a lovely view!" exclaimed a soft female voice. "I wish ma'ma had not
                     turned back, she would have been so delighted."
                  "It is truly fine," was the reply, in a masculine tone; "it is even more
                     beautiful than the view from the lawn we so much admired last evening; what if
                     you were to sketch it."
                  "If I had only brought my crayons, I would do so now. How lovely it is!"
                     answered the lady.
                  "If you have strength for it after your long walk," was the reply, "I will
                     return for your portfolio; here is a nice shady seat for you—I will soon be
                     back, but do not ramble away from this spot."
                  Louisa heard the retreating footsteps, and was about to make good her own, when
                     a beautiful Scotch air, very sweetly warbled, arrested her attention. The song
                     ceased abrubtly, giving place to a scream' so loud and shrill, as blanched the
                     cheek of Louisa with the hue of death. She sprang to her feet, and panting with
                     terror, emerged from her shelter into the open meadow just as the scream was
                     again repeated. She now almost breathlessly looked around to detect the cause
                     of alarm. In a moment she saw it all. A noble stag, having probably leaped the
                     park-palings, came bounding swiftly across the meadow directly toward the spot
                     where Louisa was now standing, no doubt with the intention of slaking his
                     thirst at the tempting stream. The terrors of Louisa were at once allayed; and she now hastened to
                     the spot whence the screams issued, to soothe, if possible, the fears of the
                     unknown.
                  Trembling with fright, and clinging to a tree for support, was a female,
                     dwarf-like in stature, and deformed in shape. Her countenance was deadly pale,
                     and her eye-balls, almost fixed with terror, were strained upon the animal, as
                     he came leaping onward. Ere Louisa could speak he had approached within a few
                     paces, and as if now first aware of their presence, he suddenly halted, arched
                     his beautiful, glossy neck, and bending his antlered head, stood at bay. Seeing
                     how utterly helpless was the poor unknown, Louisa sprung forward, and telling
                     her not to be alarmed, quickly placed herself before her; but the noble stag,
                     as if disdaining to war with women, after gazing upon them a few seconds with
                     his wild eyes, suddenly turned, and tossing his head proudly, trotted off in
                     another direction.
                  At that moment how rejoiced was Louisa to see her lover rapidly
                     approaching,—for the stranger had already fainted.
                  "Water! water!" she cried, "quick, or she will die!"
                  Without speaking, Evertson rushed to the river, and filling his hat with its
                     cooling waters, was in a second at her side.
                  "Poor girl! she will die with terror, I fear. What fine features, and what
                     beautiful hair!" said Louisa, as she swept back the long tresses from her neck
                     and brow, purer than alabaster.
                  In a few moments the object of their solicitude opened her eyes. She could not
                     speak, but pressing the hand of Louisa to her lips, pointed toward a mansion
                     just discernible through a dense shrubbery at some distance.
                  "Shall I bear you home?" inquired Evertson.
                  The stranger looked her thanks; and lifting her in his arms as tenderly as if
                     she were a babe, he proceeded with his almost lifeless burthen in the direction
                     pointed out.
                  Thus met, for the first time, the discarded Agatha and the innocent usurper of
                     her rights.
                  The fancy of Walter Evertson seized at once upon a scene so interesting as the
                     one he had just witnessed. No sooner did he part with Louisa at the door of the
                     saloon, than, hastening to his studio, he began sketching the outlines of his
                     truthful conceptions. Rapidly did he hasten on his own misery—blissfully
                     unconscious the while of the sad termination of his labors. Never had he
                     wrought so well and so rapidly—not a stroke but told. There was the beautiful
                     meadow, with its brave old trees, and the river gleaming through their
                     branches; the fine stag, his antlered front bent toward the two females; the
                     graceful form of Louisa standing beneath the old oak, shielding the terrified
                     stranger, one arm thrown around her, the other slightly raised as if motioning
                     the animal away. Love surely guided his hand; for, without a sitting, the
                     artist had transferred from his heart to the canvas the gentle features of
                     Louisa with an accuracy undisputable. Strikingly, too, had he delineated the
                     form and face of the deformed—her long, waving tresses—her pale countenance—her
                     large eyes fixed in terror upon the stag, and her small, misshapen figure.
                     Something, too, had he caught, even in that short interview, of the features of
                     Agatha. He could not, however,
                     proceed in his task until it had received the approbation of the master and
                     mistress of the mansion. He had purposely requested Louisa to be silent
                     respecting the morning's adventure, that he might, by surprise, obtain the
                     mastery over the whims of Mrs. Oakly, so hard to be gratified. They were now
                     respectfully invited to the picture-room, together with Louisa, to pass
                     judgment upon his (to him) beautiful sketch.
                  To depict the scene which followed the withdrawal of the curtain he had placed
                     before it would be impossible. Mrs. Oakly gave one look, and with a dreadful
                     shriek, exclaiming, "My child!" fell senseless to the floor. Mr.
                     Oakly, foaming with rage, his face livid and distorted, rushed upon the
                     astonished artist, and in a voice choked with passion, cried,
                  "Out of my house, villain! Ha! do you beard me thus! Who are you, that have
                     thus stolen my secret, and dare to show me that picture—dare to place that
                     hateful image before me? Out of my house, I say, ere I am tempted to commit a
                     worse crime!"
                  Astonished, bewildered, confounded, Evertson for a moment could not speak, nor
                     would the enraged man hear him when he did. In vain Louisa, while striving to
                     restore animation to her mother, interceded, explained, expostulated—alas! her
                     tears and agitation only betraying to her father a new source of anger. Seizing
                     her by the arm, and bidding her seek her chamber, he thrust her from the room,
                     and then turning once more to the artist, as he raised the still inanimate form
                     of his wife,
                  "I give you half an hour to make your arrangements for leaving my roof—beware
                     how you exceed that time; when you are ready, you will find the sum due you in
                     this cursed room—begone, sir!"
                  Without any attempt to see poor Louisa again, and trusting he might be able to
                     communicate with her in a few days, Walter Evertson left the villa.
                  When Mr. Oakly next entered the painting-room the money of the artist was still
                     there—but the fatal picture had disappeared.
                  
                  A few years after his marriage, Mr. Sullivan took his family to Europe, where
                     they remained until within a few months previous to the singular meeting of
                     Louisa and Agatha.
                  In a beautiful cottage on the borders of Loch Katrine, their lives had been one
                     uninterrupted scene of happiness—always excepting the yearning of a mother's
                     heart for her lost child. The education of Ruth and Agatha had formed their
                     chief care, and was such as a kind-hearted, intelligent man like Mr. Sullivan
                     was proud to give them, sparing neither money nor precept, and aided, too, by
                     the superior judgement and example of their excellent mother. Ruth had grown up
                     lovely and amiable, and at the time the family returned to America, was
                     affianced to a fine young Scotchman. Poor Agatha had become even more unsightly
                     in figure, yet retained all the simplicity and amiableness of her childhood.
                     Whatever may have been her own private feelings upon her unfortunate deformity,
                     it was rare, indeed, that she ever made allusion to it. When she did, it was
                     with meekness and resignation to her Maker's will; for early in life had Agatha
                     given herself to Him whose love is more precious than all earthly advantages.
                     She seldom mixed with society, yet
                     when she did, even strangers, after a slight acquaintance, thought no more of
                     her unshapeliness. The sweet expression of her countenance interested, her
                     intelligence charmed them.
                  When Mrs. Sullivan took possession of her new residence on the Susquehanna,
                     little did she dream how short the distance which separated her from her
                     youngest born; and when Agatha related the fright she had received during her
                     morning ramble, and spoke with such enthusiasm of the beautiful girl who had so
                     nobly come to her assistance, how little did she think whose arms
                     had encircled the trembling Agatha, whose voice it was had tried
                     to soothe her fears.
                  Mr. Sullivan avowed his determination of calling immediately upon their
                     neighbors to express his thanks to the fair maid, and the gallant young
                     gentleman who had so opportunely come to the assistance of dear Agatha, his pet
                     and favorite. He did so the next day, but he was too late—the house was
                     deserted.
                  Agatha evinced much regret at the circumstance.
                  "How sorry I am!" said she; "O, I do hope we may hereafter meet again; the
                     countenance of that charming girl haunts me like a dream—so lovely, and somehow
                     so familiar to me—a stranger, and yet not a stranger. Sometimes, ma'ma when you
                     look at me as you do now, I almost fancy her eyes are on me; and then again,
                     only for being a blonde, it appears to me she greatly resembled dear Ruth."
                  Mrs. Sullivan changed color, and evidently much agitated, she inquired of her
                     husband if he knew the name of their late neighbor.
                  "I do not," was his reply, "and our servants are as ignorant as ourselves. Ah!
                     here comes an honest lad with berries to sell—and a fine tempting load, too. I
                     will ask him while I purchase the fruit."
                  As the boy measured out the berries, Mr. Sullivan said,
                  "Well, my son, can you tell me who lives in the fine old stone house just at
                     the bend of the river?"
                  "Oakly, sir—Squire Oakly we call him here."
                  "Quick, quick, father, ma'ma is fainting!" screamed Ruth, springing to her
                     side.
                  For a moment all was alarm and confusion; but at length Mrs. Sullivan slowly
                     opening her eyes desired to be led to her chamber.
                  "I will lie down a few moments—I shall soon be better; it is nothing—nothing,"
                     she answered to their affectionate solicitude.
                  When alone, then did she give way to her joy. What happiness! her dear
                     Louisa—her long lost was found. She was good, too, and lovely; her kindness to
                     a stranger proved the former, and the assertions of the grateful Agatha the
                     latter. She might now hope by some fortunate chance to see her—they might now
                     meet. O, how could she keep down her throbbing heart; how would she be able to
                     refrain from clasping her to her bosom, and avowing herself her mother. When
                     she thought she had recovered sufficient composure, she again joined the
                     family; but it was almost as soon dissipated by the conversation which followed
                     her entrance into the sitting room.
                  "My dear," said Mr. Sullivan, "do you know these foolish girls are for making
                     out a relationship between themselves and our runaway neighbors—claiming a courtship, even if several degrees
                     removed, to the fair heroine of Agatha's story—can it be so, think you?"
                  "This Mr. Oakly may possibly have been some connection of their father's,"
                     faltered Mrs. Sullivan.
                  "Had papa no brothers?" said Agatha.
                  "Yes, one; but some unhappy family disagreement, however, prevented any
                     intercourse. They were as strangers to each other."
                  "What if this Mr. Oakly should prove our uncle. Had he any family, ma'ma?"
                     asked Ruth.
                  "I believe—one—one daughter," was the almost inaudible reply.
                  "Do not say any more," whispered Agatha to her sister, "don't you see how it
                     distresses ma'ma?"
                  Mr. Sullivan had observed the same thing, and the subject was dropped.
                  In a few days the papers announced among the list of passengers sailed for
                     Havre, the name of Mr. Alfred Oakly, lady and daughter.
                  
                  Another flight of years, and behold what changes in the fortunes of Mr. Oakly.
                     Adversity had at last seized its victim, gorging to the full its revenge for
                     those years when its existence had been but as a phantom to the wealthy
                     merchant; he now felt its iron clutches to be something more tangible than
                     shadows. The sea had swallowed his vessels; flames had greedily swept over his
                     warehouses; blight had devastated his fields; failures of firms he considered
                     as good as the bank—nay, even the bank itself failed; and in the short space of
                     one year, Mr. Oakly found himself stripped of all save a mere pittance, which,
                     with the most scrupulous economy, could hardly support his family. The
                     teachings of adversity upon the cold, selfish heart, are sometimes blessed with
                     happy fruits. And thus it proved with Mr. Oakly.
                  True, the change was not instantaneous; he lost not his property to-day, to
                     become a Christian, a philosopher tomorrow. But as a drop of water will in time
                     wear away the hardest rock, so, little by little, were the flinty feelings of
                     his heart softened and purified. The wicked and selfish deeds of his past life
                     arose up before him, each with its own accusing tongue. That fortune, for which
                     he had risked his soul, had crumbled away, but these stood out plain and
                     distinct, only to be effaced through the mercies of One whose most sacred
                     obligations he had violated.
                  Mrs. Oakly met this reverse of fortune humbly and uncomplainingly. Happily, she
                     was ignorant of the sin of her husband, in having, like a second Cain,
                     destroyed his brother. Yet she felt that for another crime—the disowning
                        of his own offspring—the punishment was just. Her own conscience,
                     too, reproached her for the unjust feelings in which she had indulged toward
                     the innocent Louisa; and now, almost for the first time in her life, she
                     treated her as a daughter.
                  Kind, gentle, affectionate Louisa! only that she saw her parents deprived of
                     many comforts which would have soothed their declining years, she would have
                     rejoiced in a change of fortune which had brought with it their love. In her
                     heart there was a secret sorrow which she might breathe to none—it was her love
                     for Walter Evertson. Never, since that fatal day, had she seen or heard again
                     from him; but that he was faithful, and would be faithful unto death, her
                     trusting heart assured her. When
                     ease and affluence surrounded her, this sudden separation from her lover, and
                     under such afflicting and inexplicable circumstances, had seemed to paralyze
                     her energies. Books, music, travel, all failed to excite more than mechanical
                     attention: but now, in the sorrows of her parents, she lost the selfishness of
                     her own, and strove in every way to comfort them.
                  What now had become of the once proud merchant. His name was no longer heard on
                     'change, unless coupled with a creditor's anathema; and summer friends, like
                     the sun on a rainy day, were behind the cloud.
                  
                  IT was a cold, cheerless day in December; one of those days when one hugs close
                     to the fire-side, and when even a glance at the dull sombrous out-of-door
                     atmosphere makes, or ought to make, one thankful for the blessings of a
                     pleasant fire, to say nothing of the society of a friend, or the solace of a
                     book. With all these comforts combined, the family of Mr. Sullivan had
                     assembled in the breakfast parlor. There was the grate, heaped to the topmost
                     bar of the polished steel, with glowing anthracite; the soft carpet of warm and
                     gorgeous hues; luxuriant plants of foreign climes, half hiding the cages of
                     various little songsters, whose merry notes breathed of springtime and shady
                     groves; and the face of grim winter shut out by rich, silken folds of crimson
                     drapery.
                  The pleasant morning meal was already passed, and the breakfast things removed,
                     with the exception of the beautiful coffee-set of Sevre's china, which Mrs.
                     Sullivan was so old-fashioned as to take charge of herself, in preference to
                     trusting it with servants. Seated at the head of the table, a snowy napkin in
                     her hand, she was now engaged in this domestic office. Mr. Sullivan and Mr.
                     Danvers (the husband of Ruth) had just gone into the study, to talk over some
                     business affairs. Ruth had taken the morning paper, and upon a low ottoman by
                     the side of her mother, was reading the news of the day—now to herself, or, as
                     she found a paragraph of peculiar interest, aloud for the general
                     entertainment. Agatha was reclining upon the sofa, and nestling by her side was
                     a beautiful boy of two years old, playing bo-peep through the long, sunny curls
                     of "Aunt Gatty," his merry little shouts, and infantile prattle, quite
                     overpowering ma'ma's news.
                  "Why what can this mean?" suddenly exclaimed Ruth; "do hear this ma'ma. 'If the
                     former widow of Mr. John Oakly (the name of her present husband unknown) be
                     still living, or the children of said John Oakly, they are requested to call at
                     No. 18 —— street, and inquire for A. O., or to forward a note to the same
                     address, stating where they may be found.' What can it mean, ma'ma?"
                  Without answering, Mrs. Sullivan rose from her chair; she trembled in every
                     limb, and her countenance was deadly pale.
                  "Ruth, dearest," said she, "ring the bell, and order the carriage immediately
                     to the door."
                  "Ma'ma, you surely will not go out alone," said Ruth.
                  "Yes, alone! do not disturb your father," answered Mrs. Sullivan; "alone must I
                     meet this trial. My dear girls," she continued, "ask me no questions. God knows
                     what I am about to learn, whether tidings of joy or sorrow; but I trust all may
                     be explained when I return."
                  In a few moments the carriage was at the door, and tenderly embracing Ruth and Agatha, she departed
                     upon her anxious errand.
                  After passing through so many streets that it seemed they must have nearly
                     cleared the city, the carriage turned into a narrow street, or rather lane, and
                     stopped at No. 18, a small two story wooden building. Mrs. Sullivan alighted
                     and rang the bell. The door was opened by a little servant-girl, to whom she
                     handed a card, on which she had written with a trembling hand, "A person wishes
                     to speak with A. O."
                  In a few moments the girl returned and ushered her up stairs into a small
                     parlor. Her fortitude now nearly forsook her, and it was with difficulty she
                     could support herself to a chair. As soon as she could command herself, she
                     looked around to see if she could detect aught which might speak to her of her
                     child. Upon the table on which she leaned were books. She took up one, and
                     turned to the title-page; in a pretty Italian hand was traced "Louisa Oakly."
                     Several beautiful drawings also attracted her eye—they, too, bore the name of
                     "Louisa Oakly." But before she had time to indulge in the blissful hopes this
                     caused her, the door opened, and Mr. Oakly, with an agitation nearly equal to
                     her own, entered the room.
                  Many years had flown since they met, and time on both had laid his withering
                     hand; but while Mrs. Sullivan presented all the beautiful traits of a peaceful,
                     happy decline into the vale of years, the countenance of Mr. Oakly was furrowed
                     and haggard with remorse, and all those evil passions which had formerly ruled
                     his reason. Quickly advancing, he extended his hand, and attempted to speak,
                     but emotion checked all utterance, while the big tears slowly rolled down his
                     cheek.
                  "O, speak—speak! tell me—Louisa!" cried Mrs. Sullivan, alarmed at his
                     agitation.
                  "Compose yourself," replied Mr. Oakly, "Louisa is well. I have sought this
                     interview, that I may make all the reparation now left me for my injustice and
                     cruelty. You see before you, madam, a miserable man, haunted by remorse, and
                     vain regrets for past misdeeds. From my once proud and lofty standing," he
                     continued, glancing around the apartment, "I am reduced to this. Yet think not
                     I repine for the loss of riches. No! were millions now at my command, I would
                     barter all for a clear, unaccusing conscience. Wealth, based on fraud, on
                     uncharitableness, must sooner or later come to ruin. I once despised poverty,
                     and cherished a haughty spirit toward those I arrogantly deemed my inferiors.
                     Have I not my reward?"
                  "But my child—tell me of my child!" interrupted Mrs. Sullivan, scarce heeding
                     his remarks, "where is she? May I not see her?"
                  "Bear with me a little while longer," said Mr. Oakly, "in half an hour she
                     shall be yours forever!"
                  "My God, I thank thee!" exclaimed Mrs. Sullivan, bursting into tears of
                     joy.
                  "Yes, I yield her to your arms," continued Mr. Oakly, "the loveliest daughter
                     that ever blessed a mother, and relieve you forever from the charge of an
                     unfortunate, to whom my conduct has been both brutal and unnatural. Listen to
                     me, madam, for a few moments."
                  He then as briefly as possible made confession of the base part he had acted
                     toward his brother, and the means
                     employed to ruin him with his father; the selfish motives which led to the
                     exchange of the children; related the incident of the picture, and consequent
                     removal from Oak Villa—for well did he divine who the deformed
                     was. He then spoke of Louisa; of her uniform loveliness of character, and the
                     gentleness with which she had borne, as he acknowledged, his oft repeated
                     unkindness.
                  "She knows all," said he in conclusion, "and waits even now to receive a
                     mother's embrace. I will send her to you, and may her tears and caresses plead
                     my for giveness!" so saying, Mr. Oakly quickly withdrew.
                  A moment—an age to Mrs. Sullivan—the door gently unclosed and mother and child
                     were folded in each other's arms.
                  There are feelings which no language can convey—and which to attempt to paint
                     would seem almost a sacrilege.
                  In a short time Mr. Oakly re-entered, accompanied by his wife. The meeting
                     between the mothers was painful—for each felt there was still another trial for
                     them! Mrs. Oakly now really loved Louisa, and that Mrs. Sullivan was most
                     fondly attached to poor Agatha the reader already knows.
                  "O she has been a solace and a comfort to me!" said she to Mrs. Oakly, "a more
                     noble-minded—a more unselfish, pure being never lived than our dear Agatha!
                     believe me, to part from her will cause a pang nearly as great as when I first
                     gave my darling Louisa to your arms!"
                  Another hour was spent in free communion, and then tenderly embracing her new
                     found daughter, the happy mother returned home—the events of the morning
                     seeming almost too blissful to be real!
                  It was sometime ere she could command herself sufficiently to the task before
                     her. At length summoning all her resolution she made known to her astonished
                     husband and Ruth the strange secret she had so long buried in her breast.
                  Mr. Sullivan undertook to break the intelligence to Agatha.
                  Poor Agatha was very much overcome, and for several hours her distress was such
                     as made them almost tremble for her reason. Although the circumstances were
                     related in the most guarded and delicate manner, nor even a hint given as to
                     the motives of an act so unnatural as her father had been guilty of toward
                     her—her sensitive mind too well divined the cause.
                  "Yet how can I blame them," said she, glancing in a mirror as she spoke, "who
                     could love such a being! Ah, forgive me," she cried, throwing her arms around
                     the neck of Mrs. Sullivan, who now joined them—"forgive
                        me—you—you received me—my best, my dearest, my
                     only mother—you took the little outcast to your
                        arms—you could love even the mis-shapen child whom others
                     loathed!"
                  Mrs. Sullivan strove by the most gentle caresses to soothe her agitation, and
                     at length succeeded so far that Agatha listened calmly to all she had to say,
                     and expressed her desire to be guided by her in everything relating to this (to
                     her) painful disclosure.
                  Almost in a fainting state was Agatha given to her mother's arms, and at sight
                     of her father she shuddered and buried her face in her hands.
                  
                  O the pang that went to the soul of her wretched father as he witnessed
                     this!
                  "Agatha, my child, will you not then look upon me! will you not
                     say you forgive me?"
                  She extended her hand wet with tears:
                  "Father, I have nothing to pardon. I am not now less hideous in form than when
                     to look upon me caused you shame and sorrow. In giving me to my dearest aunt
                     you gave me every blessing, every happiness, which this world has for me—but do
                     not, O do not now tear me from her?"
                  "O God! I am rightly punished!" exclaimed Mr. Oakly—"my own child in turn
                     disowns me!"
                  "Agatha," said Mrs. Oakly, "will you not love me—love your mother,
                     Agatha?"
                  Agatha hesitated, and her beautiful eyes streamed with tears—
                  "Mother! I can give that name to but one!—here here
                     is my mother!" turning and throwing her arms around the neck of
                     Mrs. Sullivan.
                  Not so was it with Louisa. Like a dove long panting for its rest, she had at
                     last reached that haven of love—a mother's heart!
                  Indeed so much distress did the thought of being separated from her more than
                     mother cause poor Agatha, that, fearful for her health, Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan
                     prevailed upon her parents to take up their residence with them for a few
                     months, to which request they finally acceded.
                  Soon after her first interview with Mr. Oakly, Mrs. Sullivan presented him with
                     a deed of the cottage, which so many years before he had given her, little
                     dreaming that any reverse of fortune would ever make him grateful
                     for so humble a shelter!
                  "The rent," said she, "has been regularly paid into the hands of a faithful
                     person, who also holds in trust the remittances which you from time to time
                     forwarded me. I placed them there for the benefit of Agatha, should she survive
                     me. It came from you originally—it is again your own—then hesitate not to
                     receive it from my hands."
                  "Excellent, noble woman!" exclaimed Mr. Oakly, overwhelmed with emotion, "how
                     little have I merited this kindness!"
                  Indeed, together with principal and interest, what at first was but a trifling
                     sum, had in the course of eighteen or twenty years amounted to quite a little
                     fortune. It was now settled that as soon as the Spring opened Mr. and Mrs.
                     Oakly were to take possession of the little cottage, and rather than be
                     separated from their dear Agatha, the Sullivans were soon to follow and take
                     lodgings for the summer months.
                  
                  "But, my dear madam," says the reader, "you have entirely forgotten to tell us
                     what became of the unfortunate artist, the lover of Louisa, whom you appear to
                     think happy enough in her present situation without a lover."
                  "O no, dear reader—but this is not a love-story, you know—if it were I would
                     tell you the particulars of a most interesting love scene between Walter
                     Evertson and his adored Louisa. Suffice it to say, they were married, and that
                     the picture which caused their unhappy separation occupies a conspicuous place
                     in their beautiful villa, a few miles from the city of P——.
               
            
            
               
               THE COUNTESS.
               A ROMANCE.
               "OH, the saints, what will become of us, my lady! All alone in this dismal old
                  Chateau, and two gay young officers billeted upon us.—O
                     ciel, what shall we do!" And it was piteous to see the distress with
                  which poor Lisette wrung her hands and rolled up a pair of sparkling black
                  eyes.
               With a look of surprise, the Countess raised hers from the embroidery on which
                  they were bent, and demanded:
               "What are you talking about, Lisette? Officers billeted upon us—what mean
                  you?"
               "Ah, my dear lady, you heard the drums this morning—mon
                     Dieu, a whole regiment has marched into the village, and every house,
                  even the good curé's, is filled with these
                  terrible soldiers, and then they cannot all find lodgings; and so the curé has
                  sent them to the Chateau—and, oh, my lady, you will be frightened to death, I know
                  you will, for there they are already below in the court, with their swords, and
                  pistols, and horrible moustaches, as if for all the world they had come here to
                  devour us!"
               "This is indeed embarrassing, my good girl. Send Jacques hither at once." And
                  rising from her embroidery frame, the Countess walked to the window which
                  commanded a view of the court-yard.
               Ah, no wonder the pretty young countess blushed like a damask rose, as she looked
                  down upon the two gay chevaliers thus forced upon her hospitality!—bold, dashing
                  soldiers—their splendid uniforms glittering with gold, and their long white plumes
                  floating on the breeze, as they paced to and fro the broad limits of the court! It
                  was, indeed, as she had averred, very embarrassing! For ever since the death of
                  the old count, her husband, she had remained like the beautiful princess in the
                  fairy tale, shut up in the chateau, seeing no one, save Father Ambrose, the curé,
                  and the faithful domestics who shared her solitude.
               "How is this, Jacques!" she cried, as the old man tottered in; "what is it Lisette
                  tells me—is our chateau, indeed, turned into a garrison? Methinks our good father
                  Ambrose has gone beyond the limits of forbearance, in sending hither such
                  guests!"
               "Ah, my dear mistress, pardon the good father!" answered Jacques, "he is half
                  bewildered—and, indeed, the whole village is turned topsy-turvy, by the marching
                  in of this regiment. Every house is filled, and some of the men, I am told, have
                  even to quarter in barns—les pauvres—boys are
                  shouting, women and children screaming, and then such a hubbub in the poultry
                  yards. Ah, my lady, no wonder the cure is beside himself!"
               "Jacques," said the Countess, "you must transfer these chevaliers elsewhere—alone,
                  as I am, it is impossible for me to receive guests of such a character under my
                  roof. Go, and look to it at once, my good Jacques."
               "But, alas, Madame, they already refuse to go! I begged of them to retire from the
                  chateau—I told them with tears in my eyes, that my lady, the Countess, was young and beautiful, and had not seen a
                  soul since the old count's death, now a twelvemonth, and——"
               "Jacques, Jacques," exclaimed the Countess, impatiently, "you surely were not so
                  absurd as to say this!"
               "Indeed, my lady, I did, for it is the truth; and I cautioned them to reflect how
                  very disagreeable their presence would be to you; and that, as you were a young
                  and charming widow, it would not be proper for them thus to intrude upon your
                  ladyship!"
               "Mon Dieu, Jacques, how could you be so
                  imprudent!" exclaimed the Countess, starting up, and pacing the room hurriedly.
                  Then, with something of a smile, already chasing away the frown, she added, "well,
                     mon ami, and what said they to such forcible
                  arguments?"
               "En verité, my lady; one would have thought I
                  had related some excellent jest, by the manner in which they laughed; thanking me
                  for the agreeable information I had given them, adding, that they certainly could
                  not think of tearing themselves away from the Chateau, after the many inducements
                  I had given them to stay. Then they handed me their cards, bidding me present them
                  to your ladyship, whom they doubted not, was as beautiful as an angel—"
               "Coxcombs!"
               "And with their most profound respects, to say, that, however they might regret
                  being thus forced to intrude themselves, their necessities must compel them to
                  demand the hospitality of the Chateau."
               "Cool, at any rate!" remarked the Countess, with a toss of her pretty head. "These
                  cards,—let us see who it is thus honors us. 'Louis Auguste, Francois Bellegarde,
                  Colonel &c. &c.' 'Eugene Montespan, Lieutenant ant &c. &c.'
                     Tres bien, Jacques, we must see to the
                  entertainment of these guests."
               The Countess mused for a moment; then a saucy smile dimpled her rosy little mouth,
                  and mischief sat in her large blue eye. "Jacques," she cried, turning suddenly to
                  her old servant, "Jacques, it would not become us to be inhospitable to the brave
                  soldiers of the Emperor."
               "Ah, vous avez raison,—Vive L'Empereur!" exclaimed Jacques. "Ah, I was once a soldier
                  myself,—yes, under the banner of——"
               "Never mind now, Jacques," interrupted the Countess. "Conduct these gallant
                  officers then to the east-wing of the chateau; be attentive to all their wants,
                  let Adolphe wait upon them, and bid him not fail in any mark of respect due such
                  distinguished guests. Let dinner be served in the great banqueting hall;
                  there—go,—and send Lisette to me."
               The old man hesitated, took a step toward the door, then returned, played with his
                  fingers, rubbed his eyebrows:
               "My honored lady—ahem—pardon an old man, but these are no doubt, wild young
                  scamps,—I—my lady—I was going to say,—grace à
                     Dieu—I think I know how to wait upon these gallants, and so if you
                  please, I will serve dinner, for my lady, the Countess, in her private
                  apartment."
               "Ah, my good Jacques," said the Countess smiling, "then you think I had better not
                  appear before these gay gallants?"
               "Pardon, my dear mistress, you are so young and charming."
               
               "Never fear, mon ami, only do as I bid you and
                  listen, Jacques, whatever I may say, or whatever you may see me do, show no
                  surprise. In an hour, I will in person, receive our guests."
               "But my lady,——"
               "Well, Jacques!"
               "My dear young mistress, let me entreat, you will not."
               "Ah, my good Jacques," cried the Countess, laughing, and playfully patting the old
                  man's cheek, "be easy, you shall see how soon these dashing chevaliers will fall
                  in love with your mistress! Now go, and send Lisette speedily."
               
               "Come here, Lisette,—now can you be secret?"
               Lisette bit her lips, as if to caution them of what they might expect, should they
                  be tempted to blab, and folding her arms tightly over her neat little boddice,
                  protested and vowed, she would be as secret as—as—
               "As most women, doubtless," answered her mistress. "But you must promise me, that
                  no consideration shall induce you to divulge the secret, with which I am about to
                  entrust you."
               "Ah, my dear lady, you may safely confide in me; I betray my dear mistress, I
                  prove unfaithful to your commands! The saints forbid! I will not tell even
                  Adolphe, no, not even if he should give me those red ribbons he promised to bring
                  me from the fair!"
               "Very well, Lisette, I think I may trust you, even against so tempting a bribe, as
                  a new top-knot," answered the Countess. "As for Adolphe, let me see; yes, Lisette
                  sette, I think we must positively let him into our secret. And now tell me,
                  Lisette, have you seen these officers?"
               Quite in a passion, apparently, did this question throw the little femme de chambre; her eyes grew rounder, and brighter,
                  and her cheeks redder, and redder, as she proceeded to relate how she had just met
                  them in the gallery, as she was walking along, and singing to herself, and not
                  thinking or caring, she was sure, about them; for if they did wear epaulettes on
                  their shoulders, and feathers in their caps, they were not half so handsome as
                  Adolphe, she could tell them. "And then one of them, my lady, swore I had d——sh
                  fine eyes, yes, indeed he did, my lady, and then squeezed my hand, in such a
                  fashion, that—ha! ha! ha! I warrant his cheeks tingle yet, with the
                  blow he got from it! And then, the other came up with a mighty sweet smile, and
                  asked me, if my lady, the Countess, was not the most beautiful creature in the
                  whole world,—and, may the saints in glory forgive me, my lady, I told him No,—that
                  you were old, and ugly, and——"
               "Bravo, Lisette! Well, and what said he?"
               "He only laughed, and chucking me under the chin, vowed I had spoken falsely, for
                  that if my mistress was old and ugly, he knew very well she would never employ so
                  pretty a maid. Ah! I wish the chateau was well rid of them; for, would you believe
                  it, this bold fellow then said," here Lisette came close to her young mistress,
                  and whispered,—"yes, said he would run away with you! Mon
                     Dieu! run away with my charming mistress!"
               Was her young lady bewitched, or why that merry peal of laughter! Instead of the
                  overwhelming indignation Lisette expected to witness, the Countess appeared to think the idea of being run away
                  with, a capital joke; clapping her little hands, and even embracing the bewildered
                     femme de chambre in her glee.
               "Eh bien! Lisette," said the Countess, at length
                  abating her mirth, "we must punish these gay gallants for their assurance. You
                  have unconsciously assisted my project. Now remember, you are to be very secret;
                  you are to do just as I tell you, and under all circumstances to appear perfectly
                  unconscious that any thing unusual is going on. Take courage, my poor Lisette; I
                  warrant these gay fellows will soon turn their backs upon the chateau. Now, come
                  with me to my chamber, and we will prepare to receive these cavaliers as they
                  deserve. Allons!"
               
               In another wing of the old chateau were our two officers, whose unlucky advent had
                  caused so much confusion. Hungry as wolves, for they had tasted nothing since
                  daybreak, they were impatiently awaiting a summons to the salle-à-manger.
               
               Silly little Lisette had no need to trouble her head about them! What if the
                  gallant Colonel did press her little brown hand, as plump as a young pigeon, or
                  chuck her dimpled chin; more did he care for the smack of a fine fat capon, than
                  for the rosiest lips in all France; and I'll warrant that the sight of a sparkling
                  wine cup would, at that moment, have filled him with more pleasure than a glance
                  from the brightest eyes he had ever pledged therein!
               "Will that infernal dinner bell never sound?" exclaimed Bellegarde, the gallant
                  Colonel, impatiently.
               You see, dear reader, the truth of my assertions.
               "Patience, patience, mon ami," interposed his
                  companion, who, it is but justice to affirm, was gazing with evident pleasure upon
                  the enchanting landscape spread out before him—not even the keen cravings of
                  appetite could blunt his appreciation of the beautiful in nature.
               "Ma foi! you may well preach of patience to a
                  man who has fed only upon sour bread and garlics for a month! Diable, Eugene, what has come over you? An hour since,
                  and you were as famished as myself, and now, with the air of a well-fed berger, you cry 'Patience!
                     patience!' Methinks you must find the air of this crumbling old pile
                  vastly invigorating!"
               Thus grumbled the Colonel—but the more he grumbled, the more cheerful became his
                  companion; it was thunder and sunshine at the same moment.
               "Come, come, Bellegarde!" exclaimed Montespan, "cease this railing, and tell me,
                  what think you of the very opposite portraits drawn of the mistress of these fair
                  domains which we have received from the lips of her attendants? Quoth the old
                  steward—'My lady is a charming young widow, and beautiful as an angel; begone,
                  therefore—you cannot enter here;' while, on the other hand, that little vixen of a
                     fille-de-chambre would make one believe her
                  mistress as old as my grandmother! What say you, Colonel?"
               "That I care not whether she be fair as Venus, or ugly as Hecate, so that her
                  viands be but tender, and her wine old," replied Bellegarde, drawing forth his
                  watch.
               "Incorrigible gourmand!" cried his friend; "have you then no curiosity to solve
                  this enigma—no desire to behold this wonderful woman, in whose person youth and
                  beauty, old age and ugliness are synonymous! Ha, ha, ha! ma foi! I
                  shall not soon forget the perplexed and anxious look with which that old fellow,
                  the steward, I suppose, entreated us to continue our march; the very arguments he
                  enforced defeating his own object; like a man in haste to arrive at his journey's
                  end, first laming the steed that is to bear him."
               "And I will lay you a wager," interrupted the other, his thoughts for a moment
                  soaring higher than his stomach, "that, after all, his picture is the right one.
                  Yes, yes, mon ami, we shall find our Countess
                  beautiful as an angel. Ma foi! well thought
                  of—eh, Eugene, am I presentable? The toilet of a soldier on march is but a rough
                  one for a lady's boudoir; tell me, shall I not shock the fair one by my bearish
                  appearance!"
               "N'importe," replied Montespan, laughing,
                  "attend to her ladyship's mutton, if you please, and——"
               "Leave the lamb to you, you would say; tres
                     bien! agreed; now, hark! grace à
                     Dieu! there sounds the dinner bell—allons! and here comes our crusty old friend to marshal us, I
                  suppose."
               Yes, it was Jacques at last, who bowing, conducted our two friends to the salle-à-manger.
               
               
               Jacques threw open the large folding doors leading from the lofty corridor into
                  the dining room. At the same moment, as if governed by the same impulse, two other
                  doors, directly opposite, silently flew back, and at the instant when the Colonel
                  and his friend stepped over the marble sill on one side, Lisette, assisted by her
                  lover Adolphe, appeared upon the other, wheeling in a small couch, covered with
                  black velvet, and over which was suspended a canopy of black lace, fringed with
                  gold.
               Beneath this canopy reclined an elderly lady, dressed in the deepest mourning
                  weeds. As her attendants wheeled the couch nearer the table, she bowed coldly to
                  her stranger guests, and motioned them to be seated, the one upon her right hand,
                  the other upon her left. Her hair, already silvery white, was parted smoothly on
                  her brow, brought far down over her temples, and confined by a close widow's cap
                  of plain white leno. Yet what added greatly to the singularity of her appearance
                  was an immense pair of green goggles—so huge, in fact, that they almost obscured
                  even her nose!
               "The little shrew was right; confound her black eyes, how they twinkle," thought
                  Bellegarde. "Ugly! she is a perfect ogress."
               "Peste! what stuff was the old man prating,
                  about his beautiful young mistress, the charming widow. Widow! ma foi! Yes, and likely to remain so; heavens, what a
                  fright!" soliloquized the Lieutenant at the same moment.
               "Gentlemen," said the unconscious object of such slanderous thoughts, "although we
                  have for many months eschewed all society, nor since the death of the master of
                  these domains have admitted other to our presence than the few faithful attendants
                  you see around you; we, nevertheless, bid you welcome to our chateau, and to such
                  poor fare as is in our power to place before you."
               Saying this with the most stately air, she motioned Jacques to fill the glasses of
                  her guests, and merely touching her lips to her own, gracefully bent her head in
                  token of the sincerity of her words.
               
               "Have we, then, the honor of addressing the Countess D'Argentine?" said the
                  gallant Colonel.
               The Countess bowed, but in so stately a manner as to check all further attempts at
                  conversation.
               Bellegarde, however, soon buried his chagrin in a fine venison pastry, and with
                  copious libations of her ladyship's excellent Bordeaux, washed down his
                  disappointment.
               Not so Montespan. All the delicacies in the world would now have failed to tempt
                  his appetite. Besides he felt embarrassed—ill at ease in the presence of this
                  singular Countess, who caused herself to be thus borne, like some effigy of
                  sorrow, hither and thither upon a funeral car. For as such seemed to him the
                  sombre equipage on which she reclined. How many thoughts flitted through his
                  brain!
               She was lame then—perhaps paralytic! And then those goggles—heavens, was she
                  nearly blind, too? Perhaps she had but one eye! perhaps she squinted! And drawing
                  a long breath, the poor Lieutenant looked another way. But, as if by some magical
                  influence his eyes again rested upon the Countess.
               Her complexion, what little her hair, and those horrible goggles left exposed, he
                  discovered must have been fine in youth, for it was still quite fair and smooth;
                  while her chin might serve for the model of all chins—it was really a love of a
                  chin, and either her teeth were in excellent preservation, or the dentist had
                  accomplished a chef d'œuvre, when he supplied
                  her ladyship's gums.
               He felt tempted to knock down old Jacques. Just as if it was his fault that his
                  mistress was so old and ugly; and as for Lisette, how he did long to shake her,
                  looking at him as she did with such saucy, knowing eyes. In fact, he was getting
                  quite savage, when suddenly the Countess, with another bend of her aristocratic
                  head, was borne from the presence of her guests.
               The heavy folding doors silently swung together, and they were left to their
                  wine—alone, save Jacques.
               "Pardieu!" cried the Colonel, seizing the old
                  man by the arm, "did you not tell me your mistress was young?"
               "Oui, Monsieur!"
               "And very beautiful?" quoth the Lieutenant.
               "Oui, Monsieur—my lady is young and beautiful;
                  for goodness like hers never grows old or decays."
               "Bravo! a sentence worthy of Fenelon; your health, old garçon."
               At this moment Adolphe entered with the compliments of the Countess d'Argentine,
                  and would be happy to see the gentlemen in the drawing room.
               "Peste?" whispered the Colonel, "I'd much prefer
                  the bottle; an agreeable time we shall have, ma
                     foi, with the old lady. I leave her to you, Eugene, and will make
                  love to that arch little coquette, the maid."
               
               The immense drawing room was blazing with light. There was, in fact, but one dark
                  spot—it was the little old Countess, still reclining upon that hearse-like
                  appendage, and half buried within the black velvet cushions. At her feet knelt
                  Lisette, with an enormous fan of peacock feathers, which she waved incessantly, as
                  though her mistress suffered from faintness. Nothing could be more recherché than the taste which marked the adornments
                  of this splendid apartment; no particular style, no particular date had here its portraiture, but
                  there was a grouping together of the rare and beautiful, most charming to the eye.
                  Here was music, too; a beautiful harp rested its golden frame against cushions of
                  azure velvet—a piano, its keys glittering in the mellow light of waxen tapers,
                  and, as if carelessly thrown by the same fairy hand that had swept its strings, a
                  guitar lay upon a small table within a little recess, over which curtains of
                  crimson velvet swept to the floor.
               "Ma foi!" whispered the Colonel, with a shrug of
                  his shoulders, as his eye took in this brilliant scene, and then glanced toward
                  the black mass in its centre. "The spot upon the sun! Ma
                     foi, our hostess well befits this temple of beauty! But, allons, let us lay our laurels at her shrine." Then
                  with something of a swaggering air, approaching the Countess, he attempted to pass
                  off a few witty compliments. Abashed and crest-fallen, he soon fell back, for an
                  empress could not have assumed more haughtiness than did that same old Countess
                  behind her horrible goggles!
               Montespan was not more fortunate in his advances, and turning away, sought for
                  amusement among the numerous gems of art which adorned the walls. Leaving all
                  others, his eye rested upon one picture alone.
               It was a portrait—the portrait of a charming young girl, but so life-like, so
                  fresh, so beaming with gladness, as she stood there, the very personation of
                  "heaven y'clep'd Euphrosyne," that our chevalier involuntarily opened his arms, as
                  if to catch the nymph in the airy descent she was about to risk. This charming
                  portrait represented a young girl tripping beneath a broken archway, as if in
                  playful chase of the little fawn skipping and leaping before her over the grass
                  grown ruins. A robe of pure white, confined at the slender waist by a scarf of
                  pale blue silk, floated with airy grace around her lovely form—save a narrow fall
                  of lace upon the shoulder, her fair, round arms were bare—one little hand
                  gathering her robe above the tiny foot, just poised upon a fragment of the ruins,
                  as if to spring therefrom—the other swept back from her beautiful brow the long,
                  golden tresses, wherein a few wild flowers were carelessly entwined. What could be
                  more graceful than her attitude—what more charming than her sweet, youthful face!
                  Ah! Montespan was very sure the world could not produce its equal!
               The Countess saw a great deal behind those goggles—yes, and she saw the start of
                  surprise which marked our chevalier's first view of the portrait, and she saw what
                  an impromptu pantomine was performing before that senseless canvass!
               A low, musical laugh broke the solemn silence!
               Could it have been that little, impudent fille de
                     chambre! Eugene turned round. The Colonel turned round. Well—the
                  Countess was as motionless as a statue, while Lisette, with a face half an ell
                  long, was sweeping the ponderous fan with the regularity of a Chinese puntah. It must have been a bird—yes, it is
                  astonishing how some birds will imitate the human voice, thought Eugene. And this
                  reminded the Colonel of music, so once more approaching the couch of the 'dark
                  ladye,' he ventured:
               "Your ladyship, I see, is a patroness of the goddess Melpomene—may I presume to
                  inquire, do you play?"
               "When I am in the mood for music," was the reply.
               
               Another silence—and again the brave Colonel hazarded a few remarks, which were met
                  with the same chilling reserve.
               "You have really some exquisite paintings, Madame," exclaimed Montespan; "pardon
                  my curiosity, but will you have the kindness to inform me whether that beautiful
                  picture which hangs opposite, is an original portrait, or some ideal sketch of the
                  artist—if so, like Prometheus, he must have worshiped the creation of his own
                  genius!"
               "Lisette, does the gentleman allude to the picture in the oaken panel?" asked the
                  Countess, without turning her haughty head.
               "Ah, oui, Madame."
               "It is an original, Monsieur," with a slight, very slight inclination of the
                  head.
               "Mon Dieu! how lovely! And, will Madame excuse
                  the liberty—this beautiful creature—she—she still l-i-ves?"
               Another slight bow was the only response. The Countess then blows a small silver
                  whistle—Adolphe glides in, and stations himself behind the sombre couch of his
                  lady. Lisette, with a coquetish air, throws down the fan, and stands by the side
                  of her lover. A slight effort—a gentle pressure—and slowly the strange equipage
                  moves forward—slowly—slowly, and with a formal "good evening, Messieurs," the
                  Countess D'Argentine disappears.
               
               "Ah, was there ever such a fright?" quoth the wicked little Countess, viewing
                  herself in the full length mirror. "What think you now, my good Lisette, are we in
                  danger of being run away with?"
               "Ah, but my dear lady—c'est dommage—you so
                  young—so charming! Ciel, that odious cap—that
                  horrid wig—ah, let me tear them to pieces!" cried Lisette, preparing to disrobe
                  her young mistress.
               "Carefully, carefully, ma bonne—remember we have
                  need of this same odious cap and wig again."
               "But these goggles—ah, mon dieu—suffer me to
                  break them."
               "Not at all, Lisette—these goggles, too, must do their duty."
               Lisette assented, with very bad grace, to her ladyship's whim, and while she
                  braided the long, fair hair of her mistress, and prepared her toilet for the
                  night, continued to chatter about the handsome chevaliers, and what a pity it was
                  after all, that they should think her beautiful lady was such a fright! While the
                  Countess, it must be owned, listened to the idle prating of her fille de chambre, with praiseworthy patience:
               "Lisette, he is very handsome—heigho!"
               "The Colonel, my lady?"
               "Oh, no—the Colonel—he is very stupid!"
               "It is Monsieur Montespan, my lady thinks is handsome."
               "Heigh-ho!"
               "Yes, my lady, he is very fine."
               "Such magnificent large eyes!"
               "Oui, Madame."
               "Such a splendid figure!"
               "Ah, yes."
               "And so graceful!"
               "So graceful, Madame!"
               
               "Lisette."
               "Madame."
               "No matter,—you may go." And resting her dimpled chin in the hollow of her little
                  hand, the thoughts of the Countess got entangled in such a maze, as—but no
                  matter,—we must not betray our little heroine,—so good night, charming
                  Countess.
               
               "Ha! ha! mon ami, what say you now, to running
                  off with our fair hostess!" cried the Colonel laughing, and slapping Montespan
                  upon the shoulder.
               "Why, as the lady does not seem to have the use of her limbs, I must give it up,
                  Colonel."
               "Good. But what a misfortune; had this widow been but young, and charming, we
                  might have crossed swords, for the possession of these fine domains."
               "But listen, Colonel,—that portrait, tell me, was there ever such an angel, such
                  beauty, such sweet innocence! Ah, mon ami, could
                  I but behold the heavenly original."
               "Charming,—and find her grandmother, perhaps."
               "Ah, impossible; who knows, my friend, perhaps this lovely being dwells within
                  these walls. O rapture! yes, it must be so, the harp, the guitar, the paintings,
                  the books, all proclaim her presence; I tell you there is some mystery here."
               "Yes, yes, you are right, Eugene. Some stepdaughter, perhaps, held in 'durance
                  vile,' through jealousy,—some dependent niece,—yes, yes, for only fancy the old
                  lady at the harp, or sweeping the guitar; ma
                     foi, the idea is too absurd. Allons, let us summon Jacques."
               "Ah, Jacques, come in, Jacques. Charming old lady, your mistress, you have lived
                  here, I suppose, at this old chateau,—fine place—beautiful scenery—I say, you have
                  lived here, I suppose, many years, good Jacques."
               "Yes, you may say that, Monsieur, six and sixty years man and boy, have I dwelt
                  within these old walls; and never, until the death of my honored master, the
                  Count, had I cause of sorrow."
               "But now, I suppose, it is different—the Countess has it all her own way, you
                  understand."
               "Non, Monsieur, I do not understand—but if your
                  honor means any thing disparaging to my beloved mistress, I—I am an old man, but
                     pardonnez-moi, I should feel constrained to
                  knock your honor down!"
               "Ha, ha; bravo—no, nothing at all disparaging, Jacques. She is an excellent
                  mistress."
               "Ah, Monsieur, she is the kindest, the loveliest, the sweetest young lady."
               "How—what—Jacques!—young—ha, ha, come, that
                  won't do!"
               "Pardon me, Monsieur, I have known my lady ever since she was a child, and I
                  forget——"
               "Yes, you forget that you have grown old together."
               "Did your master, the Count D'Argentine, leave any children?" said Montespan, for
                  the first time joining in the conversation.
               "Children—oh, no, Monsieur; why they were only married a few hours before my
                  honored master breathed his last!"
               "Then, whose portrait is that which hangs in the drawing room, good Jacques?"
               "That—why, that is the Countess herself."
               
               "Fi-donc! That is impossible; the colors are as
                  fresh and glowing as if painted yesterday, and it should be more than fifty years
                  old. No, no, good Jacques, you mistake."
               "Ah, your honor, just like that picture does my beloved lady look to me, even to
                  this day!"
               "Then, by all the saints in the calender, I wish I saw with your eyes! But the
                  harp, the piano, who plays?"
               "Why, my lady plays and sings like an angel; a-hem, I mean—that is—she did play
                  like an angel."
               "But her fingers are getting stiff—eh, Jacques?" added the Colonel, "no offence,
                  Jacques—thank you—thank you—good night."
               A week—how soon it passed even in that old chateau—and the little circle thus
                  strangely thrown together, became quite agreeable and confidently. The Colonel
                  sings 
                     
                        "Combien j'aime,
                        Hors moi-même,
                        Tout ici!"
                     
                   while he ogles Lisette, whose blushes and smiles, render poor Adolphe quite
                  beside himself with jealousy. He also hunts in the forest, and drinks wine with
                  his comrades below in the village, where all is mirth and jollity. Montespan, in
                  the mean time, cannot account for the strange interest which keeps him within the
                  chateau. He spends a great deal of time before that mysterious portrait. He feels
                  unaccountably attracted toward the old Countess—at the sound of her low, soft
                  voice, he becomes confused, and wonders why it is so much sweeter than any other
                  woman's he ever heard! He is now almost constantly by the side of that funeral
                  couch—he sometimes takes the fan from the hands of Lisette; yes, and more than
                  once assists Adolphe to place his mistress where she directs—it is such a pleasure
                  to serve so amiable an old lady!
               The reserve of the Countess rapidly wears off; she condescends to converse
                  agreeably. She is fond of reading—so is Montespan; it is surprising how their
                  tastes assimilate. Together they read Racine, Rousseau, and the charming Sevigné,
                  and the Countess is several times thrown into an agitation quite unsuited to her
                  years. Montespan is a musician, too—he plays the piano with superior skill,
                  blending therewith the tones of his rich voice. Sometimes the Countess is
                  prevailed on to touch the guitar—she certainly makes sweet music; but it is an
                  effort, she says, and she dare not trust her voice to sing; it is
                     tremulous—(query, with age?) She begins to abhor that odious cap
                  and wig, as much as Lisette, and substitutes a pair of spectacles for those
                  horrible goggles!
               "Strange," said Montespan, one day, with his eyes fixed on that charming
                  portrait—"strange, when I listen to the Countess, I sometimes forget, like poor
                  old Jacques, that she is no longer young and beautiful?"
               
               "You are not well this morning, my friend!"
               "Perfectly so, honorable lady; but my regiment leaves tomorrow."
               "Tomorrow; ah, so soon!" and there was a slight tremor in the voice of the
                  speaker.
               "The thought of parting, perhaps forever," continued Montespan, "with one to whom
                  I am indebted for so much kindness, fills me with pain!"
               
               The Countess turned away her head, and Montespan saw she grew very pale.
               "Ah, it is you, Madame; you who are not well—alas, you have exerted yourself too
                  much!"
               "No; it is only a faintness with which I am sometimes seized. I am better
                  now."
               For the first time, he ventured to take her hand—that hand so fair and
                  delicate—its touch thrilled him—he carried it to his lips.
               "Pardon me, estimable lady, your kindness to a stranger has called forth feelings
                  such as I never before experienced! Helas,
                  Madame, I am alone in the world—an orphan from my earliest childhood. No mother's
                  love, dear lady, ever blessed me; pardon me, but since I have had the happiness of
                  knowing you, I have for the first time realized of what an inestimable treasure
                  death has deprived me! Ah, Madame, that you were indeed my mother!"
               "Your mother! A—h!" screamed the Countess, and buried her face in her
                  handkerchief—suddenly she became convulsed—there was a merry peal of laughter—then
                  low, deep sobs succeeded.
               "Oh, heavens, you are very ill!" exclaimed Montespan, not doubting the poor lady
                  was in hysterics, "and I—I have caused it; Ah, quel
                     malheur! Lisette,—Adolphe—"and seizing the fan, he began to wave it
                  rapidly, over the head of the unfortunate Countess.
               In a moment, however, she recovered herself. "Helas, my friend," said she, "you touched a chord, of whose
                  vibration you little dreamed." Then drawing a valuable ring from her slender
                  finger, "Accept this, my dear young friend, in token of the regard with which you
                  have inspired me. If, at any future day, you have a boon to ask of the Countess
                  D'Argentine, send me this ring, and it is granted. Adieu,
                     mon ami!"
               
               Hark, how mournfully echo the drums, as the regiment slowly winds through the
                  rugged defiles of the mountain.
               And the Countess and Lisette stand watching them from a turret of the old
                  chateau.
               "Ah, les pauvres! and they were such charming
                  chevaliers! Helas!" exclaimed Lisette, wiping
                  her eyes. "And now, my lady, as they are gone, I suppose I may as well put away
                  your venerable grandmother's wig."
               "Ye-e-s, Lisette,—heigh-ho!"
               "And the cap, and the——"
               "Yes, Lisette, take them all, all away,—Helas! I
                  wish I had never seen them."
               But whether her mistress meant the wig, or the Chevaliers, Lisette could not
                  determine.
               
               All Paris, that is all the musical world of Paris, was in ecstasy. Radiant with
                  the most lovely countenances, with eyes more sparkling than the brightest jewels,
                  and smiles so beaming with the happiness of the hour—the Opera House presented one
                  blaze of magnificence, from pit to gallery.
               These happy people,—yes, they are happy—forgetting, for a few brief moments, the
                  vicissitudes of the world without, they have met beneath this splendid dome, to
                  greet once more their favorite Prima-donna, who, after a twelve-month's absence is
                  again to thrill their souls with her ravishing notes. Even Royalty itself has
                     stepped from the throne, to smile
                  upon this nightingale of the hour.
               It was rather late, as a party of officers entered this scene of brilliancy.
                  Chatting, and laughing gaily, their eyes appeared far more engaged in surveying
                  the galaxy of beauty which surrounded them, than their ears, in listening to the
                  magnificent trills gushing forth from the enchantress of song. One of the party,
                  however, must be an exception; for after an indifferent glance around, he seated
                  himself listlessly, in one corner of the box, and resting his head upon his hand,
                  made his own thoughts his companions.
               "Come, come, Montespan, a truce to your melancholy, for to-night, man," exclaimed
                  one. "How can you remain so insensible to the peerless charms around; see, there
                  is the beautiful Marchioness D——, one glance at her bewitching face, would warm
                  the heart of an anchorite; and there, too, is that superb Madame, with her gazelle
                  eyes, and the charming little Baroness,—but, mon
                     Dieu! who is that lovely creature, just entering the box of La
                  Duchesse De B——! Look! look! what an angel; tell me, Baraton,—La Fleur, tell me,
                  do you know who she is?"
               No, they do not know; so they level their eye-glasses, and swear a great many
                  oaths, that she is the most divine creature they have ever beheld.
               Scarcely conscious of so doing, Montespan languidly raised his head, and cast his
                  eyes to the box of La Duchesse. Heavens! what does he see, that he thus starts to
                  his feet, and with trembling hand, clings for support to one of the gilded
                  pillars? Mark how his cheek flashes, and pales, by turns, and how wildly his eyes
                  rest upon that fair young creature, whose whole soul seems only intent upon the
                  stage.
               Ah, well may he gaze,—for it is the living image of the picture, which hangs in
                  the parlor of that old chateau, afar off among the mountains, and which, fresh and
                  immaculate, has hung in the inner chamber of his heart, for a whole year, that he
                  sees. Fortunately, surprise and joy, do not often kill one,—if so, alas for poor
                  Eugene, he must have given up the ghost on the spot.
               As a lily, swayed by the breeze, the lovely unknown suddenly inclines her graceful
                  head to the spot where Montespan is still clinging to the pillar. Their eyes meet.
                  By what strange sympathy, should this fair creature also evince so much agitation?
                  As if involuntary, she half rises from the velvet cushions, and with her small
                  hands clasped together, bends toward him, and then suddenly sinks back, nearly
                  fainting.
               Again her eyes met his, but this time she did not withdraw them, while a blush
                  like the shadow of a rose, mantled her sweet face. To render her resemblance to
                  the portrait more perfect, she was dressed in pure white, with a few flowers
                  enwreathed among the beautiful tresses which fell untrammeled around her.
                  Montespan hid his face in his hands a few moments to assure himself this was no
                  illusion; he looked again—oh, happiness! she was still there!
               Convinced, now, that his imagination had not played him false—that he really saw
                  before him the original of that ravishing picture, Montespan scarcely knew how to
                  deport himself in the first delirium of his joy. Then a thousand conflicting
                  thoughts chased through his brain. Who could she be? what connection could she
                     possibly have with the inmates of
                  that old chateau? why did his venerated friend the Countess, whose parting gift
                  still sparkled upon his finger—why did she always shun inquiry, when he ventured
                  to speak to her of that beautiful portrait. True, Jacques had affirmed this
                  picture was that of the Countess herself; but the fallacy of this assertion was
                  now fully established; yet, strange anomaly, so inseparably was the Countess
                  associated with the picture, in his mind, that now to separate the two he found
                  most painful. Suddenly the conversation he had held with the Countess at their
                  last interview, her agitation, when he alluded to the ties of parent and child,
                  and her remark, "you have touched a chord of whose vibration you little
                     dreamed," occurred to him, and with it the rapid conviction that this
                  beautiful creature, whose resemblance to the portrait would almost challenge
                  belief, could be no other than the daughter of the Countess D'Argentine. Yes, he
                  was sure of it, and some unhappy difference had led to the estrangement of mother
                  and child—quel malheur, and so young and
                  beautiful! Could she be married? Married! ah, heaven forbid! And
                  raising his eyes with almost an imploring look to the spot where he had beheld
                  her, he finds, alas! the fair unknown has vanished, leaving no trace by which he
                  can hope to see her again.
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "If to meet an old friend will be agreeable to Monsieur Montespan, the
                              Countess D'Argentine will be at home to-morrow morning at twelve.
                           
                              "Hotel De B——. Rue Chaussée D'Autin."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Such was the billet which awaited our hero upon his return from the opera.
               "Ah, happy moment! The excellent Countess was then in Paris; he should behold her
                  again, that estimable, venerated friend; and ah! rapture—her daughter—that
                  beautiful impersonation of all the loveliness which once adorned her mother—her,
                  too, he should see—he should speak to her—perhaps touch her fair hand,
                  perhaps——"
               Ah! to what heaven his imagination would not have soared, it is impossible to say,
                  had not his aspiring thoughts been suddenly dashed to earth by the thought that he
                  was only a poor Lieutenant, without friends or fortune; which reflection caused
                  him to beat his breast and tear his hair in such a tragedy fashion, that his kind
                  landlady begged a set of merry lodgers in No. 10 to be quiet, as the poor young
                  gentleman in No. 12 had a grievous headache—listen! they might hear him now pacing
                  his room, pauvre jeune homme!
               
               
               The next morning, at twelve o'clock, precisely, Montespan was at the Hotel De B——.
                  He was introduced into a charming saloon, where he was told the Countess would
                  soon receive him.
               The certainty of so soon meeting this beloved friend, drove all other thoughts
                  from his mind; even the portrait and its lovely counterpart were forgotten! The
                  same delicious feeling to which he attributes all the sweetness of filial regard,
                  and which he experienced so forcibly at the chateau, again stirs his bosom. He
                  wonders through which of the many doors the couch of the Countess will be drawn;
                  he listened eagerly for her approach, when suddenly the tapestry at one end of the
                  apartment is slightly raised, and the same lovely girl whom he had seen in the box of La Duchesse De B—— glides in,
                  and, with a graceful bend of the head, desires him to be seated.
               Conceive, if you can, his emotion! It was with difficulty he could even return the
                  salute of the fair lady, and I am sure you would have felt quite ashamed of his
                  awkwardness, dear reader, had you been there. At length he ventured to ask, "Have
                  I the pleasure of addressing the daughter of my honored friend, the Countess
                  D'Argentine?"
               A mischievous smile played over the young girl's features as she answered:
               "I am the Countess D'Argentine, Monsieur."
               "Good heavens!" exclaimed Montespan, turning pale, and forgetting all in this one
                  apprehension, "do you tell me, helas! that my
                  excellent friend is no more?"
               "Did you, then, esteem her so much?" and the voice of the fair querist
                  trembled.
               The tones of that voice made him start; how much like the sweet accents of her
                  mother!
               "Pardon my agitation; but tell me, when did this melancholy event take place?"
                  said Montespan.
               "Helas! it was on the 19th of August, 182—."
               "The 19th of August! Mon Dieu! why that was the
                  very day I left the chateau! alas! and was her end so sudden?" exclaimed
                  Montespan.
               "True—it was. We buried her forever, Monsieur; we bade farewell to her silvery
                  hair, and—and her green goggles—and—"
               "But you smile! Good heavens! what mean you?"
               The young girl extended her little hand, so much like the hand of her departed
                  mother, and with an arch smile, and a blush which well became her sweet face,
                  said:
               "And when we skipped away from the funeral rites, we laughed at the ruse we had played our gay gallants. Hither, Lisette,
                  and tell Monsieur of our masquerading in the old chateau!"
            
            
               
               THE CURTAIN LIFTED.
               OR PROFESSIONS—PRACTICAL AND THEORETICAL.
               
                  CHAPTER I.
                  The Deacon.
                  EVERYBODY called Mr. Humphreys a good man. To have found any fault with the
                     deacon would have been to impugn the church itself, whose most firm pillar he
                     stood. No one stopped to analyze his goodness—it was enough that in all outward
                     semblance, in the whole putting together of the outward man, there was a
                     conformity of sanctity; that is, he read his Bible—held family prayers night
                     and morning—preached long homilies to the young—gave in the cause of the
                     heathen—and was, moreover, of a grave and solemn aspect, seldom given to the
                     folly of laughter.
                  All this, and more did good Deacon Humphreys; and yet one thing he lacked,
                     viz., the sweet spirit of charity.
                  I mean not that he oppressed the widow, or robbed the orphan of bread; no, not
                     this, it was the cold, unforgiving spirit with which he looked upon the errors
                     of his fellow man—the iron hand with which he thrust far from him the offender,
                     which betrayed the want of that charity "which rejoiceth not in iniquity,
                        suffereth long, and is kind."
                  He was also pertinaciously sectarian. No other path than the one in which he
                     walked could lead to eternal life. No matter the sect, so that they differed
                     from him, it was enough—they were outlawed from the gates of heaven. Ah! had
                     the deacon shared more the spirit of our blessed Saviour, in whose name he
                     offered up his prayers, then, indeed, might he have been entitled to the
                     Christian character he professed.
                  Mrs. Humphreys partook largely of her husband's views. She, too, was
                     irreproachable in her daily walks, and her household presented a rare
                     combination of order and neatness. The six days work was done, and done
                     faithfully, and the seventh cared for, ere the going down of the Saturday's
                     sun, which always left her house in order—her rooms newly swept and
                     garnished—the stockings mended—the clean clothes laid out for the Sabbath
                     wear—while in the kitchen pantry, a joint of cold meat, or a relay of pies, was
                     provided, that no hand might labor for the creature comforts on the morrow. As
                     the last rays of the sun disappeared from hill and valley, the doors of the
                     house were closed—the blinds pulled down—the well-polished mahogany stand drawn
                     from its upright position in the corner of the sitting-room, which it occupied
                     from Monday morning until the coming of the Saturday night—the great family
                     Bible placed thereon, while with countenances of corresponding gravity, and
                     well-balanced spectacles, the deacon and his wife read from its holy pages.
                  Thus in all those outward observances of piety whereon the great eyes of the
                     great world are staring, I have shown that the deacon and his good wife might
                     challenge the closest scrutiny. Nor would I be understood to detract aught from these observances, or throw
                     down one stone from the altars of our Puritan fathers. We need all the legacy
                     they left their children. The force of good example is as boundless as the
                     tares of sin—let us relax nothing which may tend to check the evil growth—and
                     who shall say that the upright walk of Deacon Humphreys was without a salutary
                     influence.
                  But it is with the inner man we have to do. The fairest apples are
                     sometimes defective at the core.
               
               
                  CHAPTER II.
                  Grassmere and its Inhabitants.
                  Grassmere was a quiet, out-of-the-way village, hugged in close by grand
                     mountains, and watered by sparkling rivulets and cascades, which came leaping
                     down the hillsides like frolicksome Naiads, and then with a murmur as sweet as
                     the songs of childhood, ran off to play bo-peep with the blue heavens amid the
                     deep clover-fields, or through banks sprinkled with nodding wild-flowers.
                  A tempting retreat was Grassmere to the weary man of business, whose days had
                     been passed within the brick and mortar walks of life, and whom the fresh air,
                     and the green grass, and the waving woods, were but as a page of delicious
                     poetry snatched at idle hours. Free from the turmoil and vexations of the city,
                     how pleasant to tread the down-hill of life, surrounded by such peaceful
                     influences as smiled upon the inhabitants of Grassmere, and several beautiful
                     cottages nestling in the valley, or dotting the hill-side, attested that some
                     fortunate man of wealth had here cast loose the burthen of the day, to repose
                     in the quiet of nature.
                  Although our story bears but slightly save upon three or four of the three
                     thousand inhabitants of Grassmere, I will state that a variety of religious
                     opinions had for several years been gradually creeping into this primitive
                     town, and that where once a single church received the inhabitants within one
                     faith, there were now four houses of worship, all embracing different tenets.
                     But the deacon walked heavenward his own path, shaking his skirts free from all
                     contamination with other sects, whom, indeed, he looked upon as little better
                     than heathen.
                  The pastor of the church claiming so zealous a member, was a man eminent for
                     his Christian benevolence. His was not the piety which exhausted itself in
                     words—heart and soul did he labor to do his Master's will, and far from
                     embracing the rigid views of the worthy Deacon Humphreys, he wore the garb of
                     charity for all, and in his great, good heart loved all.
                  He had one son, who, at the period from which my story dates, was pursuing his
                     collegiate course at one of our most popular institutions, and in his own mind
                     the deacon had determined that Hubert Fairlie should become the husband of his
                     only daughter, Naomi. In another month Hubert was to return to pass his
                     vacation at Grassmere, and Naomi looked forward to the meeting with unaffected
                     pleasure. They had been playmates in childhood, companions in riper years; but
                     love had nothing to do with their regard for each other, yet the deacon could
                     not conceive how friendship alone should thus unite them. At any rate Naomi must be the
                     wife of Hubert—that was as set as his Sunday face.
                  The deacon was a man well off in worldly matters. He owned the large, highly
                     cultivated farm on which he lived, as also several snug houses within the
                     village, which rented at good rates.
                  But the little cottage at Silver Fall was untenanted. Through the inability of
                     its former occupant to pay the rent, it had returned upon the hands of the
                     deacon, and although one of the most delightful residences for miles around,
                     had now been for several months without a tenant.
                  A charming spot was Silver-Fall, with its little dwelling half hidden by
                     climbing roses and shadowy maples. Smooth as velvet was the lawn, with here and
                     there a cluster of blue violets clinging timidly together, and hemmed by a
                     silvery thread of bright laughing water, which, within a few rods of the
                     cottage-door, suddenly leaped over a bed of rocks some twenty feet high, into
                     the valley below. This gave it the name of Silver-Fall Cottage—all too enticing
                     a spot it would seem to remain long unoccupied. Yet the snows of winter yielded
                     to the gentle breath of spring, and the bright fruits of summer already decked
                     the hedge-rows and the thicket, ere a tenant could be found, and then there
                     came a letter to Mr. Humphreys from a widow lady living in a distant city,
                     requiring the terms on which he would lease his pretty cottage.
                  They were favorable, it would seem, to her views, and in due time Mrs. Norton,
                     her daughter Grace, and two female domestics, arrived at Silver-Fall.
               
               
                  CHAPTER III.
                  One Fold of the Curtain drawn back.
                  A new comer in a country village is always sure to elicit more or less
                     curiosity, and Mrs. Norton did not escape without her due share from the
                     inhabitants of Grassmere. With telegraph speed it was found out that she was a
                     lady between thirty and forty years of age, dressed in bombazine, and wore
                     close mourning caps. Miss Norton was talked of as a slender, fair girl, with
                     blue eyes, and long, flowing curls, and might be seventeen, perhaps twenty—of
                     course, they could not be strictly accurate in this matter.
                  Bales of India matting were unrolled in the door-yard—crates of beautiful china
                     unpacked in the piazza—sofas and chairs crept out from their rough traveling
                     cases, displaying all the beauty of rosewood and damask, until finally by aid
                     of all these means and appliances to boot, Mrs. Norton and her daughter were
                     pronounced very genteel—but—
                  "But, I wonder what they are!" said Mrs. Humphreys to the deacon, as talking
                     over these secular matters she handed him his second cup of coffee.
                  Not that the good lady had any doubt of their being bona fide flesh and blood; neither did she believe they were
                     witches or fairies who had taken up their abode at Silver-Fall. "I wonder
                        what they are!" must therefore be interpreted as "I wonder what
                        church they attend," or "what creed they profess."
                  
                  The deacon shook his head and looked solemn.
                  "It is to be hoped," continued Mrs. Humphreys, complacently stirring the
                     coffee, "that at her period of life Mrs. Norton may be a professor of some
                     kind."
                  The deacon dropped his knife and fork—he was shocked—astounded.
                  "I am surprised to hear you speak thus lightly, Mrs. Humphreys—a
                        professor of some kind! Is it not better that she should yet rest in
                     her sins, than to be walking in the footsteps of error—a professor of
                        some kind! Wife—wife—you forget yourself!" exclaimed the deacon.
                  "I spoke thoughtlessly, I acknowledge," answered Mrs. Humphreys, much confused
                     by the stern rebuke of her husband. "I meant to say, I hoped she had found a
                     pardon for her sins."
                  "Have you forgotten that you are a parent?" continued the deacon, solemnly.
                     "Can you suffer the ears of your daughter to drink in such poison! A
                        professor of some kind! Naomi, my child," placing his hand on the
                     sunny head before him, "beware how you listen to such doctrine; there is but
                     one true faith—there is but one way by which you can be saved. Go to your
                     chamber, and pray you may not be led into error through your mother's words of
                     folly!"
                  But there were others at Grassmere most anxiously wondering, like good Mrs.
                     Humphreys, "what they were," ere they so far committed themselves
                     as to call upon the strangers. Sunday, however, was close at hand; Mrs.
                     Norton's choice of a church was to determine them the choice of her
                     acquaintance.
                  Does the reader think the inhabitants of Grassmere peculiar? I think not. There
                     are very many just such people not a hundred rods from our own doors.
                  Unfortunately, on Sunday the rain poured down in torrents. Nothing less
                     impervious than strong cowhide boots—India-rubber overcoats, and thick cotton
                     umbrellas, could go to meeting, consequently, Mrs. Norton staid at home, and on
                     Monday afternoon, after the washing was done, and the deacon had turned his
                     well saturated hay, Mrs. Humphreys put on her best black silk gown and
                     mantilla, her plain straw bonnet, with white trimmings, and walked over with
                     her husband to Silver-Fall cottage. As the widow rented her house of them, they
                     could not in decency, they reasoned, longer defer calling upon her.
                  A glance within the cottage would convince any one that Mrs. Norton and Grace
                     were at least persons of refinement—for there is as much character displayed in
                     the arrangement of a room as in the choice of a book.
                  Cream-colored mattings, and window-curtains of transparent lace, relieved by
                     hangings of pale sea-green silk, imparted a look of delicious coolness to the
                     apartments. There was no display of gaudy furniture, as if a cabinet warehouse
                     had been taken on speculation—yet there was enough for comfort and even
                     elegance; nor was there an over exhibition of paintings—one of Cole's beautiful
                     landscapes, and a few other gems of native talent were all; nor were the tables
                     freighted as the counter of a toy-shop; the only ornament of each was a
                     beautiful vase of Bohemian glass, filled with fresh garden flowers, whose
                     tasteful arrangement even fairy hands could not have rivaled.
                  The few moments they were awaiting the entrance of Mrs. Norton were employed by Mrs. Humphreys in
                     taking a rapid survey of all these surroundings, the result of which was to
                     impress her with a sort of awe for the mistress of this little realm.
                  "My stars!" said she, casting her eyes to the right and left, half rising from
                     the luxurious couch to peep into one corner, and almost breaking her neck to
                     dive into another, "my stars, deacon, if this don't beat all I ever did
                     see!"
                  But the deacon, with an air worthy of a funeral, shook his head, closed his
                     eyes, and muttered.
                  "Vanity—vanity!"
                  The door opened, and Grace gliding in, sweetly apologized for her mother, whom
                     a violent headache detained in her apartment.
                  "Well, I do wish I knew what they were!" again exclaimed Mrs. Humphrey, as she
                     took the deacon's arm and plodded thoughtfully homeward.
                  Then going to a dark cupboard under the stairs, she rummaged for some time
                     among the jars and gallipots, and finally producing one marked "Raspberry Jam,"
                     she told Naomi to put on her Sunday bonnet, and carry it to the cottage,
                     and—
                  "Naomi, you may just as well ask Grace Norton what meeting she goes to."
                  Delighted to make the acquaintance of Grace, Naomi threw on her bonnet and
                     tripped lightly to the cottage, thinking little, we fear, of her mother's last
                     charge. At any rate, it was omitted, and so the night cap of Mrs. Humphreys
                     again threw its broad frilling over an unsatisfied brow.
                  In the morning the deacon received a very neat note from Mrs. Norton,
                     requesting to see him upon business.
                  "And now, my dear sir," said she, after the common courtesies of the day were
                     passed, "I have taken the liberty to send for you to transact a little business
                     for me. If not too great a tax upon your time, will you purchase a pew for
                     me?"
                  The deacon grimly smiled, and rubbing his knee, replied.
                  "Why, yes, Mrs. Norton, I shall be glad to attend to the matter. True, it is a
                     busy season with us farmers, but the Lord forbid I should therefore neglect
                        his business."
                  "Do you think you can procure me one?" asked Mrs. Norton.
                  "O, I reckon so, for I am certain there are several pews now to be let or sold
                     either."
                  "And what price, Mr. Humphreys?"
                  "Well, I guess about sixty dollars; and now I recollect, Squire Bryce wants to
                     sell his—it is right alongside of mine, and I reckon my pew is as good for
                     hearing the word as any in the meeting-house. I am glad, really I do rejoice to
                     find you a true believer."
                  "You mistake my church, I see," said Mrs. Norton, smiling, "I belong to a
                     different denomination from the one of which as I am aware you are a
                     professor."
                  "Then," cried the deacon, rising hastily and making for the door, "excuse
                     me—I—I know nothing of any other church or its pews. I cannot be the instrument
                     of seating you where false doctrines are preached! I—good morning, ma'am."
                  
                  The widow sighed as the gate slammed after her visitor, but Grace burst into a
                     merry fit of laughter.
                  "How ridiculous!" she exclaimed; "was there ever such absurdity!"
                  "Hush, hush, my dear child," said Mrs. Norton, "Mr. Humphreys is without doubt
                     perfectly conscientious in this matter—we may pity, but not condemn such zeal
                     in the cause of religion."
                  "Do you call bigotry religion, mamma?" asked Grace.
                  "A person may be a very good Christian, Grace, and yet be very much of a
                     bigot," answered her mother. "That such a spirit as Mr. Humphreys has just now
                     shown may often be productive of more evil than good, I allow. His aim is to do
                     good, but he adopts the wrong measures."
                  "Why, mamma, one would have judged from his manner that we were infidels!" said
                     Grace.
                  "O no, my child, he did not really think that," replied Mrs. Norton, smiling at
                     her earnestness. "He only felt shocked at what he deems our error—for he
                     sacredly believes there can be no safety in any other creed than his own.
                     Without the charity therefore to think there may be good in all sects, and
                     lacking the desire to study the subject, or rather so much wedded to his belief
                     that he would deem it almost a sin to do so, like an unjust judge, he condemns
                     without a hearing. There are too many such mistaken zealots in every creed of
                     worship. O, my dear child," continued Mrs. Norton, her fine eyes bathed in
                     tears, "would that members of every sect might unite in love and charity to one
                     another! They are all aiming alike to love and serve Christ, and yet take no
                     heed to his commandment, 'Love ye one another!'"
                  "Well, mamma, for the sake of his sweet daughter, Naomi, I can forgive the good
                     deacon. I have never seen a more interesting face than hers, and her manners
                     are as graceful and lady-like as if she had never seen the country," said
                     Grace.
                  "And most probably a great deal more so, my love," replied Mrs. Norton, "for
                     nature can add a grace which courts cannot give. But I agree with you in
                     thinking Miss Humphreys interesting; she is, indeed, so, and if her countenance
                     prove an index of her mind, I think you may promise yourself a pleasing
                     companion."
                  But the deacon, it seems, was of a different way of thinking, and no sooner did
                     he enter under his own roof, place his oak stick in the corner, and hang up his
                     hat on the peg behind the door, than going into the kitchen where the good wife
                     was busily employed preparing the noonday meal, assisted by Naomi, he made
                     known with serious countenance, that he had discovered what they
                        were at Silver-Fall cottage!
                  Of course, Miss Norton was not such a companion as they would choose for Naomi.
                     True, she was a pretty girl, and Mrs. Norton a lady of faultless manners; but
                     then so much the more danger, and therefore Naomi, though not forbidden, was
                     admonished to beware of their new acquaintances.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  Love Passages.
                  The summer passed, and in the bright month of September, came Hubert Fairlie,
                     to pass a few weeks beneath the glad roof of his parents, whose only and
                     beloved child he was.
                  Their warm welcome given, the first visit of Hubert was to Naomi. They met as
                     such young and ardent friends meet after an absense of months, and Naomi soon
                     confided to him her regret that her parents would not allow her to cultivate
                     the friendship of Grace Norton, whom she extolled in such warm and earnest
                     language, that Hubert found his curiosity greatly excited to behold one calling
                     forth such high eulogium from the gentle Naomi.
                  An evening walk was accordingly planned which would lead them near the cottage,
                     hoping by that means to obtain a glimpse of its fair inmate. Fortune favored
                     them. As they came within view of the cottage, a sweet voice was heard
                     chaunting the Evening Hymn to the Virgin, and Hubert and Naomi paused to listen
                     to as heavenly sounds as ever floated on the calm twilight air. Then as the
                     song concluded, Grace herself still sweeping her fairy fingers over the strings
                     to a lively waltz, sprang out from the little arbor, and with her hair floating
                     around her like stray sunbeams, her beautiful blue eyes lifted upward, her
                     white arms embracing the guitar, and her graceful figure swaying to the gay
                     measure like a bird upon the tree-top, tripped over the greensward.
                  Among other amusements which the deacon held in great abhorrence was dancing,
                     and Naomi had been taught to look upon all such exhibitions as vain and sinful.
                     Yet never, I may venture to say, did any pair of little feet so long to be set
                     at liberty as did
                        Naomi's—pat—pat—pat-ing the
                     gravel-walk where they stood, urging their young mistress to bound through the
                     gate and trip it with those other little feet twinkling so fleetly to the merry
                     music.
                  The cheeks of Grace rivaled the hue of June roses, as she suddenly encountered
                     the gaze of a stranger; but seeing Naomi, she hastened to greet her, and
                     thereby hide her embarrassment. Naomi introduced her companion, and then Grace
                     invited them to walk in the garden, and look at her fine show of autumn
                     flowers. Minutes flew imperceptibly, and ere they were aware, Hubert and Naomi
                     found themselves seated in the tasteful parlor of the cottage listening to
                     another sweet song from the lips of Grace.
                  As this is not precisely a love tale, I may as well admit at once, that Hubert
                     became deeply enamored of the bewitching Grace, and from that evening was a
                     frequent and not unwelcome visitor—a fact which was soon discovered by the
                     deacon, for noting that Hubert came not so often as was his wont to the farm,
                     he set about to find out what could have so suddenly turned the footsteps of
                     the young man from his door.
                  Alas, for his hopes of a son-in-law in Hubert! He found those footsteps very
                     closely on the track of as dainty a
                     pair of slippers as ever graced the foot of a Cinderilla.
                  Nothing could exceed his disappointment, save the pity he felt for his
                     minister, whose son he considered rushing blindly into the snares of the Evil
                     One. Nay, so far did he carry his pity as to warn Mr. Fairlie of the
                     dereliction of Hubert. But when that worthy man reproved his uncharitableness,
                     and acknowledged that he could hope for no greater earthly happiness for his
                     son, than to see him the husband of so charming and amiable a girl as Grace
                     Norton, the deacon was perfectly thunderstruck! It was dreadful—what would the
                     world come to! In short almost believing in the apostacy of the minister
                     himself, the deacon went home groaning in spirit, as much perhaps for the
                     frustration of his own schemes, as for the "falling off," as he termed it of
                     the reverend clergyman!
                  The swift term of vacation expired, and Hubert returned to college. His
                     collegiate course would end with the next term, and then it was his wish to
                     commence the study of the law. Mr. Fairlie was, perhaps, somewhat disappointed
                     that his son did not adopt his own sacred profession; but he was a man of too
                     much sense to force the decision of Hubert or thwart his wishes. He hoped to
                     see him a good man whatever might be his calling; and if ever youth gave
                     promise to make glad the heart of a parent, that youth was Hubert Fairlie.
                  The intercourse between Grace and Naomi from this time almost wholly ceased,
                     much to the regret of both. Yet such were the orders of deacon Humphreys, whose
                     good-will toward the widow and her daughter was by no means strengthened by the
                     events of the last four weeks.
               
               
                  CHAPTER V.
                  The Practical and Theoretical Christian.
                  "WHY, what have you done with Nelly, to-day?" asked Mrs. Humphreys, of her
                     washerwoman, who came every Monday morning, regularly attended by a little
                     ragged, half-starved girl of four years old, whose province it was to pick up
                     the close-pins, drive the hens off the bleach, and keep the kittens from
                     scalding their frisky tails—receiving for her reward a thin slice of bread and
                     butter, or maybe, if all things went right, and no thunder-squalls brewed, or
                     sudden hurricanes swept over the close-fold, a piece of gingerbread or a
                     cookey. "What, I say, have you done with Nelly?"
                  "O, ma'am, she has gone to school—only think of it, my poor little Nelly has
                     gone to school! It does seem," continued Mrs. White, resting her
                     arms on the tub, and holding suspended by her two hands a well-patched shirt of
                     the deacon's, "it does seem as if the Lord had sent that Mrs. Norton here to be
                     a blessing to the poor!"
                  "Humph!" ejaculated Mrs. Humphreys, spitefully rattling the dishes.
                  "Only think," continued Mrs. White, "she has given up one whole room in her
                     house to Miss Grace, who has been round and got all the children that can't go
                     to school because their parents are too poor to send them, and just teaches
                     them herself for nothing! God bless her, I say!" exclaimed the washerwoman,
                     strenuously, her tears mingling with the soap-suds into which she now plunged her two arms so
                     vigorously as to dash the creaming foam to the ceiling.
                  Mrs. Humphreys was at once surprised and angry. She could not conceive why a
                     lady like Mrs. Norton should do such a thing as to keep a ragged school, and
                     that, too, without pay or profit. She had forgotten the words of our blessed
                     Lord, "Whoso shall receive one such little child in my name,
                     receiveth me," or, "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these,
                     ye have done it unto me." Charity alone, she argued in her selfish nature,
                     could not have influenced Mrs. Norton to put herself to so much trouble for a
                     troop of noisy, dirty, half-clothed children! No, there must be some deeper
                     motive—some sectarian object, perhaps, to be gained; and, impressed with this
                     idea, she said tartly,
                  "I think it is a pretty piece of presumption in Mrs. Norton to come here and
                     set herself up in this way, telling us as it were of our duty. She is a
                     stranger, and what business is it of hers, I should like to know, whether the
                     children go to school or not!"
                  "O, Mrs. Humphreys, indeed, I think the spirit of the Lord guides her!" said
                     Mrs. White. "Miss Grace came and asked me so humbly like, if I would let her
                     teach my Nelly, and then kissed the little fatherless child so, so—that—that—O,
                     I could have worshiped her!" and fresh tears streamed down the cheeks of the
                     washerwoman.
                  "Worship a fiddle-stick!" exclaimed Mrs. Humphreys, out of all patience, "I
                     know what she wants—an artful creature; yes, she wants to make Nelly go to her
                     meeting!"
                  Poor Mrs. White could not help smiling at the idea of attempting to form the
                     religious creed of a child scarce four years old.
                  "Well, if she will only make her as good as she is, I don't care!" she
                     answered, "for the Bible says, 'By their fruits ye shall know
                     them!'"
                  Mrs. Humphreys was more and more shocked at this. She whispered it to Mrs.
                     Smith, who whispered it to Mrs. Jones, who told Mrs. Brown, who told all the
                     society, that the Nortons were wicked, designing people, come into the village
                     to stir up schism in the church! Yet all sensible persons applauded the good
                     deed of the widow, and cheerfully aided her efforts. The little school
                     prospered even more than she had dared to hope; the children were cheerful and
                     happy, and those whose parents could not afford them decent clothing, were
                     generously supplied by Mrs. Norton—and many a heart blessed the hour which
                     brought her among them.
                  As the thunder which suddenly rends the heavens, when not a cloud on the blue
                     expanse has heralded the coming storm, was the calamity which now as suddenly
                     burst over the head of Mrs. Norton.
                  She retired at night to her peaceful slumbers, supposing herself the mistress
                     of thousands. With the early dawn there came letters to the cottage, telling
                     her that her worldly possessions were swept from her. The man to whose care her
                     fortune was entrusted, had basely defrauded her of every cent, and now a
                     bankrupt, had fled to a foreign land.
                  The stroke was a severe one. She must have been divine to have resisted the
                     first shock which the tidings caused her. But that over, like a brave and
                        noble spirit she rose to meet it.
                     Her treasures were not all of earth—in heaven her hopes were garnered; and,
                     although henceforth her path in life might be in rougher spots, and through
                     darker scenes than it had yet traversed, to that heaven she trusted to arrive
                     at last.
                  It happened, unfortunately, that the half-yearly rent of the cottage became due
                     that very week; and Mrs. Norton, thus suddenly deprived of her expected funds,
                     had no means to meet it. Where should she raise two hundred dollars! Her
                     courage, however, rose with her trials. A little time to look into her
                     affairs—a little time to form her plans for the future, and she doubted not she
                     should be able to liquidate the debt. Unused to asking favors, she yet
                     courageously went to Mr. Humphreys, and stating candidly her inability to meet
                     the rent, requested a few weeks indulgence.
                  The deacon was not caught napping. Evil news always travels with seven-league
                     boots—and long ere Mrs. Norton knocked at the door of the farm-house, it was
                     known throughout the village that her fortune was gone.
                  Now the deacon, good man that he was, was "given to idols," and
                     Mammon was one. Moreover, he owed the widow a grudge, as we already know, and
                     the old leaven of sin was at work beneath the crust of piety.
                  He was accordingly well prepared to receive her. And sorry, very sorry was the
                     worthy deacon, but he had just then a most pressing necessity for the rent—he
                     really must have it, if not in cash, perhaps Mrs. Norton might have some plate
                     to dispose of; he would be happy to oblige her in that way, for the Lord forbid
                     he should deal hard with any one—but, the amount must
                     be paid when due. Wait he could not—and if the rent was not forthcoming on the
                     day stipulated in the contract—why—why—he was very sorry—but he should be
                     obliged to take other measures, that was all!
                  Mrs. Norton soiled not her lips by making any reply to this Christian
                     Shylock—no expostulation or entreaty—but coldly bowing, she took her leave.
                  As soon as she reached home she sent for a silversmith, brought out her
                     valuable tea-set—doubly so from having been the marriage gift of her father,
                     requested its apprisal, and then duly attested as to its weight and purity, it
                     was forwarded to the clutches of the deacon.
                  Mrs. Norton met with a great deal of sympathy in her misfortunes. During the
                     few months she had resided among them, the villagers had all learned to love
                     and respect her. Even the poor came from their humble homes, and with looks of
                     sympathy and outstretched hands tendered their offerings—their hard earned
                     wages to the kind lady who had taught their little ones; they would work for
                     her—they would do any thing to serve her. With a sweet smile Mrs. Norton put
                     back their grateful gifts, and thanked them in gentle tones for their love—to
                     her a far more acceptable boon than gold could buy.
                  Again Silver-Fall cottage fell back on the hands of its owner.
                  Dismissing her attendants, Mrs. Norton took a smaller and cheaper house. Her
                     choice and beautiful furniture she sold, only retaining sufficient to render
                     her now humble residence comfortable. The avails of the sale amounted to
                     several hundred dollars—enough at any rate, she deemed, for present
                     necessities, while she trusted in
                     the meantime to find some means of subsistence by which she and Grace might
                     support themselves.
                  What more noble spectacle, than an elegant, refined woman thus meeting,
                     uncomplaining and cheerfully, the storm of adversity.
                  And Grace, too—sweet Grace—sang like a skylark, and made her little white hands
                     wonderfully busy in household matters. Hubert Fairlie was yet absent, though
                     his long and frequent letters brought joy to the heart of his beloved.
                  And had Naomi forgotten her friend in this season of trial! Not so; yet
                     forbidden as we have seen from the society of Grace, all she could do was to
                     sympathize deeply in spirit, happy when a chance opportunity brought them
                     together; and those meetings although rare, only served to strengthen the
                     friendship which united these two lovely girls.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VI.
                  The Pestilence. The Curtain wholly Lifted.
                  It was now the middle of October. 
                        
                           "Filled was the air with a dreamy and magical light, and the
                              landscape
                           Lay as if new created, in all the freshness of childhood:
                           All sounds were in harmony blended.
                           Voices of children at play—the crowing of cocks in the farm-yard,
                           Whirr of wings in the drowsy air, and the cooing of pigeons,
                           All were subdued and low as the murmurs of love,"
                        
                      when suddenly the Angel of Death folded his dark wings, and sat brooding
                     over the peaceful, pleasant village of Grassmere.
                  A terrible and malignant fever swept through the town, spreading from house to
                     house, like the fire which consumes alike the dry grass and the bright, fresh
                     flowers of the prairies. Old and young, husband, wife and child, were alike
                     brought low. There were not left in all the village those able to attend upon
                     the sick. From the churches solemnly tolled the funeral bells, as one by one,
                     youth and age, blooming childhood and lovely infancy, were borne to the
                     graveyard—no longer solitary—for the foot of the mourner pressed heavily over
                     its grass-grown paths.
                  Still the contagion raged, until the selfishness of poor human nature triumphed
                     over the promptings of kindness and charity. People grew jealous of each other;
                     neighbor shunned neighbor; 
                        
                           "Silence reigned in the streets—
                           Rose no smoke from the roofs—gleamed no lights from the windows,"
                        
                      save the dim midnight lamp which from almost every house betokened the
                     plague within.
                  None had shut themselves up closer from fear of infection than Deacon
                     Humphreys. His gates grew rusty, and the grass sprang up in the paths about his
                     dwelling. And yet the Destroyer found him out, and like a hound long scenting
                     its prey, sprang upon the household with terrible violence.
                  First the pure and gentle Naomi sank beneath the stroke, and ere the setting of
                     the same day's sun, Mrs. Humphreys herself was brought nigh the grave.
                  Like one demented, pale with agony and terror, the deacon rushed forth into the
                     deserted streets to seek for aid. His dear ones—his wife and child were
                        perhaps dying; where, where
                     should he look for relief—where find some kind hand to administer to their
                     necessities.
                  At every house he learned a tale of wo equal to his own. Some wept while they
                     told of dear ones now languishing upon the bed of pain, or bade him look upon
                     the marble brow of their dead. Others grown callous, and worn-out with sorrow
                     and fatigue, refused all aid, while some, through excess of fear, hurriedly
                     closed their doors against him.
                  Thus he reached the end of the village, and then the small, neat cottage of
                     Mrs. Norton met his view, nestling down amid the overshadowing branches of two
                     venerable elms. From the day he had almost thrust her from his gate, with cold
                     looks and unflinching extortion, Mrs. Norton and the deacon had not met, and
                     now the time had come when he was about to ask from her a favor upon which
                     perhaps his whole earthly happiness might rest—a favor from her, whom in
                        his strength and her dependence he had scorned.
                     Would she grant it? He hesitated; would she not rather, rejoicing in her power
                     now, revenge the slights he felt he had so often and so undeservedly cast upon
                     her. But he remembered the sweet, calm look which beamed from her eyes, and his
                     courage grew with the thought.
                  Putting away the luxuriant creeper which wound itself from the still green turf
                     to the roof of the cottage, hanging in graceful festoons, and tinged with the
                     brilliant dyes of autumn, seemed like wreaths of magnificent flowers thus
                     suspended, the deacon knocked hesitatingly at the door.
                  It opened, and Mrs. Norton stood before him, pale with watching—for, like an
                     angel of mercy had she passed from house to house, since the first breaking out
                     of the scourge. In faltering accents he told his errand; and, O, how like a
                     dagger did it pierce his heart, when, with a countenance beaming with pity and
                     kindness, and speaking words of comfort, the widow put on her bonnet and
                     followed him with fleet footsteps to his stricken home.
                  All night, like a ministering angel, did she pass from one sick couch to the
                     other, tenderly soothing the ravings of fever, moistening their parched lips
                     with cool, refreshing drinks, fanning their fevered brows, and smoothing the
                     couch made uneasy by their restless motions.
                  Unable to bear the scene, the deacon betook him in his hour of sorrow to his
                     closet, where all through the dreary watches of the night he prayed this cup of
                     affliction might pass from him. His heart was subdued. He saw that like the
                     proud Pharisee he had exalted himself, thanking God he was not as other
                        men.
                  
                  At early dawn came Grace also to inquire after her suffering Naomi, and finding
                     her so very ill, earnestly besought her mother that she might be allowed to
                     share the task of nursing her. Mrs. Norton had no fears for herself, yet when
                     she looked at her only and beautiful child, she trembled; but her eyes fell
                     upon the bed where poor Naomi lay moaning in all the delirium of high fever,
                     and her heart reproached her for her momentary selfishness. Removing the bonnet
                     of Grace, she tenderly kissed her pure brow, and then kneeling down, with
                     folded hands she prayed, "Thy will, O Lord, not mine be done! Take her in thy
                     holy keeping, and do with her as thou seest best!"
                  From that day Grace left not the bedside of her friend.
                  
                  On the third day Mrs. Humphreys died. Her last sigh was breathed out on the
                     bosom of the woman whom she had taught her daughter to shun. For many days it
                     seemed as if Death would claim another victim; yet God mercifully spared Naomi
                     to her bereaved father; very slowly she recovered, but neither Mrs. Norton nor
                     Grace left her until she was able to quit her bed.
                  With the death of Mrs. Humphreys, the pestilence staid its ravages, while, as a
                     winding-sheet, the snows of winter now enshrouded the fresh-turned clods in the
                     late busy grave-yard.
                  The eyes of Deacon Humphreys were opened. He became an altered man. He saw how
                     mistaken had been his views, and that it is not the profession of
                     any sect or creed which makes the true Christian, and that if all are alike
                        sincere in love to God, all may be alike received.
                  I have said this was no love tale, therefore, by merely stating that in the
                     course of a twelvemonth Hubert Fairlie and Grace were united, I close my simple
                     story.
               
            
            
               THE MAID OF CHE-KYANG.
               
                  CHAPTER I.
                  IN the reign of Kien-lung, 1736, the Ladrone Islands on the coast of China were
                     infested with vast hordes of the most desperate and daring pirates. Large
                     squadrons were fitted out from these islands even under the very eyes of
                     government, and boldly proceeded to sea to commit their daring piracies. They
                     were a terror not only along the coast of Cochin-China, but even to the shores
                     of Formosa, and, indeed, so daring were they as to have at one time anchored a
                     fleet of nearly eight thousand war junks in a bay near Canton.
                  They were commanded by a bold and desperate outlaw, named Ching-yih, who,
                     availing himself of the cupidity of these desperadoes, as a means to encourage
                     their cruelty and the terror of his own name, is said to have paid each man ten
                     taéls for the head of every prisoner brought before him. But at length this
                     terrible Ching-yih was accidentally drowned, and his widow Kea-she assumed the
                     command of the whole piratical force. Her courage and her cruelty were worthy
                     of her deceased consort, for, if possible, under her dominion this horde of
                     bucaneers became even more formidable. This is a rare instance in the annals of
                     Chinese history, where the female sex are held is such contempt and derogation,
                     that men, and those, too, of the most lawless and desperate character have held
                     themselves in subjection to a woman—but such was the fact.
                  
                  Two sons alone were the offspring of Ching-yih and Kea-she; as different in
                     their characters as is the wild mountain torrent, foaming and raging on its
                     devastating course, from the gentle stream which glides so peacefully through
                     its verdant banks, sprinkled with the flowers which its own revivifying power
                     has called forth. Lon-chi, the eldest partook of all the ferocity and cruel
                     daring of his parents. No sooner was he old enough to wield the bow, or handle
                     the pike, than he fearlessly followed in the train of the outlaws, claiming
                     only as a reward for any display of youthful courage, the boon of
                        torturing with his own hands the victims whose unhappy destiny had
                     placed them in their power. Such was Lon-chi—but how different the youthful
                     Kon-chi! Graceful and beautiful as Adonis, he was brave, noble and generous. He
                     turned sorrowing away from the daily scenes of bloodshed he was compelled to
                     behold, and although in the cause of justice, or for his country's glory, he
                     would have shone the bravest of the brave, he now shunned as much as he
                     abhorred the life of these island bucaneers.
                  From his earliest childhood Kon-chi had manifested an engrossing earnestness
                     for literature. The works of Confucius, of Mencius, and other eminent scholars
                     of the Celestial Empire, were ever in his hands, and their principles and
                     precepts he adopted and cherished as his rule of conduct. Although the habits
                     and disposition of Kon-chi were so much the reverse of that bold and bloody
                     commerce which for many successive generations had distinguished the race of
                     Ching-yih, it was only for him that the tender nature of woman ever
                        humanized the heart of his mother Kea-she. Fondly did she love
                     him —there was a charm, a soothing influence in the society of this her
                     youngest boy, which, falling like the gentle rain from heaven, insensibly
                     seemed to soften that arid and flinty soil which had choked up those springs of
                     tender affections and sympathies wont to gush forth so beautifully in the heart
                     of woman. There were times, it is true, when she urged and even commanded him
                     to abandon his books—to quit the listless and inactive life he led, for the
                     turmoil and bloody scenes of practical warfare; yet in a few hours she would
                     forget both her commands and threats, and seek only the means to advance still
                     farther the peaceful pleasures of her son. She furnished him with the most
                     liberal sums of money that he might prosecute his desire for travel and
                     improvement; she caused to be constructed for his use one of the most beautiful
                     barges which ever floated on the Chinese waters; and gave to his command a band
                     of trusty men chosen by himself from among the horde—men who were
                        human, and who gladly turned from the life to which force and
                     fear had alone consigned them, to submit themselves to the more congenial
                     authority of Kon-chi.
                  In proportion as Kea-she loved and indulged her youngest son did the heart of
                     the elder, Lon-chi, increase in bitterness and hatred to his brother. He
                     embraced every opportunity to revile and insult him—encouraged also the sneers
                     and jests of his familiars at the cowardly and pusillanimous nature of Kon-chi,
                     and strove by every means to anger his dignified forbearance.
                  At length the latter voluntarily banished himself almost entirely from the
                     Ladrones—only returning occasionally to gladden the eyes of his mother, for
                        whom he felt filial love and
                     sorrow, yet unmingled with that respect which binds the heart of
                     the son to a mother so closely, and which if destroyed, alas, how
                     humbling the situation of that mother in the eyes of a noble and upright
                     child!
                  Kon-chi accordingly visited the great cities of the Empire—made himself
                     acquainted with their arts and sciences; and also took great delight in the
                     more humble scenes of rural life. He visited Japan, and other contiguous isles,
                     and after an absence of more than a year returned once more to his native isle
                     to embrace his mother.
                  He arrived on the bridal eve of his brother. The haughty Hoo-she, daughter of
                     the next chieftain in command to himself, was the bride, and entertainments of
                     the most magnificent nature were in preparation. The sound of drums, trumpets
                     and gongs, mingled with the softer notes of flutes and stringed instruments,
                     echoed from cliff to cliff, and from fortress to fortress through those rocky
                     isles, and stole afar out over the waters, now bathed in the first beams of the
                     rising moon. Gorgeous palanquins hung around with lanterns of every form and
                     color, resembling fish, birds and serpents, and borne by carriers dressed in
                     the gayest and most fantastic fashion, with bands of music at their
                     side—banners flying on which were portrayed geese and ducks, while the living
                     birds themselves were borne in front in golden cages—were already issuing forth
                     from the brilliantly illuminated fortress of Kea-she, to escort the bride elect
                     to the dwelling of the fierce Lon-chi.
                  Kon-chi mingled not with these festivities, but sought the presence of his
                     mother. Kea-she received him with kindness, but apparently the scenes going on
                     around her, in which her eldest son bore so conspicuous a share, had aroused
                     the spirit of vanity and ambition within her. After a slight conversation, in
                     which affection bore but little share, she in a more stern and haughty manner
                     demanded of her son how long he was to continue a life so disgraceful to his
                     birth and lineage—reproaching him with cowardice, and for concealing, under an
                     affected taste for literature, only a craven and groveling spirit.
                  "Behold thy brother Lon-chi," she continued; "like the God of Thunder, when he
                     frowns, he hurls down destruction and devastation on his enemies—with the flash
                     of his eye they are consumed! Look forth—see from how many island peaks
                     fearlessly waves the flag of our race! And at yonder floating armament which
                     covers our waters! Does the blood of Ching-yih flow in your veins? and are you
                     not aroused to deeds of daring by the sight? And listen—hear you not the sound
                     of music? and flashes not yonder brilliant array upon your eye? Yes, Lon-chi,
                     the brave, weds with the dark-eyed Hoo-she, the loveliest daughter of our
                     tribe." Then suddenly fixing her piercing gaze upon Kon-chi, who remained
                     standing firm but respectful before his excited parent, she continued:
                     "Kon-chi, you are not now to learn for the first time the laws which govern our
                     mighty band, for they were taught you even in your earliest infancy, by the
                     death struggles—by the piercing shrieks of those wretches who dared to disobey
                     them! 'Wo, then, to him,' says the great Ching-yih, 'who weds with the daughter
                     of a stranger! wo to him who may look with pleased eye upon the charms of other
                     than a daughter of our tribe! Torture and death await the criminal—torture the most horrible—death the
                     most ignominious!' Then beware, Kon-chi, if, in thy life of indolence and
                     fancied pleasure, thou list to the music of other voices than here might charm
                     thine ear, or look with delight upon other eyes than here might meet thy
                     glance—or if thou takest a stranger to thy bosom, then mark me, thou art
                        doomed! Not even the glory of calling Ching-yih
                     father—Kea-she mother—can avert thy fate. Thy
                     punishment shall be the more severe, that the illustrious example shall cause
                     all future generations to tremble and forbear!"
                  The fears of Kea-she were, however, without foundation, for never yet had the
                     heart of Kon-chi felt the influence of love. Many and beautiful were the
                     maidens who had attracted his notice, but they were to him as the bright
                     flashing stars—glorious and lovely to look upon—giving light and beauty to his
                     path, yet leaving in his heart no trace that they had ever been.
               
               
                  CHAPTER II.
                  The crescent moon peered through the dark glossy foliage of the India fig and
                     banian trees interspersed with the graceful yulan, which shadowed a lovely
                     garden in the Province of Che-kyang. The air was heavy with the rich odor of
                     the magnolia, ye-hiang-ho, azelia, orange blossoms, and countless fragrant
                     shrubs—a fountain, encircled by a low marble balustrade crowned with jars of
                     beautiful plants, sent forth the most soothing murmurs, while the gold and
                     silver fish, sporting beneath the mirrored surface, flashed like jewels in the
                     moon's rays. A few yards from this lovely fountain, a flight of marble steps
                     adorned with images, each bearing some fragrant shrub, led to a gentle eminence
                     on which stood a pavilion hung with the most gorgeous silks wrought in tasteful
                     designs with thread of gold, and which seemed as if it were suspended within
                     the gigantic branches of the rare ou-tong-chu, whose thousands of large snowy
                     blossoms exhaled the most delicious fragrance as they were gently swayed by the
                     light evening wind.
                  At one extremity of the pavilion the curtains were partially drawn aside,
                     disclosing a view of the interior. The floor was paved with lapis-lazuli and
                     white jasper, representing birds, flowers, et
                        cetera—large vases of the most exquisite designs were scattered
                     here and there—the chairs and couches were covered with white satin,
                     embroidered with the richest colors, while, in the centre, a small jet d'eau of perfumed water, dropping upon a
                     pavement formed of the sonorous yu, so rare and valuable, caused
                     a constant variety of agreeable sounds, as the humming of bees over beds of
                     violets.
                  Upon one of these couches reclined a fair young maiden. One small hand was
                     pressed upon her lovely brow, from which the dark hair was drawn back and
                     caught in the beak of a silver fong-hoang,
                     whose delicate wings shaded her temples as a vail, while the long glittering
                     tail, studded with minute gems of emeralds and rubies, formed a most graceful
                     and beautiful plume. The other hand rested upon a small musical instrument
                     resembling a guitar, which, as the Chinese maiden carelessly swept the strings,
                     gave forth sweet and mournful sounds. Her little foot, encased in a jeweled
                     slipper, twinkled like a star from the cushion on which it rested.
                  
                  Apparently the thoughts of the maiden were soaring far away from the present
                     scene, for twice had the name of Leet-sie been pronounced in a sweet voice by a
                     young girl, who advanced gently from the more retired recesses of the pavilion,
                     ere the former seemed aware of her presence.
                  "Thy voice, dear Ma-che, sounds sweet as the murmuring of the dove. Methought
                     our blessed Queen of Heaven whispered 'Leet-sie,' and called me to her
                     side."
                  "Still so pensive, dear Leet-sie," answered the other maiden. "Why art thou now
                     ever sad and tearful, and thy voice low and trembling, even as the strings of
                     thy lute when the wind whispers through them?"
                  Leet-sie made no answer, but buried her face in her little hands. Ma-che
                     continued:
                  "Dost thou forget, my own Leet-sie, that when next yonder moon shall dance upon
                     the waters of the Golden Lake, then with sounds of sweetest harmony—with
                     flashing lanterns, and torches, whose brilliancy shall make the darkness hide
                     itself beneath the waters of the Yellow Sea, thou wilt be borne from thy
                     father's palace in a gorgeous palanquin, to become the bride of the great
                     Kia-chan?—of him whose eyes have even looked upon the face of the Emperor, nor
                     yet been blinded by the dazzling glory! From all the daughters of Che-kyang,
                        thee hath he chosen for his consort—thee, who can
                     call the mighty warrior Long-han, father! Then why are the stars of thy
                     forehead darkened? and why do those pearly eye-lids tremble? Tell me, dear
                     Leet-sie."
                  The maiden was about to reply, when suddenly a low strain of music swept the
                     air. Uttering an exclamation of delight, Leet-sie half rose from her seat, bent
                     eagerly forward, and with one hand raised, as if to bespeak attention, remained
                     listening to the notes.
                  The strain ceased—and all was still. Then turning and throwing her arms around
                     the neck of Ma-che, Leet-sie murmured:
                  "Alas, what can I do? Listen, dear Ma-che, to my secret—but bury it in thy
                     heart deep and forever. Hark! again."
                  And again a soft and gentle air mingled with the low music of the fountain.
                  Quickly throwing a vail around her, Leet-sie, with trembling hand, caught up
                     the lute, and timidly ran her fingers over the strings, which responded as
                     though brushed by the wing of some frightened bird. A slight rustling was
                     heard—a shower of white blossoms from the quivering branch of the ou-tong-chu
                     fell around the entrance of the pavilion, and a youth sank on his knees before
                     the couch of Leet-sie!
                  Ma-che uttered a faint scream—drew her vail over her face—and fled timidly from
                     the presence of the stranger youth.
               
               
                  CHAPTER III.
                  Long-han, the father of Leet-sie, was the most renowned warrior throughout all
                     Che-kyang; indeed, the neighboring provinces of Fokien and Kiang-nan could
                     boast no braver soldier. His name had rung even in the ears of the Emperor
                     Kien-lung, who, as a reward, permitted him the honor of wearing the
                        "yellow button," allowed only to Princes of the Blood. Ten
                     thousand of the bravest soldiers of
                     Che-kyang were at his command. His palace, situated on the flowery borders of
                     the beautiful lake Si-hou, was more sumptuous than that of the greatest
                     mandarin in the province, while love and harmony breathed the gentlest spirit
                     of happiness throughout the interior of this luxurious abode.
                  Only three moons had waned prior to the events last related, when Kon-chi, the
                     son of the terrible pirate Ching-yih, in one of his rambles in this delightful
                     province, had seen the loved Leet-sie, the only daughter of Long-han.
                  In one of those beautiful pleasure boats, so adorned with flowers that they
                     resemble some large and exquisite boquet floating on the limpid waters of the
                     lake, had the females of Long-han's household embarked to enjoy the soft breeze
                     which came wafted from the Yellow Sea across the spicy groves which shaded its
                     borders.
                  It was near the rainy season, when sudden and frequent storms arise; and while
                     yet the dip of the oars sounded in unison with the notes of flutes and other
                     gentle wind instruments, one small dark cloud appeared as a speck upon the blue
                     sky—the whole heavens were suddenly obscured—the wind seized the frail bark and
                     tossed her like some fairy plaything upon the now foaming waters of the little
                     lake. The thunder rolled, while the lightning, as in sport, flashed and danced
                     across the angry heavens. The unskillful and frightened mariners, instead of
                     endeavoring to guide the little boat, prostrated themselves on the deck,
                     uttering prayers to the gods of storms and winds, while loud screams and sobs
                     from the cabin mingled with the roar of the elements. At that perilous moment a
                     light bark, guided by one single hand, is seen rapidly sculling the foaming
                     waves, and soon reaches the doomed pleasure boat. Kon-chi springs on the
                     deck—he seizes the abandoned rudder—his voice restores courage to the
                     frightened sailors and comfort to the drooping females, who, totally forgetful
                     in this hour of danger of that reserve to which custom dooms them, now cling
                     tremblingly around him, and call upon him to save them.
                  The eye of Kon-chi falls upon the unvailed countenance of Leet-sie, pale, yet
                     beautiful as the fabled hour. His efforts redouble; once more he turns to look
                     upon the maiden, while love, more powerful than the elements, calms the terrors
                     of Leet-sie, and aids the arm of Kon-chi to her rescue. The boat is soon safe
                     by one of those massive galleries which here and there span the more narrow
                     surface of the lake. He then falls upon his knee before the blushing maiden,
                     imprints one kiss upon her hand, springs upon the galley and is gone.
                  Already was the youthful Leet-sie promised in marriage to the great Kia-chan.
                     In accordance with the arbitrary custom of the empire, Leet-sie had never
                     looked upon the features of her future lord, yet, submissive to the will of her
                     parents, she had unmurmuringly consented to become the bride of Kia-chan. The
                     most magnificent presents had been showered upon the youthful beauty by the
                     bridegroom elect. The richest silks from Persian looms—pearls and gems of rare
                     and dazzling beauty—shawls from the vale of Cashmere—birds of exquisite
                     plumage, confined in cages of silver-net, which continually poured forth the
                     most enchanting notes—these and a thousand other rare and precious gifts were
                     lavished upon the fair Leet-sie; and already the luxurious ous apartments prepared in the mansion of
                     Kia-chan seemed lonely without the presence of their young and beautiful
                     mistress. As soon, therefore, as the pale fragrant blossom of the double
                     flowering almond should bud amid its spicy foliage, it was determined the
                     impatient bridegroom should receive the trembling Leet-sie from the hands of
                     her brave father.
                  But alas, the sudden storm which had swept the calm surface of the lake had as
                     suddenly disturbed that peaceful tranquillity which had ever reigned in the
                     pure bosom of the Chinese maid. No longer did she take delight in the splendors
                     which surrounded her; the voices of the singing birds had lost their power to
                     charm, and seated in the midst of those gorgeous gifts which slaves were
                     continually placing before her, Leet-sie remained silent and sad, her pale face
                     bathed in tears; yet whenever the graceful image of the brave youth who had
                     rescued her from a watery grave flitted before her, her little heart fluttered,
                     and those cheeks, before so pale, now vied in bloom with the blushing
                     pomegranate.
                  Again the daring Kon-chi kneels before Leet-sie, and gazes unreproved upon
                     those charms which have destroyed his peace of mind forever, unless he can win
                     the maid to his home in the Pirate Isles. Their vows of love are interchanged,
                     and at length the daughter of the mighty Long-han consents to flee far from her
                     father's palace, far from Kia-chan, who even then awaits his bride. Disguised
                     in the most common garb, as attendant upon the handsome youth Kon-chi, Leet-sie
                     is soon far beyond the confines of Che-kyang; a few days, and they are safe
                     beyond pursuit amid the rocky defiles of the Ladrones.
                  Here, in a spot almost inaccessible to mortal footsteps, had Kon-chi already
                     constructed a dwelling suitable for his lovely Leet-sie. He had caused to be
                     borne thither the richest and most fragrant woods where with to rear his fairy
                     palace. The doors and pillars were of sandalwood, on which birds and flowers
                     were exquisitely delineated with inlaid ivory. Silken hangings of delicate
                     azure adorned the walls—couches, formed of silver filigree and pearl, were
                     cushioned with satin of pale rose color—curtains of fine silver net-work, so
                     flexible that with each breath of wind they moved gently to and fro, gleaming
                     in the air as moonbeams on the water, were suspended over the doors and
                     windows, and the little foot of the beautiful bride pressed only upon carpets
                     of rich velvet. The sound of falling cascades and fountains, mingled with the
                     sweet notes of birds, charmed the ear, while, as the mountain wind whispered
                     through the branches of the superb flowering trees, which the love of Kon-chi
                     had caused to be transplanted thither, it wafted to the senses an odor more
                     delicious than the breath of June roses.
                  A body of armed followers were ever at hand, and each rocky defile which led to
                     this abode of love and happiness was guarded by a chosen troop; for too well
                     did Kon-chi know that notwithstanding the love with which his mother Kea-she
                     regarded him, should she discover his retreat, his beloved Leet-sie would fall
                     an instant victim to her wrath and the stern laws of the pirate horde. Twice,
                     unarmed and alone, had Kon-chi visited the fortress where his mother held such
                     absolute command over thousands of the wild and lawless pirates. He had been
                     each time received with great kindness and favor, which only seemed to rouse anew the
                     bitter hatred that lay hidden in the heart of the wicked Lon-chi.
                  Again did Kea-she urge upon Kon-chi to wed with one of the fair daughters of
                     the tribe; his renewed refusal seemed to kindle her suspicion and her anger,
                     for in a voice tremulous with rage, and eyes flashing defiance, she
                     exclaimed:
                  "Again I tell thee, Kon-chi, to beware; for, by the head of Confucius I swear
                     that should'st thou wed with a stranger maid, were she the daughter of the
                     Emperor, the mighty Kien-lung, death to thee, and a torture
                        worse than death to her, shall be thy reward!"
                  And Kon-chi left the presence of his mother with dread forebodings at his
                     heart, followed by the sneers and malicious eye of Lon-chi.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  A year of blissful happiness had rapidly flown over the youthful pair, when one
                     day as Kon-chi was returning from a ramble through the interstices of the
                     mountain, he several times fancied he detected the sound of footsteps close
                     behind him; but whenever he turned to look around him all was still; the
                     ring-dove flew from her nest amid the deep foliage of the Mo-wang, and the
                     whizzing of pheasants, startled from their covert in the deep jungle, were the
                     only sounds that met his ear. Still the fears of Kon-chi were aroused, and no
                     sooner did he reach his peaceful dwelling than he ordered his followers to
                     scour the defiles in every direction, and bring to his presence any persons
                     they might find lurking therein. Nor were his precautions vain, for scarce an
                     hour had passed, ere one of the most daring of his brother's band was brought
                     before him. Two of these outlaws had been discovered prowling within a few rods
                     of Kon-chi's abode. One had unfortunately effected his escape; the other, after
                     a desperate resistance, and mortally wounded, was at length captured. Dogged
                     and sullen, he stood before Kon-chi, refusing to answer every question that was
                     put to him, and died at length, breathing only oaths and defiance toward his
                     captors.
                  "We must fly, star of my life," cried Kon-chi, pressing Leet-sie to his bosom.
                     "The hatred and jealousy of my wicked brother have at length discovered our
                     retreat; even now we may be too late!"
                  Then ordering his men to proceed cautiously in advance, and clasping the light
                     form of Leet-sie in his arms, Kon-chi turned sorrowing away from the charming
                     spot which had so long sheltered their loves. Wearily they began their descent
                     down the steep mountain slopes. In a small cove, on the western side of the
                     Ladrones, the beautiful traveling barge of Kon-chi was moored; but, death to
                     his hopes! As the wide expanse of ocean burst on his view, he saw he was
                        too late; that his enemies already held possession of the only
                     means of escape for his beloved Leet-sie.
                  "Too late—too late!" he exclaimed; "but on, my brave fellows. Strike down the
                     pirate band!"
                  Then placing the trembling Leet-sie in safety, and leaving a chosen guard
                     around her, Kon-chi placed himself at the head of his men, and, like a torrent,
                     they rushed down the mountain to battle with the foe. The combat was short and
                     decisive. Love nerved the arm of
                     Kon-chi; his valor inspired his followers with renewed courage, and in a short
                     time scarce one of the pirates but lay weltering in blood upon the sands.
                     Swiftly returning now to the trembling Leet-sie, Kon-chi again took her in his
                     arms and bore her to the barge. The light sails were soon hoisted, and taking
                     his station at the rudder, while the long oars were propelled by strong and
                     willing hands, the fugitives directed their course for the shores of
                     Cochin-China. But hardly had the barge proceeded a mile from the towering
                     islands, when suddenly the rocky sides of the mountain seem alive with armed
                     men pouring down toward the shore; the sound of gongs, drums, and trumpets came
                     wafted to their ears, while from every cove the armed junks and fast-boats of
                     the pirates were rapidly approaching the barge.
                  Two of these junks are larger than the others, whose brilliant decorations, gay
                     silken awnings, with the red and black flag displayed from their masts, denote
                     them to be those of Kea-she and the terrible Lon-chi. With every sweep of the
                     oar the pirates gain upon the light boat of Kon-chi, and already was that
                     commanded by Lon-chi within a few rods of the fugitives, when at the loud blast
                     of a trumpet from the war-junk of Kea-she, the rowers of Lon-chi suddenly, with
                     uplifted oars, remain motionless—the junk of Kea-she is soon alongside that of
                     her pirate son:
                  "Leave the rebel to me!" she exclaimed; "proceed no farther without my orders.
                     I alone will deal with the wretched man. Back, I say, nor come between me and
                     my vengeance."
                  Then ordering all the other boats to lie on their oars, she was soon alongside
                     of the flying barge; and commanding manding Kon-chi to lie to, this bold and
                     daring woman fearlessly stepped on board.
                  "Ungrateful, rebellious man," she cried, sternly regarding Kon-chi, "down with
                     your arms, and instantly surrender yourself my prisoner."
                  "Not while I have life," replied her son, proudly; "you are now in my power;
                     either return at once to the deck of your own vessel, or yield as my
                     prisoner!"
                  "This to me, unworthy son of the brave Ching-yih! This to thy
                     mother and sovereign! But listen, base boy—(shame upon me that the only love I
                     ever felt even now stirs my heart, degenerate as thou art!) Tell me where is
                     the unhappy wretch who hath lured the eaglet from the parent nest? Bring her
                     before me, that, as the fire of heaven, my eyes may strike her dead at my
                     feet!"
                  "Never, never will I yield my lovely Leet-sie to thy tyranny, cruel mother,"
                     replied Kon-chi. "No, sooner shall this dagger let out her pure and innocent
                     heart's blood, than she shall be made to feel the vengeance of a cruel and
                     heartless woman!"
                  But there was a slight rustling as of silken garments, a faint sob, a light
                     form tottered past Kon-chi, and throwing back her vail, Leet-sie, pale and
                     trembling, fell at the feet of Kea-she, and lifted her glorious eyes to the
                     stern countenance bent upon her:
                  "Behold, mother of Kon-chi—behold the innocent cause of thy son's apostacy!
                     Strike—I await the dreadful blow which separates me from my beloved; but, oh,
                     spare him—the young, the brave, the beautiful!"
                  "Kneel not, dearest Leet-sie," cried Kon-chi, raising her to his breast. "Ask no mercy; we will die as
                     we have lived—united!"
                  The eyes of the stern mother roved for a moment over the young and beautiful
                     pair before her. Kon-chi stood firm and erect, nor quailed his eye under her
                     fearful glance; one arm supported the light form of Leet-sie, who, clinging
                     tremblingly around him, now gazed with love and tenderness into the countenance
                     of her beloved, or lifted a timid, shuddering glance upon the cruel woman
                     before her.
                  For some moments no word was spoken; the features of Kea-she gradually relaxed;
                     the light of pity and love stole over her countenance, as the sunbeams flashing
                     on the harsh, rugged peaks of her mountain home. Motioning those around her to
                     stand back, she advanced a few paces nearer to the unfortunate pair, and, in a
                     tremulous voice, said:
                  "My son, maternal love has conquered! Depart quickly with thy lovely bride.
                     Seek some foreign land, and there dwell in peace and happiness. My children,"
                     she added, "curse not the name of your mother!"
                  Kon-chi fell at her feet, and was about to reply, when there was a sudden and
                     rapid dash of oars, and ere Kea-she could recover from her emotion, the
                     terrible Lon-chi, with death and vengeance in his eye, and cimiter in hand,
                     sprang on the deck, followed by a body of ruffians as ferocious as himself.
                  "What means this daring intrusion, Lon-chi?" exclaimed Kea-she, instantly
                     resuming all her sternness and dignity; "did I not bid you await my orders?
                     Retire then, instantly, to the boats, and return to the fortress. Know that I
                     have pardoned thy brother! How now—dare you rebel?"
                  Lon-chi turned to his men. There was a hoarse murmur of defiance, and each man
                     placed his hand on his dagger; then advancing to his mother, Lon-chi
                     replied:
                  "No, never will I leave this deck until yonder grovelling miscreant meets the
                     death he merits. What! shall he go unpunished for a crime which
                     has already cost the lives of some of our bravest men? Seize him, brave boys,
                     and strangle him before the eyes of his mountain dove!"
                  "Advance one step at your peril," cried Kea-she, springing before the furious
                     pirates, who were already closing around Kon-chi. "Back, I say, it is your
                     sovereign commands!"
                  "Heed her not, my gallant men; heed not a woman!" cried Lon-chi,
                     with a laugh and look of scorn.
                  Kea-she raised her arm, while fury flashed from her eyes.
                  "Seize the rebel!" she exclaimed, pointing to Lon-chi, "and bear him to the
                     dungeon in the rocks!"
                  Almost before the words were uttered, there was a flash, a report, and, with a
                     low scream, the pirate chief tainess fell dead upon the deck! A
                     bullet from the carbine of her son had pierced her heart!
                  For a few moments all was confusion; even the hearts of the ferocious pirates
                     were awed and touched at the sudden death of the daring woman who so oft had
                     led them forth to conquest. Kon-chi seized the favorable moment, placed himself
                     at the head of the pirates and rushed upon the parricide. Hand to hand the
                     brothers fought above the body of
                     the murdered mother. All stood back to gaze upon this dreadful combat. It was
                     soon decided—guilt and horror, as he viewed the pale bloody corse of his
                        parent, paralyzed the arm of the wicked Lon-chi; his dagger
                     remained powerless in his hand, and, after a few faint struggles, he fell,
                     mortally wounded by the hand of Kon-chi.
                  Our story is ended. Suffice it only to say that Kon-chi, with his beloved
                     Leet-sie, reached in safety one of those sea-girt isles which "like to gems
                     inlay" the bosom of the Pacific Ocean.
                  Deprived of their bold and terrible leaders, the Ladrone pirates from this time
                     ceased to be longer objects of terror. They were soon disbanded; some formed
                     themselves into small hordes, and were taken and put to death; while others,
                     joining the armies of the Emperor, were even promoted to high rank and power
                     for their superior skill and bravery.
