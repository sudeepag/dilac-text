            PREFACE.
            We have long desired to have a Work-House, in order to rid our streets of the
               numerous vagrants that infest them. All acknowledge the necessity of
               such an establishment, yet no steps are taken to erect it.
            Now, I have resolved (perhaps not wisely, but certainly with good intent) to attempt
                  digging its foundation by means of this homespun
               volume—the products of the sale of which, after paying the costs of publication, will
               be appropriated to that purpose; and I doubt not that the building in question being
               thus begun, other funds will be contributed to carry up its superstructure. At least,
               let us try the experiment—it can do no harm—nay, it shall do good; for
               if the sum accruing from the sale of this work, prove inadequate for the project in
               view,—instead of its being presented to that august body of our esteemed
               townsmen, the City Council, it will be given to the Union Benevolent Society for the
               benefit of the poor: Thus imitating the recent bright example of our worthy and gallant commandant at the Armory,
               and thereby proving in more ways than one, that his lights did not shine
               in vain.
            With this short and explanatory preamble, I commit my "odd volume" to
               its fate.

                           ———We speak of them, we keep
                           Their names, like light that must not fade, within our bosom's
                              deep.
                        
                     
                     Mrs. HEMANS.
                  
               
               
                  MRS. JEAN WOOD, OF CHELSEA.
                  Mrs. Jean Wood was the daughter of the Rev. John Moncure, a Scotch clergyman of
                     the Episcopal church, who in 17— emigrated to this country, and was the first
                     progenitor of the numerous Virginia families bearing that name. He possessed
                     considerable talents, which his third daughter, Mrs. Wood, inherited. She was
                     very intellectual, and highly gifted with both poetical and musical genius. Of
                     poetry she has left some beautiful specimens, which have been offered for the
                     pages of our favorite "Messenger," where they will deserve a place. In music,
                     though entirely self-taught, she acquired considerable skill, and played with
                     taste on the guitar, piano and spinet, an instrument much in vogue in her day;
                     and so thoroughly did she make herself acquainted with it, that she has been
                     known to employ her ingenuity successfully, in restoring an injured one to
                     complete order and harmony; indeed, her energy and perseverance in whatever she
                     undertook usually insured success: even after she was sixty, having had the
                     misfortune to be overset in a carriage and break her right wrist, she quickly
                     learned to use her left hand in sewing, and to write with it not
                     only eligibly but well.
                  
                  
                  The early part of Mrs. Wood's life was tinged with romance. She reciprocated at
                     seventeen the ardent attachment of a young gentleman from Maryland, and they
                     became engaged; but their union being opposed by her relations, because
                        he was a Roman Catholic, they separated, and at parting
                     exchanged vows never to marry, so that when she was addressed by Gen. James
                     Wood, several years afterwards, she declined his proposals, and he proceeded to
                     the West to join in the war against the Indians, first bequeathing (in case he
                     should be killed) his property to the fair lady of his choice. Fate, however,
                     allotted him a brighter destiny—for Miss M. having been led to believe that her
                     former lover had broken his pledge, yielded to the persuasions of a cousin with
                     whom, since her parent's death, she often resided, and consented to recall the
                     General; and not until after their union did she discover that she had been
                     cruelly deceived. Hearing of her marriage, Mr.—— considered himself absolved
                     from his promise, and soon entered the bands of matrimony also. In their
                     subsequent history, a remarkable coincidence occurs.
                  Mrs. Wood had an only child, a daughter who was extremely intelligent until
                     four years old: she was then attacked with convulsions, and owing to their
                     frequent recurrence, grew up an idiot; and Mr. ——, of Maryland, had a son in a
                     similar state! Would it be uncharitable and superstitious to infer that these
                     corresponding calamities were inflicted upon each party by Heaven, as a
                     punishment for breaking their rash, yet solemn vows? * * * * * * To this
                     unfortunate child she devoted herself with all of a mother's tenderness and
                     zeal, and many of her effusions touchingly allude to the deep affection she
                     bore her, and the anxiety she suffered on her account. She lost her at the age
                     of eighteen, and bewailed her death as bitterly as if she had been of those
                     whom God endows with the blessings of intellect and beauty.
                  After this event and the decease of General Wood, who had been elected Governor
                     of Virginia many years before, she removed from the pleasant shades of Chelsea
                     to Richmond, where she spent the remainder of her days in works of charity and
                     usefulness; and there, aided by her intimate friend, Mrs. Samuel Pleasants, and
                     by Mrs. Chapman, the lady of a British officer, founded a society for assisting
                     indigent widows and children. It was termed the "Female Humane Association of
                     the City of Richmond," under which title it was incorporated by the Legislature
                     in 1811, and still exists and flourishes, though its efforts and finances have
                     been, since its primitive establishment, differently appropriated than was
                     originally intended, and are at this time devoted solely to the benefit and
                     maintenance of female orphan children to the entire exclusion of
                        widows. Mrs. Wood was chosen President of this society, and
                     untiringly and faithfully performed the arduous duties of that responsible
                     station until summoned by her Maker to a happier and higher vocation in
                     Heaven.
                  
                  She rested from her labors in the 68th year of her age, and reposes in the
                     rural cemetery of "Poplar Grove," a family seat about two miles distant from
                     Richmond.
                  She was brought up as an Episcopalian, but during the ministry of Dr. John H.
                     Rice she joined the Presbyterian church. This worthy pastor instituted a second
                     association of ladies, for the purpose of working for the poor students in
                     Hampden Sidney College, and in compliment to Mrs. W. called it the "Jean Wood
                     Society."
               
               
                  MRS. ABIGAIL MAYO, OF BELLEVILLE.
                  Another remarkable lady of Richmond, Virginia, was Mrs. Mayo, the consort of
                     Col. John Mayo, of Belleville, the enterprising projector and proprietor of the
                     lower bridge now spanning James River, a work that was at first generally
                     deemed impracticable, because of the depth and violence of the current, but
                     which his energy and perseverance nobly achieved.
                  Mrs. Mayo was the intimate friend of Mrs. Wood, and, like her, an elegant
                     writer, not in poetry however, but in prose, as
                     numerous productions from her pen give proof. A journal she kept during her
                     sojourn in Europe in 1829 has been found among her papers, and is exceedingly
                     ceedingly entertaining and interesting, and beautifully written.
                  Mrs. Mayo's maiden name was De Hart, and her native place Elizabethtown, New
                     Jersey. She was ever distinguished for her personal comeliness and mental
                     endowments; so much so, that in former days it was said by some of her
                     companions and admirers, that "in her were united the
                        beauty of Venus, the dignity of Juno, and the
                        wisdom of Minerva!" and truly, she was a woman of rare mind,
                     character and talents, and withal kind-hearted and charitable.
                  A friend has oft-times been commissioned by her to perform acts of benevolence,
                     for which she liberally supplied the funds, and has repeatedly known her to
                     send loads of fuel to warm and cheer the hearths and hearts of the poor and
                     needy.
                  It was entirely through the instrumentality and benevolent exertions of Mrs.
                     Mayo to assist an unfortunate and worthy friend, that one of the first and best
                     female boarding-schools ever kept in Richmond was established here in 1812,
                     where many of the most distinguished ladies of the present day acquired their
                     education and accomplishments.
                  She departed this life on the 2nd of October, 1843, retaining to the last her
                     mental faculties, and to an uncommon degree, her strength and activity. She had
                     reached the advanced age of eighty-two when taken ill. A few sad days she suffered from pain and fever; then her
                     spirit took its flight, we trust, from Earth to Heaven!
                  
                  Eighteen months previous to her death, the spacious and beautiful mansion she
                     occupied, uninsured, and with nearly all of its contents, was
                     destroyed by fire. Her deportment on this trying occasion created both respect
                     and admiration, as the following extract from the newspapers of that period
                     will show:
                  "There was no white person upon the premises when we reached Belleville, except
                     its strong-minded and wonderfully-gifted proprietress, Mrs. Mayo, the widow of
                     Colonel John Mayo, and mother-in-law of Gen. Winfield Scott and Dr. R. H.
                     Cabell, of this city..... We have never witnessed a more imposing spectacle of
                     this description. The immense building on fire, the large masses of light which
                     were scattered in all directions, illuminating grove and lawn,—the large groups
                     of people collected around,—the heaps of furniture piled up at the several
                     points, formed a tout en semble of the most
                     striking character! ...... But the most impressive thing of all, was the
                        moral effect imparted by the presence of the venerable lady of
                     the mansion, who sat in front of the burning ruins, amid the masses of
                     furniture, without one tear, one lamentation or murmur, inspiring all who saw
                     her with the deepest sympathy and respect for one who bore herself so firmly,
                     so nobly, under so severe and sudden a calamity!"
                  Mrs. Mayo lies interred near her husband and children in the family cemetery of
                     Powhatan Seat, a short distance below Richmond; where two white marble obelisks
                     adorn their honored graves.
               
               
                  MRS. MARY W. MOSEBY, OF CURLS.
                  The next hallowed name we select from Richmond annals of female excellence and
                     talents, is that of Mary Webster Pleasants, the late consort of John G.Moseby,
                     Esq., of this city.
                  And who that knew her can ever forget her, or fail to treasure the remembrance
                     of her virtues and genius?
                  Gentleness, piety, charity, liberality, and energy of mind and character, were
                     her distinguishing traits, combined with talent and intellectual
                     cultivation.
                  She was profoundly versed in all scriptural subjects, and what is very
                     remarkable, had included in her studies, that of medicine,
                     regarding that branch of knowledge as a necessary part in the education of one
                     residing in the country. I have been informed, too, that her proficiency in it
                     has excited the surprise of several eminent Physicians.
                  For many years her ready pen supplied a number of Magazines with the rich
                     harvests of its industry, and often were the verses and prose pieces of
                     "Marcella" and "M. M. W." (her usual signatures) lauded by the most fastidious
                     votaries of literature: they were always filled with pathos and religious feeling, for they were
                     always the spontaneous effusions of a brilliant mind and pious heart.
                  Her poem of "Pocahontas," the only one she ever published, was
                     eulogized by the ablest critics and reviewers.
                  In her youth, Mrs. Moseby must have been very handsome: the writer had not the
                     happiness of knowing her, personally, till late in life, and even then her
                     features were delicate and regular, and her countenance sweet and intelligent;
                     but owing to protracted ill health, her complexion was pallid.
                  It is now time to say something of her birth and parentage, the particulars of
                     which have been obtained from one who justly idolized her, and still deeply
                     mourns her death!—from her husband.
                  She was born on the 25th of April, 1792, and was the daughter of Mr. Robert
                     Pleasants, of Curls, in Henrico county, whose father (also named Robert) was
                     one of the most distinguished members of the society of "Friends" in
                     Virginia.
                  Her mother was Miss Elizabeth Randolph, of Tuckahoe, the daughter of Col.
                     Thomas Mann Randolph, and the sister of Col. T. M. Randolph, (formerly Governor
                     of Virginia,) and of Mrs. David Meade Randolph, Mrs. Harriet Hackley, and Mrs.
                     Virginia Carey.
                  At nine years of age, Mrs. Moseby was left an orphan, but the loss of her
                     parents was almost supplied by her venerable paternal grandfather.
                     Being exceedingly strict in his religious gious principles, he sent her, when
                     old enough, to his brother, (Mr. Samuel Pleasants, of Philadelphia,) with
                     directions that she should be placed at Weston School, which was under the
                     superintendance of persons of his profession of faith; but notwithstanding
                     these precautions, after her marriage she followed the dictates of her
                     conscience and embraced the Episcopalian religion.
                  She resided seven years at Weston, and received every advantage that the most
                     careful education could bestow; and that the good seed was sown upon a rich and
                     grateful soil, was plainly evinced by her refinement of mind and manners, her
                     agreeable conversation and useful habits.
                  At eighteen she bestowed her heart and hand upon Mr. Moseby: they were blessed
                     with children, and for many years enjoyed ease, happiness and prosperity. But
                     the evil day came at last!
                  Like many others, they were destined to prove experimentally, that "Riches make
                     unto themselves wings and flee away." .... Necessity demanded the sacrifice,
                     and they parted with their pleasant rural residence on the banks of James
                     river, and located themselves in a small house in Richmond.
                  In this season of trial, the virtues of Mrs. Moseby shone with a lustre
                     brighter than ever, and gained her still farther the esteem and love of those
                     who witnessed her fortitude, and cheerful fulfilment of every duty, in the
                     midst of reverses so sudden and great!
                  
                  It was in 1842 that to these were added the failure of her health. She was
                     attacked with disease of the heart; and although the most skillful physicians
                     were consulted, and unremitting attentions paid to her case, and every exertion
                     made for her restoration, all were in vain. In the City of Richmond, on the
                     19th of November, 1844, her sainted spirit took its flight!
                  The following lines are a feeble tribute to her memory: 
                        
                           Thou art gone where no ills can beset thee,
                           Where friends re-unite ne'er to part;
                           Thou art gone!—but I ne'er will forget thee—
                           Thine image is graved on my heart.
                        
                        
                           Like the warm breath of spring-time, bestowing
                           New life on the foliage of earth—
                           So affection within my breast glowing,
                           Sweet musings about thee, call forth.
                        
                        
                           And I see thee in dreams, with bright spirits,
                           Whose rapturous anthems arise
                           In rich chorus, with saints who inherit
                           Their promised rewards in the skies.
                        
                        
                           There the arms of the Saviour enfold thee—
                           Oh, the thought is a balm for all grief!
                           And 'tis thus—yes, 'tis thus I behold thee
                           In visions delightful, though brief.

                        Francis the First.
                  
                  
                     HAVRE DE GRACE, ——.
                     MY DEAR JANE:
                  
                  The last wave of your handkerchief, when we parted from you at Southampton made
                     me feel quite sad for some time; but the bustling scene around me at length
                     diverted my thoughts from their gloomy course, and I employed myself in
                     observing the rapid movements of the sailors, as they obeyed the orders of
                     their captain, who had the voice of a stentor, and took no pains to soften it.
                     Our fellow passengers were an elderly gentleman and his two sons, whom he was
                     going to place at a boarding-school near Havre. We reached this celebrated port
                     in the evening, and I am happy to tell you (now that it is over,)
                     not without an adventure.
                  
                  Our parents and Edgar were not very sea-sick, but alas! for Sigismund and
                     myself! we were the Jobs of the party. I mean as regards
                        suffering, not patience; for of the last we both
                     stood in need. I already detest the sea, and dread re-crossing it. But all this
                     time you are unacquainted with our adventure; it was this. When within a few
                     miles of Havre, a sudden squall arose, and for more than an hour our situation
                     was truly terrifying. Fortunately the wind blew from the land, or we should
                     have been wrecked on the "iron-bound coast," which was very near us. The sails
                     of our small vessel flapped with such violence, that the captain says they must
                     have been torn to pieces if they had not been perfectly new.
                  We have occupied ourselves since our arrival here, in walking about the town
                     and riding in its neighborhood. Yesterday we visited the two light-houses on
                     Cape la Heve, and ascended one of them to view from its roof the surrounding
                     country, which is beautiful, and bounded on three sides by the ocean. We
                     purchased of an old woman, residing in the light-house, some specimens of shell
                     work; and I chose for you a little dog, ingeniously made of small white shells,
                     whose tiny black eyes shine as brightly as your own.
                  This morning we surveyed the Frescati Baths, and the reservoir for oysters in
                     front of them. The baths are kept in elegant order, and the spacious mansion
                     containing them presents a handsome exterior. I did not relish the oysters;
                     they taste of copperas, like those we get at home—and this is natural enough,
                     as they come out of the same waters. On the shore, contiguous to the bathing
                     establishment, we witnessed the amusing spectacle of ladies and gentlemen in
                     Turkish costume, struggling in the briny element, whose billows almost threw
                     them down, although supported by the arms of sturdy sailors, and clinging to
                     ropes suspended from stakes on the beach. Last night we went to the theatre,
                     and were much entertained by the performance of Lepeintre, an excellent comic
                     actor from Paris. Havre is enclosed by lofty walls, outside of which are deep
                     moats, and the borders of these are covered with a bright verdure. In the town
                     there is a pleasant walk shaded by lime trees, and the square in front of the
                     theatre is laid off in gravel walks, with seats on each side. Here the gentry
                     of the city, and hosts of children, with their nurses to guard them, assemble
                     every afternoon. It is also used for a military band to play there at sunset.
                     The most interesting object in Havre is an old structure called the "Tower of
                     Francis the First," in which that monarch was sumptuously feasted by the
                     [primeval] inhabitants of this place, three centuries ago. But money must have
                     been of extreme value, and provisions very cheap in that age, as it is said the
                     banquet cost only thirty pounds; or perhaps what then was considered a
                        feast, would in these days of luxury be thought an
                        ordinary meal. The following anecdote will give you an idea of
                     the strength of the edifice. A crazy
                     soldier once shut himself up in it while the garrison were dining, and although
                     he was strongly besieged, maintained possession for two hours ere he was
                     overcome. As we are to rise at five o'clock to-morrow morning, for the purpose
                     of embarking for Rouen in the steamboat, I must retire to rest. Accept our
                     love, and remember us affectionately to aunt Margaret and Albert. I hope you
                     had a safe journey from Southampton, and found all well at the Lodge.
                  
                     Yours,
                     LEONTINE.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER SECOND.

                     ROUEN, ——.
                     MY DEAR JANE:—
                  
                  What a silly creature you are, to be sure!—to have preferred the shades of
                     Morren Lodge, and the company of good aunt Margaret, (not to say that of
                     somebody else, for fear of a blush,) to accompanying us in our present tour! I
                     am more and more enchanted as we proceed, and cannot help bewailing your
                     decision, whenever we are partaking of any pleasure or amusement. 'Tis true,
                     you tell us that after your marriage next spring, Albert intends visiting the
                     continent; but dear me! how many things may occur in the mean-while to alter
                     your plans. Nay, the knot may never be tied—for its no "wonder of wonders'
                     now-a-days for lads and lasses to change their minds. And should you prove a
                     "constant couple," and the wedding take place, I doubt that Albert will be able
                     to tear himself from his books and musty parchments. You know I've often told
                     you, that he never would have fallen in love with your lady-ship, I'm
                     convinced, had he surprised you that eventful morning in papa's study, reading
                     the life of the American President, Thomas Jefferson, while the rest of us were
                     playing at battledore on the lawn; and this you may tell him if you choose.
                     "Well, enough of rattle, Leontine, (I hear you say,) and do let's have
                     something interesting." So you shall, sister Jane; and I hasten to give you an
                     account of our voyage from Havre to this ancient capital. It was delightful! We
                     were favored with clear skies and propitious breezes, and remained on deck the
                     whole day to enjoy the scenery, for the banks of the Seine are highly
                     cultivated, and at every turn present beautiful points of view. We glided by
                     many villages, and several monasteries and castles. Among the former I will
                     only mention Quillebeuf and Candebeck. Quillebeuf is famous for its ninety-nine
                     pilots; and as the navigation there is extremely dangerous for vessels, they
                     have full employment. It is remarkable that their number has always been
                     ninety-nine from time immemorial. Candebeck debeck is situated immediately on the bank of
                     the river, and Vernet, the celebrated marine painter, pronounced the view from
                     its quay one of the most beautiful water prospects in France. An old lady on
                     board the steamboat told mamma and myself, as we were passing Candebeck, that a
                     few miles from it there is a village called St. Arnold, which contains a pool
                     of stagnant water, that many credulous people believe efficacious in healing
                     cutaneous diseases, and that at a certain period of the year, numbers who are
                     afflicted with such disorders go to bathe in the pool. First, however, a
                     particular ceremony must be performed, or the water will have no effect. Each
                     applicant for health must steal from the neighboring woods a
                     stick, and cast it down to assist in forming a pile. In the evening this is set
                     on fire by the curate of the village, who comes forth dressed in his sacerdotal
                     robes, and accompanied by priests chanting a hymn. When the smoke begins to
                     darken the air, a white pigeon is let loose from the spire of the church, and
                     the poor deluded sufferers firmly believe it to be the holy ghost descending
                     from Heaven to cure them! Quillebeuf and Candebeck are both associated with
                     historical recollections. The former was fortified by Henry the Fourth, who
                     considered it an important point, and wished to have it called Henry'sville,
                     after himself. This was not done, however, and since his death the
                     fortifications have been destroyed. It was at Candebeck that William the
                     Conquerer crossed the Seine in 1047, on his way to Arques, to quell a sedition
                     among the people there, under the Count of Arques. It was governed by the
                     famous Talbot during the reign of Henry the Fifth of England, and the
                     inhabitants distinguished themselves by their bravery in a combat with the
                     English. At one period it was noted for its manufactures of hats and gloves;
                     and at that time no one of bon ton would wear
                     a hat that was not made at Candebeck. The revocation of the edict of Nantz
                     proved a death-blow to the industry of this town. Soon after leaving it, we
                     passed the Chateau of La Mailleraie, once the residence of Mademoiselle De la
                     Valliere, during her youth. The mansion is spacious, and its gardens and
                     thickets looked very inviting. In 1824 the Duchess of Berri visited this
                     retreat, and breakfasted in the garden; and to commemorate this circumstance, a
                     white marble column has been erected there. I wonder they did not surmount it
                     with a coffee-pot. Beyond La Mailleraie the scenery is rather
                     monotonous, but at length you approach the Abbey of Jamieges, (founded by St.
                     Philibert,) and the landscape becomes lovely. This noble ruin, with its
                     numerous Gothic windows, was a majestic spectacle. Being situated on a
                     peninsula, round which our course extended, we had a view of it for a
                     considerable time; at last, to my regret, it faded from our sight. Charles the
                     Seventh built a fine villa in the neighborhood of Jamieges, and here the
                     beautiful, but sinful and unhappy Agnes Sorrel, resided. At her death her heart
                     was deposited in the Abbey, and her body carried to Loches, where it was
                     interred with great ceremony in the
                     choir of the collegiate church, for Agnes had been extremely munificent to the
                     canons of Loches, giving them two thousand crowns and quantities of jewels,
                     tapestry and pictures; and these crafty ecclesiastics paid her remains all due
                     respect during the life of Charles the Seventh, her royal lover; but after his
                     demise, while Louis the Eleventh was visiting their church, knowing that he
                     detested Agnes, and designing to flatter him, they pointed out her tomb and
                     requested permission to have it removed. "I consent," replied the monarch,
                     (indignant at their duplicity and ingratitude,) "but you must first restore the
                     riches she lavished upon you." The last object I will now describe to you is
                     the Chateau of "Robert le Diable," a wicked wretch, whose crimes sullied the
                     earth, and whose spirit is believed by the superstitious still to haunt the
                     places that witnessed them. The scanty remains of his fortress are just visible
                     on a rocky height on the southern bank of the Seine. Beneath the steep you
                     behold a La Vacherie, a neat little country seat that is worthy of notice, as
                     being the residence of Madame Bocage when she composed her "Columbiade." We
                     landed at Rouen about six o'clock, and are located in a comfortable hotel,
                     where papa says we will remain until we have seen all the curiosities of this
                     interesting old city. You will therefore hear from me again ere our
                     departure.
                  
                     Yours truly,
                     LEONTINE.

                     ROUEN, ——.
                     MY DEAR JANE:—
                  
                  According to your request and my propensity to scribbling, I intend to be very
                     circumstantial in my details. Pray don't grow tired of them, or if you do, keep
                     it a secret, and my vanity may prevent my suspecting such a misfortune. Mamma
                     gives me great credit for being so industrious with my pen. Sigismund and Edgar
                     keep a journal; but that requires more exactness than I possess, so I prefer
                     writing a letter when the humor takes me. We have been out
                        sight-seeing, every morning and afternoon, until to-day. A
                     brisk rain now confines us to the house, and affords me leisure for again
                     conversing with you. I will commence my agreeable task with a description of
                     the town. Its environs are beautiful, but the interior rather gloomy—the
                     streets are generally so narrow and the houses so old. It was formerly
                     surrounded by walls and moats; the walls have been pulled down, and the moats
                     filled up and converted into public walks. At Rouen, the ancient Dukes of
                     Normandy held their courts, and it contains many vestiges of their
                     magnificence. The palace of justice is a vast Gothic structure of the reign of
                     Louis the Twelfth. Beneath it are prisons, to which they were conducting two culprits as we entered. One
                     of its various halls is of immense extent, and has a singular vaulted ceiling,
                     that reminds you of the hulk of a vessel reversed—a comparison, by the bye,
                     that is not original with me. The venerable cathedral, with its lofty spire and
                     painted windows, engaged us a long while. The spire is three hundred and eighty
                     feet high, and visible seven or eight leagues. There are two towers; one of
                     them denominated the butter tower, because the expense of erecting
                     it was defrayed with money that had been paid by the people for permission to
                     eat butter during lent! It contained an enormous bell, nearly equal in size to
                     that at Moscow, and the founder of it is said to have died in an ecstacy at its
                     completion. This wonderful bell was destroyed during the revolution. Many
                     illustrious persons are buried in the cathedral. Among them, Henry the Fifth of
                     France, Richard Cour de Lion, the Duke of Bedford, and the Cardinals of
                     Amboise. The monument of the two Cardinals is superb, and covered with
                     arabesque work. They are represented kneeling on its summit. Above them is a
                     gilded equestrian statue of St. George, their patron; below them (ranged in
                     niches on the front of the tomb) are small marble figures, emblematical of the
                     virtues they possessed. Opposite this mausoleum is another, equally remarkable.
                     It is dedicated to the Grand Seneschal Breze, the husband of Diana of Poitiers,
                     and Governor of Rouen in the sixteenth century. Of the numerous statues that
                     adorn this tomb, that which represents the Seneschal as an extended corpse is
                     the most striking, and it is inimitably executed. The pinched nose, tight drawn
                     skin, hollow cheeks, and sunken eyes, give it the exact appearance of a dead
                     body. Over the grand altar of the church hangs a fine painting, by Philip de
                     Champagne; the subject of it is the adoration of the Magi, and the light is
                     ingeniously and beautifully reflected from the infant Jesus, (the
                        light of the world,) upon the surrounding objects. But enough
                     of the cathedral, Allons a Saint Ouen, famous for its fine interior
                     perspective, which is curiously and perfectly delineated by reflection on the
                     surface of the holy water, in the baptismal font, near the chief portal of the
                     church. St. Ouen was originally a Benedictine abbey. Its architect, Berneval,
                     is buried in one of the chapels, and there is an improbable
                     tradition concerning him, viz: that he was hung for assassinating his
                     apprentice, who, by excelling him in carving some trifling ornament for the
                     ceiling, had excited his jealousy. The painted windows of St. Ouen are
                     beautiful, and shed a mellow lustre over its triple aisle, which we regretted
                     to exchange for the glare of the sun without; but time pressed, and we hastened
                     to view the picture gallery and public library in the Hotel de Ville—neither of
                     them extensive, though worthy of examination. We next proceeded to the square
                     of Joan of Arc, where a statue of her is erected on the spot upon which she was
                     burnt as a sorceress in 1430. Last night we went to the play. The theatre is a
                     handsome edifice and the ceiling
                     exhibits the apothesis of Pierre Corneille. You behold him crowned by tragedy,
                     while painting and sculpture vie in copying his features, and fame sounds his
                     praise to the world. Apollo sheds over him his brightness, and time with his
                     scythe drives away envy and other evil genii inimical to his glory. The ladies
                     here dress well and tastefully, but the costume of the peasants is very queer.
                     It is the same throughout Normandy. They wear high crowned muslin caps, tight
                     boddices, full plaited short petticoats garnished with rows of black velvet,
                     blue stockings clocked with red, and black sharp-toed shoes, cut low on the
                     instep, and ornamented with rosettes. They always have a gold cross, suspended
                     from a black ribbon encircling the neck, and a pair of gold earrings. But here
                     am I continuing to scribble, and the weather has cleared off and the carriage
                     is ordered for a drive, and I verily believe coming to the door. There! papa
                     calls me to descend. In haste, farewell.

                     DEAR JANE:—
                  
                  "Another letter from Rouen!" you'll exclaim; yes, my dear sister, even so,—for
                     papa being well pleased with our accommodations here, and finding the town
                     contains more curiosities than travellers are usually aware of, we have thus
                     prolonged our stay; but to-morrow go we must, as our seats are
                     engaged in the diligence for Paris. Since I wrote you three days ago, we have
                     seen divers other objects worthy of notice, though not so interesting as those
                     I have described to you. To-day we saw the bridge of boats which connects the
                     city with the suburbs of Saint Severe; it rises and falls with the tide, and is
                     divided into compartments that can be easily separated for ships to pass
                     through at any moment. The invention of this bridge is attributed to an
                     Augustin monk. A handsome stone bridge is now building over another part of the
                     Seine.
                  Every evening at 9 o'clock we hear the tones of a clear sonorous bell, sounding
                     what is termed the "retreat." This is merely the continuation of
                     an ancient custom, practiced during the Norman wars, when it was necessary to
                     give a signal for those persons who might be without the city to enter, ere the
                     gates were shut for the night. This bell is also rung on occasions of public
                     ceremonies, festivities, or calamities, and is called the silver
                     bell, because, according to tradition, it was made of money raised
                     from taxes. It hangs in the belfry of a curious old Gothic tower, whose archway
                     spans one of the chief streets of Rouen, and on the side of which is placed the
                     city clock, resembling the face of a gigantic watch. This afternoon we purpose
                        visiting the botanical garden, and
                     after that, taking a farewell drive in the neighborhood of the town; there are
                     many beautiful prospects to be seen from the surrounding hills.
                  Yesterday Edgar and myself walked to the terrace of St. Paul, a plain and
                     antique little church, built, it is said, on the ruins of a temple of Adonis.
                     From the terrace you enjoy a fine view; and near it is a mineral spring, the
                     second in Rouen. Here we met with a number of ladies and gentlemen, and were
                     much diverted at the tricks of a fellow who mimicked the peculiarities of
                     different nations; and when about to show off the English, cried
                     out, "Maintenant pour 'Got dam;'" he made the most ridiculous faces you can
                     imagine, and excited great mirth. It was surprising what power of muscle and
                     expression he possessed; one moment his nose appeared turned up, his eyes
                     squinting and his mouth too small to admit a plum; the next, you'd
                     think he could take in a melon—and his physiognomy would so
                     completely change, that you could scarcely believe it was the same person
                     before you. Sometimes, to increase the effect, he put on a huge pair of
                     spectacles and sung a droll song, a companion playing merrily on the violin all
                     the while, and suiting the melody to the performance. After this came a band of
                     tumblers, and three children tawdrily dressed—exhibited sundry feats on the
                     back of a chair, and on the head and shoulders of a man. It was painful to
                     behold the little creatures in such jeopardy; and having contributed tributed
                     our sous for their benefit, we quitted the scene. Adieu.

                     DEAR JANE:—
                  
                  Not a question, I pray you! about the journey from Rouen hither. I can only
                     tell you that we chose the lower route; that the prospects were lovely and the
                     diligence rolled rapidly along the banks of the Seine; that we stopped only to
                     swallow our meals as quickly as possible, and had not time to examine any
                     thing. We entered Paris by the Porte de Neuilly and Champs Elysees, at dusk,
                     and witnessed the beautiful sight the latter presents, when illuminated by its
                     numerous lamps, which, instead of being fixed on posts, were suspended high
                     above our heads from ropes swung across the road. The resemblance of these
                     lamps, when lighted to a range of brilliant stars, occasions the gate by which
                     we entered to be called the "barriere de l'etoile." We found rooms ready for
                     us, papa having written to request Mr.
                     Dorval to engage a suite in the pleasantest quarter of the city.
                  Here there are four modes of living customary among visiters. First, boarding
                     in a hotel by the day, week, or month: second, boarding at a lodging house by
                     the week, month or year: third, hiring furnished apartments and eating at a
                     restaurateur's, or being supplied thence: fourth, furnishing rooms yourself,
                     and having your own cook. The first of these plans, being the least
                     troublesome, we have preferred. It is, however, more expensive than either of
                     the others. Our hotel is delightfully situated, and commands a view of the
                     Italian Boulevard and of the Rue de la Paix, at the corner of which it stands;
                     the latter, one of the widest and handsomest streets in the metropolis. From
                     our windows we can also see the "Place Vendome," with its superb and stately
                     bronze column, erected by Napoleon, in imitation of that of Trajan at Rome. It
                     is made of the cannons taken by him at the battle of Austerlitz; the principal
                     events of that campaign are represented in a bas-relief, which is carried spirally around the whole shaft, the
                     figure of the Emperor being prominent in each compartment. His statue formerly
                     crowned the summit of the column; but since his downfall it has been removed,
                     and the vacancy is now supplied by a simple banner.*
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     *The statue of Napoleon has been replaced since the last revolution; the
                        dress is the great coat and three cornered cocked hat in which he is so
                        frequently represented, and he holds in his hand a short telescope, or
                        rather opera glass.
                  
                  Beyond the Place Vendome is the Rue Castiglione, with its fine shops and
                     arcades; and at the end of this street is the garden of the Tuileries, where we
                     repair before breakfast every morning, to enjoy its shades, and contemplate its
                     statues, flowers and fountains. In flowers it always abounds, for they are
                     planted in pots concealed in the ground; and as soon as one set goes out of
                     season, it is replaced by another in bloom.
                  From eleven until four o'clock we study the pictures in the magnificent gallery
                     of the Louvre, whose halls are open for the benefit of strangers and students
                     on every day of the week, except Monday. On Sunday they are open
                     to every body, and consequently on Monday require the operations
                     of the broom and brush. The halls appropriated to sculpture are on the ground
                     floor, and the ceilings of several are superbly painted. It was from the window
                     of one of these apartments that Charles the Ninth fired upon his persecuted
                     subjects during the massacre of St. Bartholomews, (August 24, 1572.)
                  Our usual evening resort is the Boulevard, where we listen to music, and
                     observe the motley crowds around us; and when tired, refresh ourselves with
                     ices or lemonade in a cafe.
                  Dear me! how tastefully the French ladies dress! What beautiful robes, and
                     hats, and gloves, and shoes and boots, they wear! and how well each article
                     corresponds with another. If they have on different colors, they take care
                        that they shall contrast agreeably,
                     and not be an uncouth mixture, displeasing to the eye. In the morning their
                     toilette is remarkably neat and appropriate. You'll probably find them, when
                     you call, in a simple gingham dress, with pelerine to suit, and a black silk
                     apron; their hair arranged in puffs, and quite unadorned. Now, is this not more
                     rational than to be furbelowed, and curled, and richly clad, as if they were
                     expecting company, instead of being usefully employed? At entertainments and in
                     the public promenades, they display their fine clothes. We have already
                     received and returned the visits of several of the French families to whom we
                     brought letters; but much to our regret, the venerable Count Segur is out of
                     town, and Baron Hottinguer, his lady and son, are at their country seat. The
                     Minister of the Marine (Mr. Hyde de Neuville) and Madame his spouse, are
                     extremely pleasing and amiable. They still have their regular soirées,
                     notwithstanding the advanced season, and we intend to avail ourselves of their
                     polite invitation to attend them. By the bye, I should tell you (what M. Dorval
                     told me,) that in Paris many persons have an appointed evening for
                     receiving their acquaintances, once a week, fortnight, or month, (as suits
                     their convenience,) and on this evening they illuminate their rooms for the
                     reception of their guests. The greater number of these remain only a half hour,
                     and then repair to the opera, or to some other soirée, as such an assembly is termed. It is usual to go to three
                     or four on the same night. There is seldom any refreshments freshments offered,
                     and the amusements are conversation and ecarte—sometimes billiards; and when
                     the soiree is social and small, they even introduce childish plays, such as
                     "Colin-Maillard," "Le Mouchoir," "Tierce," &c. in which elderly people
                     frequently join with all the vivacity of youth.
                  Monsieur and Madame de Neuville reside in a superb mansion, that was formerly
                     the "Garde meuble," or royal wardrobe. It is now called the "Admiralty," and
                     appropriated to the use of the Minister of the Marine and Colonies. On its roof
                     is a telegraph, and its front is embellished with sculpture and columns, which
                     support a portico as long as the building itself.
                  A few nights since we were at the Theatre Francais, and saw Mademoiselle Mars
                     perform the part of the Duchesse de Guise in "Henri Trois." To the astonishment
                     of every body she excels in this character, although it is a difficult one to
                     play, and her first attempt at tragedy. Her talents, hitherto, you know, have
                     been devoted to comedy. She is the most lovely and youthful looking woman of
                     her age I ever beheld. What do you think of her being past fifty, and yet not
                     appearing as old as twenty-five? She is so graceful too, and then her voice is
                     melody itself. But I must cease my encomiums, or I shall not have space to
                     assure you that I am your affectionate sister,

                     DEAR JANE:
                  
                  What a variety of places we have visited since I despatched to you my last
                     letter. Par exemple, the Palais Royal, with
                     its agreeable garden and jets d'eau, surrounded by arcades, under which are
                     splendid shops and cafés, that are dazzling when illuminated at night; the
                     Royal Library, with its vast collection of manuscripts and engravings, and its
                     cabinets of antiquities and medals—the latter considered to be the most
                     complete in the world; the Hotel de Ville, on the Place de Greve, where the
                     guillotine sometimes plies its dreadful work; the Exchange, with its sixty-four
                     corinthian columns, fine hall, and superb imitations of bas-reliefs, so
                     admirably executed, that you can scarcely be convinced they are the effect of
                     the brush instead of the chisel. Add to these several
                     churches and fountains; the Mint, where we witnessed the curious process of
                     coining, and the "Palais de Justice." In this vast structure of antiquity, the
                     judicial courts of Paris hold their sittings. It was founded in the ninth
                     century, and is termed a palace, because it was once the abode of the French
                     monarchs. I remember having read in some history of the magnificent
                     entertainments they gave here, in a grand hall containing statues of their race
                     and a marble table of uncommon size, at which none but princes of the blood
                     were allowed to feast. In 1618 nearly the whole edifice was burnt, and the
                     wonderful table and statues destroyed; it was rebuilt by Desbrosses, the
                     architect of the Luxembourg. Besides the court rooms and many others above
                     them, filled with the judiciary archives of the kingdom, there are long
                     galleries which have on each side rows of petty shops and stalls. Beneath these
                     galleries are the gloomy prisons of the conciergerie, wherein such attrocities
                     were committed during the revolution. Here we saw the dungeons in which Marie
                     Antoinette and the Princess Elizabeth were immured; the cell in which
                     Robespierre was confined; and that of Louvel, who assassinated the Duke de
                     Berri. We were shown the prison room of the gallant Ney. The cells that
                     inclosed the unfortunate queen and her sister-in-law are now converted into a
                     small chapel, which communicates, by means of an arch, with another of larger
                     dimensions. In the latter, the captives of the, conciergerie are permitted to
                     attend mass on the Sabbath. The arch is decorated with medallions of Louis the
                     Sixteenth and the Princess Elizabeth, and a few lines extracted from his will
                     are inscribed on an altar in the smaller chapel. On the wall of this hang three
                     pictures in oil colors; the first represents Marie Antoinette taking leave of
                     her family just before she was brought to the prison; in the second, you behold
                     her standing wrapt in meditation by her miserable cot-bed, after the door is barred upon her; in
                     the third, you see her at confession, preparatory to ascending the scaffold.
                     Melancholy themes, and well suited to the gloom of the place! You approach the
                     Palace of Justice through an enormous iron gate remarkable for its workmanship
                     and gilding. On the left of it stands an ancient building, called the "Holy
                     Chapel," from its having been erected by Saint Louis for the reception of the
                     sacred relics he brought with him from Palestine, whither he went on a crusade,
                     in fulfilment of a vow he had made during a dangerous illness. His oratory is
                     still shewn, and once served as a refuge from popular fury to the present King
                     Charles the Tenth, in the time of the revolution. The painted windows of the
                     chapel are beautiful,—the colors so bright and various. Around the interior,
                     instead of altars and confessionals, are a range of cases,
                     containing archives and records. By the bye, among those we saw in the upper
                     galleries of the Palace of Justice, (which communicates with the "Sainte
                     Chapelle,") were the condemnation of Joan of Arc, and that of Jean Chatel, who
                     attempted to stab Henry the Fourth, but failed, and having been seized was put
                     to a dreadful death, according to the mandate which we read. He was stretched
                     on the rack, then drawn on a sledge to the Place de Greve, his flesh torn with
                     hot pincers, and his right hand cut off; finally, his limbs were tied to four
                     wild horses, and thus rent asunder. When dead, his body was burnt, and his
                     ashes scattered to the winds. The dress he wore when he attacked the King, and
                     a rope ladder he used in endeavoring to escape while confined, are carefully
                     preserved in a box, with a scull that was found in the possession of a famous
                     robber, and is said to have served him as a cup, out of which he compelled his
                     victims to drink wine, and then swear allegiance to him. The condemnation of
                     Joan of Arc is replete with superstition and abuse of that poor warrior damsel;
                     she is pronounced a sorceress, a blasphemer, a devil, &c., and numerous
                     other opprobious epithets are given to her besides. We were likewise shown the
                     hand-writing of Francis the First, Louis the Eleventh, and that of several
                     others of the French monarchs; and to speak the truth. I don't think their
                     penmanship does them much credit.
                  Returning home, we stopped at the flower market, and were surprised at the
                     beauty and cheapness of the flowers. You may buy them growing in pots, or
                     arranged as bouquets. The market is held on the Quay Dessaix, under two rows of
                     trees, in the midst of which a plentiful fountain refreshes the air, and
                     affords water for the plants. Adieu. Ever yours,
                  
                     LEONTINE.
                  
               
               
                  
                  LETTER SEVENTH.
                  
                     Church of St. Roch—Pere la Chase.
                  
                  
                     PARIS, ——.
                     DEAR SISTER:—
                  
                  Your letter (received within a few hours) gave us all great pleasure, and we
                     are rejoiced to learn that folks and things are going
                     on so well at the Lodge. What a fine time you and Albert have for
                        sentimentalizing! Make the best of it; for you know October is
                     only a few months off, and when it comes you'll perhaps find me at your elbow
                     oftener than you anticipate. I shall have so much to talk about; for believe
                     me, although my communications are so long and frequent, a great deal will
                     remain to be told when we reach "sweet home."
                  Now, let me inform you of the strange sight we have just been witnessing in the
                     Church of St. Roch; a funeral and two weddings solemnizing in the same place
                     and at the same moment! To us it was shocking, and certes if I had been one of the votaries of hymen on
                     the occasion, I should have experienced sad forbodings of evil in the connubial
                     state. Really, it was sometimes difficult to hear the priests who were
                     performing the marriage rites, their voices being drowned in the loud requiem
                     chanted over the dead. The coffin was strewed with white flowers, emblematical
                     of the youth and maidenhood of the deceased.
                  We have visited Pere la Chase, and spent nearly a whole day in reading the
                     inscriptions on its numerous and varied monuments,—many of them so magnificent!
                     many so neat and simple! The inscriptions are generally beautiful and
                     touching—they speak to the hearts of all; and the lovely and odoriferous
                     flowers that decorate the tombs, seem to rob the grave of its sadness, and shed
                     their balmy influence o'er the mind of the beholder. Several tombs are also
                     adorned with miniatures inserted in the stone, and portraying the once animated
                     countenances of those who rest beneath them. This romantic burying ground
                     spreads itself over the side of a hill, and from the upper part you have a
                     noble prospect of the city and its environs. In the fourteenth century it was
                     the site of a splendid mansion, built by a wealthy grocer, whose name was
                     Regnaud. Its magnificence being incompatible with his rank, it was soon
                     entitled "Regnaud's Folly." The Jesuits afterwards obtained possession of it,
                     and gave it the name of "Mont Louis," because Louis the Fourteenth when a boy
                     witnessed from its summit the battle in the Faubourg St. Antoine, between the
                        Frondeurs,*
                      commanded by the Prince of Conde, and the Court Party, under Marshal
                     Turenne. I recollect reading in
                     Voltaire's history of that monarch's reign, that during this bloody skirmish,
                     Mademoiselle d'Orleans(Louis' cousin) sided with the Prince of Conde, and had
                     the cannons of the Bastile pointed against the royal troops. This ruined her
                     forever in the opinion of the king; and Cardinal Mazarin remarked, knowing her
                     desire to marry a crowned head, "ce canon la, vient de
                        teur son mari"—"that cannon has killed her husband." Bnt I've
                     digressed from my original theme, and hasten to resume it. Pere la Chase, one
                     of the Jesuits, became confessor to Louis, and had entire control of
                     ecclesiastical affairs. The King was very fond of him, and as a mark of his
                     esteem, presented him with the estate of "Mont Louis," having considerably
                     enlarged and embellished it for his use. On the death of the holy father, it
                     reverted to his brethren, and was called after him. These wily priests
                     projected there the Revocation of the edict of Nantes, and issued thence many a
                     lettre de cachet, decreeing imprisonment to their enemies. They retained
                     possession of the place until the abolishment of their order in 1763, when it
                     was sold for the benefit of their creditors, and had divers owners, until
                     purchased by the Prefect of the Seine, and appropriated to its present purpose
                     in 1804. There are three kinds of graves: first, those termed
                        public, in which the poor are gratuitously buried; but each
                     body can remain only five years, the time supposed to be sufficient for its
                     decomposition. These graves resemble immense ditches, and the coffins are
                     deposited one upon another, and side by side, as close as they can lay. They
                     are wretchedly made, and soon drop to pieces; and therefore it is not uncommon,
                     in burying a corpse, to see the exposed head and limbs of another! Is'nt this
                     horrible? Second, temporary graves, wherein the dead remain
                     undisturbed during ten years, for the sum of fifty francs. At the close of that
                     period, unless the grave be rendered of the third kind, perpetual,
                     by the payment of a larger portion of money, its ghastly tenant is removed. The
                     oldest and most interesting sepulcher is that of Abelard and Heloise; it is
                     formed of the ruins of the paraclete, and covered with antique sculpture and
                     ornaments. It represents a gothic chapel, in the center of which the bodies of
                     the lovers are represented extended on a bier; the whole is of gray stone. The
                     monument of the Countess Demidoff, a Russian lady, we considered the richest
                     and handsomest in the collection. It is composed of pure white marble highly
                     polished. A part of the cemetery is appropriated to the use of strangers, and a
                     considerable space allowed to the Jews. The gate is always thronged with
                     carriages that have brought either visiters or mourners. On each side of the
                     entrance are stalls, where wreaths and bunches of flowers may be purchased. I
                     must now conclude, and am sure you will dream of church-yards and hobgoblins,
                     after reading this letter, from your attached
                  
                     LEONTINE.
                  
                  
                     
                     *This party were termed frondeurs or
                        slingers by their opponents, in allusion to the boys who were then in the
                        habit of throwing stones with slings in the street, and who ran away when
                        any one appeared. The Sobriquet, as has
                        frequently happened, was adopted by them as their distinctive
                        appellation.
                  
               
               
                  
                  LETTER EIGHTH.
                  
                     Hotel des Invalides—Chamber of Deputies—Pont Louis 16th—Bridges of Paris—The
                        Pont Neuf.
                  
                  
                     PARIS, ——.
                     DEAR JANE:
                  
                  "Let them gild the dome of the Hotel des Invalides," said Napoleon to an
                     officer, who informed him that unless the war with Italy was discontinued,
                     there would certainly be a revolution in Paris. The mandate was issued, the
                     dome covered with the shining leaf, and the minds of the people immediately
                     turned from the operations of war, to those of the artizans employed on the
                     cupola of the military asylum. Napoleon foresaw this, for well he knew the
                     character of his subjects. A mere trifle, having novelty to
                     recommend it, attracts their notice, engages their attention, and forms the
                     theme of their conversation for a long while—at least, until another new bubble
                     arises. This we must own is a happy disposition, and better calculated to
                     render a nation contented and joyous, than the sober, phlegmatic temperament of
                     our Islanders.
                  Thus, my dear Jane, have I managed to describe to you, in a very few words, the
                     dome of the Invalids and the character of the Parisians. Knowing you hate
                     prolixity, I rejoice at my success, and for the same reason, proceed without
                     delay to give you an account of the Hospital in question tion. It is a stately
                     edifice, and was erected by Louis 14th, for the reception of brave and disabled
                     old soldiers. In approaching it, you traverse a vast esplanade embellished with
                     a fountain and bordered by a grove of lofty trees, with seats beneath them to
                     tempt the lounger and rest the weary; some of them were occupied by veterans
                     whom I readily imagined to be telling "how fields were won." We spent three
                     hours in their noble asylum, examining its spacious halls and dormitories, its
                     cleanly and well-arranged kitchen, its library and magnificent church, and its
                     cabinet of architecture, which consists of two large rooms, containing models
                     of all the fortified towns in the kingdom. These are most ingeniously and
                     beautifully executed, and give you a perfect idea of the places they represent.
                     The council chamber adjoins the library, and this and two other apartments are
                     decorated with the portraits of the deceased marshals of France: while the
                     originals are living, their likenesses are deposited in the "Salle des
                     Marecheaux," at the Palace of the Tuileries. In the church we saw the mausoleum
                     of Turenne and that of the famous engineer Vauban.*
                      The interior of the dome and the ceilings of six chapels surrounding it
                     are richly painted, and the tesselated pavement, interspersed with fleurs de
                     lis and other symbols, is exceedingly beautiful. Three hundred flags, the
                     spoils of different
                     
                        
                        *He was deformed, and being once asked by the king what his enemies
                           thought of his back,—"Sire, (he replied,) they have never seen it."
                      ent nations, were
                     once suspended from the dome; but when the allies entered Paris, the
                        invalid warriors tore them down to prevent their being
                     retaken.
                  From the Hotel des Invalides we rode to the Chamber of Deputies, adjoining the
                     palace of Bourbon, and situated on the southern bank of the Seine, which
                     separates it from the "Place Louis Quinze." It is a handsome building, adorned
                     with statues and corinthian columns, and has a pleasant garden attached to it;
                     the deputies hold their assemblies in a semi-circular hall, lighted from the
                     top and appropriately arranged. Monsieur de N—— was so kind and polite as to
                     send us tickets, and we have been twice to hear the debates; they were very
                     animated, though whenever a member wished to speak, he was obliged to curb the
                        spirit that moved him, until he could cross the floor and mount
                     a rostrum, which delay I should think is most unfavorable to extemporary
                     eloquence.
                  Returning, we passed over the Pont Louis Seize, and examined the twelve
                     colossal figures of white marble that have been recently placed on it; they are
                     masterly pieces of sculpture, but too gigantic for the size of the bridge and
                     their approximation to you. There are no less than seventeen bridges athwart
                     the Seine, but not one of them can be compared to those of Waterloo,
                     Blackfriar's, or Westminster at London, as regards strength or magnitude. The
                     Pont Neuf is the largest; it is more than sixty feet wide, and lined on each
                     side with stalls of every description; the passengers are continually beset by
                     the importunities of the shoe-black, the dog-shaver, the ballad singer, the
                     bird seller, the fruiterer, the pedler, the vender of second-hand books, and
                     various other petty dealers. Good night, dear sister. My paper and candle warn
                     me to conclude, which I fear you will not regret.

                     MY DEAR JANE:
                  
                  We were agreeably surprised the day before yesterday, while at dinner, by the
                     arrival of the Danvilles, the American family with whom we were so charmed at
                     Bath last summer. Leonora is as lovely as ever, and delighted at the idea of
                     spending the fall and winter here; she expects, too, to be joined by her cousin
                     Marcella, of whom we have heard her speak with such affection and admiration.
                     She has been so good as to let me read her journal, and I have obtained her
                     permission to transcribe a part of it for your perusal. It concerns the journey from Calais to Paris, and
                     as I have given you a sketch of that from Havre here, this will enable you to
                     compare the two routes. I dare say you will like, also, to read her
                     observations about the Thames and our steam boats. She writes thus:
                  "Soon after leaving London, the Thames quite astonished me. I had no idea it
                     was so considerable a river. For many miles it is broad and winding, and each
                     shore presents fine scenery. We had a good view of several noted towns, and
                     remarked the superb hospital at Greenwich and the royal dock yard at Woolwich,
                     where ships of war are made. At Gravesend we passed two vessels transporting
                     convicts to Botany Bay, and I regretted to observe that the women were more
                     numerous than the men.
                  "The motion of the English steam boats is still more disagreeable than that of
                     ours, but their machinery is less noisy, Coal being used for fuel instead of
                     wood, the passengers soon look dingy in face and dress: therefore one should
                     not travel in them handsomely clad, as clothes are quickly ruined by the smoke
                     and dust. There is no particular hour for breakfast; each person calls for it
                     when it suits his pleasure, and has a table to himself. Dinner is served at
                     five o'clock.
                  "We reached Calais about eight P. M. At the custom house the officers were not
                     strict in their examination of our luggage; this surprised us, for we had
                     understood that they were always very rigid in performing this troublesome
                     duty. Perhaps our being Americans was the cause of their mode ration in
                     disturbing our trunks and boxes,—for the French like us almost as
                     much as they detest the English. On landing, we were highly
                     diverted at the scene on the Quay. The instant we left the boat we were beset
                     with men and boys on every side, recommending different hotels,—and frequently
                     cards of address were absolutely forced into our hands. When one overheard
                     another advising any of us to go to a particular house, he would cry out,
                     "never do you mind that fellow, ma'am, (or sir,) he tells a lie; he always
                     tells lies!" Or, "no such thing, sir; that house is full, sir; you can't get
                     in, and he knows it!" Or, "that hotel is not a good one, sir,—indeed it is not;
                     try mine, sir; mine's a palace to it!" and fifty other such droll speeches, at
                     which (tormented as we were) we could not help laughing. Sometimes they would
                     even seize us by the arm and entreat us to accompany them to their hotel, if
                     only to see how comfortable it was. These besiegers (we have since
                     been told) receive a trifle from every innkeeper to whom they carry a guest,
                     and it is their anxiety to obtain this fee that renders them so annoying to
                     travellers.
                  "Ere leaving Calais, we had sufficient leisure to walk about the town and visit
                     the church, the town hall on the "place d'armes," and the column on the pier
                     commemorating the landing of Louis 18th, on the 24th of April, 1814. It is a
                     plain stone pillar, surmounted by a ball and a fleur de lis. In front of it is
                     a representation in bronze of the print of the king's foot (or rather his shoe)
                     upon the spot he first stepped on from the vessel. We found the country between
                        Calais and Paris uninteresting and
                     generally barren. Once or twice we had a fine view of the sea. The French
                     villages appeared horribly dirty after the exquisite neatness of those in
                     England. The highways presented a bustling and entertaining scene; for men and
                     women, boys and girls, gaily dressed, continually passed us, carrying baskets
                     of fruits, riding on donkeys, or driving along pigs, sheep, cows, or geese. The
                     venders of fruit would frequently jump up behind our carriage, and thrust in,
                     at the window, peaches, pears and grapes, beseeching us to buy them, and
                     assuring us we had never tasted better in all our lives. Whenever we stopped at
                     an inn, or ascended a hill, we were surrounded by dozens of paupers, begging
                     for a sous. Sometimes they looked so miserable, it was impossible to refuse; at
                     others, we were fain to bestow it in order to get rid of them. Little urchins
                     would also solicit a penny, and scamper after us a considerable distance, often
                     springing up behind and sticking their heads into the coach. Upon the whole, I
                     am contented with our journey hither; for if it was not picturesque, it was
                     highly amusing.
                  "The principal towns we have passed through, are Boulogne, Abbeville, and
                     Beauvais. The first is said to have been founded by Julius Cæsar; and Le Sage,
                     the author of Gil Blas, died there in 1747; the house in which he expired, is
                     yet shewn as a curiosity. Within a mile of Boulogne is a corinthian column,
                     which Bonaparte began to erect as a memento of his victories over the English;
                     he left it unfinished, and Louis 18th had it completed for his own honor and
                     glory."
                  Thus far, dear sister, I have copied from Leonora's diary; now for something of
                     my own. Last night we were at M. de Neuville's grand levee; he has one every
                     week, and being exceedingly popular, his rooms are generally crowded. We saw,
                     there, many distinguished characters; among them, Monsieur de Chateaubriand,
                     whose travels have afforded us so much entertainment and instruction, and
                     General Saldanha, the brave Portuguese. He has a commanding figure and face,
                     and wears a pair of tremendous mustachios, which are so frightful and so
                     fashionable! To-day we devoted a portion of our time to the Expiatory Chapel, a
                     beautiful building, constructed in honor of Louis 16th and Marie Antoinette; it
                     covers the spot where their remains were first interred; for since the
                     restoration of the Bourbons, these have been conveyed to the royal vault at St.
                     Denis. The entrance and interior of the chapel are very handsome; the light is
                     admitted from the cupola, beneath which are fifteen niches, destined to hold
                     statues of the chief victims of the revolution. There is a neat altar, and the
                     will of Louis and that of his sister (the Princess Elizabeth) are engraved in
                     golden letters, on two white marble tablets. A subterranean apartment contains
                     another altar; and in front of this, a black marble slab, bearing an
                     inscription, still designates the original grave of the royal and unfortunate
                     pair. In the court of the chapel, many of their faithful Swiss guards are interred. The testament of Louis,
                     wherein he expresses good will towards his enemies, and forgiveness of his
                     unloyal and cruel subjects, is very touching. A peasant girl was reading it
                     when we entered, and her cheeks were bedewed with tears.
                  I regret to inform you that mama has had a return of her consumptive cough, and
                     is compelled to drink asses' milk. She is plentifully supplied with it every
                     morning, by an old man who drives a flock of female asses about the streets,
                     and milks them before the door of each customer. The tingling of a little bell,
                     which he carries, gives notice of his arrival whenever he stops. Farewell: kind
                     greetings to those around you,—and above all to yourself. From

                     DEAREST JANE:
                  
                  On inquiring the day of the month, I am quite surprised to find that my pen has
                     been idle nearly a week. I will now try to make up for lost time, by describing
                     to you some of the places we have visited in the interim; and the Luxembourg
                     being first on the list, will commence with that. It is one of the most
                     magnificent palaces in Paris. The exterior is highly embellished, and, to use
                     the words of an English tourist, "the architecture throughout is distinguished
                     by its bold and masculine character, and by the regularity and beauty of its
                     proportions." This palace was built by order of Mary de Medici, the widow of
                     Henry 4th; it afterwards became the property of some of the French nobility,
                     but was finally restored to the crown. During the revolution, it was used as a
                     prison; the Senate afterwards occupied it; at present it contains the Chamber
                     of Peers,—and its galleries are filled with the chef d'œuvres of modern
                     artists, whose productions are not admitted into the Louvre until their death.
                     Of course, the collection of paintings here is much smaller than at the Louvre;
                     but the pictures are all on the most interesting subjects, and are seen to
                     greater advantage, the light being let in from above instead of from the sides
                     of the rooms, as is the case at the Louvre. There are some choice pieces of
                     sculpture; one of them (by Charles Dupaty) represents the Nymph Biblis changing
                     to a fountain. It is both a singular and ingenious production. The Chamber of
                     Peers, like that of the Deputies, is semi-circular in shape; it is hung with
                     blue velvet; and the marble effigies of several orators, legislators and
                     warriors of old, grace its walls. From the ceiling, which is painted, hangs a
                     splendid chandelier. I will only mention one or two more of the apartments—the
                     Salle du Trone,*
                      as being particularly rich, and the billiard room, which is tapestried
                      with white velvet
                         
                         *Hall of the Throne.
                       vet, with various
                     views of Rome beautifully delineated on it in water colors. On the ground floor
                     is the chapel—this is very plain; near it is the gorgeous chamber of Marie de
                     Medicis,—the ceiling, walls and shutters of which are covered with gilding and
                     arabesque paintings. The principal staircase of the palace is remarkably grand
                     and magnificent; there are forty-eight steps, each twenty feet in length, and
                     formed of a single stone; on the right and left of it, are statues and
                     trophies. The garden of the Luxembourg is shady and pleasant, and has the usual
                     embellishments of gods and goddesses amid fountains and flowers. As you are
                     fond of the marvellous, I will tell you a tradition I have just read respecting
                     it.
                  There once stood a castle on the site of this garden, which, remaining a long
                     while uninhabited, was said to be haunted by frightful demons and apparitions;
                     the whole neighborhood was nightly disturbed by them; no person would venture
                     out after sunset, and finally the inhabitants were compelled, for the sake of
                     rest, to seek other dwellings. In this state of things, the monks of a
                     Carthusian monastery at Gentilly (who were doubtless at the bottom of the
                     mystery) promised to drive away the malicious spirits by exorcism, if St. Louis
                     would grant them the castle and its appurtenances. Their request was complied
                     with; and they so faithfully performed their part, that peace was soon
                     restored, and the chateau converted into a convent, which existed about six
                     hundred years.
                  From the Luxembourg we proceeded through a long sunny avenue, to the
                     observatory. On the left of the road, Arnaud, our valet de place, pointed out
                     the spot upon which Marshal Ney was shot. "Regardez, Mesdames! ce fut la
                     (pointing with his finger) l'endroit ou le brave Maréchal Ney fut
                     massacré—Jétais présent et il me semble que je le vois tout sanglant dans ce
                     moment," said he, shuddering. We paused to look at the once bloody spot, now
                     verdant with grass and so sadly interesting. The observatory may be considered
                     a wonderful building, for neither iron or wood have been used in its
                     construction; it is entirely of stone, each piece being ingeniously fitted to
                     another. Four astronomers pursue their avocations here, and have the advantage
                     of a good library and apparatus; there are, likewise, an anemometer for
                     indicating the course of the wind, and a pluviometer for measuring the quantity
                     of rain that falls at Paris. A geometrical staircase leads to the entrance of
                     some spacious caverns where experiments in congelation are made, and these
                     caverns communicate with subterranean galleries that were originally quarries,
                     and extend a considerable distance under the city, containing beautiful
                     stalacities, formed by water oozing through the rocks. We did not see them, for
                     they cannot be entered without a special guide, and a written permission from
                     certain persons appointed by government to superintend and inspect them.
                  But my stars! I have exhausted nearly all my paper, and have yet a dozen places
                     to describe! Well, well, you must be
                     contented with an account of two of the most important; and by the time I have
                     finished with them, I shall have to squeeze in my name, no doubt.
                     And now let me decide which of the various objects we have examined, I ought to
                     regard as chief. Why, the mother church of France "Notre Dame," and the
                     Pantheon, to be sure! The first is the most ancient religious structure in the
                     city, and is pronounced to be one of the handsomest in the kingdom. Being built
                     in the Gothic ages, its architecture is according to the fashion of those
                     times, very singular and bold. The interior of the building corresponds with
                     the outside in curious carving and designs; the choir and the stalls
                     surrounding it are covered with grotesque sculpture. There are no less than
                     thirty chapels, and all of them contain pictures, but are generally very
                     indifferent. There are several fine ones around the choir—among them the
                     "Visitation," by Jean Jouvenet; this painting was executed entirely with his
                     left hand, after he lost the use of his right by a paralytic stroke. Behind the
                     altar, is a good piece of sculpture by Coustou; the subject is the "descent
                     from the cross." In the vestry room, we were shown some extraordinary
                     relics,—such as part of the crown of thorns that was worn by our Saviour, and a
                     bit of his cross! We also saw the regalia of Charlemagne, and the splendid
                     robes given to the priests of this cathedral by Bonaparte at the period of his
                     coronation, upon which occasion they were used; they are embroidered in the
                     richest manner with gold and silver, and amazingly heavy. Numerous sacred
                     festivals are celebrated at Notre Dame in the course of the year; and in August
                     there is to be a procession in fulfilment of a vow made by Louis XIII. This is
                     done on the 15th of that month annually, and the royal family always join in
                     it. We shall go to see it, of course; and how I wish you, aunt Margaret and
                     Albert were of our party.
                  The Pantheon, or Church of Saint Geneviéve, is a magnificent structure, and its
                     dome is the most striking object that presents itself as you approach Paris.
                     The interior of it is beatifully painted, the artist having chosen for his
                     subject the apotheosis of Louis XVI and his family. When the work was finished,
                     the King went to see it, and after looking at it attentively for a quarter of
                     an hour, he turned to the painter Gros, who was anxiously awaiting his opinion,
                     and said to him, "Eh bien Monsieur le Baron votre ouvrage est trés
                     bien fait!" thus recompensing his talents, by bestowing on him a title of
                     nobility. Saint Geneviéve, the patron Saint of Paris, is buried in the
                     Pantheon, and her tomb is always surrounded by lighted tapers, the votive
                     offerings of those who come to demand her intercession for pardon or blessing.
                     In the vaults beneath the church, many distinguished men are interred. Indeed,
                     it was to receive the ashes of such, that the Pantheon was designed; and Louis
                     XV, who was the liberal encourager of science and art, was the founder of
                     it.
                  Contrary to my expectations, I find I've yet space enough to inform you that we have been twice to the
                     Italian Opera, to hear Madame Malibran and Mademoiselle Sontag. The former
                     seems really adored here. At her benefit, many gentlemen voluntarily paid one
                     hundred francs for a ticket, instead of twenty, the actual price. She sings
                     enchantingly and acts with great spirit; so does her rival, Mademoiselle
                     Sontag. In fact, I know not to which of these nightingales I prefer listening.
                     Adieu.
                  
                     LEONTINE.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER ELEVENTH.
                  
                     Malmaison, Tomb of the Ex-Empress Josephine—Engine for conveying water to
                        Versailles and St. Cloud—St. Germain en Laye—Nanterre—St. Geneviéve.
                  
                  
                     PARIS, ——.
                  
                  Although quite fatigued, I cannot retire to rest ere I have rendered my dear
                     sister an account of to-day's excursion to St. Germain and to Malmaison, the
                     favorite residence of the late Ex-Empress Josephine. We took an early
                     breakfast, and sat off by ten o'clock; the Danvilles in their carriage,
                     accompanied by Sigismund, and we in a remise, or, as it is termed in England, a
                     glass coach. We soon alighted at Malmaison, it being only two leagues from
                     Paris, and spent more than an hour in walking over the house and grounds, and
                     thinking of poor Josephine. A great deal of the furniture niture yet remains as
                     she left it; even her music books are kept as she arranged them. The room she
                     occupied as her chamber, is exceedingly beautiful. It is circular, lined with
                     cloth of crimson and gold, and surrounded by mirrors inserted into the walls
                     and doors. The bed is supported by golden swans, and the coverlid and curtains
                     are of silver lama. In the library we saw the writing table and inkstand of
                     Napoleon. The first bears evident marks of his penknife; which, while
                     meditating, he used to strike into the wood. The domestic who conducted us
                     through the apartments, spoke of the Ex-Empress with great affection; and so
                     did the gardener, a West India negro, whose ebony visage was a novel spectacle
                     to us. They said she was beloved by all the household and neighborhood, for her
                     affability and kindness. The green house is filled with gay and choice flowers
                     and shrubs; and it is melancholy to reflect that these, the frailest
                     productions of nature, have outlived their lovely mistress, and still blossom
                     and flourish and shed their fragrance around, while she, like a shadow, has
                     passed away! After following a while the windings of a stream that meanders
                     through the garden, we found ourselves at the threshold of a pretty little
                     temple dedicated to Cupid. The mischievous urchin himself, treading upon roses,
                     is placed in the centre, and on the pedestral beneath him, this vindictive
                     couplet is inscribed: 
                        
                           Il l'est, le fut, ou le doit être,
                           Qui que ce soit, voici ton Maitre.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                  We quitted the shades of Malmaison with regret, and proceeded to the
                     neighboring village of Ruelle to visit the tomb of Josephine in the church
                     there, where her ashes repose. The monument is of white marble, and was erected
                     to her memory by Eugene Beauharnais, her son. On its summit she is represented
                     clad in a folding robe with a diadem on her head, and kneeling before an open
                     breviary. It is a handsome tribute of filial love.
                  Near Ruelle is a chateau that once belonged to Cardinal Richelieu, and since
                     then to Marshal Massena, whose widow still inhabits it.*
                      Being informed that the family were absent, and that it was customary
                     for strangers to visit this sojourn of those distinguished men, we drove there;
                     and, alighting from our carriages, were demanding permission of a person in the
                     yard to see the mansion and its grounds, when a lady suddenly made her
                     appearance, and we had the mortification to find that we were intruding on the
                     privacy of Madame Massena herself. We immediately explained our mistake, and
                     would have come away, but she insisted on our entering, and was so polite that
                     we could not refuse. The chateau is very plain, and furnished with
                     corresponding simplicity. In front of it is a limpid sheet of water, and behind
                     it a pleasant garden, where we wandered awhile, and then took leave, gratified
                     with our adventure, awkward as it was at the commencement.
                  
                     
                     *This lady is since dead. She died soon afterwards.
                  
                  Retracing our steps a short distance, we continued our ride to St. Germain en
                     Laye, and observed on our left a stupendous steam engine, which, on inquiry, we
                     found is used for supplying the fountains of Versailles and St. Cloud with
                     water from the Seine, and has succeeded the famous machine of Marly. This
                     machine had become so decayed in some parts before its removal, that it
                     occasioned the death of several persons who were examining its construction,
                     and heedlessly stepped on an old board, which, giving way, they were
                     precipitated in the river and drowned, or crushed to death by the wheels. St.
                     Germaine en Laye derives it name from the extensive forests adjoining it, which
                     is considered the finest in France, and has ever been the favorite hunting
                     ground of the French monarchs. While partaking of the pleasures of the chase,
                     they inhabited the spacious palace that still exists, and is at present a
                     barracks for soldiers. That abject king, James the Second, resided in it twelve
                     years, supported by the munificence of Louis le Grand, and finally closed his
                     earthly career in this noble retreat. He was buried in the adjoining church,
                     and his heart is enshrined in a paltry looking altar, before which a lamp is
                     constantly burning, and upon which is an inscription informing the reader why
                     it was erected. But what renders the palace at St. Germain peculiarly
                     interesting, is its having been the residence of the Duchess de la Valliére;
                     and in the ceiling one of the rooms appropriated to her use there is a trap
                     door, through which it is supposed her enamored sovereign descended when he visited her clandestinely. On
                     the left of the castle is a terrace one mile in length, and bordering an
                     acclivity that overhangs the Seine, and is highly cultivated in vineyards and
                     fruit trees. This terrace is much frequented by persons who resort there for
                     the purpose of enjoying fresh air and a fine prospect. Some go in carriages,
                     but the usual mode of conveyance is by a donkey, and this we chose. The streets
                     of the town are wide, and the houses generally large; which might be expected,
                     as court festivities were so often held here; and now-a-days, many of the
                     Parisian gentry pass the summer months here.
                  We finished the day by dining at a neat auberge, (inn,) with a garden teeming
                     with flowers just in front of our parlor. Returning home, we passed through the
                     village of Nanterre, (the birth-place of St. Geneviéve,) and stopped an instant
                     to buy some of the cakes for which it is renowned; they are merely buns, and we
                     did not think them deserving of their fame. Nanterre beer and
                        Nanterre sausages are also held in great estimation; but of
                     these we did not taste, being quite satisfied with our trial of the cakes. I
                     imagine you know the history of St. Geneviéve; though lest you should not, I
                     will tell you, in a few words, that she was a shepherdess, whose virtues and
                     piety caused her to be canonized after her death, and made the patron saint of
                     Paris. There is a lovely picture of her at the Louvre, by Pierre Guerin,
                     representing her turning a spindle while guarding her flock. Good night.

                     Lafayette and his Family—Sévres Manufactory—Palace of St. Cloud—Madame de

                     PARIS, ——.
                     DEAR JANE:
                  
                  We have formed acquaintance with some delightful characters since I wrote to
                     you a few days since. We have been introduced to the good and brave General
                     Lafayette and his family. On Wednesday he came with his son, Mr. George W.
                     Lafayette, to see Mr. Danville, and the latter presented us to them. The print
                     you have seen of this distinguished patriarch is a correct likeness; and his
                     manners are as benevolent as his countenance. He has a soirée on every
                     Wednesday night, and we have gladly accepted the kind and pressing invitation
                     he gave each of us to attend them. The ladies of the family, consisting of his
                     daughters, his grand-daughters, and daughter-in-law, Madame G. Lafayette, have
                     also called, and we find them very amiable and pleasing.
                  We have likewise had an introduction to Madame de Genlis, for which we are
                     indebted to Mrs. Danville; who, rightly conjecturing it would be gratifying to
                     us to know this celebrated lady, and being well acquainted with her, requested
                     her permission to present us to her. This was readily granted, and this morning
                     appointed for the visit. Accordingly, after an early ride to the Sévres
                        manufactory of porcelain and the
                     Palace of St. Cloud, the most splendid of all the King's habitations, we
                     repaired to her residence. On arriving, we were conducted up stairs by a
                     tidy-looking femme de chambre and ushered
                     through a small bed-room, plainly furnished, into an apartment that, from the
                     variety of its contents, might be compared to Noah's ark. Besides the usual
                     appendages of a parlor, it contained a piano, a harp, a guitar, a folding
                     screen, and several tables loaded with books, papers, baskets and boxes,
                     &c.
                  We found the venerable authoress seated in an arm chair, near the window. Her
                     regular and delicate features and fair skin still indicate former beauty. Her
                     nose is aquiline, and her eyes clear blue; as they are weak, she is obliged to
                     wear a green shade, to protect them from the light, but has never yet found it
                     necessary to use spectacles: this is astonishing, for she will be eighty-two on
                     the 25th of next January! She wore a black silk gown, and a simple muslin cap;
                     and when Mrs. Danville introduced us, she offered her hand to each, and, as
                     soon as we were seated, entered into conversation with a degree of vivacity
                     that quite surprised us; we were still more so, at her vanity. She talked a
                     great deal about her own works, and in their praise! We asked her if she
                     continued to play on the harp. "Oh oui! très bien!" she replied. "And on the
                     piano and guitar, Madame?" "Oh, oui, tout, tout, très bien!" She told us she
                     often practised on the harp and composed in prose at the same time; and that
                     while reciting verses aloud in a distinct voice, and with strict attention to
                     punctuation and emphasis, she could read a page from any author, and then
                     recount to you, in regular rotation, every idea therein expressed; and this
                     proved, she said, that the mind is capable of two operations at once. Papa
                     observed that Charles the Twelfth, of Sweden, proved it a century ago, when he
                     played chess while dictating letters to different persons. She did not notice
                     this remark, but proceeded to extol a novel she wrote some years since,
                     entitled "Alfred the Great." She considers it one of her best productions, and
                     gave it to a physician who attended her during a dangerous illness, and
                     declined being paid for his services. She said she thought she could not
                     compliment him more, than by making him a present of her work; that he seemed
                     highly delighted with it, and declared he would have it published immediately,
                     but that, much to her regret, he had not kept his promise.
                  Alfred is her favorite hero, and she expressed her wonder that he is not often
                     made the subject of a romance. She informed us that she always retires to bed
                     at half past ten o'clock, and rises at seven, and is careful to eat very
                     moderately. Her faculties continue perfect, and she knows fifty-two trades;
                     such as sewing, knitting, spinning, embroidering, making baskets, weaving
                     purses, &c. &c. We saw on the chimney-piece a snuff box that
                     Mademoiselle d'Orleans, her ci-devant pupil,
                     had sent to her. On the lid she had painted a harp entwined with a garland of
                     flowers, and below it this sentence was written: "C'est votre ouvrage." Having sat with her two hours, we took
                     leave, and had quitted the room, when she called us back to show us with what
                     ease she could rise from her chair without resting her hands on the arms of it
                     to aid herself, as old people are commonly obliged to do. She has invited us to
                     call on her whenever we can, and was so polite as to say she felt quite
                     flattered by our visit.
                  On reaching home, we found Mr. Danville and Leonora much diverted at the
                     exploit of a monkey that had climbed in at the window, and ere they perceived
                     it, twitched from Leonora's hand a bunch of raisins she was eating. It was the
                     property of a little Savoyard, who had taught it a variety of tricks, in order
                     to gain a few sous by their exhibition. The Boulevard abounds with these little
                     wanderers, and their marmosets.
                  This evening we are going to a fête at the Tivoli Garden; the New
                     Tivoli as it is called; the old one (which I am told was far handsomer) has
                     been converted into ground for building. We have seen the Ballet of Mars and
                     Venus, at the grand opera; nothing can be more beautiful and splendid than it
                     is! Leaving it for your imagination to fancy, I subscribe myself your
                     affectionate
                  
                     LEONTINE.

                     DEAR JANE:—
                  
                  We were much entertained at Tivoli. The garden was brightly illuminated, and
                     all sorts of amusements went on; and what a variety of these the French have,
                     and with what zest they partake of them! We did our part very well too. We
                     swung, we rode on wooden horses, sailed in ships, looked at a cosmorama,
                     witnessed a phantasmagoria, rope-dancing and fire-works, a play performed by
                     puppets, and some metamorphoses of little paste-board figures, that were quite
                     wonderful; for instance:—a tiny lion was changed, as if by magic, into a cupid
                     driving a car drawn by swans, a young lady into a basket of flowers, a
                     butterfly into a beau, &c. &c. These transfigurations, I think, must be
                     produced in the following manner: Two different objects are painted on a bit of
                     pasteboard, one on the back and the other on the front of it; the pasteboard is
                     then folded into the shape of one of them, and threads, too fine to be visible
                     at a moderate distance, attached to it; after exhibiting the first figure a
                     sufficient time, the threads are pulled and the pasteboard adroitly turned
                     round and thrown open, thus displaying the second figure, to the form of which
                     its edges are trimmed. As no person was visible, the threads were
                        undoubtedly passed through the
                     scenes of the miniature stage into the hand of the skilful operator,—for
                     skilful he or she was who conducted the business. When tired of strolling, we
                     entered a fine café, situated in the centre of the garden, and refreshed
                     ourselves with ice creams; afterwards, attracted by the sound of music, we
                     repaired to an open space, where an orchestra was erected and a band of
                     musicians were playing quadrilles for a party of beaux and belles, who danced
                     away merrily, not on the turf, but in the sand; they were,
                     however, so inspired by the tones of violins and clarionets, that they moved
                     along as if on a board floor.
                  You will wonder, perhaps, how we sailed in ships without the aid of wind or
                     tide! I will tell you. Two poles, with a little ship suspended by a rope from
                     each end, were placed crosswise on a pivot, and turned as rapidly as you chose,
                     carrying you round and round in the air, with an undulating motion, not
                     dissimilar to that of a vessel at sea, and so unpleasant to our feelings that
                     we soon disembarked. This diversion is termed "les Espagnolettes."
                     The wooden horses are arranged in like manner, except that they are firmly
                     fixed on the ends of the poles, and consequently, in riding on them, you do not
                     experience the sickening, waving motion. The machine for swinging is
                     denominated a "Balancoir." This consists of a couple of beams placed athwart
                     each other, with chairs attached to their ends, which are thrown alternately up
                     and down. Several parties, as they glided round on the wooden horses, amused
                     themselves by trying to pass a stick through a large ring, which was held
                     towards them by a woman mounted on a bench. Whenever a ring was caught and
                     borne off, it was instantly replaced by another, until one of the competitors
                     had obtained five, and thus won the game.
                  I must now change my theme, and inform you of our disappointment as respects
                     seeing the catacombs. They are closed at present by order of the government—I
                        believe on account of the danger there is in visiting them. We
                     have been to the 'cemetery of Montmartre," or "Field of Repose," as it is
                     likewise styled. It is of much older date than "Pére la Chase," but not so
                     extensive, nor does it contain such handsome monuments; there are, however,
                     some shady, melancholy dells and moss-covered tombs, that render it peculiarly
                     interesting. Vestris, the celebrated dancer, and Very, the chief of
                     restaurateurs, are buried there.
                  From the cemetery we proceeded to the "Abattoir," or "Slaughter-house of
                     Montmartre;" an establishment of this kind is erected in every department of
                     the city. Within them the butchers exercise their sanguinary functions, and the
                     expense of them is defrayed by taxes on the animals that are killed. They are
                     kept in the neatest order, and composed of numerous buildings, each of which is
                     appropriated to a particular branch of the business. In one, the poor animals
                     are knocked in the head; and there is a receptacle for the blood, which
                     trickles into it through furrows made in the floor: in a second, the carcase is
                     skinned: in a third, quartered: in a
                     fourth, the entrails are separated and cleansed: in a fifth, the fat is boiled
                     in an immense kettle. There are, besides, spacious stables, where the
                     unconscious victims are sheltered, and amply supplied with food and straw,
                     while awaiting their fate. It made me quite sad to behold them eating and
                     reposing so calmly, and then to think of their bloody destiny! The "Abattoirs"
                     are liberally watered and often washed, and therefore no disagreeable odour is
                     perceptible about them. I wish our butchers would follow the example of their
                     French brethren as regards these places!
                  We had the gratification of meeting with Lady Morgan last night at Madame
                     B——'s. Mamma had a great deal of conversation with her, and found her extremely
                     affable and agreeable. You know we were told she was ugly—we do not think her
                     so, but she certainly dresses too girlishly, rouges too highly, and seems too
                     desirous of admiration. This cannot be said of Mrs. Opie, to whom we were also
                     introduced. She was as plain in her attire as a dark grey silk gown, and a
                     white muslin kerchief and cap, could make her. In her manners she is
                     unaffected; in her conversation, animated and intelligent. Her countenance is
                     open and expressive of her lively mind. The moment we beheld her, we recognized
                     her as a lady we had seen at a Quaker meeting, which we attended, from motives
                     of curiosity, on Sunday. A Quaker meeting in Paris! you will exclaim. Even so,
                     my dear, for what is there on the face of the earth (that depends not on
                        soil or climate) which may not be found in this
                     bustling capitol? The meeting was held in a house in the Champs Elysées,
                     belonging to a Quaker family with whom Mr D. was acquainted, and who gave him a
                     cheerful permission to bring with him, whenever he wished it, any friends
                     desirous of going there. We were shewn into a neat parlor, where about twenty
                     persons were sitting in solemn silence, and for nearly an hour not a sound was
                     heard, save the occasional sneezes of an old lady who had a violent cold in her
                     head. At length, however, the spirit moved a dark-eyed gentleman, and he gave
                     us a tolerable sermon. I conclude with love from all of us to yourself, aunt M.
                     and Albert, and to our relations and friends in the vicinity of Morven Lodge. I
                     have not always room for affectionate messages, or be assured they would always
                     be inserted.

                     DEAR JANE:—
                  
                  Another busy week of pleasure and amusement has glided by since you have heard
                     from us, and two evenings of it have
                     been spent at two delightful soirées. The first at Madame de N——'s; the second,
                     at the gallant old General Lafayette's, in the rue d'Anjou; where he has a
                     suite of small and neat apartments, illuminated for the reception of his
                     expected guests on every Tuesday evening. We made our debut there about 9
                     o'clock, and found them crowded. Among the throng there were many celebrated
                     and interesting personages, for the worthy and enlightened of all nations seem
                     ever ready to do homage to the virtuous patriarch of Lagrange. At his soirées
                     the greatest ease prevails—the refreshments are simple and plentiful; and in
                     compliment to the Americans and English, tea is always served, a custom not
                     practised among the French. We again saw Sir Charles and Lady Morgan and Mrs.
                     Opie, with whom, by the bye, we have exchanged visits. Then there was the
                     orator, Benjamin Constant, a pale, thin man, with light blue eyes and snowy
                     hair, looking as if he were far on his passage to the next world. He was
                     environed by a crowd of gentlemen, to whom he was speaking very earnestly with
                     a great deal of gesture. Not far from him we observed other stars of the
                     Chamber of Deputies, and these were Messieurs Casimir Perrier, Lafitte and
                     Ternaux, whose countenances bespeak their noble minds. Monsieur Ternaux has
                     introduced here, and carries on the manufacture of cashmere shawls, and they
                     not only equal those of India in tints and texture, but surpass them in the
                     beauty and richness of the borders. To him also is attributed the discovery of
                     the art of stamping patterns in relief on cloth table covers, &c. In the
                     next room, we saw Mr. Cooper, the American novelist, and his lady—the two Miss
                     P——'s, cousins of Lord Byron, and Mr. and Mrs.——. She is the daughter of Gen.
                     Bertrand, and a beautiful creature she is. The lovely Countess d'A—— was
                     sitting near her. She is the sister of Madame George W. Lafayette, and is an
                     intelligent and fascinating woman. She called here yesterday, with Madame
                     Lasteyrie and her daughters.
                  It is now time to speak of some of the curiosities of Paris, to which we have
                     recently been devoting our mornings. I believe the "conservatory of arts and
                     trades" stands first on the list. It is also termed the "museum of industry,"
                     and is a collection of all sorts of machines and models, patterns and specimens
                     of things that French genius and labor have produced; for the government
                     obliges every Frenchman to deposit here a sample or model of whatever he
                     improves or invents, and to accompany it with an account of its manufacture or
                     construction. Besides several halls exhibiting machines and models, there are
                     others filled with specimens of porcelain, glass, stone ware, lace, silks,
                     ribbons, tapestry, colored and stamped paper, scissors, knives, fans, watches,
                     clocks, lamps, and a thousand other articles. One of the halls contains a
                     number of miniature buildings, representing sundry manufactories.
                     They are open in front, and display in different apartments the various
                     processes of each business, and the implements required in it, not omitting
                        the most trifling tool. Another
                     hall contains a library of 10,000 volumes, written in almost every language,
                     and treating on subjects connected with the purport of the establishment—and
                     professors of geometry and natural philosophy give lectures there to such
                     pupils as are recommended by the minister of the interior. Would it not be
                     shameful if the French nation did not rapidly progress in the arts and
                     sciences, when the government is so liberal in encouraging them, by affording
                     those persons who possess talents every advantage gratuitously, so that the
                     poor may rise as well as the rich, if blessed with abilities? Among the
                     patterns of tapestry is one, concerning which a droll story is related, viz:
                     that Vaucanson, a skilful mechanic, being offended with the inhabitants of
                     Lyons for undervaluing some looms he had invented, tied an ass to one of them,
                     and made him execute the piece of embroidery from which this specimen was cut,
                     and which excelled any they had ever done.
                  We have also visited the Diorama, the Georama and the Neorama, the royal
                     printing office, the manufactory of plate glass, and the hospital of the
                     "Quinze Vingts." A diorama you have seen. A georama is a panoramic
                     representation of the earth, with its divisions of land and water; the
                     spectator standing in the centre. A neorama is a painting, so ingeniously
                     designed and arranged as to produce the illusion of your being within whatever
                     building it represents. The one we saw is a picture of the interior of St.
                     Peter's at Rome, and M. Dorval, who has been there, says it is an exact
                     copy.
                  The royal printing office is an establishment of great magnitude. There is a
                     vast collection of types and several hundred presses. We were informed that
                     Pope Pius VII visited this office during his sojourn in Paris, and that while
                     he was there the Lord's prayer was printed in no less than 150 languages and
                     presented to him.
                  At the plate glass manufactory, we beheld mirrors of wonderful magnitude. The
                     plates are cast at Cherbourg and at St. Gobin, (a castle in the department of
                     Aisne,) and sent here to be quick-silvered and polished. Eight hundred workmen
                     are constantly employed in the business. The French are indebted to the great
                     Colbert for this establishment; prior to its foundation, plate glass could only
                     be had by sending for it to Venice.
                  Having satisfied our curiosity here, we proceeded to the hospital of the
                     "Quinze Vingts," founded by St. Louis in 1220 for the maintenance of 300
                     blind—a larger number is now admitted. It was customary in the age of St. Louis
                     to count by twenties; and there being 15 twenties in 300, this institution
                     derived its appellation from having that number of pensioners. We were pleased
                     with the neatness and comfort that reigned, and arrived there just in time to
                     hear a class of the blind sing and play; for those who evince a talent for
                     music are instructed in it. The women were the vocalists, and the men performed
                     on various instruments. Even the leader was sightless! They kept time very
                     well, and we enjoyed their concert exceedingly, though the distorted torted faces some made while singing
                     were horrible. They are taught a variety of trades, and not only reading, but
                     the art of printing; and we saw a man arrange the types and print several words
                     with both skill and quickness. The types were extremely large and made of wood,
                     and no ink was used in the operation; but the letters pressed on the paper, so
                     as to leave the traces of them perceptible to the slightest touch.
                  On Wednesday we went to the castle of Vincennes, a gothic fortress, about three
                     miles from the city. It contains the state prisons and an armory. A note to the
                     commandant, from Mr. Warden, the American Ex-Consul, and a kind friend of the
                     Danvilles, gained us admission, and we spent two hours in examining the castle,
                     within whose gloomy turrets, nobles and monarchs have sighed in captivity. The
                     celebrated Mirabeau was a prisoner there during four years, and there wrote his
                     letters between Gabriel and Sophie. The duke d'Enghien was shot in a moat of
                     this castle: the spot where the execution took place is designated by a willow
                     tree and a black column, bearing this inscription, "Here he fell." In the
                     chapel is a handsome mausoleum enclosing his ashes. Returning from Vincennes,
                     we stopped on the Place de la Bastile (once
                     occupied by that terrific building) to view the model of the fountain of the
                     Elephant. It is of plaster, and 72 feet high. A tower on the animal's back is
                     to serve as a reservoir for the water which is to flow from the proboscis, and
                     one of the legs is to contain the stair-case leading to the tower. The whole
                     mass is to be of bronze, but it is doubtful if this grand fountain will ever be
                     made; it was one of Napoleon's gigantic designs, which adversity and death
                     prevented his accomplishing. Last night we witnessed the wonder of an Elephant
                     acting a part in a play at the Cirque Olympique, a theatre of the same
                     description as that of Ashley's in London. The house was crowded almost to
                     suffocation, and the docile and astonishing creature excited universal
                     admiration by her performance. She is called "Mam'selle Dyjeck," is a native of
                     the island of Ceylon, and was purchased from some Indian jugglers by Monsieur
                     Huguet, her present owner. She is so attached to him, that she shews evident
                     distress if he is long absent from her, and extreme delight when he returns. If
                     he be fatigued or indisposed, it is said that she even undresses him, puts him
                     to bed, and watches by him while he rests. Travellers, I know, are expected to
                     exaggerate, but I assure you I am not availing myself of the privilege in the
                     present instance. The play was entitled "l'Elephant du roi de Siam," and was
                     written expressly to exhibit the address and sagacity of M'lle Dyjeck, who
                     really acted throughout as if she were a human being. At the close of the
                     performance, the audience vociferated for her re-appearance; and after a few
                     moments elapsed, the curtain rose, and the royal lady came forth
                     proudly tossing her trunk. She advanced to the edge of the stage and made three
                     courtesies, retreating all the while; and looking round on the spectators as
                     she rose, until she had sufficiently
                     receded, she walked off amidst a roar of applause. It was quite an inspiring
                     scene. The Duchess of Berri and her suite were present.
                  A propos—Madame F. lately gave us a most interesting account of her Highness'
                     children, the little Duke of Bordeaux and M'lle Louise. She says they are both
                     remarkably amiable; and le pelit Duc holds a
                     levee daily, is dressed en militaire, and
                     assumes all the airs of a grown gentleman. He is so proud of his sword, that
                     the severest penalty his tutor can inflict, when he misbehaves, is to deprive
                     him of it. He is a pretty boy: we have often met him taking an airing in his
                     coach and four, surrounded by gens d'armes; for the Bourbons are so unpopular,
                     that for fear of his sharing the fate of his father, he is always strongly
                     guarded whenever he appears in public. He pays dearly for his lineage, poor
                     little fellow! and I never see him without thinking sorrowfully of the
                     probability of his perishing by the ruthless hand of an assassin. But mercy!
                     what a packet. Have patience, dearest! with your
                  
                     LEONTINE.

                     Foundling Hospital—Hotel Carnavalet—Count de Segur.

                     MY DEAR JANE:—
                  
                  This morning, we visited the Foundling Hospital. Being told we should go there
                     very early to behold the emptying ing of the baskets in which the babes are
                     deposited at the gate during the night, we hastened there ere seven o'clock;
                     but we had been misinformed, and were disappointed in our wishes. The infants
                     are carried there at all hours; none, however, were received during our
                     visit.
                  We were conducted through the numerous wards, and saw many forsaken little
                     creatures—a distressing sight, indeed! Then to behold the sufferings of such as
                     were diseased! Some of them lying on hard beds, with a bright light from
                     opposite windows torturing their eyes, which were generally inflamed from being
                     thus exposed. Some of the nurses, too, were exceedingly rough. For instance, in
                     an apartment attached to the sick wards, four or five women were occupied in
                        dosing and feeding several babies: one of them asked another,
                     who stood by a table, to hand her a spoon; instead of handing it, she threw it,
                     and so carelessly, that the poor child received a blow on the cheek. I could
                     have boxed the vixen! Each infant is swathed, and wears on its wrist a piece of
                     pewter, telling the hour, the day of the month, and the year, of its reception
                     at the hospital; this enables a parent, who may desire to reclaim a child, to
                     find it. About six thousand children are annually received here, and frequently
                     as many as twenty in the course of a day. A considerable number are sent into
                     the country to be nursed; and during our stay, a half a dozen carts drove off,
                     filled with peasant women and their helpless charges. The destiny of these we
                     thought enviable, when compared with that of those who remained. At two years of age, the
                     children are removed to another hospital, and there instructed until old enough
                     to be put to some trade.
                  After breakfast, we visited a place of a more pleasing description; this was
                     the Hotel de Carnavalet, formerly the residence of Madame de Sévigné. It is now
                     inhabited by a Monsieur de P——, an eminent engineer, with whom we have become
                     acquainted, and who kindly invited us there, to see the very chamber and
                     cabinet occupied by that lady, when she penned those charming letters to the
                     Countess de Grignan. The window of the cabinet overlooks a small garden, in
                     which is a flourishing yew tree, that was planted by Madame de Sévigné herself.
                     As I viewed it, and thought of her who reared it, Lord Byron's beautiful lines
                     on the cypress came forcibly to my mind. 
                        
                           "Dark tree! still sad when other's grief is fled,
                           The only constant mourner o'er the dead."
                        
                     
                  
                  The charming old Count de Ségur has returned to town, and we have paid him our
                     respects at his residence in the Rue Duphot. He was here yesterday, and invited
                     us to dine with him en famille to-day; we are
                     going, and I shall close my letter with an account of the party, when we come
                     back. At present, I must abandon the writing desk for the toilet table.
                  Eleven at night. We reached home a half an hour since, and having changed my
                     dress for a robe de chambre, behold me quite at my ease, and again in
                     possession of the pen.
                  We spent our hours delightfully at the Count's! On alighting there, we were for
                     some minutes sole tenants of the parlor, and thus had an opportunity of
                     examining a beautiful portrait that decorates the wall of the room, and which,
                     we afterwards learned, is that of the Countess de Ségur. It was painted during
                     her youth, and if the resemblance be a good one, she must have been a lovely
                     creature! Our observations were interrupted by the entrance of the Count from
                     his library, adjoining the parlor—and our circle was soon increased by the
                     addition of several French gentlemen, to whom he introduced us, but I quite
                     forget their names. One of them had recently been in Greece, and described a
                     horrible scene of carnage he witnessed there. In the evening, the Count had
                     many visiters, this being the time he prefers his friends to call on him. Among
                     those who came in, was the authoress of "Adèle de Senange," that interesting
                     novel we read together last winter. You may depend I heard the name of Madame
                     de Susa announced with great satisfaction. She entered, and we beheld a plain
                     looking woman, apparently about fifty years old. Then there was Monsieur de
                     Marbois, who wrote the history of Louisiana, one of the United States; and
                     Count Philip de Ségur, author of the "Russian Campaign," who is considered the
                     ablest military historian of the age. I am now so sleepy, I can write no more;
                     so bid you, in the name of all of us, a fond adieu.

                     PARIS, ——.
                     DEAR JANE:
                  
                  
                     Marcella Erisford has arrived, accompanied by her father, who returns to
                        Soissons to-morrow. He has been residing there eleven months, in order to
                        settle some business, relative to a legacy left him by an intimate friend;
                        in the spring he expects to re-embark for Philadelphia, his native city. He
                        resembles his sister, Mrs. Danville, and appears equally amiable and
                        desirous of contributing to the happiness of those around him. We shall
                        sincerely regret his departure. Marcella is quite a beauty, with her glowing
                        cheeks, hazel eyes and pearly teeth, although her features are by no means
                        regular. She is less lovely than Leonora, but just as intelligent and
                        accomplished; so you see I have two delightful companions to console me (if
                        it were possible) for your absence. Our brother Edgar is, I
                        think, desperately smitten with Marcella; certes, when she is by, he has
                        neither eyes or ears for anybody or anything else.
                     Now for our peregrinations. The weather being remarkably fine on Tuesday,
                        and the carriages at the door by 9 o'clock, according to order, we proceeded
                        to Montmorency and the Abbey of St. Denis. Oh, how your pensive spirit will
                        luxuriate in wandering through the solemn aisles and caverns of this "hoary
                        pile," among the sepulchres of its mighty dead! You are aware that, during
                        the revolution, this asylum of deceased royalty, was invaded by a barbarous
                        populace, who dragged the corpses from their graves, loaded them with
                        indignities, and cast them into ditches and other places of filth. It is
                        related, that the corpse of the brave Louis XIV, when thus profaned, raised
                        its arm, as if to strike the miscreant who dared the deed, while that of the
                        good Henry Quatre (which was found uninjured by time) smiled benignantly on
                        his ungrateful subjects! The tombs have since been restored by Napoleon, who
                        intended for himself, and his descendants, the vault which is appropriated
                        to the Bourbons. It is secured by two massive bronze gates, which he had
                        made to close upon his own ashes, that now repose under a simple stone on
                        the barren island of St. Helena! So changes the glory of this world and its
                        mighty ones!
                     The Abbey of Saint Denis was originally a plain chapel, erected by a pious
                        and wealthy lady named Catulla, to shelter the remains of that martyr (St.
                        Denis) and his companions, after their execution. The generosity and care of
                        various monarchs, have transferred the humble chapel into the present
                        majestic cathedral. The relics of St. Denis are enclosed in a splendid
                        shrine, the gift of Louis XVIII; and the sumptuous altar in front of this,
                        with its enormous gold candlesticks, was given to the church by Bonaparte,
                        after his marriage with the Empress Marie Louise, on which occasion it was
                        first erected in the Louvre, where the ceremony mony was performed. In the side isles of St.
                        Denis, are several superb monuments, in memory of Francis I, Henry II, and
                        Henry III, and their Queens. The antique sepulchres of Dagobert, and his
                        spouse Natilde, are near the door, and that of Dagobert is most curiously
                        carved. In one of the vaults we saw the stone coffin of King Pepin; it is
                        open and empty, and when struck on the side, sounds like metal. Near the
                        mausoleum of Francis the I, stands the mimic bier of Louis XVIII, canopied
                        and richly decorated with funeral ornaments. It will remain until succeeded
                        by that of Charles X, for such is the custom of France. What grave rise to
                        it I know not; but we may reasonably suppose that it was intended, like the
                        monitor of Philip of Macedon, to remind the reigning monarch of his
                        mortality.
                     At Montmorency we had fine sport, riding about on donkeys to the different
                        points of view that merit notice for their beauty. The little animal upon
                        which Mr. Erisford rode, was at first extremely refractory, and the trouble
                        he had to force it along excited our mirth; then my saddle girth broke, and
                        this was another source of merriment. After riding over the valley, we
                        alighted at the hunting seat of the unhappy father of the murdered Duke
                        d'Enghien, the present Prince of Condé, who is said to be yet overwhelmed
                        with affliction at the untimely and cruel end of his noble son. The place is
                        called the "Rendezvous;" it is shady and pleasant—the house a plain stone
                        building: we did not enter it, but partook of some cool milk beneath the
                        trees, in front of the door. We purchased it of the game-keeper and his
                        wife, who reside there.
                     Retracing our path, (and the little donkeys, I assure you, trotted back
                           much faster than they went,) we stopped at the
                        Hermitage. This is the most interesting object to be seen at Montmorency,
                        and indeed the chief attraction to that spot—although circumstances induced
                        us to defer our visit to it till the last. It is a quarter of a mile from
                        the village, and was the residence of Jean Jacques Rousseau, and afterwards
                        of Andrew Gretry, the musical composer, whose family still occupy it. They
                        are so obliging as to allow strangers to visit this rural retreat of those
                        celebrated men, and have arranged, in a small apartment, various articles
                        that were owned and used by them, and that are consequently interesting to
                        the spectator; for instance, the bedstead and table of Rousseau; the cup and
                        saucer of Gretry; his comb and spectacles, and the antique little spinet
                        upon which he tried his compositions. A flower garden adjoins the mansion,
                        and there we saw a rose bush that was planted by Jean Jacques, and the stone
                        bench upon which he used to sit while writing his "Héloise." From the bay
                        tree that shades it, I procured a leaf for your herbarium. A rivulet
                        meanders through the garden, and empties into a small lake, near which is
                        the bust of Gretry, supported by a column, with an inscription in gilt
                        letters. Rousseau's bust occupies a niche in the wall, and is covered with a
                        glass to protect it from the pencils of scribblers, which have disfigured it
                        considerably.
                     
                     Bidding adieu to the Hermitage, we returned to the "White Horse," an
                        excellent inn we had selected in the town, and, having recruited ourselves
                        with a hearty dinner, resumed our seats upon the donkeys, and repaired to
                        the village of d'Enghien, (a mile distant,) to see its neat and commodious
                        sulphur baths, and the pretty lake of St. Gratien, on the border of which it
                        stands. In the centre of the water is a restaurant, to which, if you choose,
                        you are conveyed in a boat; but it was so late, that our parents would not
                        consent to make this aquatic excursion, and we therefore returned to
                        Montmorency, and thence to Paris. A bright moon lighted us home, where we
                        arrived about 11 o'clock, pleased with our day's adventures, and so sleepy
                        we could scarcely reach our chambers without falling into a slumber on the
                        way.
                     On Sunday, Mr. Dorval brought us six tickets of admission to the Chapel of
                        the Tuileries, where high mass is performed every Sabbath, while the king is
                        in the city. Not a moment was to be lost, so we hastened to array ourselves
                        for the occasion, as full dress is required, if you sit in the gallery with
                        the royal family, and our billets were such as to admit us there. Marcella,
                        Leonora and myself had just purchased new bonnets, and these we wore.
                        Their's are of straw colored crape, ornamented with blond and bunches of
                        lilacs, and are very becoming; mine is of pink, and decorated with blond and
                        white hyacynths. Our party, consisting of mamma, papa, Edgar, and our three
                        ladyships, was soon ready and at the palace. The chapel was crowded, but we
                        found no difficulty in obtaining seats—for, on presenting our tickets, the
                        captain of the guards handed us to them, and the throng yielded to him
                        without hesitation. The music was very fine, and we had a close view of the
                        Bourbons and their suite. They were sumptuously clad, and the King and Duke
                        and Duchess of Angoulême seemed very devout. The Duchess has a most
                        melancholy expression of countenance, owing, perhaps, to the sad
                        vicissitudes of her youth. Neither she, her spouse or uncle are popular. The
                        Dutchess de Berri is exceedingly so, and is considered one of the most
                        charitable ladies in the kingdom. She is extremely fair, has light hair and
                        a pleasing face. She is not sufficiently dignified, I think, and is a
                        terrible fidget; during service, she was continually adjusting her tucker,
                        necklace, or sleeve. It is reported, that when the omnibuses, or circulating
                        carriages of the Boulevards, were first introduced, she made a bet with the
                        king that she would ride in one of them, and actually did so, in disguise! I
                        am summoned to the parlor to receive visiters—so kiss my hand to you.

                        They came to take leave of us ere their departure for La Grange. The Chamber
                        of Deputies having dissolved, they go to the country to-morrow, where the
                        rest of the family have already established themselves. We have been so pressingly invited to pay them a
                        visit, that we have determined to do so, and anticipate great pleasure and
                        gratification from spending a day or two in the midst of this charming and
                        highly respected family. Again adieu. L.

                     The Garden of Plants—The Camel Leopard—The Library, Museum, and Cubinet of
                        Anatomy—Manufactory of Gobelin Tapestry.
                  
                  
                     PARIS, ——
                     DEAR JANE:
                  
                  I do not wonder that you are surprised at my not having yet described to you
                     the "Royal Garden of Plants." The fact is, we have been thrice disappointed in
                     our arrangements to go there, but at last have accomplised our project, and
                     devoted both Tuesday and Wednesday to the investigation of this famed spot, and
                     we have seen nothing in Paris that has interested us more. It is of great
                     extent, and affords the visitor as much information as amusement. It was
                     founded by Jean de Brosses, the physician of Louis XIII, and much improved by
                     the exertions of Buffon, the naturalist. It contains various enclosures, some
                     of which are appropriated to batany, and display every plant, flower and shrub,
                     native and foreign, that can be made to grow there. Each is labelled, and bears
                     its botanical name; and there are spacious hot-houses for such as require
                     shelter and extreme care. We remarked here some fine specimens of the bread
                     tree and sugar cane. Other enclosures are filled with all sorts of culinary
                     vegetables. There are, besides, nurseries of fruit trees and samples of
                     different kinds of fences, hedges and ditches, and of various soils and
                     manures. The enclosures are separated by wide gravel walks, 
                        
                           "Bounded by trees, with seats beneath the shade,
                           For talking age and whispering lovers made."
                        
                     
                  
                  In the centre of the garden is an artificial hill, crowned with a temple, from
                     which you enjoy a view of the city, and may aid your sight with a spy glass, by
                     paying a trifle to a man who owns it and generally sits there, for the purpose
                     of hiring it, and indicating to strangers the names of the public edifices
                     visible in the prospective. On the way to the temple, you pass under a huge and
                     towering cedar of Lebanon, which De Jussieu, the botanist, planted more than
                     eighty years ago. This superb tree was considerably injured during the
                     revolution; and had it not been for the remonstrances and influence of
                     Humboldt, the traveller, the whole garden would probably be now in a ruinous
                     condition—for when the allies were in Paris, it was owing to his exertions that
                     the Prussians were prevented encamping there.
                  The menagerie exhibits the greatest variety of animals. The ferocious are kept
                     in iron cages; those that are gentle, in enclosures and habitations suitable to
                     their propensities and natures, and embellished with such trees and shrubs
                        as are found in their native
                     climes. Goats, for instance, are furnished with artificial acclivities for
                     climbing, and bears with dens and rugged posts. The populace often thow
                     biscuits and fruit to the bears, in order to witness their endeavors to catch
                     them; but this is dangerous diversion, for in doing this, a boy was not
                     sufficiently alert in his movements, and, ere he withdrew his arm, had it
                     severely lacerated by the eager animal. On another occasion, a careless nurse,
                     while amusing herself in a similar manner, let a child fall in, which was
                     instantly devoured! Among the gentlest and most curious of the quadrupeds, is
                     the giraff, or camel leopard, which was brought from Africa about two years
                     ago, and threw all Paris into commotion. Thousands visited him daily, and
                     belts, reticules, gloves, kerchiefs, and even cakes and blanc mangés, were
                     decorated with his image. It is said that he possesses both sagacity and
                     sensibility, to prove which the following anecdote is related of him. As his
                     keepers were bringing him to Paris, they were joined by a man on horseback, who
                     continued to bear them company for several miles, until he came to another
                     road. The giraff, which had manifested great delight when the traveller first
                     appeared, then evinced deep distress, and even shed tears! Upon inquiry, it was
                     found that the traveller's horse and the giraff were from the same part of
                     Africa, and probably old acquaintances. This is a marvellous story, I must
                     confess; nevertheless, many persons believe it. I will now tell you another
                     less incredible, and which shews to what perfection the flower makers here
                     carry their art. The giraff is very fond of rose leaves; and not long since,
                     seeing a bunch of artificial roses in a lady's bonnet, and thinking them
                     natural, he seized hold of them, and pulled with such force, that he soon had
                     possession of hat and all. It must have been a ludicrous scene. He is so
                     delicate, that strict attention is obliged to be paid to his food and lodging.
                     The first consists of delicate vegetables, and the heat of the
                     last is regulated by a thermometer; and his African attendant sleeps near to
                     guard him and supply his wants. Leaving the quadrupeds, we proceeded to look at
                     the birds, which are also admirably arranged. The water fowls have their pools
                     and lakes—the ostrich its sands, and so on.
                  I have now detailed what we saw on Tuesday. On Wednesday, we returned to the
                     garden, and examined the Library, the Museum of Natural History, and the
                     Cabinet of Comparative Anatomy, where, for the first time in my life, I beheld
                     the human form, divested of its skin and flesh, and changed to a machine of
                     dried bones and sinews, and bloodless veins! The sight made me shudder, and I
                     felt relieved when we came away.
                  Not far from the Garden of Plants, at the corner of the Rue Mouffetarde, is the
                     celebrated manufactory of Gobelin Tapestry, which derives its name from a dyer
                     who first owned the establishment, and employed himself in coloring worsteds.
                     Colbert, the patriotic champion of the arts and sciences, during his ministry,
                     occasioned the rise and perfection
                     fection of it in the following manner. He engaged workmen to weave tapestry in
                     imitation of that of Flanders. The attempt succeeded, and such has been the
                     proficiency of those who have since carried on the work, that their productions
                     are now equal to any others of the kind. You may imagine what care and expense
                     is required in the business, when I inform you that a single piece of tapestry
                     frequently demands two years' labor to finish it, and has cost almost three
                     hundred pounds sterling!
                  The clock is striking two, and I must prepare for a ride in the Bois de
                     Boulogne. It being a delightful afternoon, we shall no doubt find it alive with
                     carriages, pedestrians and equestrians. Those who repair there in coaches,
                     usually drive to a pleasant spot, and then descend to walk to and fro in the
                     shade, for air and exercise, until the approach of the dinner hour, or some
                     other engagement calls them elsewhere. Farewell.

                  LETTER EIGHTEENTH.
                  
                     Ceremony of taking the Veil—Palace of the Warm Baths, a Roman Ruin.
                  
                  
                     PARIS, ——.
                  
                  Oh! Jane, how we wished for you yesterday! Early in the morning we received a
                     note from Madame F——, saying that if the ladies of our party would like to
                     witness the ceremony of "taking the veil," and would repair to her house by
                     nine o'clock, she would accompany them to a neighboring convent, where it was
                     to be performed about the hour of ten. The Abbess being her friend and cousin,
                     she had obtained her consent to our attending on the occasion, in case we
                     wished it. We wished it, you may be sure, and her kindness was
                     eagerly and thankfully accepted. On reaching the convent, its portals were
                     opened by two of the sisterhood, who greeted Madame F—— very cordially, made
                     their curtsies to us, and then conducted us to the gallery of a small chapel,
                     the main body of which was filled with nuns clad in black, and seated on rows
                     of benches, each side of the aisle. In the centre of it, upon a damask chair,
                     sat a young lady richly dressed. She wore a yellow silk frock trimmed with
                     lace, white satin shoes, long white kid gloves, and ornaments of pearl. A
                     wreath of orange blossoms mingled and contrasted with her dark hair, and were
                     partly concealed by a flowing veil. Madame F—— related her history, and, to our
                     surprise, we learned she was an English girl who had been placed in the convent
                     at an early age to be educated. As might have been expected, associating so
                     constantly and closely with Catholics from childhood, she became one herself;
                     and when her parents came over to France for the purpose of carrying her home,
                     they found her resolved on becoming a nun. Having tried in vain to dissuade her
                     from it, they at length yielded to her entreaties, and were even present when
                     she took the vows; and as they did not
                     appear distressed on the occasion, I suppose they had finally become reconciled
                     to their bereavement. But to proceed to the ceremony.
                  Long prayers were said, incense scattered, and a fine hymn chanted—the novice
                     kneeling down before a table covered with a crimson cloth, and reclining her
                     head upon it, in humble submission to that Divine Power to whom she was
                     dedicating her heart and days! When the music ceased, the Abbess advanced, and,
                     taking her hand, led her out through a side door; and while they were absent, a
                     nun distributed among the sisterhood a number of large wax candles, which she
                     afterwards illumined. The Abbess now re-entered with her charge, and prayers
                     and incense were again offered, a second hymn sung, and the novice had her
                     hair, or a portion of it, cut off; she then prostrated herself before the
                     altar, and a black pall was cast over her, to signify she was dead to the
                     world. On rising, she retired a second time with the Superior, and in a few
                     minutes re-appeared, clad in the habiliments of the cloister, and went round
                     the chapel to receive the kiss of congratulation and welcome from each of the
                     community; after which the lights were extinguished, and every one departed,
                     leaving her to solitude, meditation and prayer, until the vesper bell should
                     tell the hour for rejoining her. How awful I felt while a spectator of the
                     solemn scene; and how strange, is it not? that reflecting beings, who know the
                     fickleness of human nature—that "nature's mighty law is change"—can venture
                     thus to bind themselves for life to stay in one limited space, and pursue one
                     unvaried mode of existence! I hope and think I love religion truly; but I am
                     sure, if I were a saint upon earth, I should never hide my light
                     in a monastery.
                  I ought to mention, that except the father and brothers of the new nun, no
                     gentlemen were admitted to the ceremony; and I ought also to state that
                        she was very pretty. Leonora says that, notwithstanding the
                     scene and place, she was constantly imagining the interference of some brave
                     youth, to save the fair creature from her fate, by rushing in and bearing her
                     off by force; but alas! the age of chivalry is long past, and now-a-days a
                        hero in love would be thought a prodigy and hard
                     to find, unless, perhaps, he was sought for in a certain old-fashioned fabric
                     in the vicinity of Morven Lodge. There, peradventure, such an
                        extraordinary personage might be discovered.
                  
                  From the convent we drove to what is called the "Palace of the Warm Baths."
                     This is a relic of Roman antiquity. In it, the Roman emperors, and after their
                     dominion ceased in France, the French monarchs, used to reside. Its foundation
                     is attributed to Julian, the Apostate. The sole remaining apartments consist of
                     an extensive and lofty hall, and some cells beneath it. The hall is lighted by
                     an immense arched window, and its vaulted roof for several ages supported a
                     garden. By this we may judge how firmly and strongly the Romans used to build.
                     I cannot, for lack of space, express
                     to you the kind messages with which I am charged. Suffice it to know, we all
                     love you dearly.

                     PARIS, ——.
                     DEAR SISTER:—
                  
                  I have really a great mind to give you a scolding, instead of a
                        description, for your perusal. What are you all about at the
                     Lodge, that you have not written to us for this fortnight. Papa and mamma are
                     quite out of patience with you, and desire me to request you will answer this
                     the moment it reaches you. Indeed, I hope you will, for they are
                     evidently uneasy in consequence of your long silence.
                  Now, let me tell you of our visit to Versailles. We spent Friday there, and,
                     carrying with us a cold dinner, partook of it under the trees near the Petit
                     Trianon, having gained a keen appetite by first walking over the immense palace
                     and its garden; of the splendors of both you are well aware. We were not much
                     pleased with our rustic mode of eating on the grass, the premises of the
                     table-cloth being frequently invaded by insects. Like dancing on the turf, such
                     arrangements are pleasanter in description than in reality. The Petit Trianon
                     was the favorite residence of Marie Antoinette, and there she passed a great
                     deal of her time, free from the bustle and formality of the court, and devoted
                     to rural occupations. The place still exhibits evidences of her taste and
                     innocent amusements. The grounds are diversified with grottos, cottages,
                     temples, mimic rivers and cascades. Then there is a beauttful little music
                     room, a labyrinth, a dairy, and a lake. The palace is a tasteful edifice, and a
                     part of the furniture is the same that was used by the decapitated queen.
                  The Grand Trianon, another palace, situated in the park of Versailles, is
                     superior to this in elegance and embellishments, but not half so interesting.
                     The parterre, behind the mansion, teems with Flora's choicest gifts, and
                     reminded me of the saying, that "Versailles was the garden of waters; Marly the
                     garden of trees; and Trianon that of flowers." In the orangery at Versailles,
                     we were shown an orange tree which is computed to be three hundred years old!
                     It is denominated "The Old Bourbon," and has been the property of several kings
                     of that race. Its trunk and foilage are remarkably thick. The garden and park
                     are five miles in circumference; and only think of these, and the magnificent
                     structure overlooking them, being completed in seven years! But, perhaps, did
                     we know the number of workmen employed upon them during that period, the fact
                     would not seem so amazing.
                  We rode through the wide streets of the town, visited the Church of St. Louis, where a simple monument is
                     erected in honor of the Duke de Berri, and then turned our course homewards,
                     stopping for an hour at Mendon, a royal chateau that Napoleon fitted up
                     elegantly for his son; it is now unoccupied, though I believe the Duke de C——
                     sometimes spends a few weeks there. A noble avenue leads to the house, and from
                     the terrace in front of it, the prospect is very fine. As we traversed the
                     grounds, guided by an old soldier, we were quite diverted at the astonishment
                     he expressed on discovering, from an observation of Leonora's, that she and her
                     family were Americans. "Mais comme vous êtes blondes!" cried he, "et j'ai
                     toujours entendu dire que les habitans d'Amerique étaient rouges ou noirs!"*
                     
                  
                     
                     *But how fair you are! and I have always heard that the inhabitants of
                        America are red or black.
                     
                  
                  At the foot of the hill of Mendon, near the banks of the Seine, are large
                     quarries of chalk, that we were told merited our attention; but it was too late
                     to profit by the information, and we hastened on to Paris.
                  After resting ourselves and drinking tea, we sallied forth again, and strolled
                     on the Boulevards as far as Tortoni's, to eat ices. He is master of a grande
                     café, and famous for his ices and déjeunés a la fourchette. His establishment
                     is splendidly illuminated every night, and so thronged with customers, that it
                     is often difficult to procure a seat. Some prefer regaling themselves before
                     the door in their carriages; and there is generally a range of stylish
                     equipages in front of the house, filled with lords and ladies, and beaux and
                     belles, partaking of the cooling luxuries of iced lemonade and creams, and
                     listening to the bands of ambulatory musicians, that here are always to be
                     found and heard, wherever there is a crowd. They select the popular airs of the
                     theatres and those of the first composers' of the day, which are as familiar to
                     the common people as they are to amateurs.
                  We recently spent another delightful evening at Count Ségur's. We found him, as
                     usual, surrounded by the learned and refined; and he met us with his accustomed
                     smile of benevolence and bonhomie. There was a lively young relative of his
                     present, and when most of his visiters had departed, she insisted on his
                     joining her and myself in playing "l'Empereur est Mort," &c., and with the
                     utmost amiability he complied with her wishes. The play of l'Empereur is
                     similar to that termed the "Princess Huncamunca."
                  While we were at the Count's, Mr. and Mrs. Danville attended a levee at the
                     Hotel Marine, and the girls accompanied a young friend of Marcella's (a Miss
                     Y—— from Soissons) to a fancy ball given by the children of Madame Clément's
                     seminary. Miss Y—— being a pupil, had the privilege of inviting two
                     acquaintances, and chose Marcella and Leonora as her guests. They were highly
                     entertained. All the scholars wore costumes, and several supported the
                     characters they assumed with proper spirit. There was a little round, rosy
                     faced girl, of five years old, decked as a Cupid. She was entwined with a silken drapery,
                     thickly studded with golden stars; sandals laced on her feet, and a quiver
                     slung over her plump and naked little shoulders! In her right hand she held a
                     gilt bow, and her curls were confined by a glittering bandeau. They danced
                     until ten o'clock, and as none of the masculine gender were admitted, the elder
                     Misses played the part of beaux. I should have liked to join in the frolic, I
                     confess, though not upon condition of foregoing the pleasure we had at No. 13,
                     Rue Duphot, Count Ségur's residence.
                  Papa has presented me a beautiful watch, and intends purchasing another for
                     you. With tender regards to aunt M—— and Albert, I remain your attached
                     sister,

                     PARIS, ——.
                  
                  "Joy! joy!" cried I, on looking out of the window yesterday, and spying Arnaud
                     returning from the post office with a letter, which, according to our wishes,
                     proved to be from our naughty Jane. Arrant scribbler that I am, I hasten to
                     answer it, though you must feel you do not deserve to be replied to so
                     speedily. However, as this is the first time you have been negligent, we ought
                     not to be relentless—so here is my hand in token of forgiveness
                     and good will; but beware of repeating the offence.
                  Having finished my lecture, and knowing you are fond of listening to
                     adventures, I will now recount a droll one that happened to us last evening. At
                     sunset we were walking on the Boulevard du Temple, which abounds in every
                     variety of the lower order of amusements, when suddenly a violent shower began
                     to fall, and, of course, every body to scamper to some shelter. We
                     took refuge in the portico of an illuminated building, entitled, in large
                     transparent letters over the door, "Theatre Mecanique," and finally determined
                     to enter and witness the acting within. We accordingly purchased tickets of the
                     woman employed to sell them, and following her up a narrow flight of stairs,
                     were ushered into a confined gallery, overlooking a dirty pit, the highest
                     grade of whose occupants seemed to be that of a cobbler. Four tallow candles
                     lighted the orchestra, where two hard plying fiddlers performed
                     their tasks. We began to think we might be in "Alsatia!" and then the actors
                     and actresses! what were they? Why, a set of clumsy wooden figures that
                     tottered in and out, and were suspended by cords so coarse, as to be visible
                     even amidst the gloom that surrounded them. A ventriloquist made these puppets
                     appear very loquacious; and, whenever they stopped to make a speech, it was
                     quite ludicrous, for they vacillated to and fro like the pendulum of a clock,
                     for more than a minute. We would have rejoiced to get out, but the rain still
                     poured, and we were compelled to remain.
                  
                  After the piece was concluded, and the fiddlers had put up their instruments,
                     and were puffing out and pocketing the bits of candles, and we were reluctantly
                     preparing to issue forth into the storm, up came the above mentioned vender of
                     billets, (who, it seems, was manager likewise,) and calling to the musicians to
                     resume their operations, begged us to be re-seated, in order to see the first
                     act repeated, which we had lost by arriving too late. We availed ourselves of
                     her politeness and honesty, but could scarcely refrain from
                     laughing as we did so—and, fortunately, during the half hour that succeeded,
                     the weather cleared, and we were thus enabled to get home without the dreaded
                     wetting; but the Boulevards not being paved, the walking was exceedingly muddy,
                     and it was so long ere we reached a stand of carriages, that when we did, we
                     thought it more prudent to continue our route on foot than to risk sitting in
                     our wet shoes.
                  As you may not know what is meant by the "Boulevards," I will tell you. They are wide roads, or streets,
                     edged with spreading umbrageous elms, and formerly bounded the city, but now,
                     from its increase in size, they are within it. Their appellation
                     of "Boulevards" is derived from "bouler sur le vert," to "bowl upon the
                     green"—being once covered with turf, and the frequent scene of playing at
                     bowls. Here, nightly, the citizens forget the cares and labors of the day, and
                     resign themselves to pleasure and mirth. Rows of chairs, owned and placed there
                     by poor persons, may be hired for two sous a piece. Adieu.

                  LETTER TWENTY-FIRST.
                  
                     Places of Protestant Worship in Paris—History of Mr. Lewis Way, an English
                        Divine,
                  
                  
                     PARIS, ——.
                     DEAR JANE:
                  
                  Here is an interesting narrative to amuse you, which I have just heard related.
                     In the Champs Elysees, there stands a
                     beautiful Protestant chapel, where we attend divine service almost every
                     Sabbath; if we do not go there, we repair to the oratorio, a Protestant church,
                     in the Rue St. Honoré, or to the English Ambassador's, where there is public
                     worship every Sunday, or to another temple consecrated to our form of worship,
                     (the Church of the Visitation,) in the Rue Saint Antoine. Bishop Luscombe
                     officiates at the oratorio, and Mr. Wilkes, a Presbyterian clergyman, assembles
                     his congregation in an upper apartment adjoining the church. The history in
                     question, is that of the Rev. Mr. Lewis Way, who owns the chapel in the Champs
                     Elysées and preaches there; he is extremely eloquent and energetic, and speaks
                     plain truths to his flock without hesitation, when necessary. It is said that
                     when a youth he had an ardent desire to be educated for the church; but his
                     parents being extremely poor, and not having any relatives to assist him, he
                     became a student of law at the temple, and was one morning proceeding to his
                     labors, when he observed his own name inscribed on the door-plate of a handsome
                     dwelling. He immediately ascended the steps, and requested to speak with the master of the house; and on his
                     appearance, after apologizing for the liberty he was taking, told his story,
                     represented his forlorn situation, and begged to be informed if there was any
                     relationship between them. On comparing notes he found there was
                        not, and was taking leave; but the gentleman, who was an odd
                     old bachelor, insisted on his prolonging his visit, and, in the interim, sent a
                     trusty servant to inquire his character of the lawyer under whom he studied,
                     and who happened to be the one whom he (Mr. Way, senior) usually
                     employed.
                  The lawyer's answer was highly creditable to his pupil, and from that moment
                     the old gentleman adopted him, enabled him to take orders, and, dying soon
                     afterwards, bequeathed him a fortune of 300,000 pounds sterling. The sudden
                     accession of such wealth affected his brain, and he was crazy for several
                     years. Now, I think he must have been so, when he introduced
                     himself so strangely to his benefactor; but be that as it may, on regaining his
                     senses, he resolved to make Paris his future home, and to devote his time to
                     the Protestants in that city. He accordingly came over here, purchased the
                     hotel Marbœuf, his present a bode, and converted a portion of it into the
                     tasteful little chapel, where he addresses and edifies a numerous congregation
                     on all holy days.
                  The seats of the chapel are covered with cerulean velvet, the windows
                     ornamented with paintings, and there is a good organ, upon which one of his
                     daughters (for he has married and has several children) always performs. A
                     shady and pleasant garden adds to the beauty and comfort of the place. And thus
                     ends my story, for the truth of which, remember, I do not vouch. 
                        
                           But just as it was told to me,
                           Have I detailed it unto thee.
                        
                      And with this flourishing rhyme conclude.
                  
                     Yours,
                     LEONTINE.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER TWENTY-SECOND.
                  
                     Excursion to Lagrange—Count de Tracy and Madame La Fayette—Theatre of
                        Monsieur Compte—Chinese Baths.
                  
                  
                     PARIS, ——.
                  
                  I thank you, beloved sister! for your affectionate letter of the—instant, and
                     shall not delay answering it, for I am impatient to inform you of our recent
                     agreeable excursion to Lagrange. On Friday we availed ourselves of the kind
                     General's invitation, and, rising very early, commenced our journey to his
                     castle. We partook of coffee, eggs, and bread and butter, at a village some
                     leagues hence, and, having rested the horses, went on so rapidly as to reach
                     Lagrange in time for dinner; met with a cordial reception from all the family,
                     and were introduced to several distinguished guests. Among these, were the
                     venerable Count de Tracy and the celebrated Monsieur Constant. The former is
                     the father of Madame G. Lafayette, and a charming old gentleman he is. The latter, the intimate
                     friend of Madame de Stael, and the leader of the liberal party in the Chamber
                     of Deputies, I have described to you in a previous letter. Madame George W.
                     Lafayette is the presiding hostess of Lagrange, and has uncommonly affable and
                     affectionate manners; indeed, the whole family (as I have already remarked) are
                     extremely amiable, and so charitable, that many poor persons in their
                     neighborhood are supported by their bounty.
                  Madame Lafayette, senior, you know, died of a malady contracted in the damp and
                     noxious dungeon of Olmutz, while she shared her husband's captivity. Her memory
                     is deservedly venerated by him, and I am told that he cannot speak of her,
                     without shedding tears of sorrow and gratitude, at the recollection of her
                     sufferings and self-sacrifice for his sake. He showed us a miniature of their
                     jailor, which was taken by his eldest daughter, Madame de Maubourg, during
                     their imprisonment, in the following singular manner. She drew it first on her
                     thumb nail with a pin, not being allowed a pencil or paper;
                     however, having found means to obtain a piece of crayon and a blank leaf from a
                     book, she copied the head sketched on her nail, and, as the resemblance was
                     striking, her father has since had it painted in oil colors, by an artist, who
                     has enlarged the design; by portraying the old Cerberus with a huge bunch of
                     keys, and in the act of unlocking the prison door. It is quite an interesting
                     little picture.
                  I will now describe the farm, for we examined all parts of it. Order and
                     neatness reign throughout the domain, and the General himself sees that nothing
                     is neglected. He has a numerous flock of merino sheep, well guarded by a
                     shepherd and two faithful dogs. Their sagacity and vigilance are remarkable; if
                     one of the flock separated itself from the others only a few feet, these dogs
                     would observe it in an instant, and hasten to drive back the wanderer to its
                     place, which they always did with evident tenderness. The horses, cows and
                     swine were in a thriving condition, looking contented, fat and sleek. The
                     poultry yard contains foreign as well as domestic fowls; they are accommodated
                     according to their habits, and form an amusing spectacle. The regulations of
                     the kitchen, the dairy, the ice-house, stables and pig-styes, are admirable,
                     and you may tell Albert, that I advise him to come over and take a lesson in
                     such useful arrangements, though I will answer for it, you
                     entertain so exalted an opinion of his knowledge on all subjects, that you deem
                     more acquirements or improvements unneccessary. "Mais revenons au Chateau."
                  It is a stone building, enclosing three sides of a square court. There are five
                     towers, one at each corner, and one in the centre of the left side of the
                     castle, as you enter through a large arch which leads into the square court; it
                     is surrounded by a thickly spreading ivy, which was planted by our great
                     statesman, Charles James Fox, more than twenty years ago, while on a visit to
                     Lagrange. You approach proach the
                     arch by a bridge, thrown over a moat, bounding two sides of the castle, and
                     terminating in a small lake, Here may sometimes be seen floating an American
                     boat, that in 1824 beat an English one, in a race on the water at New York, and
                     was afterwards presented to the good General. He is adored by the Americans,
                     and quite devoted to them and their interests. His drawing room is decorated
                     with the portraits of their Presidents, and in an adjoining room may be seen,
                     in golden frames, their declaration of independence and the farewell address of
                     Washington; also, the colors of the "Brandywine," the ship they sent out with
                     him when he returned from an excursion to their country four years ago. These
                     colors were presented to him by the officers of that vessel, and the midshipmen
                     gave him, as a testimony of their respect, a handsome silver urn, with an
                     appropriate inscription. The library and a cabinet of curiosities are likewise
                     supplied with American productions. In the first, are beautiful engravings of
                     various parts of the United States, some American works, and the cane of
                     Washington; and in the second, divers odd articles of Indian manufacture.
                  On Saturday, we took leave of Lagrange and its inmates; their kindness and
                     attention to us, and the pleasure we derived from our visits to them, we can
                     never forget; they will be associated with our most agreeable reminiscences of
                     France. Last night we went to the theatre of Monsieur Compte, where all the
                     performers are children; the little creatures acted remarkably well and with
                     great spirit, and we were highly diverted. Monsieur Compte is considered the
                     best ventriloquist in Europe.
                  Edgar and Sigismund have been taking lessons in swimming; there are several
                     excellent schools here for teaching the art, and one for ladies;
                     and Marcella, Leonora and myself had serious thoughts of entering as pupils,
                     but finally concluded we had enough of water-works at the
                     delightful "Chinese Baths," on Wednesdays and Saturdays, our regular bathing
                     days, when we usually rise extremely early, so as to accomplish our purpose,
                     and get back in time for breakfast. The "Chinese Baths" are so called, because
                     the building containing them is in the Chinese style; in front is a parterre of
                     flowers, and, beyond this, masses of artificial rocks, with a couple of Chinese
                     figures among them; the whole arrangement is singular and picturesque. The
                     H——'s have returned to town for a few weeks, and we are engaged to pass this
                     evening with them. I do not covet going, however, for their parties are said to
                     be very stiff.
                  With our usual affectionate greetings to aunt Margaret, Albert, and yourself, I
                     conclude.

                  LETTER TWENTY-THIRD.
                  
                     A sociable evening at the Ex-Minister's of the Marine—Museum of
                        Artillery—Bay Market—Corn Market—St. Germarn l' Auxerrois.
                  
                  
                     PARIS, ——.
                     DEAR JANE:
                  
                  Our stay here is drawing to a close, and, consequently, during the last ten
                     days, we have been so occupied in shopping, visiting and
                        sight-seeing, that I have found it impossible to write; but
                     here is a rainy day, and I take advantage of it to resume our correspondence.
                     We called yesterday to take leave of Monsieur and Madame de N———, and they
                     looked happier, I assure you, in their own residence in the Faubourg du Roule,
                     than they did when inhabiting the sumptuous edifice of the "Admiralty," on the
                     place "Louis Quinze." I suppose you have
                     learnt from the newspapers that Monsieur de N——— thought it prudent to resign
                     his office, and has been succeeded by Monsieur ———.
                  We found him and Madame de N——— surrounded by friends, who had accidentally
                     dropped in as well as ourselves, and the evening being sultry, the company were
                     regaled with delicious sorbets and iced
                     creams. Ecarté was soon introduced among the
                     elder gentry, and several of Mr. de Neuville's young nieces being there, our
                     brothers and two other youthful beaux, the girls and myself, joined them in
                     playing "Tierce" and Blindman's-buff in the saloon. We enjoyed ourselves thus
                     till quite a late hour.
                  One of the most curious and interesting places that has recently attracted our
                     attention, is the "Museum of Artillery," in the street of the University. It is
                     the depot of a great variety of antique armor, ordnance and implements of war,
                     and among the first we beheld the coat of mail of many a famous champion, and
                     that of Joan of Arc, which we thought uncommonly large to fit a woman. Every
                     article is kept beautifully neat and bright, and a number of the things are
                     labelled, which saves the trouble of a guide to explain their names and use.
                     Another most singular place we have seen is the "Marche
                        du Vieux Linge," or "rag fair." This is an emormous building
                     divided into four halls, containing 800 stalls or petty shops. And oh! the
                     queer articles that are in these shops!—tawdry second hand hats and dresses—old
                     shoes, old gloves, old ribbons, old trunks, old carpets, bedding, chairs, and
                     other furniture. These castaways are vamped up for sale, and wo betide the
                     unfortunate wight whose path lies through or near the market; he is sure to be
                     assailed and deafened with loud importunities from every quarter, to "come and
                     buy," and may think himself lucky if he be not seized and absolutely forced
                     into some of the stalls, to behold their wonders. We went out of
                     mere curiosity, and were glad to hurry out as quickly as our feet could carry
                     us, the people were so rude and presuming.
                  The "Halle au Blé," or "corn market," well merits examination. It is a large
                     circular edifice of stone, enclosing one immense hall with a vaulted roof of
                     sheet iron; supported ported on an
                     immense framing of cast iron; from a window in the centre of which the light
                     descends. The bags of corn are heaped in enormous masses at regular distances,
                     and through the myriad of narrow passages formed by these you thread your
                     way.
                  To-day we visited the venerable church of St. Germain l'Auxerrois, the bell of
                     which tolled the signal for the Catholics to commence their direful murders on
                     the eve of St. Bartholomew, in 1572. It was once rich in pictures and statues;
                     at present, it is remarkable only for its antiquity and the curious carving
                     around its portal. Its founder was the cruel and superstitious Childebert, and
                     two statues of stone, near the entrance, are said to represent him and his
                     wife. On the fete de Dieu, the royal family
                     walk there in procession from the palace of the Tuileries, to hear mass. They
                     are magnificently arrayed and attended by a concourse of priests and soldiers,
                     and by a band of females clad in white, who strew roses in their path. From St.
                     Germain, we hastened to the palace of the fine arts on the quay Conti. For an
                     account of it, you must wait till my next letter reaches you; this, you
                     perceive, is almost full, so, while I have room, I had better insert the name
                     of your attached
                  
                     LEONTINE.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER TWENTY-FOURTH.

                        Chocolate—Iced Creams—Champs de Mars—Racing—Palace of the Fine Arts and
                        Royal Academy or Institute.
                  
                  
                     PARIS, ——.
                  
                  "What! again at your pen Leontine?" inquires Marcella; "assuredly you are a
                     most indefatigable scribe or an exceedingly devoted sister!" "Leave out the
                        or," I answer, "for I am both." You, dearest Jane,
                     can bear witness to the truth of my assertion, and I hope it will ever be my
                     pride to merit the second appellation. Indeed, it would be shameful if I did
                     not endeavor to deserve it, as you continually set me the example. This will be
                     my last letter from Paris, for the signals of our departure are resounding
                     through the saloon, from the hammers of the packers there busily engaged. Here,
                     for five francs, you may have your fine dresses and hats, &c., &c.,
                     safely and neatly arranged for travelling, by men who thus gain their living;
                     and it is surprising with what adroitness and fitness they adjust each article,
                     depositing more in one box or trunk than we could in
                        two, and fixing every thing so securely that it cannot get
                     injured, no matter how violent the motion of the carriage may be.
                  On Wednesday, we shall set out for the borders of the Rhine. Papa has
                     determined to proceed to Strasbourg, and thence descend the river as far as
                     Nimueguen, where we shall abandon
                     the steamhoat for the stage, and commence our tour through Holland. How I shall
                     regret to part with the Danvilles! Poor Edgar, it will cost him a severe pang
                     to bid farewell to Marcella, though I verily believe she has refused him,
                     judging from certain indescribable, but very expressive symptoms
                     in their recent behaviour towards each other. Alas! we shall probably never see
                     her again. Mr. Danville has promised to rejoin us at Morven Lodge, about the
                     period of your marriage. Papa, without assigning the reason of his request, has
                     urged him to be with us there by the 10th of April; but I have been so
                     loquacious as to explain all to Leonora, and we have decided on acting as
                     bride's maids, which you must own is extremely kind. Pray, don't scold me in
                     your next for tattling, and don't tell Albert of my volubility; you know, he
                     always insists that the stale and foolish saying, "a woman cannot keep a
                     secret," is correct, and he would be sure to crow over my frailty. This evening
                     we are going to see the opera of the "Muette de
                        Portici," in which there is a representation of Mount Vesuvius in
                     a state of eruption, and the imitation is considered excellent and wonderful.
                     Our party will be large, but I suspect not gay, for the reflection, that in two
                     days we shall be far separated, will doubtless cast a gloom over the mind of
                     each. As for me, I cannot bear to dwell upon the subject in thought or word, so
                     will hasten to another.
                  Who should drop in upon us yesterday evening, while we were at tea, but
                     Ernestus Blanford, and he rendered himself doubly welcome by delivering your
                     dispatches. Thank you for my share of them and for the beautiful embroidered
                     reticule. Mamma is much pleased with her's. Really, you are cunningly skilled
                     in producing, Love in a Mist, Heart's Ease, and Bachelor's
                     Buttons; may you be as successful in creating the first and second in the
                     hymeneal state; for the third, there will then be no demand. Our father and
                     brothers desire their acknowledgments for the watch-guards you wove them, and
                     Sigismund bids me say, that if the chains with which you have encircled Albert
                     are as soft and silken as those just received, he is no longer amazed at his
                     tame submission to thraldom.
                  We took a farewell drive through the city this morning, and visited the whale
                     now exhibiting on the place "Louis Quinze," in a neat edifice erected for its
                     reception; and what do you think of their having converted the poor dead
                     monster into a reading room? It is a fact, that the interior of the carcass is
                     decorated and furnished for that purpose, and is the resort of the newsmonger,
                     as well as the curious! It was on the place "Louis Quinze," (from the centre of
                     which, the view of palaces, avenues, colonades and bridges, is superb,) that
                     the royal martyrs, and thousands of other victims of the reign of terror, met
                     their fate, at the foot of a statue of Liberty, erected during that bloody
                     period on the ruins of an equestrian statue of Louis XV. This was overthrown by
                     the remorseless revolutionists, although it was universally regarded as an exquisite piece
                     of sculpture, (especially the horse,) and was the chêf d'œuvre of Bouchardon.
                     Issuing like Jonah from the whale, but probably with less
                        velocity, we went to the Bazaar to purchase some rolls of sweet
                     chocolate, which we are advised to carry with us, as being agreeable and
                     wholesome to eat early in the morning, when travelling a long distance to
                     breakfast. While the woman who sold it was tying up the package, we questioned
                     her about the conflagration of the old Bazaar, that happened several years ago,
                     and among other things she told us that two Anacondas, confined in a room of
                     the building, perished in the flames, and, during their torments, shrieked like
                     human creatures.
                  It is quite amusing to remark the variety of forms into which chocolate is cast
                     here. Tiny boots and shoes, pots and kettles, bugs and nuts, little men and
                     little women, and numerous other objects, are represented by the ingenious
                     manufacturer of that luxury. As for the bugs with their wire legs, and the
                     divers sorts of nuts, you can distinguish them from real ones only by the touch
                     or taste. While on the subject of eatables, let me mention the peculiar manner
                     in which iced creams are served at balls and parties. Each kind is moulded into
                     the shape of the fruit with which it is flavored, and frequently a peach or
                     apple dexterously tinged with red, to render the semblance of nature more
                     complete. The plates containing them are usually in the form of a golden grape
                     leaf; the stem turned up constitutes a handle, and golden spoons accord with
                     the burnished leaf. When an entertainment is given, it is only necessary for
                     the master or mistress to send a mandate for the requisite number of ices, to
                     Tortoni, Hardi, or any other adept in the freezing art, and at the
                     appointed hour they arrive, disposed in the tasteful order just described.
                  We have lately witnessed a race on the "Field of Mars," the spot appropriated
                     to such sports and to military parades. It is a vast plain, in front of the
                     military school, and is capable of admitting the evolutions of 10,000 soldiers
                     within its boundaries. These consist of rows of trees and a verdant bank, or a
                     wide wall of turfed earth, which affords a safe and convenient station for the
                     spectators of the scene below. The race road is immediately beneath the bank,
                     and separated from the area of the plain by stone pillars connected with iron
                     chains—beyond these, the carriages and horsemen are ranged. We observed several
                     ladies dashing about on horseback at a fearless rate, and among them the pretty
                     Mrs. W., the Yankee wife of a rich banker. On one side there was a pavillion
                     wherein we procured seats, and the royal family occupied another near it, which
                     had been prepared for them. The little duke of Bordeaux and his youthful sister
                     were in extacies whenever the horses ran by. The chief contention was between a
                     courser of Monsieur Casimir Perrier and one belonging to Lord Seymour. The
                     French steed gained the victory, much to the delight of the populace. But some
                     Englishmen surmised that if Purdy
                     had been there, matters would have ended differently. I asked Mr. Danville who
                     they meant by Purdy, and he informed me that he is a countryman of ours, who
                     once distinguished himself in America (at the city of New York, I think he
                     said) by mounting a famous horse, ycleped Eclipse, and wrestling
                     the palm from Henry, a celebrated racer of the South. At present, I must fulfil
                     my promise of describing to you the "palace of the arts," anciently termed the
                     college of the four nations, because it was designed by its founder, Cardinal
                     Mazarin, for the reception of pupils from among the four nations subdued by
                     Louis the great.
                  It is a handsome structure, extending for many yards along the borders of the
                     Seine. Its designation has been changed, and it is now used by the "Royal
                     Academy or Institute," for their private meetings and general assemblies. This
                     corps of Savans was established in the reign of Louis, and is composed of the
                     élite of the philosophers, artists and literary men of the kingdom. They
                     correspond with the literati of all countries, and have done much in the cause
                     of literature and the arts and sciences. They have ranged themselves into four
                     classes; the first is devoted to the improvement of natural philosophy,
                     chemistry and mathematics, and is denominated the "Academy of Sciences;" the
                     second makes the language and literature of France its care, and is called the
                     "French Academy;" the third applies itself to history and ancient learning, and
                     bears the title of the "Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres;" and the
                     fourth, the "Academy of the Fine Arts," is employed on music, painting,
                     sculpture and architecture. The classes meet separately once a week, and hold
                     each general annual association in the months of March, April, July and
                     October; at which times prizes are awarded by the Academy of the Fine Arts, to
                     such as deserve them; who are afterwards permitted to repair to Rome and remain
                     there some years to improve themselves in their vocations, the government
                     paying their expenses. The hall in which the general meetings are held, was
                     formerly a chapel; beneath it Cardinal Mazarin lies buried. The members wore a
                     costume of black and green, and the successful candidates are sometimes crowned
                     with wreaths of laurel. The hall, and several apartments leading to it, are
                     decorated with statues of various distinguished characters,—as Bossuet,
                     Fenelon, Sully, Pascal, Descartes, Rollin, Moliére, and others, whose names are
                     venerated by the learned and good. The post hour has arrived, so farewell to my
                     "bonny Jean"—we shall soon be still farther from you, but any
                     where and every where I shall still be your devoted sister,
                  
                     LEONTINE.
                  
               
            
            
               
               THE DEAD BRIDE;
               OR, "THE FOUNTAIN OF TREVI."
               A TALE FOUNDED ON FACT.
               In the spring of 18—, two young ladies, attended by their brother, sallied forth
                  from one of the chief hotels in Rome, to view some of its architectural wonders
                  and inhale the balmy air of a glorious morning.
               Day, "beautiful day!" shed a golden lustre upon dome, column and spire, each of
                  which seemed rejoicing beneath the brightening influence, as in gleaming grandeur
                  it towered to the skies.
               The pedestrians proceeded first to the "Fountain of Trevi," which is considered
                  the most beautiful and most wholesome in the city. They admired its capacious
                  basin, which is many feet in circumference and several feet deep; its pile of
                  artificial rocks in the centre, and the colossal figure of old Neptune in his car
                  of shells, drawn by sea-horses and guided by Tritons; its emblematical statues and
                  basso-relievos, one of the latter representing the peasant girl who directed some
                  thirsty soldiers to the source of this fountain, (eight miles distant,) from which
                  circumstance it is termed "Aqua Virgina;" and another portraying the valiant
                  Marcus Agrippa, the embellisher of Rome, to whom the ancient city is indebted for
                  the Pantheon, and many of its noblest edifices.
               As they stood upon its brink, examining its decorations and listening to its musical ripplings—"What a
                  charming conception for a fountain!" exclaimed Constantia, the younger sister,
                  whose dark and mirthful eyes, glowing cheeks and dimpled mouth contrasted strongly
                  with the pale and pensive, yet lovely face of Dora, the elder. "All hail to the
                  son-in-law of Augustus, for having had this water conducted to Rome, although it
                  was merely for the selfish purpose of supplying his baths. And more thanks still
                  to Clement the Twelfth, for the ornamental devices and statues he has lavished
                  upon it, thus rendering it so goodly a spectacle for our present benefit! How
                  refreshing just to look upon it and hear its murmurings!"
               "Do you remember," said Dora, "Madame de Stael's beautiful description of it in
                  her thrilling novel 'Corinne?' I should like to come and read it here on the spot
                  some clear moonlight night. Suppose we do?"
               "Agreed, thou romantic girl, if Ernest will again be our escort," replied
                  Constantia.
               Their brother acceded to the proposition; and they continued their ramble to the
                  Piazza Monte Cavallo, a noble square, pleasantly situated on the Quirinal Hill,
                  and surrounded by magnificent buildings. In the midst of these, rises a lofty
                  Egyptian obelisk of red granite, flanked by two celebrated specimens of antique
                  sculpture, attributed to Phidias and Praxiteles, the majestic figures of Castor
                  and Pollux with their struggling chargers. From these superbly executed coursers,
                  the square derives its name of "Monte Cavallo."
               After gratifying curiosity and admiration here, they proceeded to the Rospiglio
                  Palace, to see the famous picture of Aurora, or morning personified, by Guido
                  Reni. It is painted in fresco, (an art now
                  lost,) on the ceiling of a basement room, and wonderful is it for beauty of
                  design, coloring and expression!
               Another party of English visitors were present, and quite enthusiastic in their
                  encomiums on it, and among them a young lady so intent upon inspecting the
                  picture, that, gazing upwards and walking backwards at the same time, she came
                  suddenly against Constantia, and was near being prostrated. Recovering her
                  balance, she turned to apologize for her rough intrusion on the pretty foot she
                  had pressed, when the owner of it and herself simultaneously ejaculated in joyful
                  surprise—"Why, my dear friend, are you here?" At the same moment,
                  Dora and Ernest appoaching, affectionate greetings were exchanged between them
                  all; for who should it be but their friend and former schoolmate, Sophia Elfort,
                  standing so unexpectedly among them! They had parted the year before in London,
                  and at that time she had no idea of following them to Italy; but, in the
                  meanwhile, two wealthy relatives, Mr. and Mrs. Mervin, having invited her to
                  accompany them in a tour on the continent, she accepted their kindness, and was
                  thus again united, much sooner than either of the three anticipated, to her
                  favorite associates.
               She introduced them to the Mervins, and after spending an hour together in social
                  chat, and promising to meet often, the travellers separated and returned to their
                  respective hotels to breakfast.
               We will now retrograde in our story, in order to render it more intelligible to
                  the reader.
               Mr. Wentworth, a rich merchant of Bristol, a man of sense and refinement, and of
                  high parentage, was travelling for his health, accompanied by his wife, his two
                  daughters, Dora and Constantia, and his only son Ernest, a chief actor in some of
                  the scenes to be described.
               
               The family had passed the winter in Florence; but, owing to Mr. Wentworth's
                  indisposition, they lived very retired, with the exceptiou of Ernest, who,
                  becoming intimate with two gay and fashionable young men from England, was often
                  induced to join in their amusements and mingle with the world. After spending many
                  weeks in a round of dissipation, he determined on going to Rome with his new
                  friends and boon companions, Herman and Medway, and there awaited the arrival of
                  his parents and sisters, who purposed remaining a month longer in Florence. They
                  departed with letters of introduction, that soon enabled them to share in the
                  festivities of Rome as they had done in those of Florence, and they joined in the
                  frivolities and mad frolics of the carnival with great zest.
               At that time, there resided in the Rue de Ripetta, an Italian gentleman, the
                  Signor Albertini, with his only daughter, the lovely Laura, and his orphan niece,
                  the fair Eudosia, whose father, Mr. Sanford, was an Englishman, and once a
                  resident of Naples, where he married the sister of Albertini. Eudosia was about
                  seven years old when her parents removed to London to take possession of an
                  inheritance bequeathed them by a distant relation. In the course of a few years
                  they also died, and she was left, at the age of thirteen, a wealthy heiress and
                  unprotected. Albertini immediately offered her a home, (his motives, we will not
                  scan,) and she gladly exchanged "the vapors, clouds and storms" of old England,
                  for the bland and sunny clime of her native "Italia," where she soon became the
                  devoted and beloved companion of her beautiful cousin, Laura. Being nearly of the
                  same age, they attended the same schools, and pursued their studies congenially
                  together until womanhood, when, buoyant with spirits and pleasant anticipations,
                  they entered society.
               For poor Laura, these were quickly blighted. The avaricious disposition of her
                  father proved as fatal to her budding hopes and affections, as is the breeze from
                  the baneful upas to the flower upon which it may chance to blow. Talented, and
                  very lovely, she attracted numerous admirers, and among them a rich nobleman, Lord
                  V. She disliked him exceedingly, and avoided and repulsed him on every occasion;
                  but he was as invulnerable to slight and rudeness, as was Achilles to the weapons
                  of his foes—nay, more so, for the Greek champion could be wounded in
                  the heel, but Lord V. was entirely callous; and perceiving that the
                  sordid Albertini favored his suit, he prosecuted it with an ardor which rendered
                  him still more detestable to the object of his passion. Compelled, at length, by
                  her stern and inexorable sire, to listen to the addresses of her tormentor, and
                  consent to sacrifice herself at the shrine of mammon, the timid girl became almost
                  broken-hearted. Eudosia deeply sympathised with her, and vainly strove to soothe
                  and cheer her. Calm and tearless, she moved about, as it were, in a lethargy of
                  grief, and every day the roses faded from her cheek.
               Things were in this sad state, when the Duchess of M. gave a ball, and she being
                  the aunt of Lord V., Albertini insisted that his daughter and niece should attend
                  her gala. He was not to be disobeyed, and they did so, though most
                  reluctantly.
               Dressed in virgin white, and pale as the snowy wreaths that twined her hair, Laura
                  entered the splendid halls of the Duchess, accompanied by Eudosia and Albertini,
                  who, as he advanced between them, reminded one of a dark and lowering cloud separating two lovely stars. Having
                  paid their respects to the hostess of the palace, they stationed themselves in a
                  favorable position for viewing the dancers, where we will leave them for the
                  present, and recount what was passing on the opposite side of the ball-room
                  between two young cavaliers, conversing as follows:
               "Ernest, did you ever behold a more complete realization, in face and form, of
                  Byron's Zuleika, than that beauteous being now before us? What a divine
                  creature!"
               "She is, indeed!" replied his companion, involuntarily repeating the lines alluded
                  to, as he gazed upon the unconscious girl to whom his attention was called—upon
                  Laura, who, fair and drooping as a lily—fit emblem of her purity and
                  sweetness—stood leaning on her father's arm.
               "Oh, cease your poetizing, Ernest," cried Herman; "for to me it now seems very
                     prosing, as I am impatient to find out who she is; and before the
                  revels are over we must form her acquaintance—for she is a goddess at whose shrine
                  I fain would worship: so come along."
               "What think you of the blue-eyed sylph on the other side of that scowling old
                  gentleman?" asked Medway, who had just then approached and heard their remarks. 
                     
                        "'Aime les yeux noir si tu vu,
                        Moi, j'aime les yeux bleu.'"
                     
                  
               
               "Ah! well, aid us in our voyage of discovery, and we will not interfere with your
                  choice," was the reply, and the lively trio mingled with the crowd around
                  them.
               A few hours afterwards, Medway was dancing with Eudosia, and Ernest and Herman
                  holding "sweet converse" with Laura.
               Seated in an alcove, apart from the "busy throng," they listened to her gentle
                  tones, and, alike entranced by her beauty and intelligence, the friends became
                  rivals. Lord V. witnessed, with jealous and angry feelings, their devotion to his
                  betrothed, and, seeking Albertini, the destiny of poor Laura was soon decided; for
                  he demanded and obtained the promise of a speedy union.
               At a late hour, Albertini returned home with his daughter and niece, and informed
                  them that in one month from that night the proposed nuptials were to be
                  solemnized, as Lord V. would not consent to delay them any longer.
               In vain did Laura and Eudosia plead for a respite: it was peremptorily denied; and
                  oppressed with disappointment and sorrow, they retired to their chamber, not to
                  rest, but to mingle their tears and vain regrets. At early dawn, Laura arose from
                  her sleepless couch, and wrote the following note to her father. Pity that it had
                  not softened his adamantine heart, and changed his stern resolve.
               "Father! father! once more I supplicate for mercy. Oh! grant it to me, I beseech
                  you! I am almost frantic at the thought of marrying Lord V., that hateful man! He
                  is odious to me, and a union with him will be more dreadful than the bitterest
                  death! Father, will you not save me from it? Would that he had never crossed my
                  path, which he has so strewn with thorns. Father, again I call upon you to save me
                  from him, to rescue me from a fate that will impel me to destruction with a power
                  as irresistible as that which draws the doomed vessel into the maelstrom!"
               The appeal was useless—her fate was sealed.
               We will now return to our three heroes, Ernest, Herman and Medway.
               After the departure of the cousins from the ball, they also left it, and repaired
                  to their lodgings, where, before retiring tiring, they talked over the events of the evening. Medway acknowledged himself
                  deeply smitten with the charming "les yeux bleu," and Herman and Ernest confessed
                  the passion with which the beautiful Laura had inspired them; but, at the same
                  time, pledged themselves by the sacredness of friendship and fellowship, not to
                  impede each other in the pursuit of her favor, but to be strictly guided in their
                  course by the partiality she might evince for either. Striking hands to this
                     Pythian game, they sought their pillows.
               The following afternoon they were gallantly mounted, and mixing with the crowd of
                  carriages and horsemen which daily assemble at four o'clock to drive and ride in
                  the "Strada del Corso," the gayest and most fashionable street in Rome, and so
                  called from the races which annually take place in it. In these the
                  horses run without riders, and are covered with leather straps furnished with
                  small iron points, which prick the poor animals at every motion, and, together
                  with the shouts of the spectators, urged them to full speed. It is a cruel
                  sport.
               Our adventurers had not proceeded far, ere they descried the objects of their
                  search in an open landau, attended, as usual, by the watchful sire and his chosen
                  son-in-law.
               On recognizing Herman and Medway, Laura and Eudosia bowed and blushed, and the
                  shafts of Cupid sank still deeper into the hearts he had already pierced. That
                  night, at the witching hour of twelve, dulcet sounds and melodious voices broke
                  upon the slumbers of the cousins, and from their balcony they listened, and their
                  gentle bosoms responded to the tender strains that were chaunted beneath it.
               Again and again were these serenades repeated, and afforded poor Laura the only
                  moments of happiness she enjoyed; for whenever Eudosia and herself went out,
                  though they always met Herman and Medway, they could seldom converse with either,
                  as Albertini and Lord V. generally escorted them. But love is as shrewd as it is
                  watchful, and, during the carnival, opportunities had occurred, whereby they had
                  eluded the vigilance of their male Duennas, and with the eastern
                  eloquence of flowers, told tales of ardent attachment, and in stolen interviews
                  exchanged vows of eternal fidelity.
               And what of poor Ernest? 'Tis time we should speak of him and tell how nobly he
                  acted—how (true to his pledge) he withdrew from the fascinations of Laura as soon
                  as he perceived her predilection for Herman. His parents and sisters arriving in
                  Rome, he devoted himself to them; but his saddened aspect and pallid
                  cheek betrayed a secret sorrow within his breast, despite his efforts to conceal
                  it. It was an unquenched and unrequited flame that preyed upon him, baffling his
                  every struggle to subdue it. Lest he should meet with Laura, he kept out of
                  society—lest he should hear her spoken of, (he even dreaded the "magic of a
                  name,") he avoided his friends, Herman and Medway, and held no intercourse with
                  them for many weeks. During that period, how wretched was the object of his
                  adoration!
               Preparations were made for her approaching nuptials, or, more properly speaking,
                  her immolation. Rich and rare was the trousseau which the golden
                  coffers of Lord V. provided; and if silks and velvets, lace and jewels, could
                  create felicity, the highest might have been hers—but alas! what avail such
                  gewgaws to the stricken heart! It turns from them in disgust.
               "Young ladies, are you ready for our walk to the 'Fountain of Trevi?'" demanded
                  Ernest, one evening, shortly after the events recounted above. "The moon is
                     shining brightly, and the heavens
                  without a cloud—if you have found the book, pray let us go."
               "Here it is," observed Constantia; "but Sophia Elfort has not arrived, and we
                  cannot proceed without her. What can thus detain her?"
               Just then they heard her voice in the corridor, and she entered, accompanied by
                  Mr. and Mrs. Mervin.
               "Well, really, my friend, we quite rejoice to greet you," said Dora. "We began to
                  fear you would not come, as you are generally so punctual to your
                  engagements, and it is now long past the hour appointed for assembling."
               "Pardon me, dear girls, for thus trying your patience," she replied; "but when you
                  learn the cause of my fault, you will excuse me, I'm sure. Know, then, that as we
                  came by the 'Chiesa del Jesu,' we observed it was illuminated, and entering to see
                  what was going on, we beheld a most touching, painful, yet beautiful
                  spectacle!—the lifeless body of a young and lovely girl, clad in bridal attire,
                  and laid on a bier surrounded by a railing to prevent intruders from approaching
                  too near to the sacred remains. Oh! she was as fair and beauteous as the
                  orange-blossoms that decorated her clay-cold brow! We learned her melancholy
                  history from a bystander, and I will relate it as we sit by the fountain—to do so
                  now, will delay us too long, Come, let us hasten on, for, perhaps, after listening
                  to the sad tale, you will like to repair to the church and gaze upon the
                  dead."
               They proceeded—Ernest with a dark presentiment in his mind, which made him
                  shudder, and dread to hear the promised recital.
               A month had elapsed since he had received tidings of Herman and Medway, or the
                  family in the Rue di Ripetta, and what might not have happened in that time!—for
                  "who knoweth what even a day may bring forth!"
               The rays of the moon fell softly on the glittering spray of the Fountain of Trevi,
                  as it danced and rippled over the mimic rocks in the centre. Madame de Stael's
                  pleasing and graphic description of it was read according to agreement, and quite
                  hurriedly too; for both the reader and listeners were impatient for the narration
                  Sophia had promised, and she declined giving it until the object of their visit
                  was accomplished. This done, she began, and Ernest, almost breathless with
                  anxiety, placed himself at her side, leaning for support upon one of the stone
                  pillars which stand upon the brink of the reservoir.
               "Our informant," continued Sophia, "did not know the name of the beautiful corpse;
                  he had only been told that she was the daughter and sole child of a crusty old
                  Italian, whose avarice had compelled her to resign a young and ardent lover, whose
                  affection she reciprocated, and with whom she had vainly tried to elope, and to
                  marry a dissipated old nobleman who was very rich. Yesterday was to have been the
                  wedding day of the ill-matched pair, and a numerous company were bidden to the
                  espousals. They assembled at the appointed hour, and anxiously awaited the descent
                  of the bride from her chamber, where, at her request, her attendants had left her
                  alone a short time previous to that at which the ceremony was to be performed.
               "The guests and attendants waited in vain—the hour struck and past—still she came
                  not forth—they sought her apartment, the door was locked within; they knocked,
                  they called—no answer was returned—the door was forced open, and horror-stricken,
                  they beheld her in all her rich attire
                  and beauty, stretched upon the nuptial couch, and still and cold in death!
               "To avoid the hateful union to which she was doomed, she had swallowed a subtle
                  poison, and the too late repentant father was childless!"
               As Sophia concluded, a groan, instantly succeeded by a heavy plunge into the deep
                  and spacious basin of the fountain, caused the three girls to start and scream
                  with alarm. Ernest had fainted and fallen in; his sisters and Sophia shrieked for
                  succor, but it was late and the street forsaken, and many minutes elapsed ere help
                  arrived. Alas! when it came it availed not the unhappy youth! Cold and senseless,
                  he was drawn from the water and carried home, followed by the terrified and
                  weeping females. Every effort to restore him proved unavailing: life was extinct,
                  and he was buried in the same vault with the beautiful and lamented Laura
                  Albertini, whose story and wretched fate our readers must doubtless have
                  recognized in the sad recital of Sophia Elfort. On his tomb was
                  engraved "Ernest;" on hers, "Laura"—nothing more bespoke the place of
                  their rest—naught told of their virtues or their sorrows, save the records of
                  memory in the hearts of their friends. Separated in life, in death they were
                  united.
               The anguish of Mr. and Mrs. Wentworth cannot be depicted—neither that of Herman.
                  For weeks he was in a state bordering on frenzy. At length he grew more composed,
                  and consented to return to England with the Wentworths, who, notwithstanding their
                  own griefs, visited him in his affliction' as being a "stranger in a strange
                  land," and a chosen friend of their lamented son.
               Medway parted from him reluctantly, but remained in Rome to console and wed
                  Eudosia, who was almost distracted ed at the untimely end of her darling cousin.
                  After some months they were united in wedlock, and with the approval of her uncle,
                  the miserable Albertini, who, agonized and softened by the loss of his lovely
                  daughter, no longer opposed their wishes, and very soon after their marriage,
                  retired to a monastery, where he endeavored, bya life of piety and penance, to
                  obtain that inward peace the world can never give. Let us hope he succeeded. Lord
                  V. wore mourning for his betrothed the usual period dictated by etiquette, and
                  then resumed his pursuits of pleasure in the fashionable coteries of Rome and
                  Florence.
               And now for the moral of my story. Parents, take warning by the fatal and painful
                  incident upon which it is founded, and let not a base regard for "filthy lucre,"
                  as the Scripture calleth it, induce you to sacrifice the happiness of your sons
                  and daughters at the altar of hymen. Wedlock without love is bad enough; but to
                  share it with one while the heart throbs with devotion for another, is
                  insupportable misery; the mere anticipation of which has probably driven many to
                  self-destruction, like the unfortunate heroine of our tale.
               It is finished, save that for the edification of our readers we will add a few
                  lines, to say that when time had alleviated the grief and despair of Herman, he
                  sought further consolation in a union with the gentle Dora, and that previous to
                  this event, Constantia and Sophia bestowed their hearts and hands upon two worthy
                  nephews of Mr. Mervin.
            
            
               
               WO AND WEAL; OR, THE TRANSITIONS OF LIFE.
               A TALE.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Man's yesterday may ne'er be like his morrow;
                           Naught may endure, but mutability."
                        
                     
                     MRS. M. W. SHELBY.
                  
               
               Harcourt and Reginald Delacy were twin brothers, and the only children of a brave
                  officer, who was killed at the bombardment of Fort McHenry, near Baltimore,
                  Maryland, during the war of 1812, between the United States and Great Britain.
               That "misfortunes rarely come singly," is as true a proverb as it is common, and
                  this, their first calamity, was quickly followed by a second equally severe, the
                  loss of their mother, whose constitution had been so enfeebled by long declining
                  health, that she sunk under the affliction occasioned by her husband's untimely
                  death, and, a few months after that melancholy event, her sainted spirit took its
                  flight from earth to rejoin him in a happier sphere.
               A sketch of Mrs. Delacy may not be inopportune. She was the daughter of an Irish
                  peer, beautiful, and an heiress, and, as might be expected, received numerous
                  offers of marriage, but rejected all for the sake of him who had gained her young
                  affections before she entered society—her cousin Oswald—the gallant Major whom she
                  wedded.
               Her disposition was extremely gay, perhaps too volatile; but when maternal feelings were developed, they
                  triumphed over every other propensity, and she readily abandoned the haunts of
                  pleasure and devoted herself to her children, and a husband whom she idolized. He
                  being a sensible and religious man, the force of his example caused her to render
                  a lovely character still more lovely, by the additional graces of piety and its
                  attendant virtues, humility and gentleness. Although in her fortieth year, and a
                  prey to blighting sickness, many personal attractions still remained;—a set of
                  delicately chiselled features, a fair skin, and large, lustrous hazel eyes, to
                  which consumption, with that mysterious effect peculiar to it,
                  communicated unusual brilliancy, while the softness of her voice, the elegance of
                  her manners, (for she had been bred in the highest circles,) and the conviction,
                  which her fragile appearance instantly produced, that her life was fast waning
                  away, created interest and sympathy in the minds of all who knew her.
               A touching and a holy scene did the chamber of that dying mother present, in the
                  agonizing moment of separation from the loved ones of earth!
               It was a gloomy November evening, and the wind in fitful gusts shook the closed
                  blinds of the invalid's apartment, but comfort and quiet reigned within. A carpet
                  and curtains of rich crimson, a brisk fire and an astral lamp diffused a cheerful
                  glow around the room, and the atmosphere savoured of an aromatic perfume, from a
                  pastil burning in a miniature castle of gilded porcelain. Near a table, covered
                  with books and implements for drawing, and a tray of oranges and candied fruits,
                  reclined Mrs. Delacy in an easy chair, while Reginald read aloud one of Mrs.
                  Sherwood's excellent volumes, and Harcourt inspected a port folio of engravings.
                  Suddenly, a slight faintness assailed her, and she requested them to extinguish
                  the pastil and open the door to admit air. They did so, but she grew worse, and
                  they summoned her nurse, who, alarmed at the death-like hue and expression of her
                  face, immediately sent for a physician, and dispatched a messenger for Mr.
                  Fitzgerald, an intimate friend of the family, who resided a few miles off, and had
                  acted as their protector from the period of the Major's death.
               They came, and Mrs. Delacy was soon aware of her approaching dissolution; she was
                  undismayed, for she knew that the beneficent Creator she had served in prosperity
                  would not forsake her in the hour of trouble, and on the threshold of eternity she
                  was calm and collected. Raising her beautiful eyes and hands to heaven, for some
                  minutes she appeared absorbed in fervent supplication; she then embraced and
                  solemnly blessed her weeping sons, as they knelt by her side, and committed them
                  to the guardianship of Mr. Fitzgerald, and the smile of an angel beamed o'er her
                  countenance as she thanked him, the doctor, and nurse, for their kindness, and
                  left affectionate messages for absent friends.
               Ere morning, the vigils of love and duty were no longer necessary; the sufferer
                  was at rest, and the convulsive sobs of the bereaved brothers, the stealthy tread
                  and low whispers of sympathising assistants, and the moaning of the autumn wind,
                  which seemed chanting a requiem for the dead, were the only sounds that fell upon
                  the ear, throughout the mansion of the departed. 
                     
                        "Until the grave shut from our sight it's
                        Victims, there is hope."
                     
                  
               
               And, although their mother's increasing palor and debility ought to have prepared
                  them for the "coming wo," Harcourt and Reginald clung to the fond anticipation of
                  her recovery covery, and their
                  bereavement was a shock that overwhelmed them with despair.
               Mr. Fitzgerald was faithful to his trust, and, when the last sad rites of
                  sepulture had been performed over the remains of Mrs. Delacy, he removed his
                  wards, then fifteen years of age, to Cherwell Cottage, his own rustic, but
                  tasteful residence, in the vicinity of Oxford.
               Here Mrs. Fitzgerald and her two little daughters greeted them with cordiality,
                  and every thing was done to sooth and content them. Grief has but temporary power
                  over the young; it may cause them to droop like flowers for awhile, but like
                  flowers will they revive, if bedewed with the waters of consolation and kindness,
                  and thus treated, Harcourt and Reginald by degrees resumed their cheerfulness, and
                  shared in the sports of their blythesome associates, Amanda and Rosa: these little
                  lassies were several years younger than themselves, and as bright and blooming as
                  the roses of Damascus. The income arising from the Delacy property was amply
                  sufficient for the support and education of our young heroes, and, after a sojourn
                  of considerable length at the cottage, they were placed at school, at Eton, in
                  Buckinghamshire, that famous establishment founded by Henry the Sixth, where they
                  continued several years; in which interim, Harcourt, who was as wild and bold as
                  D'Israelli's "Vivian Grey," headed a row for amusement whenever he had a chance,
                  and was careful not to injure himself by too close an application to Greek and
                  Latin, or the Classics; Reginald, on the contrary, became their devotee. In truth, the patriarchal twins of yore,
                  Jacob and Esau, were not more widely different in appearance, tastes and
                  dispositions, than were these, our pen portrays; and when qualified for their
                  terms at College, the intellectual and study-loving Reginald was fain to go, but
                  the enterprising Harcourt insisted upon seeking his fortune in the West Indies.
                  Mr. Fitzgerald remonstrated in vain against the proposal; his objections were
                  over-ruled, and he yielded a reluctant consent.
               Harcourt sailed for Cuba, and never trod his native soil again! He vested his
                  property in a successful speculation: this tempted him to try another, then a
                  third, a fourth; each proved fortunate, and in less than five years, he was the
                  proprietor of a large and flourishing plantation, well stocked with negroes and
                  overseers to cultivate it.
               Yet, in the midst of this wondrous prosperity and augmenting wealth, he felt as
                  did Damocles, when feasting with the sword suspended over his head; the slow but
                  sure destroyer, withering consumption, which he inherited from his mother,
                  attacked him even in Cuba's southern clime, and, notwithstanding the utmost
                  prudence and care, for life to him was sweet, and he was loth to die, he became
                  its victim ere he attained his twenty-fifth anniversary. He bequeathed his estate
                  to Reginald, whose career had been far happier. Though Fortune had showered no
                     golden favours o'er him, Love had lavished on him his
                  rosiest smiles. Amanda Fitzgerald, now a beautiful woman of nineteen, had plighted
                  to him her faith, and their nuptials were to be celebrated as soon as he commenced
                  the practice of his profession, the law.
               The intelligence of poor Harcourt's decease afflicted him deeply, though
                  accompanied by the information of his rich bequest. Interest required that he
                  should hasten to take possession of it, and he prepared to do so—to leave, for six
                  tedious months, his betrothed! Had the inheritance consisted of Golconda's diamond
                  mines, he would have thought them well
                  paid for, by the performance of such a pilgrimage. But the dread of evil, like the
                  anticipation of enjoyment, generally exceeds its realization.
               The evening appointed for his departure arrived, and he sauntered with Amanda in
                  tender converse on the banks of the Thames at Oxford, where he had graduated, with
                  distinction, the preceding year. A full-orbed moon poured down her silvery rays
                  upon the turrets and buildings of the University, that venerable and illustrious
                  seat of learning, and varied with light and shadow the thickly foliaged trees
                  which reared themselves around. The calmness of the night diffused its influence
                  over the minds of the lovers, and, for awhile, they ceased to speak; Delacy at
                  length resumed—"my sweet friend," said he, "think of me when gone, as I shall
                  think of you, frequently, fondly, fervently! Pray for my welfare, as
                  I shall pray for your's, and Heaven will surely bless me with a
                  prosperous voyage and a speedy return, to claim this precious hand, and make it
                  mine forever!" Amanda responded to his affectionate appeal, and promised all he
                  desired.
               It was late ere they rejoined the inmates of Cherwell Cottage; and not till long
                  after the College bells had chimed twelve, (which seemed to them a parting knell,)
                  did they separate. The family had retired at an earlier hour, and left them
                  together.
               As he bade farewell, Reginald drew from his vest a chain of gold and clasped it
                  round Amanda's neck—"Dearest, this sacred relic, the gift of my angelic mother! I
                  leave with thee; its purity and strength render it a fit emblem of our attachment;
                  so wear it for my sake, and now I claim the bridal lock you promised to have ready
                  for me." The boon was given, and he tore himself away.
               Amanda accompanied him to the door, and thence gazed upon his receding figure as
                  he traversed the lawn, till, in the depths of the avenue beyond, it was hidden
                  from her view. With an aching heart she sought her chamber, and there yielded to
                  the fulness of its sorrow. "Oh! that I could have been his bride and shared the
                  perils of this voyage!" she exclaimed; "the wide, wide seas will soon roll between
                  us, and I have sad forebodings we shall never meet again." Pressing the chain to
                  her lips, she knelt and prayed for the beloved donor; then threw herself on the
                  couch beside her sleeping sister; but day dawned ere slumber closed her
                  eye-lids.
               Her perturbed feelings communicated themselves to her dreams, and in them she
                  beheld Reginald struggling amid the ocean's briny waves, and vainly trying to
                  reach an island, near which the vessel was wrecked—at length, with extended hands,
                  he grasped the shore, when a huge billow enfolded him and he disappeared. She
                  uttered a piteous cry and awoke; the sun was shining through the lattice, and an
                  April shower falling rapidly in large drops, whose loud pattering had probably
                  contributed to the illusion of her stormy dream. Rosa was dressed and the matin
                  bell had rung; so, springing from her bed, with her sister's aid, she was soon
                  ready to descend to the saloon, where the family were at prayers, and as she
                  joined in devotion, she felt her heart relieved of despondency, and full with
                  faith that her lover would be protected and restored to her. Happy those who thus
                  can find solace in communion with a merciful Providence! Amanda now reaped the
                  blessings of a religious education; her parents were strict members of the
                  Protestant Episcopal church, and had brought up their children in accordance with
                  its holiest precepts—had taught them to love, honor, and trust in God!
               
               At present, trace we Delacy in his peregrinations. After quitting Cherwell
                  Cottage, he walked on without venturing a glance upon temptation in the form of
                  the fair being he had left standing in the door-way. Guided by the light of the
                  still presiding moon, he pursued the path to Magdalen bridge, so remarkable for
                  its position and the beauty of its architecture. Spanning both branches of the
                  Cherwell, a considerable portion of it lies over the ground which divides the
                  river. Here he paused to cast a "lingering look" upon the exquisite landscape, and
                  especially upon the poplar and leechen trees which towered in perspective, and
                  sheltered the abode of the beloved one from whom he had just separated—perhaps for
                  ever! The very idea was insupportable, and he hurried away to his lodgings, to try
                  and banish it in the forgetfulness of sleep; but his repose, like Amanda's, was
                  disturbed and unrefreshing, and when at day-break he entered the stage-coach for
                  London, his feelings were as sombre as the sky above him, then darkened by masses
                  of clouds which ultimately descended in the plentiful shower already mentioned.
                  Soon, however, the sun shone out and a rain-bow arched the heavens; it seemed an
                  omen of good, and with the cheerful villages, verdant hedges and parks, and an
                  exhilirating breeze, revived his spirits and his hopes.
               Those who have traveled in "merry old England," well know the ease and velocity
                  with which its smooth and level roads are glided over by vehicles, public or
                  private; the comfort and neatness of the inns—the smiling physiognomies and
                  obligingness of the land-lords, land-ladies, waiters, and waiting-maids,
                  particularly when the style and appearance of the traveler betokened liberal
                  custom and sure payment. Reginald experienced all these, and in due
                  time was set down at Wright's hotel, near the strand. The following day he made
                  purchases and preparations necessary for his voyage, and wrote a farewell letter
                  to Amanda—the second found him on board of a noble packet ship, with full-spread
                  canvass, moving like a stately swan across the blue waters of the British
                  channel.
               Among the passengers were a gentleman and lady from New York, Colonel and Mrs.
                  Danvers, who, with their three daughters, had been making a tour through England
                  and Wales, and spending a winter in London. The trio were lovely looking girls,
                  and Delacy perceiving a strong resemblance between Adelaide, the eldest, and
                  Amanda, often sought her society and paid her marked attention—reading, or playing
                  chess and backgammon, or promenading, when the sea was smooth; they were
                  constantly together. It was a dangerous intimacy for susceptible and sympathetic
                  souls!
               For many days the voyagers were favoured with propitious winds and sunny skies;
                  but when within a week's sail of the American coast, the aspect of the heavens
                  suddenly changed, and darkness seemed brooding o'er the vessel, as it rolled
                  heavily from side to side on mountainous waves. Anon, flashes of lurid lightning
                  gleamed upon the deep, accompanied by peals of hoarsest thunder, and white-crested
                  billows dashed in furious tumult over the deck of the struggling ship, washing off
                  all things that had not been securely corded to its masts or bulwarks. The
                  straining and creaking of the timbers, the rattling of the ropes, the cries of the
                  sailors as they dragged down the torn and soaking canvass, in obedience to their
                  captain's orders, issued with a stentorian voice through a speaking trumpet,
                  rendered the scene terriffic! Those who have not witnessed a storm at sea, cannot conceive its sublime
                  horror, and the awful fear it excites in the breasts of the timid and
                  inexperienced! Then the dizziness—the qualmishness—the revolting sickness! Oh,
                  'tis a time of trial! a rigorous test of every mental and bodily nerve!
               The female passengers of the "Trident" were frantic with terror. Mrs. Danvers and
                  her younger daughters clung to their father for support and protection, but
                  Adelaide flew to Delacy. "If doomed to be lost, let us perish together," she
                  exclaimed, and threw herself into his arms, where she remained motionless, almost
                     breathless, till the rage and violence of the elements abated,
                  when, recovering her presence of mind, and abashed at this involuntary exhibition
                  of a passion she had hitherto concealed, she broke from him and hastily retreated
                  to her state-room.
               Then and thus it was that Delacy discovered his civilities and kindness had been
                  misinterpreted, and had won the heart of his artless companion. The conviction
                  filed him with pain; generous, honorable, and benevolent, he would not allow even
                  vanity to be gratified by so great, so fruitless a sacrifice, on the part of
                  another, complimentary as it was. What course to pursue, he hesitated—to change in
                  his demeanor and treat with reserve and coldness an innocent creature, who
                  evidently adored him, seemed cruel; nay, impossible! and yet to persevere in his
                  attentions would be cherishing a hopeless, and perhaps, a fatal attachment. He
                  thought not of danger to himself—Alas! for Amanda! Alas! for woman's
                  love and man's fidelity!
               After a vast deal of meditation, Reginald determined, as young people generally do
                  in cases of difficulty, to be guided by circumstances, (in other words, their own
                     impulses,) and with that perilous resolve, instead of
                  disclosing ing his engagement and restraining his inclinations, he continued his
                  usual intercourse with the bewitching girl, whose blushes and averted looks, when
                  next they met, plainly betrayed her recollection of the inadvertent confession she
                  had made during her alarm. Reginald was equally confused and tremulous with
                  emotion, and his agitation was not lost upon Adelaide—again was he
                  misunderstood.
               They reached New-York in safety, and more than a month elapsed ere Reginald found
                  a vessel bound for Havana, his destined port, beyond which lay the plantation
                  bequeathed him by his brother. It was a month replete with incidents, which
                  kindled hopes in one fond breast that never were to be realized.
               Delacy became domesticated at Col. Danvers', and, strange to say, was unconscious
                  of the spell that drew him there, till a fervent letter from Amanda awakened his
                  sleeping conscience and made him aware that the fascinating American had
                  engrossed, too completely, his time and thoughts, and that the hours spent with
                  her in that luxurious parlor, in a fashionable square, or strolling through
                  Broadway, or accompanying her in parties of pleasure on the water, to Staten
                  Island, Flushing, and other places of amusement, had caused him to neglect the
                  sweet friend who so lamented his absence. Only once had he written to
                  her since he landed.
               Repentant of his delinquency, he kissed as he refolded the letter, and hastened to
                  answer it; and struck with his injustice towards Adelaide, and the danger and
                  impropriety of his own position, he determined to mention his engagement, and
                  forego the enjoyment of her society during the remainder of his sojourn in the
                  city. He fulfilled his purpose the next evening, and the alternate flush and
                     paleness of her cheek alone betrayed
                  the pangs his communication occasioned the unhappy girl; for wounded pride and
                  dignity yielded strength and support through the hard trial, and not a reproach,
                  or even a remark, escaped her lips. She quickly changed the conversation to an
                  indifferent topic, and they parted tranquilly; yet her heart was
                  almost breaking, and his was truly grieved.
               He now saw, too late, how imprudent, how irrational, his course had
                  been, and the pain of retrospection was only alleviated by the consideration that
                  he had at last done his duty, and by the hope that time and absence would heal the
                  wounds his presence had inflicted.
               Fallacious reasoner! little he knew of the depth and durability of woman's
                  tenderness; the only sure conquerors of which, are harshness and
                  neglect—'tis these which destroy the romance of
                  attachment, and gradually weaken and undermine the citadel of strong
                  affection. Time and absence are frail adversaries, when busy memories act as
                     sentinels to oppose them.
               At the end of a melancholy week, he called to bid the Danvers family a final
                  adieu, and was not surprised at their treating him coldly; nor could he blame
                  them, for he felt that his conduct appeared cruel and ungrateful. Adelaide he did
                  not see—they told him she had gone to visit a relation in
                  Brooklyn.............
               Reginald embarked for Havana—he was an enthusiastic admirer of Nature, and but for
                  the gloomy state of his mind, would have luxuriated in the magnificent scene
                  around him, as the vessel scudded before a brisk wind, through the harbor of
                  New-York, on the morning of his departure. He remembered too well, however, with
                     whom he had oft descanted upon the beauties of that
                  prospect, even at that very hour; when, as then, a brilliant sun-rise gilded the
                  forests of masts which arose from the wharves of the city, and mellowed the green
                  of the hills and shores encircling its bay. As he gazed upon the villas on some of
                  the islands, with their teeming orchards and gardens, he remembered too well with
                     whom he had visited their shades and culled their fruits and
                  flowers—and as they entered the "Narrows," the splendid sea-view occasioned such
                  painful reminiscences as forced him, absolutely soul-sick, to descend
                  to his cabin.
               It was the fifth day, after leaving New-York, that he was suddenly aroused from a
                  sound nap, at early dawn, by a a terrible noise and commotion on deck, mingled
                  with the clashing of swords and discharge of pistols in quick succession; he
                  leaped from his berth, and hastily dressing, rushed up the gang-way—the next
                  instant he was struck down senseless by a heavy blow from the blunderbuss of one
                  of a pirate band, who had attacked and captured the ill-fated schooner, in which
                  he was a passenger.
               How long he remained in this situation he knew not; but when he revived, and
                  feebly raising himself, looked about, an appalling sight presented itself—the
                  vessel's deck was clotted with blood and strewed with corpses! She was entirely
                  dismantled, and floated without sail or rudder at the mercy of the waves and
                  winds. The pirates had earried off every article that was valuable, and not a
                  trace of them remained, save the dreadful carnage and devastation they had made!
                  Reginald reclosed his eyes in horror, but not dispair—he inwardly prayed to heaven
                  for protection and relief, and again sunk into unconsciousness. His petition was
                  not in vain—towards evening the gory hulk, with its ghastly burdens, was espied by the Montezuma, a
                  Spanish merchantman, and was immediately pursued and boarded.
               On perceiving that Reginald still breathed, the humane captain had him gently
                  removed to his ship, and used every effort to restore him. The bodies of the
                  slaughtered crew were consigned to the deep, with every mark of respect customary
                  on such solemn occasions—rolled up in hammocks, containing weights to make them
                  sink, they were laid in a row, prayers read over them, a gun fired from the bows
                  of the Montezuma, and then, one after another, the dead were launched into the
                  ocean.
               For several days Reginald was unable to rise; he had a severe cut and contusion on
                  his head, and the loss of blood and appetite rendered him weak and pale. With
                  sorrow, too, he discovered that the braid of Amanda's hair, which he wore round
                  his neck, was gone; it was attached to his watch, of which he had been robbed
                  during his swoon.
               Captain Laplata, from Cadiz, was bound for Havana, so that our traveller was
                  neither turned from his course nor delayed by his adventure; in one respect it was
                  favorable to his interest; it proved the means of an acquaintance and intimacy
                  with his deliverer, which led, as will be shewn hereafter, to important
                  results.
               The worthy Captain once resided in Havana, and was pleased to show him the town
                  and give him much useful information; he also introduced him to several agreeable
                  families, and Reginald was astonished at the degree of luxury and fashion which
                  prevailed among the high classes, and at the magnificence of the churches, and
                  that of many private mansions, where he was entertained in quite a princely style.
                  But being impatient to wind up his business and return to Europe, he soon hired a
                     "quitrine," a light carriage peculiar liar to the country, and
                  proceeded to his plantation, where, in the midst of overseers and a numerous horde
                  of slaves, we shall leave him for the present, and hold intercourse with the other
                  characters of our story.
               About four months after Reginald's departure from England, Rosa Fitzgerald, who
                  had matured into as graceful and lovely a woman as her sister, received and
                  accepted the addresses of a young gentleman of fortune and genteel standing, whose
                  father was a Spaniard. Mr. Deltavega married in early life a lady of Liverpool,
                  and became a resident there. He was the head of an extensive mercantile
                  establishment, and had amassed considerable wealth. Having fitted his only son,
                  Francesco, to succeed him, he determined to retire from business, and to begin his
                  future holiday by a visit to Cadiz, his native city. Thither, after the union of
                  Rosa and Francesco, Mrs. Deltavega and the new married couple were to accompany
                  him, and the latter to spend the remainder of the summer in travel before finally
                  settling in Liverpool, to enjoy the sweets of connubial felicity and domestic
                  life.
               Amanda had heard but twice from Reginald. His last letter mentioned that he
                  intended to leave New-York immediately for Cuba, and should write, without delay,
                  after reaching it; but he had not done so, and she knew not even where to address
                  him—consequently, all communication between them had ceased, and she was so
                  disturbed and depressed, and her health so evidently impairing from anxiety of
                  mind, that her parents insisted on her joining the party to Spain, promising to
                  forward, without delay, all packages that might arrive for her, while she was
                  absent. She yielded to their wishes, and, after the ordinary routine of calms and storms, the voyage was accomplished
                  in due time and safety.
               They found the city of Cadiz in great commotion—a gang of pirates had been
                  captured and brought into port, and a crowd of soldiers and citizens were
                  conducting them to prison.
               The Deltavegas were soon established in comfortable quarters, and warmly greeted
                  by relatives and friends. Time rolled tranquilly on with all save Amanda—tidings
                  from home brought none of her truant lover, and she grew more and more restless
                  and unhappy. She thought he must be dead, or ill; she
                  could not, would not doubt his truth.
               In fine weather, Rosa and herself usually walked out of an afternoon; and though
                  not Roman Catholics, they frequently went to the Cathedral at the hour of vespers,
                  to listen to the strains of sacred music which then pealed through its aisles.
               One evening, while thus employed—"sister," whispered Amanda, "what tender memories
                  do those sweet and solemn notes revive! tender and painful too—Oh! let us away!
                  they oppress me, and I feel as if some dire calamity was hanging over me. 'Tis
                  folly, I acknowledge, to yield thus to superstition, yet I cannot resist its
                  influence."
               And here we would ask, how is it that, between the spirit and the future a
                  mysterious and strange communion does sometimes exist, which sways
                  the strongest minds and saddens them with apprehensions of coming ill? It is one
                  of the secrets of nature that cannot be explained.
               The sisters quitted the church, and, after a short stroll, returned home. In the
                  parlour, they found father Anselmo, a relation of Mr. Deltavega, sitting with the
                  family, and giving them an account of the execution of the pirates, which had
                  taken place that morning.
               The good old man had been summoned to shrive one of them, and had received from
                  him, as an offering to the virgin, a rich gold watch attached to a braid of auburn
                  hair, and bearing the initials R.D.
               The penitent confessed that he had rifled it from the person of a young gentleman
                  who was killed on board of an American vessel, which he and his accomplices had
                  attacked and destroyed nine weeks previous to their own capture.
               As he finished speaking, father Anselmo drew forth the watch from the folds of his
                  gown, and, no sooner did Amanda behold it, than she recognized it as Reginald's,
                  and the hair chain as the trees she had bestowed on him at parting. "Now, by that
                  token of death, are my mournful forebodings realized!" cried she, and fainted
                  away; a brain fever ensued, and for a long while her life was in danger.
               Poor Rosa hung over her pillow night and day, and listened, with tearful eyes, to
                  her delerious lamentations. She insisted upon substituting her own watch as a
                  votive gift, in lieu of her lover's, and kept that, with the chain he
                  had presented her, in her bosom, and often covered each with kisses and tears.
               It was a melancholy period; but close attention and careful nursing at length
                  prevailed, and the sufferer began to regain consciousness and health.
               Oh! the fallacy of human hopes and earthly happiness! Scarcely six months had
                  elapsed since Amanda's heart beat high with both, and all seemed bright and
                  fair—now, dejected and careworn, to her the world appeared shrouded
                  in darkness; and now were her's, though yet so young, thoughts that banished sleep, affections withered
                  in the bud, and sorrowful remembrances!
               Change of air and scene was prescribed by her physician, and she accompanied Rosa
                  and her husband in a tour through the South of Spain.
               
                  Our scene must now change also—'tis done—the curtain again rises, and
                  lo! the interior of a hovel, in an obscure street of New-York, and on a coarse,
                  but clean bed, a woman lying apparently in the last stage of consumption. Her
                  sunken and heavy eyes brighten, and o'er her pallid cheek a slight flush diffuses
                  itself, as she listens to a youthful female who is sitting beside her, smoothing
                  her path to death with words from Holy Writ; those precious promises therein
                  contained, of mercy and salvation to all who believe and repent,
                  that, "though their sins be as scarlet, they shall be made white as snow."
               The gentle girl lays down the book, to administer nourishment to her dying charge,
                  and as she turns round, the lovely countenance of Adelaide Danvers is revealed to
                  us. Yes, it is she who thus performs the duties of charity, and seeks
                  to assuage her own griefs by alleviating those of her fellow creatures, and to
                  exchange her earthly idol for a Heavenly one! A blessed balsam for a wounded
                  heart! and verily she found it so: for, although she could never entirely subdue
                  her hopeless passion, and, therefore, never married, yet was her life, in after
                  years, serene and almost happy, for it was devoted to piety and beneficence.
               Again must our curtain fall—again it rises and displays a more familiar scene; the
                  road to Cherwell cottage, and Reginald moving as rapidly over it as post horses
                  can convey him.
               He has arranged his West Indian affairs re-crossed the Atlantic, and is hurrying
                  to his affianced bride. The chaise stops at the door—he alights and is about to
                  enter the house, when an exclamation of rapture is heard within, and the next
                  moment his arms encircle his sweet Amanda, who has flown to meet him. The bloom of
                  health is once more on her cheek, and "the smile of contentment and love" in her
                  soft blue eye.
               Perhaps our readers will not object to be informed of the occurrences which
                  brought to pass this pleasing termination of what has hitherto been a gloomy
                  tale.
               Shortly after the excursion through Spain, which proved less beneficial to the
                  invalid than was anticipated, our old acquaintance, Captain Laplata, returned to
                  Cadiz, and was invited to dine with Mr. Deltavega. In boyhood they were friends,
                  but, since then, had not met before.
               When the ladies retired from the dinner table, they remained discoursing over
                  their wine, and the Captain remarked upon the beauty and extreme dejection of
                  Amanda, whereupon Mr. Deltavega related her touching history.
               When he concluded, the benevolent seaman replied, "How fortunate, my dear sir,
                  that you have communicated to me these facts! for I can meet them with others
                  which will doubtless act like the elixir of life upon the withering heart of Miss
                  Fitzgerald."
               He then detailed the circumstance of his encounter with the plundered vessel, his
                  discovery and rescue of Reginald, and their subsequent association; and read aloud
                  a letter which he had just received from him, stating that since they parted, he
                  had suffered from a dangerous fever, but was convalescent, and, having
                  satisfactorily completed his business, was on the point of embarking for England,
                  where he feared some misfortune a
                  waited him, as he had had no reply to any of his letters since leaving
                  New-York.
               The delight which this intelligence created, may well be imagined. How to impart
                  it to Amanda in her present nervous state was a difficulty.
               Some writers maintain that sudden joy is harder to bear than sudden wo; and
                  history avers that the messenger who brought to Athens the news of the victory at
                  Marathon, died of extacy the instant after he had told the "glad tidings;"
                  nevertheless, we are doubtful of the theory in question, and opine that the poor
                  fellow's death might have been the result of over exertion in his
                  vocation. Be that as it may, it was deemed expedient not to inform Amanda of her
                  lover's continued existence, till Rosa had prepared her for the blissful
                  revelation in the gentlest manner, and an unexpected auxiliary in the form of a
                  dream favored her design.
               On entering her sister's chamber (according to her wont) the next morning, she
                  found her sitting by the window, with her head resting on her folded arms. "Dear
                  Amanda, what is the matter?" inquired Rosa; "I hope you are not ill, though I
                  perceive you are paler than usual." "No, my kind Rosa, I am not ill; but surely I
                  bear a charmed life, or could I thus linger in this weary world, a prey to such
                  wretchedness? Oh! Rosa, what a blessed dream was mine last night! Alas! that it
                  was but a dream! Methought that the dead, to whom my fate is linked, was restored
                  to life—that he had been saved from shipwreck, and borne to a beautiful and
                  fertile island; that we were sailing hence for England, and stopped at this island
                  to procure water and fruits; there we discovered him, and, amazed and transported,
                  I uttered a scream which aroused me, and I awoke to bitter disappointment and vain
                  regret."
               Rosa listened in mute astonishment; she was not superstitious, yet the remarkable
                  coincidence of the dream with the events she had to disclose, made her almost
                  believe that Providence had sent the vision to prepare her sister's mind for the
                  happiness that was in store for her.
               Tenderly putting aside the ringlets which clustered round her brow, and looking
                  earnestly and somewhat archly in her face, she said, "suppose, Amanda, that this
                  extatic dream should be realized, could you support the transition from wo to
                  weal, from misery to gladness?" Amanda started, and, regarding her intently, was
                  struck with the expression of her countenance; "Rosa, Rosa," she exclaimed, "what
                     do your words and manner imply? Rosa, you would not, you
                     could not venture to trifle with feelings so sacred as mine!" Rosa
                  was silent; but drew from her pocket Reginald's letter to Captain Laplata,
                  unfolded and placed it in her sister's hand. With convulsive grasp and throbbing
                  heart she seized it, read it, and, throwing herself upon her knees, poured forth
                  thanks to Heaven for its mercy. Then, completely overcome, she wept and sobbed
                  aloud.
               When this burst of feeling was past, relieved by it, she became more composed, and
                  Rosa called in her husband and his parents, who added their congratulations to
                  her's.
               The embarkation of the happy party for England speedily ensued, and they arrived
                  at Cherwell cottage just a week before Delacy made his appearance there, as above
                  described.
               Satisfactory explanations soon took place between the reunited lovers. Reginald
                  had written several times; but there being no regular mail to Havana from his
                  plantation, which was situated far in the interior, his letters had, doubtless less, miscarried. Illness, too, had
                  prevented his writing for a long while.
               The episode of Adelaide Danvers, he did not dare to touch upon; nor
                  ever could, till long after he was a married man, and had heard of her well-doing
                  and prosperity. Amanda's excuses we need not detail, as they are already known to
                  our readers.........
               A merry wedding at Mr. Fitzgerald's added its festivities to those of Christmas,
                  in the month of December succeeding these events. The names of the bride and
                  bridegroom may easily be surmised; and a handsome couple they were, as they stood
                  before the clergyman to be joined in holy wedlock: she in her white
                  crape and roses; he in his blue coat and snowy vest; her
                  sole ornament, a rich gold chain; his, a watch fastened to a braid of
                  glossy hair—which same valuables were carefully preserved and bequeathed to their
                  descendants, with an interesting legend concerning them.
               And now, as "all's well that ends well," we trust our story, with its happy
                  denouement, will prove satisfactory to those who may chance to peruse it; and
                  concluding, after the manner of a celebrated author, we bid them a friendly
                  adieu.
            
            
               ILIA, THE HIGH PRIESTESS.
               
                  The principal events of this story are historical; the rest is
                     fiction, and the character of Brennus has been moulded to suit the writer's
                     fancy.
               
               The day was resplendent with sunshine, and the streets of Rome were thronged with
                  a gay and busy crowd. From the balconies and windows of the houses, hung draperies
                  of yellow or crimson silk, bright colored carpets and festoons of flowers; each
                  decoration more or less costly, simple or gaudy, according to the means and tastes
                  of the inmates.
               It was the anniversary of the "Vestalia," or "Feast of Vesta," and was to be
                  celebrated with the magnificence and banquetings usual on such occasions.
               At the head of a band of virgins, clad in snow-white vests and flowing mantles of
                  purple hue, walked Ilia, their high priestess, whose gentle dignity and supreme
                  beauty riveted the admiration of many spectators. Her dress was like that of her
                  companions, save a circlet of gold which graced her brow and reflected the sun's
                  rays as they shone upon it, radiating them like the mystic glory round the crown
                  of a saint. In her hands she bore a richly embossed silver urn, wreathed with ivy,
                  and containing an offering to her goddess. She was preceded by a lictor, carrying
                  the Roman fasces.
               The office of Vestal was very ancient, and is
                  supposed to have been instituted by Eneas, King of Troy. Ilia, the mother of
                  Romulus and Remus, held it for a time, but, violating her vestal oath, she was
                  doomed to be buried alive. Ilia, the
                  high priestess of our story, was called after the maternal parent of the royal
                  twins, and early dedicated to the service of the temple. At ten years old, her
                  faultless face and form attracted the notice of the high priest whose duty it was
                  to supply vacancies in the vestal train; and he induced her parents to consecrate
                  her to that holy vocation. Being poor, and having other children, they were glad
                  thus to provide for their little daughter, and to promote her, as they thought, to
                  honor and happiness; for in those days it was considered a blessing for any young
                  girl if she could obtain admittance into the corps of Vesta's virgins, their
                  privileges were so great. Every luxury was furnished them at the public expense,
                  and they were treated with the utmost deference when and wherever they appeared;
                  and as above described, a lictor, bearing the Roman fasces, or consuls'
                     rods, always marched before them: the consuls themselves, as well as the
                  people, reverentially made way for them as they passed along. If they met a
                  criminal going to execution, they had the power of pardoning him, provided the
                  meeting was accidental; and in trials, their word was deemed
                  sufficient, without an oath to confirm it—indeed they were frequently appointed to
                  act as arbiters in cases of difficulty or doubt.
               Behind the band of virgins came another, formed of the chief ladies of Rome. They
                  were also clothed in white, and proceeded with downcast eyes, and uncovered heads
                  and feet, slowly threading the streets of the city leading to the Fane they
                  sought. On reaching it, the procession stopped; the solemn music, which had
                  sounded from various instruments in rich accord during its progress, ceased; the
                  flower-scattering multitude separated, and in silence looked on. Ilia ascended the
                  steps of the temple, and entered its lofty portal; two and two her vestals
                  followed, and for some minutes prostrated themselves before the altar where
                  flickered the sacred flame; then, as if impelled by one intuitive feeling, the
                  fair worshippers arose, and Ilia, in accents sweet and clear, chanted the
                  invocation and deposited the costly gift upon the shrine. An anthem, sung by
                  melodious voices in full concert, and the burning of incense, concluded the
                  ceremonies; after which the crowd quickly dispersed, and the vestals repaired to a
                  sumptuous feast that awaited them, where the beautiful Ilia presided, and innocent
                  hilarily prevailed. But it was of short duration—fleeting as the brightness of a
                  summer sky, when suddenly obscured by a storm-brewing thunder cloud. The banquet
                  was not half over, when an attendant, pale with affright, entered the hall and
                  proclaimed that the sacred fire they had left upon the altar was extinguished.
                  Immediately, consternation and horror succeeded pleasure and mirth. The fair
                  revellers rushed frantically forth; the populace joined them on their way, and
                  lamentations and cries of "to the Temple, to the Temple!" rent the air; for the
                  extinction of the holy fire was regarded as a sure prognostic of calamity to the
                  state, and always created dismay among all ranks of the Roman people.
               Prayers and libations were offered to Jupitor Pistor, and the sacred flame
                  rekindled with rays from the sun, by means of glasses kept for the purpose, and
                  all was again outwardly tranquil. But gloomy forebodings continued to disturb the
                  minds of many, and, ere the year had run its course, were but too fully realized.
                  The close of that year saw Rome in the power of her enemies; her
                  temples and palaces in ashes, and her inhabitants blockaded in the capitol,
                     where they had taken refuge, and
                  fortified themselves within its ramparts.
               At the period about which we are writing, the north of Italy was peopled by hordes
                  of that fierce and gigantic race, the Gauls, headed by a bold chieftain, Brennus,
                  whose success in was had spread alarm through the country. He was assaulting
                  Clusium, the capitol of Etruria; but, incensed at the conduct of some Roman
                  ambassadors, he abandoned the siege of that city and led his army to Rome. On his
                  way he encountered the Roman legions by the river Allia, and a battle ensued, in
                  which, as usual, he was victorious. The news of this battle and its results were
                  soon carried to Rome by fugitives from the scene of carnage; and as the Gauls,
                  whom conquest had rendered careless, loitered to plunder the camp of their
                  adversaries and divide their booty, many of the Romans had time to save themselves
                  by flight, and others to secure themselves in the citadel and prepare for
                  resistance.
               The vestals concealed under ground most of the sacred utensils in their charge,
                  and fled with the remainder and the holy fire to the town of Cœre, which they
                  reached in safety after much exertion and fatigue—all save Ilia. Seized with
                  sudden illness, she was compelled to crave shelter in a shepherd's hut, where her
                  companions left her. They would have remained to share her danger, but she urged
                  them on. "Fly, fly, my beloved friends," she cried; "be faithful to your solemn
                  trust, and leave me to the fate the gods may destine for me. Preserve the sacred
                  fire from the touch of the profane, and stay not your efforts till you have placed
                  it in security." Accustomed to obey her mandates, they hastened away.
               The kind shepherd and his wife rendered her all the assistance in their power, and
                  provided her with a pallet of dried leaves in a small back room, the only retired
                  spot their habitation afforded. In a few days she recovered sufficiently to arise
                  and partake of their frugal repasts of brown bread and goats' milk. At one of
                  these, she thus addressed them: "My kind hosts, as soon as my strength permits, I
                  shall leave you, to rejoin my companions at Cœre, and shall probably never see you
                  again; but never will I forget your generous care and hospitality, and my prayers
                  shall daily ascend to the gods for blessings on you, and rest assured that they
                  will reward you for having succored and protected one whose life is consecrated to
                  their service."
               She had scarcely uttered these words, when a strain of martial music was heard,
                  and, on looking out, they beheld a part of the Gaulic army advancing. They were
                  all both shocked and terrified; yet there was no occasion for fear. Brennus, in
                  his march to Rome, did not molest the quiet inhabitants of the country, saying
                  that he had no cause for anger against them; that to chastise the
                  Romans for their insolence to him, through their ambassadors, was alone his
                  object: so, as corps after corps passed orderly along, the trembling inmates of
                  the cabin felt their courage revive.
               The army was still moving by, tramp, tramp, tramp, when a warrior knocked at the
                  door of the hut: it was opened to him, and he asked for a wrapping for his hand,
                  which was wounded and bleeding profusely, though the gash was not a fresh one; but
                  an accident had re-opened it and rendered it very painful. With the usual
                  benevolence of woman. Ilia instantly tore off a portion of her tunic, and with it
                  bandaged the wound; and as she twined the strip of muslin round and round it, the
                  warrior was struck with her uncommon beauty, and gazed upon her, entranced; and his admiration was mingled with wonder,
                  at seeing so radiant a being the inhabitant of so mean an abode.
               After the humane task was completed, he thanked her and said: "Beautiful maiden!
                  in return for thy great kindness and condescension, is there no service I can
                  render unto thee? No boon which thou wouldst demand of Brennus, whose heart beats
                  with gratitude for thy ready and benevolent aid, and yields due homage to thy
                  surpassing charms?"
               Ilia blushed, and with downcast eyes replied: "Noble chieftain! much thou
                  over-ratest the small assistance I have been able to afford thee in thy need: none
                  but the most unpitying would have refused it to a fellow creature: yet will I
                  accept the gracious offer thou makest to repay the deed. Behold, before thee, the
                  high priestess of Vesta, whom sudden illness has separated from her companions in
                  their flight from Rome to Cœre, whither they have gone for refuge from the fearful
                  numbers thou art leading on. Grant me a safe conduct to them; and when with thy
                  victorious bands thou hast taken possession of our fallen city, spare, oh spare,
                  for Ilia's sake, the shrine and temple of her virgin goddess!" The request was
                  readily granted; "but first, fair lady," said the chief, "thou must accompany me
                  to Rome, where I pledge to thee mine honor that thou shalt be treated with every
                  respect and consideration, and that, when I have seen my followers there encamped,
                  I myself will escort thee in safety to Cœre."
               A mysterious influence impelled Ilia to consent, and a litter was formed, in which
                  she placed herself—first having taken a grateful and affectionate leave of the
                  good old couple who had so befriended her. The litter was borne along on the
                  shoulders of four stalwart soldiers; and their commander walked by its side,
                  watching over the lovely burthen it contained, with all the care of a lover: for
                  lo! the proud conqueror of the Roman legions had become an easy captive to Love's
                  bewitching power, and it was this sudden infatuation that instigated him to carry
                  Ilia to Rome before taking her to Cœre, hoping, by a course of devoted attentions,
                  to win her heart. Oh, Beauty, how potent is thy sway! and yet, oh Beauty, how
                  frail thou art! Alas! for Ilia: little recked she of the fascinations
                  of magnanimity and valor, combined with the most flattering and winning devotion,
                  and such did Brennus employ to gain her affections. Placed in a gorgeous tent, and
                  supplied with every luxury the times afforded, she was daily visited by him, and
                  always treated with the most tender respect. Unconsciously her heart became
                  enthralled, and by degrees she not only ceased to urge the fulfilment of his
                  promise, but lent a willing ear to the confession of his passion. Soon she madly
                  returned it; consented to be his bride, and they were joined in wedlock. Thus,
                  like the illustrious matron whose name she bore, she broke her vestal oath; and by
                  the laws of the state, forfeited her life, and, what was worse, by those of
                  conscience, her self-esteem. Still, Brennus played the husband's part so kindly,
                  that for a while she experienced a degree of happiness unknown to her before; yet
                  remorse soon blighted it, and rendered her miserable and fearful. Often, when the
                  veil of night had fallen, and she slumbered on her pillow by his side, dark dreams
                  would disturb her repose, and, starting wildly, she would exclaim: "Brennus, my
                  husband, save me! save me! the avengers of my perfidy are near; the executors of
                  Vesta's wrath are kindling a funeral pile for me, her traitorous priestess!" Then
                  would the chieftain awake and sooth his beloved to sleep again, as does a fond
                  mother her offspring.
               
               Months elapsed, and the wasted form and pallid cheek of Ilia plainly indicated the
                  harassing conflicts of her mind. At length she could bear them no longer—Rome lay
                  in ashes before her, and daily she heard the discussion of plans for effecting the
                  conquest and destruction of the capitol, which still resisted the assaults of the
                  Gauls. Her beloved temple, with its desecrated shrine, was a heap of ruins:
                  notwithstanding the strict orders of Brennus that it should be preserved, as he
                  had promised her, it was destroyed in the conflagration that consumed nearly the
                  whole of the city. Pondering over these disastrous events one morning as she sat
                  alone, dejected and care-worn, an irrepressible desire, a high resolve, took
                  possession of her soul—it was to expiate her crime by the sacrifice of her passion
                  and the idol which had occasioned it—to fly from Brennus and retire into the bosom
                  of her family, to spend the remainder of her life in penitence and prayer. Falling
                  on her knees and clasping her beauteous hands, she ardently implored the
                  forgiveness and assistance of the deity she had offended, and just as she had
                  finished her supplication, a dazzling sun-beam burst through a cloud that had,
                  till then, obscured the heavens: regarding this as an omen that her petition was
                  favorably received, she arose with a lighter heart and prepared to meet her
                  husband, whose well known step she heard approaching. By a violent effort she
                  stifled her emotion and received him with her usual affectionate greeting, though
                  at sight of him her spirit again sunk within her under the consciousness of the
                  agonizing course she had determined to pursue.
               Brennus, himself, was gloomy, having just returned from an unsuccessful attack
                  upon the town of Ardea, which was defended by the celebrated Roman General and
                  Dictator, Camillus; for the Gauls were so long encamped within and around the
                  walls of Rome, that they grew tired of being stationary, and in separate hordes
                  made frequent incursions on the neighboring states. Poor Ilia, perceiving Brennus
                  thus melancholy, cast self aside and endeavoured to cheer him; yet, though
                  distressed for him, she could not but rejoice at the escape and
                  safety of those who were of her own nation; and it was such contending and
                  exciting sensations as these, not unfrequently called forth, which combined with
                  the reproofs of conscience in embittering her existence, and imperceptibly
                  loosening the cords of life.
               Several weeks had passed since the foregoing occurrence; the night was dark and
                  boisterous, and the wind, in fitful and violent gusts, swayed the branches of the
                  largest trees as if they had been mere saplings. On the banks of the Tyber, not
                  far from the walls of Rome, stood an isolated building of brick; it was
                  moss-grown, and apparently the remnant of a strong tower which had been erected
                  for some defensive purpose in former times. This edifice had long been the
                  habitation of the bat and the owl; but on this stormy evening its inmates were to
                  girls and a youth, in the guise of minstrels. A fire blazed in the long forsaken
                  hearth, and as the heat from the faggots ascended the capacious chimney, the
                  ill-omened birds of night fluttered from their scorching nests. The noise blanched
                  the cheeks of the maidens, and they pressed closer to their protector; but soon
                  discovering the cause of it, their alarm subsided.
               Marcia and Lucia, the sisters of Ilia, and Fabius, her youngest brother, were they
                  who thus sought shelter from the tempest; white around them, in the gloom, lights
                  twinkled from the tents of the Gauls, and the hoarse voices of the sentinels could be distinguished in the
                  transient pauses of the storm.
               The party arranged themselves as comfortably as their dreary abode
                  allowed—dispelling its chilling damps by keeping up a large fire with liberal
                  supplies of wood, which Fabius had gathered on their arrival, before the rain
                  began. A log sufficed for a seat, and, luckily for them, some one had deposited in
                  a corner of the tower, a quantity of clean straw, probably for forage, of which
                  they formed a bed, and covering themselves with their cloaks, fatigue soon acted
                  upon them like a soporific, and they slept soundly till dawn.
               The elements expended their fury during the night, and the sun rose bright and
                  clear. Fabius was the first to awake, and while his sisters continued to repose,
                  he revived the dying embers on the hearth, and adding more faggots, kindled a
                  cheering flame; he then aroused them, and opening a small wallet of provisions,
                  they partook of a plentiful breakfast and proceeded on their way.
               "Who goes there?" demanded a sentinel as they sauntered by. "Three wandering
                  minstrels, who would fain seek employment in Rome," was their response; and in
                  this manner they were repeatedly hailed, yet permitted to advance, until they
                  reached one of the gates of the city, where the surly guards refused them
                  entrance. "Avaunt! ye baggage," they cried, "we want none of your whining here!"
                  and thus coarsely repulsed, they retreated.
               "Well!" exclaimed Marcia, "this is a rebuff I little anticipated—I thought
                  minstrelsy was welcomed every where."
               "So it generally is," answered Fabius, "but these horrible ble barbarians have no
                  relish for any thing tender or refined."
               "Perhaps," observed Lucia, "one of our glees will soften their gruff nature, and
                  serve as a charm to get us in; at least let us try the experiment." So they joined
                  in a trio, seating themselves on the turf, and accompanying their voices with
                  their guitars. It proved a happy thought of Lucia's; for, while they were singing,
                  the Porta Capena was thrown open to permit the passage of a cortege, in the midst
                  of which was the chief of the Gauls. Ever on the alert to promote the enjoyment of
                  Ilia, his ear no sooner caught the sweet sounds that were flowing from the lips
                  and instruments of the peasants, than he stopped and dispatched one of his train
                  to bring them to him.
               "Minstrels," said the messenger, "Brennus, our commander, desires your
                  approach."
               On hearing that dreaded name, the maidens instantly arose, and, with mingled hope
                  and trepidation, followed their brother, who gladly obeyed the behest. The
                  warrior, after asking them a few questions, which Fabius answered, ordered them to
                  join his retinue and follow him. The cortege halted in front of a lofty tent,
                  surmounted by a crown and guarded by two sentinels, slowly pacing their rounds.
                  Brennus entered it alone, and in a few minutes the minstrels were summoned again
                  to his presence. They were astonished at the splendor they beheld within; the
                  interior was festooned with hangings of scarlet damask, edged with broad silver
                  fringes; couches and smaller seats were placed around, decorated in like manner;
                  and there were marble tables bearing candelabras of massive gold, and richly
                  sculptured vases and urns, of Etruscan shape, in many of which bloomed the
                  choicest flowers, that filled the air
                  with pleasant odors. Beneath a magnificent canopy sat Brennus and a beautiful
                  lady, in whom, to their utter amazement, they recognized their sister, although
                  she no longer wore the sacerdotal dress they had been accustomed to see her in, on
                  festal occasions, in days gone by. The simple white vest and tunic, once
                  emblematical of her truth and holiness, were exchanged for a mantle of blue velvet
                  and a bodice ornamented with pearls and brilliants; a bandeau of these also
                  adorned her hair; which was looped up behind with a large gold bodkin, sparkling
                  with diamonds. Two female attendants waited near her. She looked, if possible,
                  more lovely than ever, though very pale and very sad, except, now and then, when
                  addressing her husband, her countenance would be radiant with a smile of
                  affection; a gleam of pleasure as evanescent as bright. Ilia had not seen her
                  sisters and brother since they were children: it was, therefore, not surprising
                  that she did not know them when they so unexpectedly stood before her, greatly
                  altered in stature and face. They remembered her,
                  because they had often gazed on her with admiration and pride while she was
                  officiating as High Priestess in the Temple, totally unaware of their being among
                  those who were present.
               Subsequently their father had removed his family to a cottage in the Appenines,
                  where he cultivated a vineyard, and his wife plied the spindle and shuttle for
                  support, assisted by their children. There a vague report had reached them, that
                  Ilia was a captive in the Gaulic camp; and Lucius Albinus, a plebeian, who had
                  overtaken the vestals, after their parting with her, on the road to Cœre, and
                  charitably given them seats in the wagon in which he was transporting his own
                  family from the enemy, confirmed the startling intelligence, by relating the
                  circumstances of her being seized with sudden illness and left behind in the
                  shepherd's cot. The news deeply afflicted her parents; and the good old Turnus,
                  her father, unable to attempt the journey himself, resolved to send his two
                  remaining daughters and his youngest son, who, during the summer seasons,
                  perambulated the country as minstrels, to supplicate Brennus for her release from
                  bondage. "Go, my children," said he to them, "and be of good Courage—a father's
                  blessing attends you; and may the gods grant you their protection, and aid you to
                  accomplish your pious design. Should you succeed in finding your unfortunate
                  sister, then seek Brennus, and appeal to him for her deliverance; in
                  him valour and clemency, we hear, are united, and if so, surely he will listen to
                  your prayers. Alas! Alas! Perhaps (oh! torturing thought!) our darling Ilia, once
                  so highly blest and honored, is now the victim of insult and cruelty."
               The travellers departed, and had toiled over a weary distance, on the night they
                  reached the lonely tower, when the storm suddenly arose and compelled them to take
                  shelter within it till morning, when they hoped to gain admittance into Rome, and
                  information respecting Ilia and an interview with Brennus. We have seen how
                  Fortune favored their plans, and threw them in his way. On entering the royal tent
                  and discovering their sister, their first impulse was to rush to her arms and make
                  themselves known; but a natural timidity, in the presence of the chieftain,
                  restained the maidens, while feelings of a very different nature in fluenced the
                  youth.
               After playing a variety of Italian songs and tunes, they were liberally rewarded
                  and dismissed, with directions to return again on the morrow. A subaltern
                  conducted them to the quarters allotted
                  to them by the orders of Brennus; and when he had left them, Lucia exclaimed, "Why
                  so moody, brother Fabius, when there is such cause for rejoicing at the success of
                  our errand? And then (only to think of it!!) to have found our sweet sister no
                  captive, as we anticipated, but enjoying all the honors of a Queen!"
               "I cannot believe they afford her enjoyment," answered Marcia, "for
                  the whole time we were playing, her face was the picture of wo; and did you not
                  observe how often her eyes were suffused with tears?"
               "She deserves to be unhappy," cried Fabius indignantly;
                     "I feel no pity for her. Were she an unwilling prisoner in the
                  power of the hated conqueror of our people, I would gladly yield my life for her
                  rescue; but to behold what she is, and to remember what she
                     was, what she has forsaken, and for whom, excites my
                  contempt for her, and increases my detestation of her destroyer!"
               This sudden outbreak of passion overwhelmed the young girls with astonishment.
                  Fabius was assuming quite a new character; and he, a mere stripling, who was ever
                  before thought gentle almost to effeminacy, now exhibited a degree of violence
                  that alarmed them. The truth was, the latent pride and patriotism of his bosom
                  were aroused at finding his sister, as he thought, a renegade from
                  her faith, and the wife of her country's foe; and from that moment he determined,
                  by some means, to separate them. In vain, that night, he courted sleep—rest, he
                  could not; so leaving his couch, he walked out to inhale the fresh air. A faint
                  breeze was stirring, and the myriads of white tents glimmering in the star-light,
                  looked like so many massive sepulchres.
               While meditating on the subject that annoyed his mind, he descried a light issuing
                  from the royal pavilion, and the forms of two warriors, who appeared in earnest
                  converse, and slowly moved towards the spot where he stood. As they advanced he
                  screened himself from view, behind a large tree over-hanging their path, and heard
                  enough of their discourse to feel assured that there was to be a secret attack
                  made on the capitol ere morning.
               "Ha! ha!" laughed Fabius bitterly to himself, "the gods favor my revenge, and
                  furnish me with the means of carrying it into execution. To the Tarpeian rock will
                  I hasten, and climb again the steep and tortuous path I once ascended in my
                  boyhood, to prove my courage to the youngsters who were with me, and dared me to
                  the feat. 'Tis known to few, and now shall avail me to mount the dizzy height once
                  more, and give warning to my countrymen of the wily purpose of our foes."
               Thither he quickly turned his steps, but to his amazement and agony he found he
                  was too late! The Gauls were already tugging up the very path he sought. On, on,
                  they mounted, clinging to whatever shrub, or projecting stone, or crag, they could
                  lay hold of. Oh! horror!—the foremost of them gain the top! They are on the
                  ramparts, and about to slay the faithless, sleeping guards; when, wonder of
                  wonders! a flock of half-starved geese, kept near Juno's temple, utter shrill
                  cries, arouse the drowsy watch, and defeat the bold project of the invaders! The
                  intrepid Consul, Manlius, with other brave Romans, flies to the rescue—the Gauls
                  are beaten headlong down the precipice, and the capitol is saved.
               In the midst of the tumult and slaughter Fabius was hurrying back to his sisters,
                  when the sight of a group of figures bearing a lifeless form, which he but too
                  plainly recognized cognized, transfixed
                  him with grief and horror. It was that of Ilia! Awakened from slumber by the noise
                  and commotion in the camp, (for Brennus had kept the intended attack a secret from
                  her,) and missing her husband from her side, she sprung up and ran wildly from her
                  tent, calling piteously upon him, and followed by her affrighted attendants, who
                  in vain endeavoured to calm her agitation. A soldier met them and informed them
                  that Brennus was killed; he was mistaken, the chieftain was unscathed, but the
                  shock proved too great for her shattered nerves—she fell to the earth and
                  expired!
               Thus ended the short and sad career of the beautiful High Priestess; she was but
                  nineteen. With sorrowing hearts the minstrels returned to their distant mountain
                  home, and imparted to their family the mournful tidings—yet not before the
                  expulsion of the bereaved and unhappy Brennus and his army by Camillus, who became
                  the restorer of Rome and the deliverer of his country.
            
            
               REMINISCENCES OF A TRAVELLER.
               
                  NUMBER I.
                  "What a delightful day for roving!" I exclaimed, on opening my eyes one
                     brilliant morning, and beholding the golden sun-beams illuminating our pleasant
                     room. "Awake, awake, Ismelda, my sweet companion, and let's be going." We were
                     quickly dressed, and on our way with a party of friends to the villa
                     Doria-Pamphili. Oh, the exhilarating month of October! how we enjoyed our walk,
                     and greeted with lightsome hearts the flowers and breezes which regaled us at
                     every step. (Breezes which re-galed us—a tolerable pun; but,
                     really, I did not intend to make one.)
                  We soon reached the villa, for it is but three-fourths of a mile from Rome. Its
                     grounds are extensive and magnificent, and peculiarly interesting from the
                     numbers of ancient tombs, inscriptions and statues scattered about; above all,
                     from some excavated catacombs within its precincts. Surrounding every apartment
                     of these catacombs, are rows of small arches, each of which encloses a cinerary
                     urn in a perfect state, although centuries have elapsed since it
                     was deposited in its sombre niche. As we surveyed these memorable antiquities,
                     that solemn fiat—"Dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt return"—came forcibly
                     to mind; for here the good, the brave, the beautiful, the proud, the wicked,
                     reduced to heaps of earth, painfully illustrate its power and truth. I thought,
                     too, of the probable struggles of many of them for that alluring and deceiving meteor,
                     worldly fame! What availed their efforts? Here, unknown, repose their ashes,
                     while their virtues or their crimes, their very names, like their frail bodies,
                     are buried in oblivion. Happy those whose wishes soared beyond these mortal
                     scenes, and sought a surer friend in Heaven!
                  My ruminations were interrupted by a summons to share the rural breakfast of
                     fruit, milk and biscuit, with which we had provided ourselves. On this
                     luxurious domain are artificial cascades and grottoes, fountains of every
                     description, an amphitheatre, and a superb lake. Seated on its borders, we
                     partook of our repast, and, in defiance of sentiment and romance, did it ample
                     justice—thanks to our early promenade and Italian zephyrs! Vegetation prospers
                     long in so bland a climate; and on the 9th of October, 1827, we rambled through
                     verdant thickets, and tripped over turf enamelled with flowers!
                  While we were in the amphitheatre, an old man, who acted as cicerone, slipped,
                     unperceived by us, into a closet, behind a marble figure representing a
                     shepherd blowing his flute, and turned a wheel; immediately (as if the statue
                     of Memnon had been transported from Egypt) dulcet sounds issued from that
                     before us, accompanied by the murmur of a hundred little water spouts which
                     sprung from the ground like magic, played while the music continued, and with
                     it gradually melted away.
                  Among the various inhabitants of the poultry yard were snow-white pea-fowls.
                     They were not comparable in beauty of plumage to those of the usual colors, but
                     they strutted about with quite as much vanity. Two buildings, in the form of a
                     miniature temple and tower, afford shelter to them and their feathery
                     companions when necessary.
                  The interior of the villa does not correspond with the decorations without. We
                     were surprised at its plainness, its coarse brick floors and faded, ordinary
                     furniture. Some ancient chandeliers, however, were remarkable, and we admired
                     several of its numerous old paintings and mutilated statues. From the roof we
                     enjoyed a fine view of Rome and its environs, and quite feasted our eyes upon
                     an adjoining grove of stately pines: they told of "dear native home." The villa
                     occupies the site of the Emperor Galba's gardens, and was constructed in the
                     sixteenth century for Prince Pamphili, by Alexander Algardi, a distinguished
                     architect and sculptor of Bologna.
                  The present princess Doria is a beautiful creature, of majestic mien, and noted
                     for her charity and religious zeal. During the celebration of the holy week, we
                     witnessed the washing of the pilgrims in the establishment appropriated to the
                     females; and there we saw her bending over a pail of water and
                     bathing the feet of an aged crone, with the humility of a Magdalen. She is
                     exceedingly popular, and proves how lovely piety is in woman. It is carried to
                     superstitious excess by both sexes in Italy. Shrines, dedicated to the virgin
                     Mary, adorn every road-side, and are seldom destitute of votaries kneeling
                     before them, "telling their beads," and imploring her protection and favor; to
                     conciliate which, and to evince their devotion, even the poverty-stricken will
                     spend their last mite in purchasing a chaplet of flowers or a waxen heart for
                     her brow or bosom.
                  Protestants often smile at what they term Roman
                     Catholic credulity; yet it is a blessed thing to possess such ardor and faith
                     as we daily observed among the lowest ranks, producing content and
                     cheerfulness, although common sense and industry were the consequent sacrifice;
                     and that such was not
                        always the result, the following incident will prove. I learnt
                     it from Mrs. ——, and detail it, as nearly as I can, in her own words:
                  "While travelling through Tuscany, we were attracted, one day, by the
                     interesting appearance of a young peasant, who diligently whirled her spindle
                     as she presided over a flock of goats. Her garments were coarse and much worn,
                     but clean; and the countenance of the blooming girl so intelligent and
                     prepossessing, that we were induced to bestow on her a trifle, and enquire
                     about her parentage and situation. 'They call me Teresa,' she replied; 'and the
                     madonna takes care of me, for I have neither father nor mother. They died while
                     I was an infant; and I do not even know what were their names. A poor woman had
                     charge of me, but she treated me cruelly; and as soon as I was old enough to
                     work, I ran away from her. In my distress, I prayed fervently to the madonna;
                     she heard me, and moved the heart of a lady to have pity on my forlorn
                     condition, and give me a home and employment. I still live with her, for she is
                     a good mistress—gives me plenty of bread and grapes to eat, and never beats me.
                     At night I sleep in her barn, and in the day I tend her goats and spin flax.'
                     After hearing this recital, we offered her more money: she was in
                     raptures—kissed our hands as we cast it into her apron, and exclaimed, 'never
                     did I expect to be so rich! Now, I can buy a crown for the
                     madonna, and go to mass and pray for blessings on my generous benefactresses.'
                     Happy Teresa! The madonna did not forsake her. Years afterwards, we met her in
                     the same neighborhood, neatly dressed and the picture of contentment and
                     health."
               
               
                  NUMBER II.
                  Our visit to the crater of Vesuvius proved less fatiguing than we anticipated.
                     After an early breakfast, one morning in 18—, we proceeded from Naples to
                     Portici, (four miles distant,) in carriages, and there devoted an hour to
                     Herculaneum. Immediately over this buried city stand the villages of Portici
                     and Resina; and to ensure their safety, by strengthening their foundations, the
                     excavations beneath them have been so filled up, that only a very limited space
                     remains to explore; and an extensive theatre is the sole building left exposed,
                     to gratify modern research or curiosity. Of this, the stage, orchestra and
                     seats are of stone, and in full preservation. In one of the lobbies we plainly
                     discerned, on the hardened lava, an impression of the lips, nose and eyes of a
                     face, probably that of some statue. To enter this nether region, we traversed
                     the cellar of a house, and passing through a low door-way within it, followed a
                     winding and narrow passage, which descended gradually into the earth and
                     terminated in the vestibule of the theatre. Our waxen torches cast a yellow
                     glare over every countenance, and added to the solemnity of the scene—it was
                     something like the procession of ghosts in "Macbeth." Danger, too, seemed
                     impending, as we listened to the thundering roll of carriages in the streets
                     above our heads; so that we were fain to finish our tour of inspection as
                     expeditiously as possible, and to return to sun-shine and our inn. There, both
                     annoyance and amusement awaited us—at least a dozen stout Lazzaroni greeted our
                     approach—each had a donkey saddled and bridled, which he urged us to take to
                     convey us to Vesuvius, and loudly proclaimed its merits and the excellence of its gear, at
                     the same time decrying the property of his comrades. "Oh," said one, "mine is
                     the strongest, the swiftest, the surest! and the saddle is almost new—there is
                     none here to compare with it—and see, it is the only one lined with red, (a
                     favorite color with the Neapolitans,)—the others are scarcely fit
                     to carry a Signora." In fact I thought they would have pulled us to pieces;
                     for, in their eagerness to obtain employment, they actually siezed hold of our
                     dresses and arms. At length we contrived to make a selection, and moved off in
                     cavalcade, amid the triumphs of the favored, and, for aught I know, the
                        maledictions of the rejected. The saddles were large and
                     comfortable, and bordered on the right side and behind by a ridge, several
                     inches high, stuffed and lined, for the purpose of supporting the rider when
                     ascending a steep hill or mountain.
                  On reaching the Hermitage of San Salvadore, which is just half-way up Vesuvius,
                     we alighted and refreshed ourselves with some of the far-famed Lachry mæ
                     Christi, (tears of Christ!) a luscious wine, worthy of its reputation. It is
                     made from the grapes in the neighbourhood of the mountain, and derives its
                     appellation from the manner in which it exudes from them, even before they are
                     subjected to any pressure but their own weight; it drops from the
                     press like tears, and is of crimson hue. A mile from the
                     Hermitage, we again abandoned our mules, and climbed the "ashy steep" on foot.
                     Advancing slowly, and secured to our guides by leathern belts, we accomplished
                     the task without difficulty; peril, there was none; for, at every
                     step, we sunk into the dried and parched soil, as if treading on newly ploughed
                     ground, and, of course, there was no risque of slipping; but the jerking
                     motion, occasioned by the unequal walk of our conductors, was extremely
                     disagreeable, and I quickly liberated myself from harness and held
                     the strap in my hand, to pull against, when assistance was requisite. As we
                     progressed, our sensations of wonder and delight increased. There we
                     were—environed by a surface of blackened lava, miles in extent, and totally
                     devoid of a tree, or bush, or any semblance whatever of vegetation. Above us,
                     curled the thick smoke of the volcano, mingled with white and greyish vapours,
                     which, owing to the dampness of the weather, arose from the earth. Below us lay
                     expanded the "blue glittering bay of Naples," with its twin promontories,
                     islets, villages and cities; beyond these, in perspective, soared a series of
                     undulating appenines, tinged with that soft plumb-like hue so peculiar to
                     Italy. Gazing upwards, I thought of Pluto's dismal
                        empire—downwards, of Paradise itself. The abodes of misery and
                     happiness seemed to have changed places. The blending of light and shade was
                     striking and beautiful! The traveller was right, I think, who designated light
                     as the physiognomy of scenery, and compared a landscape to a regular set of
                     features; avering that both may be good, but neither speak, unless
                     the light of Nature, or of mind, illumine them.
                  Owing to the continual crumbling of the lava, the crater presents a different
                     form almost annually; to us its outline was that of an oval; some
                     parts of the edge were too hot to stand upon for more than a few minutes, and a
                     sheet of paper thrust in, soon ignited. We descended fourteen feet into the
                     abyss, and walked upon a broad and projecting rock, where we distinctly heard
                     the crackling of the flames in the aperture whence oozed the fiery smoke. The
                     next day this gigantic rock tumbled down, and created a dreadful ful panic in the vicinity of the mountain. The
                     crash it made, and the quantity of ashes and cinders it forced into the air,
                     caused persons, for an instant, to believe that an irruption was commencing,
                     and to rush from their dwellings. When told of this event, I trust all of our
                     party felt grateful to Providence for saving us from the awful end that would
                     have been ours, had the avalanche occurred twenty-eight hours sooner. None of
                     us desired the celebrity of Pliny, the elder, that "Martyr of Nature," as he is
                     justly styled, upon condition of sharing his fate. When we grew tired of
                     looking and admiring, (for even contrast may become monotonous,)
                     we descended and remounted our donkeys, which manifested much more willingness
                     in carrying back their burdens to Portici, than they had done in bringing them
                     from there.
                  On reaching Naples, it was quite late, and we were rather exhausted, yet could
                     not resist the temptation of going to the Opera, to see Madame Pasta in
                     "Tancredi." The magnificent theatre of Don Carlos was brilliant with lamps,
                     chandeliers, and gilding. Its drop-curtain was the most splendid I ever saw—it
                     was blue and gold, with a rich border of roses, and the centre adorned with
                     Cupids, in cars, drawn by various animals. To show that "Love conquers all
                     things," was (I conjecture) the design. The King and Queen, with their suite,
                     were present, and Pasta seemed inspired. She was more than human. We had heard
                     her before, but never did she appear as lovely, or sing so divinely. Her voice
                     might have vied with the clearest and softest flute, as she executed most
                     difficult and exquisite passages in music. Well might she be called the queen
                     of song. When we retired to our pillows that night, it was to dream of her
                     syren notes and eloquent acting.
                  Sulky clouds portended rain when we arose next morning, at an early hour, in
                     order to prepare for another excursion—our goal, Pompeii, in its loneliness and
                     desolation! While breakfasting, the sky vented its wrath in a plentiful and
                     rapid shower, after which the clear blue ether triumphed in the heavens; and at
                     8 o'clock we departed, with the presage of a fine day, and travelling baskets
                     well stocked with provisions for a cold dinner in the villa of Diomede, the
                     first edifice that presents itself, as you enter Pompeii, by what is termed the
                     Appian way—the way we intended going. We retraced our steps as far as Portici,
                     and thence proceeded through the towns of Torre del Greco and Torre del
                     Annunziata, both of which suffered from the burning torrents of Vesuvius;
                     indeed, were destroyed by them, but have since been rebuilt. We saw vineyards
                     which the lava had streamed across, and becoming cold, had formed, in some
                     places, solid crusts, several feet thick, and of a brown color; portions of the
                     road were hewn through these stony beds. We were informed that the
                     lava runs very slowly, and that the smallest impediment will stop its course—it
                     then swells, sometimes, to the height of a dozen or fourteen feet, environs
                     whatever hinders its progress, till it has destroyed or covered it; flints and
                     porous rocks it causes to break, with an explosion like gun-powder; trees, and
                     wooden objects, it ignites and consumes; when hardened, it is capable of
                     receiving a brilliant polish, and is applied to ornamental as well as useful
                     purposes. Most of the Neapolitan towns, both ancient and modern, are paved with
                     it. As we approached Pompeii, our interest almost amounted to awe—we arrived,
                     and thrilling with curiosity,
                     alighted near the Herculaneum gate; our path towards it was bordered by a
                     double row of mausoleums, massive, grey with age, and bearing inscriptions,
                     some of which were quite legible.
                  After examining them, we quitted this funeral suburb and entered the
                     city—silently we threaded its solitary streets; their raised footways flanked
                     with tenantless, roofless houses, wherein the stillness of death prevailed. Not
                     a sound was audible, save our loitering steps upon the mosaic floors, and our
                     low-toned voices when we made a casual observation or questioned the cicerone
                     who accompanied us. Mirth or loud conversation would have seemed unbefitting,
                     while wandering through that solemn city, with its decaying fanes, theatres and
                     dwellings of yore! The horrible fate of the beings who once enlivened them
                     gleamed, too, upon our memories, and added depth to feeling as we viewed and
                     inspected their forsaken haunts.
                  It is inferred, however, that the Pompeiians generally escaped with their
                     lives, as not more than a hundred skeletons have ever been discovered among the
                     ruins, and only one in the theatre, where, according to history,
                     the people were assembled in great numbers, when the irruption began; and that
                     as the volcano always gives indications of a violent and dangerous discharge
                     hours before it takes place, only those perished who were too old, too feeble
                     or too sick to run, or perhaps too avaricious to abandon their wealth in their
                        flight.*
                      Of this miserly class, Diomede, in whose stately mansion
                     we dined, (as above stated,) was conjectured tured to be, because his skeleton
                     was found near his gate, grasping a key in one hand, and coins and jewels in
                     the other. With him, strong in death was the ruling passion! In
                     his cellar we saw fifteen wine casks glued to the wall by lava,
                     and evident impressions of five or six human bodies.
                        
                        *Vasi, in his "picture of Naples and environs." Tells us that "when dense
                           clouds of black smoke arise, and particularly when they assume the form
                           of a cone or pine tree, it is considered as an infallible sign of an
                           approaching eruption."
                     
                  Pompeii was buried beneath a deluge of ashes and
                        cinders; from which it has been completely dug out, and now
                     stands fully revealed, resembling a city that has been the prey of flames,
                     except that its walls and window-sills are not blackened by smoke. Its houses
                     are only two stories high, but many of them are rich in architectural ornament
                     and arabesque painting—many are adorned with colonnades, enclosing a spacious
                     court, with a fountain or reservoir in the center. Over the principal doors of
                     some, the names of the owners are written in red paint. Among others, I
                     recollect those of Pansa, the Roman consul, and Caius Sallust, the historian:
                     the latter is said to have possessed one of the most beautiful residences in
                     the city, containing a great deal of handsome furniture, and mosaic
                     decorations, statues and paintings, which, with myriads from other mansions,
                     public and private, have been conveyed to the Museum in Naples, rendering it a
                     complete Golconda of such treasures. It is surprising, in what a
                        perfect state the things are, and how much the articles of
                     household furniture, and utensils for various purposes, resemble those of the
                     present century designed for similar use.
                  The streets of Pompeii are regular and straight, but entirely too narrow to
                     admit of carriages passing each other in any of them; so that a certain number
                     must have been appropriated to vehicles proceeding in certain directions. The
                     traces of wheels still indent the pavement of several, and not being more than two or three feet apart,
                     prove that the carriages of those times were very diminutive—perhaps mere cars
                     or small open chariots, such as we see depicted in antique paintings.
                  The grandest and best preserved of the public edifices are the Temple of Isis,
                     the Palace of Justice, and the Amphitheatre, where the famous combat took place
                     between the Pompeiians and the Nocereans during an exhibition of gladiators,
                     for which the Roman Senate exiled its leaders, and prohibited all such sports
                     for the space of ten years. The shops of Pompeii excite equal
                     interest, though, of course, not equal admiration with its nobler and more
                     aristocratic buildings. The statuary's, the apothecary's, the carpenter's, the
                     jeweller's occupation, is either mentioned on a sign without, or designated by
                     some mark or emblem within. The counter of the apothecary bears stains of vials
                     and glasses, which contained something corrosive; that of the confectioner
                     displays those of saucers and cups, and in the bakery are ovens. We lingered
                     through these deserted abodes, once the busy scene of human activity and labor,
                     but now so "sad, solitary and silent," till the slanting rays of the declining
                     sun invested them with a factitious cheerfulness, at the same time that they
                     warned us to depart if we wished to be benefited by their light during our ride
                     home: so, bestowing the well-earned and expected recompense upon our honest and
                     intelligent "Sivanni" for his services, we returned to bustling, thriving,
                     noisy Naples. The moon rose in splendor as we entered it, and the long ride,
                     and the sentimental, exciting and moralizing day we had spent, did not decrease
                     our appetites, when we attacked the abundant supper which awaited us.
               
               
                  NUMBER III.
                  A VISIT TO THE SHAKERS.
                  On the 17th of September, 18—, our curiosity was highly gratified by a visit to
                     the celebrated Shaker village, about two miles from New-Lebanon, in the state
                     of New-York. It consisted, principally, of yellow wooden houses, with neat and
                     verdant yards around them. Their gardens and orchards were regularly laid out,
                     and kept as clean and nice as possible; and their vegetables and fruits
                     cultivated with the greatest attention and care. The women wore dark-coloured
                     gowns, black-stuff shoes with old-fashioned high heels; and on their necks and
                     heads, white muslin kerchiefs and caps. They turned their hair back from the
                     forehead and tucked it up behind. The men wore theirs very short, and were clad
                     in suits of grey or brown.
                  We were received with much hospitality, and treated with delicious cider, bread
                     and butter, cheese and milk. They shewed us their whole establishment—the
                     dairy, the cheese-room, the dining-room, kitchen and chambers, and we were
                     surprised at the numerous ingenious contrivances they had, for saving labor and
                     rendering themselves comfortable. We saw about thirty of them at dinner. When
                     they had finished eating they knelt down, and not a sound was heard, or
                     movement made, for some minutes; each appeared absorbed in devotion. Having
                     thus returned thanks, all arose simultaneously and hastened away to
                     business.
                  Our guides were extremely affable and communicative, and told and shewed us
                     many things, which I shall not take time to narrate at present. In the
                     depository, or store, they had for
                     sale, boxes, brooms, sieves, brushes, silver pens, pincushions, and various
                     other articles, but no baskets, much to our disappointment, for we wished to
                     have purchased some; they told us they had been in such demand, that from a
                     large supply, not one was left. Their work, of every description, was
                     uncommonly neat and substantial, so we consoled ourselves with mats and wooden
                     spoons. In consequence of a shower, we were detained among these singular
                     beings for several hours; at length we got off, probably, as much to their
                     satisfaction as our own.
                  The next day being the sabbath, we resolved to attend their worship, and
                     accordingly, after breakfast, again proceeded to their village; there was a
                     considerable party of us, and we filled several carriages. The church was a
                     white wood building, with a tin roof; it stood on a most velvet-like and
                     beautiful green mound, enclosed by a white paling; it looked like purity
                     itself; but what fantastic ceremonies did we witness within? None that inspired
                     either devotion or respect. When we entered, the men were ushered in at a
                     different door from the one that admitted the women; for the sexes are not
                     permitted to sit together. The walls of the church were painted blue, the
                     windows were numerous and large, and the floor of fine plank, nicely scoured
                     and sanded.
                  The service lasted upwards of two hours, and was well worth a journey to
                     witness. The men arranged themselves in corps of ten abreast, opposite to
                     similar corps of women. With clasped hands and solemn faces, they remained
                     motionless, till, urged by the Spirit, (as they term it,) one would advance
                     into the space between them and the phalanx of females, and deliver a sort of
                     lecture, the greatest recommendation of which was its brevity; then resuming
                     his place in the ranks, prayer and shouting arose, accompanied by a gentle
                     movement of their persons up and down, by raising themselves on their toes.
                     When this had continued about half an hour, a signal was given, upon which they
                     brought forward, from the sides of the church, long benches, and arranged them
                     in straight lines; men and women still keeping places and distance as when
                     previously standing. As there was not room enough on the benches for
                        all to sit, some took turns with their neighbours. In the
                     meanwhile one of the elders preached quite a good sermon, and was succeeded by
                     another, who equally edified us. Each stood facing their visitors, (our party,)
                     to whom they seemed to address themselves, and not to their own sect on either
                     side of them. When the second elder had ended his discourse, the benches were
                     removed with much dexterity, and again they formed themselves into two corps as
                     at first, and we had a repetition of speaking, praying, and shouting. At length
                     they became quiet, and an old man advanced towards us, and requested that there
                     might be neither whispering nor laughing among the strangers, at
                     the manner in which they were about to worship God. He said they acted with
                     sincerity of heart, and with a view to the Creator's glory. He then retreated,
                     and in an instant he and his companions stripped off their coats, and turned
                     their sallow faces to the wall and their backs to us; the women did likewise,
                     with the exception of disrobing. In that position they sung, with
                     loud and harsh voices, a monotonous tune, and danced with all their might, for
                     at least fifteen minutes; then with the skill of experienced soldiers, they
                     arranged themselves four abreast, (males and females always in distinct
                     columns,) and marched round and round, till their bones must certainly have
                        ached. They held their arms up
                     from the elbow, and let their hands droop from the wrist, looking, for all the
                     world, like a flock of penguins. Sometimes they prayed, sometimes they sung and
                     loudly clapped their hands; yet did these make less noise than another set, who
                     stood, with joined hands, as if going to dance a reel in the centre of the
                     church, and almost stunned us with their vociferations.
                  We quite rejoiced when the commotion was over, and the moment of departure
                     arrived, and did not fail to hasten ours. It was painful to behold our
                     fellow-creatures under the influence of such absurd fanaticism!
                  We remained only a couple of days at Lebanon. The season for bathing and
                     drinking the waters there, being past, it was not an inviting sojourn, and we
                     soon retraced the road back to Albany.
                  The old Dutch houses, with which that city abounded, with their antiquated
                     roofs and windows, interested me much more than its statelier residences and
                     public edifices.
                  We visited the spacious yellow mansion in which the veteran, Gen. Schuyler,
                     used to reside. The yard and garden were rendered almost gloomy, by the number
                     of trees which shaded them. Most of them were cedars, and other sombre-tinted
                     evergreens, reminding us of Lord Byron's beautiful lines on the cypress: 
                        
                           "Dark tree! still sad when other's grief is fled,
                           The only constant mourner o'er the dead!"
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  NUMBER IV.
                  A SHORT SOJOURN IN FRANKFORT ON THE MAIN.
                  Well, as I was saying, we left Darmstadt at 2 o'clock, A.M., in a drizzling
                     rain. On the route, we passed through Langen, Spreudlingen and Neuf-Isenbourg.
                     At Langen, we baited the horses, and, while waiting at the inn, observed in a
                     neighbouring pool a brood of remarkably beautiful ducks—about the neck and
                     breast their plumage was white; on the rest of their bodies, of a rich green
                     and black; and their bills of the brightest yellow—they resembled the American
                     summer duck. Another set were of a pale brown, with bills slightly hooked, and
                     white or brown tufts on their heads, looking very regal.
                  
                  Between Langen and Isenbourg, we threaded a forest of noble oak and beech
                     trees, that were really brilliant with the hues of autumn. The
                     rain had ceased, and, as we approached Frankfort, numerous and flourishing
                     vineyards perfumed and enlivened our road, filled with men, women, girls and
                     boys gathering their luscious products. Some of the men wore three-cornered
                     hats, and some of the women white quilted cotton caps with stiff peaked crowns,
                     (I thought them frightful;) while others, more youthful in appearance, had
                     their hair platted and wound entirely round the head; the little girls wore
                     their's in bands falling to their waists, as is the fashion among us at
                     present.
                  The view of the town, river, and mountains beyond it, was enchanting! We
                     crossed the stone bridge over the Main, and were set down at the "Hotel of the
                        Golden Swan." It was past 8
                     o'clock—so we were fain to sup and retire for the night. The next morning we
                     commenced our peregrinations by a visit to the Rœmer, an ancient Gothic
                     edifice, where the Emperors used to be elected and crowned, and where the
                     Senate still sits. The spacious hall in which they meet is wainscotted with
                     crimson damask, and its ceiling ornamented with the coats of arms of the
                        nine electors.*
                      In the "Hall of the Emperors," forty-eight niches contain a likeness of
                     each, painted to represent a bust of bronze on a pedestal, with
                     its shadow behind it, which serves as a strong relief, and produces a good
                     effect. The walls and ceiling of this room are decorated with various devices
                     and a picture of the judgment of Solomon. In front of the Rœmer stands a
                     fountain, surmounted by a statue of Justice: from this fountain wine is played
                     for the populace on certain fête days.
                  
                     
                     *A change made in the Constitution of the Empire in 1798 (since the
                        building of the room) has increased the number to ten.
                  
                  The Cathedral next engaged us; it is old and ugly, and in the form of a cross.
                     The clock is placed within the building, and the hours are struck by two little
                     figures each side of it. On the right of the altar is the tomb of Gunther, the
                     poet of Schwartzburg; he was poisoned by a rival, who was jealous of his favor
                     at court. The Cathedral is dedicated to St. Bartholomew, and contains two
                     horrid pictures of his martyrdom. While we were making our observations, a
                     christening party entered; and after witnessing the ceremony we came away, and
                     strolled through the Zeil, the finest street in the city; and then, by way of
                     contrast, took a view of the Jews' quarter——a dark, dirty and narrow defile,
                     abounding with Shylock-looking personages, of whom I really felt
                     afraid. The sides of many of the houses were slated, and the windows of
                        all of them extremely small. We saw the antique residence of
                     the Rothschild family, the sons of which have become the chief bankers of
                     Europe. It is a plain and humble dwelling.
                  Frankfort is a spacious, modern-looking town; and but for the recollection of
                     Goethe and Werter, allied with no poetic or romantic associations. They were
                     natives of the place, although Werter resided thirty miles distant: his real
                     name was Jerusalem. Some author (I do not remember whom) bewails
                     Goethe's having been born in the heart of a pounds-shillings-and-pence city,
                     instead of the depths of an Alpine forest; but surely his imaginations and
                     fancy were sufficiently vivid, without farther aid from Nature; and it was for
                     the sake of the author's own faculties, that the regret was expressed. Near the
                     porte of Friedbourg (one of the gates of the town) we remarked a curious
                     monument, and, on enquiry, were informed that it was erected by Frederick the
                     2nd, of Prussia, in memory of a Hessian Prince and his followers, who were
                     killed at the siege of Frankfort, in 1792. It consists of an immense block of
                     marble placed on a pile of rocks; the four sides are plated with copper, on
                     which are inscriptions in German and Latin; upon the summit lies a gigantic
                     helmet and shield, a cannon and a huge lion's skin; it makes one think of the
                     wondrous story of the "Castle of Otranto."
                  Our next resting place was the Church of St. Catherine; here we seated
                     ourselves to recover breath and examine a good painting over the altar, the
                     subject of which was the Redeemer at prayer in Gethsemane, and his disciples
                     sleeping around him; the chandeliers of this church are of glass, and somewhat
                     curious; two of them were surmounted with an image of St. Catherine holding her
                     sword; a third with two crucifixes, each bearing the body of our Saviour.
                  
                  By this time we were pretty well satisfied with sight-seeing, and returned to
                     our lodgings; as we walked along, we observed small mirrors of oval shape
                     attached to the windows of many of the houses, and so fixed as to reflect
                     objects for a considerable distance up or down the street. We thought, at
                     first, they were intended for that sole purpose; but our landlord told us they
                     were used thus, in order to reflect the rays of the sun and introduce them into
                     rooms that, without them, would be too sombre. Having recruited our strength
                     and energy, we proceeded, in the afternoon, to the new Library, a
                     stately edifice of stone, with a portico supported by corinthian columns. There
                     was not much to be seen within; a moderate collection of books; a few Egyptian
                     antiquities, and some indifferently painted portraits, but an excellent one of
                     Martin Luther; in a glass case were carefully preserved a stout pair of shoes,
                     a blue linen shirt, and a coat of mail, once his, two of his letters, and two
                     of Philip Melancthon's, his wise and gentle coadjutor in the reformation, whose
                     benignity and moderation contrasted strongly with Luther's vehemence and
                     impetuosity.
                  Bethmann's garden and museum interested us very much. Mr. Bethmann is a
                     millionaire, and a great admirer of the fine arts, which he liberally
                     patronizes. His garden is luxurient and beautifully laid out and decorated. His
                     museum stands in it, and is divided into four apartments, one devoted to orange
                     trees and other shrubs and plants; the remaining three, to statues and busts of
                     marble and plaister. Danneker's exquisite statue of Ariadne riding on a
                     panther, has a room appropriated to itself. The coloured glass of the window
                     tinges the figure with a roseate hue. The nymph is represented in a most
                     graceful attitude, and with a countenance tenance beaming with love and hope,
                     for it is as the joyous bride of Bacchus, and not the forsaken of
                     Theseus, that the sculptor has depicted her. Her head is wreathed with grape
                     leaves, and she is sitting on a drapery, which falls naturally and tastefully
                     over the back of the panther; both figures are done to the life! It seems as if
                     a touch of the finger would leave an impression on them. And here a slight
                     sketch of the artist, John Henry Von Danneker, may not be amiss.
                  His birth-place was Stuttgard, and his family of low origin, and so poor that
                     they could not afford to give him an education, except the simplest schooling.
                     His talent for sculpture was indicated early in youth, by his carving, on the
                     materials of a neighbouring stone-cutter, various designs and objects. Charles,
                     Duke of Wirtemburg, in whose employ his father served as hostler, struck with
                     the intelligence of his mien, received him into a military school he had
                     established for the sons of his dependents, and, afterwards, furnished him with
                     funds to visit Paris, whither he travelled on foot, and where he remained
                     nearly two years diligently devoting himself to his profession, and submitting
                     to the greatest privations, in consequence of the ardour with which he pursued
                     it. He repaired to Rome from Paris, again travelling on foot; here he met with
                     Canova, who proved a warm friend to him, and assisted him with his counsels and
                     instructions. At the end of five years, he returned to Germany, and was made
                     Professor of the Fine Arts, in the Stuttgard Academy. He is now one of the most
                     indefatigable and eminent of modern sculptors, and not only estimated for his
                     genius, but beloved for his excellent qualities. Canova used to style him "the
                     Blessed." Here we will bid him adieu and return to Frankfort.
                  
                  A drive round its environs the following morning, was both refreshing and
                     delightful; a perfect garden, l'Anglaise; encompasses it and abounds in a
                     variety of trees and flowers; there were many beautiful spruce pines, and,
                     wherever there was shade from foilage, rustic seats allured the pedestrian.
                     Swans and ducks in abundance were swimming about on streams and sheets of
                     water. We made a second pilgrimage to the Cathedral, to ascend the tower, on
                     the top of which, to our utter amazement, we found the sexton and his wife
                     residing in a small cabin, pub up there for their accommodation! They told us
                     that they rarely quitted their airy pinnacle more than twice a week; the
                     stair-way leading to it was so steep and fatiguing, we could vouch for the
                     truth of the assertion by our own feelings at the moment.
                  At night, we went to the Theatre; both its exterior and interior are handsome;
                     over the stage was an illuminated clock; the music was good, and among the
                     performers we heard a fine female vocalist; there were many genteel looking
                     women in the pit as well as the boxes—they wore large bonnets and
                     shawls; the performance occasioned a deal of laughter, but not understanding
                     German, we could not share in the mirth. Ice creams were handed during the
                     evening—of course they were for sale, and each person laid his money on the
                     waiter as he took a glass. The play was concluded by 9 o'clock, rather a more
                     reasonable hour for separating than is usually observed at such
                     entertainments.
                  The ensuing day we were aroused from our morning slumbers by the firing of
                     cannon, tolling of bells and marching of soldiers—it was the anniversary of the
                     battle of Leipsic, and we hurried to the square in front of the Rœmer, to
                     witness its celebration. We counted eight regiments in dashing uniforms; the
                     caps of one company were peculiarly martial in appearance, being decorated with
                     tremendous tassels of horse hair, hanging forwards and a little to one side
                     over the forehead. The effect was quite improving. A vast crowd assembled to
                     see the parade and listen to the lively music of the military bands. Senators
                     in black occupied the arches of the Rœmer, which were festooned with red cloth;
                     rich equipages (most of them drawn by coal black horses) were filled with
                     well-dressed ladies, but we beheld no pretty faces among them. At 4 o'clock,
                     three corps of little boys and girls sung a hymn, and then the populace rushed
                     to the bridge and quay, where cannons were discharged, while the church bells
                     rang loud and merrily. One gun sufficed our ears, and we hastened
                     home, after refreshing ourselves with cakes and lemonade at a confectioner's N.
                     B. German cakes and bonbons are uncommonly nice and tempting; sugar is
                     fabricated into all sorts of pretty things, and a proportionate
                     price demanded for them.
                  What smokers the Germans are! Whether driving, or riding, or walking, or
                     sitting, within doors or without, they are puffing a pipe, and frequently have
                     a pouch of tobacco tied to the button-hole of their coat; and always in their
                     pocket, they carry a box with materials for striking fire. The shop windows of
                     the town were filled with pipes; some of them at least a yard in length. After
                     that tumultuous day, we slept soundly, you may be sure, and were off for
                     Mayence by dawn the next morning.
               
               
                  
                  NUMBER V.
                  THE OLD CITY OF MAYENCE.
                  As we approached Mayence, or Mentz, for it is called by both these names, the
                     one being German, the other French, a pleasing landscape opened upon our view,
                     and a crimson sky tinted everything "couleur de rose." This is one of the
                     strongest towns in Germany, and finely located on the slope of a hill, at the
                     confluence of the Mein and the Rhine; opposite, is the fortified town of
                     Cassel, with which it is connected by a bridge of boats, and beyond these we
                     remarked a row of wind-mills, on boats also.
                  At the custom-house, passports and luggage were inspected, but not strictly,
                     nor were we long kept waiting during the examination; yet how provoking are
                     such detentions, however short! especially to Americans accustomed to range
                     over their own vast continent ad libitum, as
                     we say in music.
                  The weather continued clear and cold, and after an early breakfast, next
                     morning, we commenced our peregrinations; as usual beginning with the
                     Cathedral, like all other cathedrals in Europe, a sombre and ancient looking
                     pile. It was built in the tenth century, but not completed till the eleventh,
                     when it was nearly destroyed by fire and again constructed. Here we saw the
                     tomb of Frauenlob, chief of the Troubadours, (they told us,) a minstrel who
                     devoted his strains to the graces and virtues of the female sex, and thereby
                     became so great a favorite with the ladies of Mayence, (then the chief resort
                     of the Troubadors,) that on his death they insisted upon bearing his body to
                     the grave; where they bewailed his loss with sighs and tears, and poured out
                     such plentiful libations of wine, in honor of him, that the spacious floor of
                     the church was well nigh deluged. So much for tradition. The tomb consists of
                     two bas reliefs, placed against the wall of the adjoining cloister; one
                     represents the funeral procession of the minstrel, and the other his bust. An
                     escutcheon, on the wall within the Cathedral, denotes the
                     resting-place of Fastrade, the wife of Charlemagne, and beneath it is engraved
                     a Latin inscription concerning her. Over one of the altars is a huge picture of
                     Saint Martin, the patron Saint of the church; he is on horseback, and both man
                     and charger are the full size of life.
                  After viewing two or three other churches, of which I will not speak, lest you
                     be surfeited by such-like descriptions, we walked to the Library; but it was
                     undergoing repairs and could not be entered—this was quite a disappointment, as
                     it contains a fine collection of ancient medals, and numerous specimens of the
                     first essays in printing with moveable types, which we desired to
                     see. The inventor of these, Jean Goensfleisch de Sorgenloch, usually styled
                     Gutenberg, from the name of his habitation, (signifying good mountain,) was a
                     native and resident of Mayence; and we visited the house in which he resided.
                     He was of noble birth, and a sign bearing his coat-of-arms and an inscription,
                     in gilt letters, informs those passers-by, who can read and comprehend German,
                     that said house was once his dwelling place. His coat-of-arms is also marked on
                     a projecting beam of wood in the chamber he occupied. He was assisted in his
                     plans by a wealthy goldsmith of the town, John Fust, or Faust, who, in
                     conjunction with Pierre Schoeffer, afterwards wards improved the types by forming them of
                        metal instead of wood.
                  
                  Strasbourg, Harlem, and Mayence, are very jealous of each other on the subject
                     of printing, each claiming the credit of its invention; but this dispute, like
                     that of the seven cities concerning their title to Homer, remains,
                     I believe, yet undetermined.
                  A building, designated as being the first printing establishment, is still
                     standing, and is termed "la cour zum Inngen."
                  The next things of note that attracted us, were the Hall of Antiquities, the
                     Picture Gallery, and the Ducal Palace. In the last is shewn the suite of
                     apartments which Napoleon Buonaparte occupied, during his sojourn in Mayence.
                     Our cicerone on the occasion, a respectable German woman, who spoke English
                     tolerably well, lavished high praises on the French Emperor; she said all loved
                     him who attended on him, he was so kind and generous! That his soldiers lived
                     like princes, and that those who supplied them were amply paid. "Ah!" she
                     exclaimed, "times are sadly changed since then; what I gave to the poor, in
                     those days, I would now be glad to get myself." In fact, wherever we stopped,
                     the very name of Napoleon, if mentioned, seemed to call forth, from the
                     middling and lower classes, enthusiasm and commendation.
                  In the Hall of Antiquities we saw many ancient votive altars, and at least
                     fifty large monumental stones, bearing sculptured figures of Roman Knights.
                     They were discovered on an eminence in the vicinity of the town, (where was
                     once a Roman cemetery,) by Professor Lehne, a learned gentleman; said to be
                     almost as devoted to antiquarian researches and lore, as Sir Walter Scott's
                     famous Mr. Old buck, alias Monkbarns; and the neighbourhood of Mayence ence
                     furnishes unlimited means of indulging his labors and taste; for the city is
                     exceedingly old, being founded as early as the 70th year of the Christian era,
                     by Drusus Germanicus, during the wars between the ancient Germans and Romans.
                     In that stormy age he built a fortification, called in Latin Mogontiacum, which
                     was gradually surrounded by other edifices till the number increased to a town,
                     eventually enlarged and called Mentz, or Mayence. A second fort, erected by him
                     on the opposite bank of the Rhine, was in like manner the origin of Cassel.
                     Mayence was afterwards totally destroyed, but refounded by Charlemagne.
                  All this is a digression—let us re-enter the Hall of Antiquities, to notice the
                     plan of a noble bridge, which Napoleon intended to have had constructed over
                     the Rhine. It was to be of sufficient height to allow of vessels passing under
                     it, and would have cost thirty-six millions of francs.
                  Among the pictures in the Gallery of Painting, there was a singular one
                     entitled the Menagerie of Rubens; in which his wife and child are represented,
                     surrounded by various sorts of birds and beasts. The human figures were
                     executed by himself, the birds and quadrupeds by Francis Snyders,
                     the Flemish artist, so renowned for his skill in that species of painting. He
                     was a native of Antwerp, and often worked in concert with Rubens. Much
                     enjoyment have I had in viewing both their joint and separate productions, and
                     those of other equally eminent limners!
                  Poetry and music, 'tis true, are delightful, but I regard painting as the most
                     valuable art; because it not only brings before us scenes and places of beauty,
                     grandeur, and celebrity, which otherwise we would never behold, but enables us
                     to retain the forms and features of our beloved friends when they are no longer with us. And
                     what yields more soul-thrilling, though melancholy pleasure, than gazing on the
                     cherished lineaments of those we almost idolized, when on earth, after they
                     have been torn from us by the cold and relentless grasp of death? For the same
                     reason statuary, or sculpture, ranks next to painting, in my preference; but
                     the dead whiteness of the cold marble plays not upon the heart and imagination
                     with the force of the glowing canvass; nor, like it, for a moment charms us
                     into the evanescent belief of beholding the dear originals themselves.
                  But, again, a truce with digressions! and "revenons a' nos montons."
                  There are several most agreeable and enticing public promenades at Mayence; the
                     two principal we visited—these were the "Favorita" and the "Gartenfeld;" from
                     both you have a bewitching prospect. The "Favorita" was once a fortification,
                     and from its heights are seen the town, the sparkling river with its islets,
                     the busy villages, whirling wind-mills and bridge of boats, and the mouth of
                     the sluggish Mein, pouring its tributary waters into the green and rapid Rhine.
                     The "Gartenfeld" (Gardenfield) borders the latter, and is so arranged that it
                     can be inundated in time of war.
                  One morning, with a little boy to guide us, we proceeded to the tower of
                     Drusus, in the vicinity of Mayence. This is the remains of a monument erected
                     in honor of him. It is circular, and contains a spiral stair-case. The Germans
                     term it the Eichelstein, (Eagle's stone,) because it was formerly surmounted
                     with an eagle.
                  The weather being uncommonly fine, and the vintage going on, we were induced to
                     extend our walk farther into the country, and a merry scene we witnessed—there
                     was a numerous band of peasants, singing loudly and cheerily as they pursued
                     their labours; presently up came another set, in procession, headed by a
                     rosy-faced little fellow, a miniature Bacchus, with a wreath on
                     his head and a banner in his hands, made of divers gay-colored ribbons and
                     pieces of cloth, which he waved about with quite a triumphal and martial air,
                     accompanying every gesture with what he meant for music; but which
                     sounded discordant and grating to our ears, and we were glad when
                     the train dispersed. The vintagers were very generous in offering us grapes, of
                     which we partook plentifully, nor would they accept of any remuneration.
                  And now, with your leave, I will close my details, this evening, with an
                     appropriate fiction, which shall be called, not
                        "Alonzo," but, 
                        RODOLPH, THE BRAVE.
                     
                  
                  A peasant girl of Ezbach, a town of the Rhingan, where, you know, the best
                     wines of Germany are made, was remarkable for her beauty; and from among the
                     numerous swains it had subjugated she selected, as her favorite, a young
                     vintager almost as handsome as herself, and promised him that the hymenial knot
                     should be tied as soon as the grape-gathering was finished. In the meanwhile,
                     the happy pair daily plied together their pleasant tasks.
                  One morning, while thus employed, the Lord of the Castle, who, after a long
                     absence, had just returned to his domains, came riding by on a tour of
                     inspection. He had left the bright-eyed, cherry-cheeked Frederica, an
                     unattractive child of nine years old—she now stood before him a graceful,
                     lovely girl, the pride of the village. He fell desperately in love!—sent for
                     her the next Sunday, to his
                     dwelling, and proffered the astonished maiden his hand and heart. She was no
                     Jeanie Deans on the occasion; and dazzled by his promises of gifts and
                     pleasures, above all by the splendors which adorned his stately halls, she
                     listened to the tempter, and abandoned her humble lover for the wealthy
                     Count.
                  In due time, and with due festivities, the nuptials were celebrated; and the
                     bride, in her rich attire, looked more beautiful than ever. But the paleness of
                     her face, and the tremour and icy coldness of her hand, betrayed too plainly
                     the struggle, the agony of her bosom, where Love lay bleeding beneath the
                     selfish grasp of Ambition.
                  Rodolph could not witness the unhallowed bands. In despair he quitted his
                     birth-place, and fled to a distant land.
                  Frederica grew more and more unhappy. She was soon surfeited with the luxuries
                     for which she had sacrificed herself and her lover; and a victim to the
                     tormenting jealousy and harshness of her lord, who, ungenerous and
                     narrow-minded, incessantly reproached her with her attachments to Rodolph,
                     (thereby exciting both her aversion and contempt,) she pined away; her beauty
                     faded, her health and strength departed; and ere a second summer, after that
                     fatal union, had re-clad the vines with leaves and fruit, the grass grew high
                     and green around the tomb of poor Frederica!
                  She left an infant, a few months old, and the babe was lovely as the mother it
                     resembled, and thrived and prospered under the devoted care of its maternal
                     grand parents. Its reckless father, weary of his lonely hearth, had committed
                     it to their charge, and again gone forth to seek enjoyment on some foreign
                     shore. Thence, in after years, the tidings came that he was dead; and behold,
                     the little Gertrude a rich and beauteous heiress! Hosts of lovers worship ship
                     at her shrine, but "favours to none, tho' smiles to
                        all, she extends;" until a warrior bold, with laurel-wreathed
                     brow, casts his trophies at her feet. His valor and his manly beauty prove
                     resistless, and she pledges him her troth.
                  And who is this "warrior bold"—this victorious champion in love
                     and war?
                  It is Rodolph, once termed the "Forsaken," but now the
                        "Brave."
                  With valiant heart he subdued his ill-requited passion and wooed another bride,
                     and Glory was her name! He sought and won her on the
                     battle-field of Prague.
                  A gallant knight, guerdoned with well-earned honors, he returns to his
                     country—hears of the syren of Ezbach, whose fascinations are enchaining every
                     heart, and hastens to his own cherished home to yield his homage
                     too.
                  With amazement he recognizes, in the enchantress, the daughter, the
                        image, of his once adored and faithless Frederica!
                  
                     
                        "None but the brave deserve the fair"—
                      So thought Gertrude, and the suit of Rodolph was not rejected. Like Cæsar,
                     "he came, he saw, he conquered." They were married, and long and flourishing
                     was the line of their descendants; and happily lived, to a green old age, the
                     Count and Countess of Ezbach.
               
               
                  
                  NUMBER VI.
                  "LA GRANGE" AND ITS INMATES.
                  It was a charming week that, which we spent at "La Grange Bleneau," the
                     turretted and ivy-mantled castle of our venerated friend, General La Fayette,
                     now no longer a sojourner upon earth. Peace to his soul! ... During three days
                     of that pleasant period, "our sunshine lay within," as one of my favorite songs
                     has it—for without, the rain came down in torrents, and the waters
                     of the moat looked troubled, the sky gloomy, and the surrounding trees drooped
                     under the storm. In short, a poetic dreamer might have imagined that the
                     spirits of the castle's lake were busily employed in plotting mischief against
                     the little boat that was tossing on its surface, and the waving shrubbery and
                     vines in its vicinity. The interior of the castle exhibited a far different
                     aspect, with its pictured walls, gay covered sofas, chairs and window
                     curtains!—and then the cheerful faces, and hearts brimful of mirth and
                     kindness, that were there! Oh! I well remember the merry set we formed. The
                     young folks waltzing and dancing quadrilles to the sound of the piano, (there
                     were no polkas in those days, at least out of Hungary
                     and Poland,) or playing at "Colin Maillard," (in plain English, "blindman's
                     buff,") and their elders looking on and enjoying the sight of their feats and
                     graces, or else engaged in animated discourse, or deep in the mysteries of
                     chess, and the chances of backgammon, ecarte, &c.
                  The family then assembled at La Grange consisted of the General's only son and
                     daughter-in-law, Monsieur and Madame George W. La Fayette, (who did the honours
                     of the castle,) and their three daughters, Natalie, Mathilde and Clementine;
                     their sons were absent. The General's two daughters, Madame Caroline de
                     Maubourg and Madame Virginie de Lasterie, both of whom shared his captivity at
                     Olmutz from choice, as did their mother, who afterwards died of an illness
                     caused by the hardships and sufferings experienced during that horrible
                     incarceration. Madame de Lasterie had also three daughters, and Madame de
                     Maubourg two; then there were young Julius de Lasterie, and a half score of
                     other young people, on a visit to him and his sisters and cousins, it being a
                     holiday season. Even now, I can recall to mind each of that happy, lively
                     crew.
                  Mathilde La Fayette, with her soft blue eyes and flowing ringlets, and Octavie
                     de Lasterie, with her hazel orbs and flaxen hair, (an unusual, but beautiful
                     contrast!) I thought the prettiest of the girls, though Clementine was,
                     perhaps, the most graceful and dignified in her appearance and deportment, and,
                     withal, had much sweetness of manner. Besides our own immediate party, there
                     were several other guests, and when collected together, we daily constituted a
                     company of about thirty in number.
                  It was in this refined circle we first had the pleasure of meeting, and
                     becoming acquainted with, the beauteous Countess de Lobespin and her father,
                     the old Count de Tracy, once a very literary character, but almost blind when
                     we saw him. The distinguished writer of the "Prussian Campaign," Count Philip
                     de Ségur, and the still more celebrated Count Ségur, the elder, his venerable
                     parent, were also there. We were charmed with the latter, and afterwards
                     partook of several pleasant dinner parties at his residence in Paris, where we
                     met many of the Literati of the day; his
                     house being quite a rendezvous for the learned and talented. His entertainments were always simple
                     and extremely agreeable; sprightly conversation, anecdotes and repartee
                     abounded, and the hospitable old Count entered into the spirit of the "feast of
                     reason and flow of soul," (what a rare quotation I've selected!)
                     with as much gusto as the very brightest and most vivacious of his company.
                  But thus getting, in imagination, into No. 13 Rue Duphot, (Count
                     Ségur's habitation,) I have wandered far from my original subject, "La Grange,"
                     and will now resume it, it being to me too agreeable a theme to abandon so
                     quickly. After the gale I've described above, had subsided, and the cheering
                     sun-beams had sufficiently dried the walks about the grounds, we strayed over
                     the farm in every direction that fancy led us, having neither fences or walls
                     to impede our movements, as of such sorts of enclosures there were none.
                  Everything bore the impress of good order, regularity and method, for
                     everything was watched over with vigilence by the two masters of the domain,
                     the General and his son. It being the month of September, clusters of grapes
                     hung in dewy freshness on their vines, and in our itinerant rambles we never
                     failed to do ample justice to their lusciousness. Sometimes we amused ourselves
                     in the menagerie, (for a menagerie there was, and a considerable one too!)
                     watching the different ways of the birds and quadrupeds it contained. There was
                     a variety of both from foreign countries, and a couple of enormous bears from
                     our own native land. They were sent out by the late Mr. Skinner, of Baltimore,
                     the able editor of the "Farmer's Magazine."
                  These pedestrian excursions always immediately succeeded breakfast, the hour
                     for which was eleven o'clock; previous ous to this, each guest had coffee and a
                     roll offered to him at his chamber door, so that we were no sufferers from
                     hunger, and had ample time to perform our devotions and sundry necessary pieces
                     of work, ere summoned to mingle with the world below at the festal board of the
                     castle, where every luxury was displayed in abundance; such as wines, fruits,
                     conserves, cakes, meats, and bread in various forms; also, butter and cream,
                     and excellent milk, fresh from the extensive and well kept dairy.
                  On re-entering the house, after our pleasant promenades, the ladies assembled
                     for an hour or more in the parlour, where some embroidered or sewed, others
                     made music on the piano, all talked, and all seemed to enjoy
                     themselves. As to the "lords of the creation," I entirely forget
                     what became of them until dinner; the dear old General and Mr. George W. La
                     Fayette went out to inspect the labourers on their farm, I
                        suppose, and others to hunt or shoot, or to fish in the lake,
                     perhaps, and some no doubt resorted to the library, which was rich in valuable
                     books, and had among them a set of handsomely bound volumes of American
                     Ornithology, that were executed in this country, and beautifully printed and
                     engraved.
                  We frequently varied our mode of exercise by a drive, and one balmy morning
                     visited a neighbouring village, in whose small parish church William
                     Summerville, a Virginian, lies buried. I well remember seeing him in my
                     childhood, at my father's country seat, "the Hermitage," (dear old Hermitage!)
                     where he spent many a day. Mr. Summerville was said to have been engaged to be
                     married to the lovely Miss Conyers, who perished in the flames of the Richmond
                     Theatre on the night of its awful conflagration, December 26, 1811. Others aver
                     that she was betrothed trothed to
                     the noble and gallant Gibbon, who, vainly trying to rescue her from the burning
                     ruins, shared her hapless fate.
               
               
                  NUMBER VII.
                  THE INSTITUTION FOR THE DEAF AND DUMB, AND THE BLIND ASYLUM IN
                     PARIS.
                  Not far from the little free-stone chapel which crowns the summit of Mont
                     Louis, in the cemetery of Peré La Chaise, stands a small black marble
                     sepulchre, bearing the date of 1823, and the name of Sicard, spelt in the
                     expressive manual alphabet of the Deaf and Dumb. The letters are
                     formed by six hands, delineated in different positions, after the manner of
                     Egyptian hieroglyphics, and neatly carved on the front of the tomb.
                  It is an object of peculiar interest, and we paused before it, not from
                     curiosity alone, but from an innate feeling of respect for the memory of him
                     whose remains are enshrined within—whose life and talents were so nobly, so
                     energetically devoted to that work of wonder and benevolence, the education of
                     the Deaf and Dumb!
                  To the Abbé Roch Ambroise Cucurron Sicard, of Tousseret, near Bordeaux, and to
                     his teacher and predecessor, the Abbé Charles Michael de L'Epée, of Versailles,
                     both the gratitude and admiration of all philanthropists are due; but more
                     especially the gratitude of such as have ties connecting them with that once
                     helpless portion of our race; for whose benefit the time and labors of these
                     humane and distinguished men were applied with such blessed success.
                        They have passed from the earth; but imperishable must ever be
                     the fame and fruits of their good works, their ingenuity and exertions. To
                     borrow the words of an interesting tourist, "their names and praises shall
                     live, when the marble upon which they are engraved shall have crumbled into
                     dust."
                  The Abbé de L'Epée possessed only a moderate income, yet supported, at his own
                     private expense, no less than forty deaf and dumb children; and by his
                     indefatigable instructions and patience, accomplished his design of rendering
                     them susceptive of enjoyment within themselves and useful members of society.
                     He even communicated to them the knowledge of various languages and
                     sciences—some became mathematicians and engineers, and others poets and writers
                     for literary works—all were taught a trade or profession. Such was
                     his regard for his protegées, that, when quite an old man, he has been known to
                     deprive himself of a fire, during an entire winter, in order to supply them
                     liberally with that and other comforts.
                  Government at length rewarded his generosity and successful efforts by its
                     patronage, and erected a public institution, which was committed to his
                     guidance and control. It is located in the Rue du Faubourg St. Jaques, towards
                     the southern extremity of Paris, and is certainly one of the most interesting
                     establishments in the city.
                  One morning in every week it is thrown open for public inspection; and at the
                     close of every month there is a public examination of the pupils, to which
                     admission may be obtained by merely applying to the Director for tickets; and
                     well worth while it is to do this, and go there to witness an interesting and
                     touching scene, which will occupy
                     only a few hours, and leave a pleasing and lasting impression on both mind and
                     heart.
                  The number of pupils is limited to ninety, and their rapid progress and
                     attainments in different branches of knowledge, their development of power and
                     acuteness in metaphysical reasoning—in short, their utter change from mental
                     obscurity to soul-cheering light of intellect, inspire the visitor with
                     pleasure and amazement; and almost induce the belief that Providence, who
                     always "tempers the wind to the shorn lamb," has bestowed on this unfortunate
                     class of human beings, higher capacities than common, to compensate, in some
                     measure, for their deprivation of hearing and speech.
                  After the death of the Abbé de L'Epée, which occurred in 1789, his friend and
                     assistant, the Abbé Sicard, conducted the school with equal skill and
                     credit—indeed, it seemed as if, like Elijah of old, his master had cast his
                     mantle upon him, and with it transmitted his ability and zeal for
                     the office he bequeathed to him.
                  To the original list of studies, Monsieur Sicard added the accomplishments of
                     drawing, painting and working in mosaic, and had the gratification of sending
                     forth, from his seminary, many proficients in each; but death, the fell
                     destroyer of the good as well as the wicked, put an end to the labors of this
                     excellent man while in the prime of his life and usefulness, and on the tenth
                     of May, 1822, (a gloomy day for the poor mutes!) he was laid upon his bier.
                     When we were in Paris, the Abbé Gawdelin occupied his place at the head of the
                     institution, and Madame —— had charge of the girls; for both male and female
                     children are admitted, a circumstance I have neglected to mention.
                  Those who can afford to pay, are charged for board and tuition, but the poor
                     are received gratuitously; none of the latter, however, are suffered to enter
                     without the testimony of a surgeon to their being deaf and dumb, nor without
                     the most satisfactory proofs that their parents are unable to provide for their
                     support and education.
                  When these are obtained, the candidates are welcomed to a comfortable home,
                     there to reside five years and be fitted to share in the pursuits
                     of their fellow-creatures, and maintain themselves by that trade, or
                     profession, they may prove best calculated to acquire. Dr. Johnson calls their
                     education "a philosophical curiosity," and so it really is. The
                     idea of instructing them, and the method of doing so, is said to
                     have originated with a Benedictine Monk, about the end of the sixteenth
                     century—his name was Pedro de Ponce. He educated two Castilian children, of
                     high birth, who were mutes, and his success excited both wonder and
                     applause.
                  After his time, several other Spaniards, and individuals in different
                     countries, applied themselves to the same benevolent vocation, but their labors
                     extended to a very few pupils, and their system of teaching was very
                     incomplete—the happiness and honor of perfecting it were reserved for the two
                     eminent Frenchmen, of whom I have been speaking.
                  According to a computation, made some years ago by the Academy of Science, in
                     Paris, there were then, in Europe, more than eighty Institutions for the Deaf
                     and Dumb, and several in the United States of America.
                  To give you an idea of the unique and fanciful style in which the mutes usually
                     express their conceptions of any given subject, here are a series of
                        flowery definitions I have written in imitation of it. Suppose
                     them to be asked the meaning of Gratitude, Fidelity, Ingratitude, Fear,
                        Pride, Humility, Revenge,
                     Modesty, Patience, Punctuality, and Power, they would probably answer somewhat
                     as follows:
                  GRATITUDE—The incense and beauty with which the
                     flower repays the care and trouble of him who reared it.
                  FIDELITY—The adherence of the ivy to the scathed oak, or ruined
                     tower.
                  The constant turning of the sun-flower to the sun— 
                        
                           
                              "As the sun-flower turns on her god when he sets,
                              The same look which she turned when he rose."
                           
                        
                        MOORE.
                     
                  
                  INGRATITUDE—The thorns of the rose, piercing the hand which
                     nourished it.
                  FEAR—The shrinking of the sensitive-plant from the hand that would touch
                     it.
                  PRIDE—The towering of the stately holly-hock above more attractive
                     and sweeter flowers of humbler growth.
                  HUMILITY—The lowliness of the sweet and beauteous violet.
                  REVENGE—The stinging of the nettle, when disturbed.
                  MODESTY—The retiring of the lily of the valley within its
                     leaves.
                  PATIENCE—The prostration of the tulip during the storm.
                  PUNCTUALITY—The opening and closing of the
                     morning-glory.
                  POWER—The exhalation from the upas-blossom, overcoming all within
                     its influence—The fragrance of the ottar-gul.
                  Lord Byron, in a note to one of his poems, relates that an eastern swain once
                     broke a vial of this rich perfume (the ottar-gul, or ottar of roses) under the
                     nose of a duenna, employed to keep guard over his lady-love, and that the old
                     woman was so overwhelmed by its potency that she fainted away; and thus he was
                     enabled to enter the forbidden ground, and obtain the interview he desired to
                     have with her fair charge.
                  But a truce with digressions! Let me resume the thread of my reminiscences, and
                     tell you of two other charitable establishments of peculiar interest, situated
                     in the same quarter of Paris with that for the Deaf and Dumb; these are the
                     "Hospital of the Quinze Vingts," and the "Royal Institution for the Young
                     Blind." The first was founded by St. Louis in 1220, and is exclusively
                     appropriated to the indigent blind, who are there taught various mechanical
                     arts and trades, and soon learn to gain their own subsistence instead of
                     depending for it on the community. The appellation of "Quinze Vingts," (fifteen
                     twenties,) is derived from the number of paupers originally admitted, but which
                     has since been allowed to be considerably augmented.
                  The Hospital for the young blind is, as its name imports, designated for the
                        young alone, and like the institution for the deaf and dumb,
                     receives ninety pupils, including boys and girls; like that too, it affords the
                     stranger an opportunity of witnessing an interesting examination at the close
                     of every month, and is open to the public several mornings during the week. The
                     course of instruction is also nearly the same, and the method of teaching,
                     though totally different, is equally ingenious.
                  The children are taught reading, cyphering and music by means of cards and
                     papers, stamped in a peculiar manner, expressly for their use. The
                     letters, figures and notes are rendered palpable to the touch by being printed
                     in relievo, that is, raised above the surface
                     of the card, or paper, and they learn them with facility and quickness by
                     passing their fingers to and fro upon the lines of the page.
                  
                  In writing, iron pens without slits are used. With these they distinctly trace
                     the letters upon soft, tough paper by bearing very hard upon the pen. To keep
                     their lines straight, and their letters equi-distant, the paper is arranged in
                     a very curious and ingenious machine contrived for the purpose; and as whatever
                     is thus written, must necessarily be read on the opposite side of the paper,
                     they preceed from right to left, like the Chinese in their
                     grotesque operations.
                  In printing, they are furnished with little boxes, each one
                     containing a liberal supply of a different letter of the alphabet, which they
                     easily select and arrange by feeling. When the types are set, a
                     moistened sheet of paper, or pasteboard, is laid upon them; and by the
                     operation of a press, or the repeated strokes of a hammer, the desired
                     impressions are permanently made. One of the pupils composed a comedy in verse,
                     and printed it for his companions to act, and they used often to perform it
                     with great zest and animation. Many of them evince considerable genius and a
                     decided talent for composition; but this fact will not surprise those who have
                     read the biography of Doctor Thomas Blacklock, a Scotch clergyman and poet,
                     professor of divinity in the college of Aberdeen, and that of Doctor Nicholas
                     Saunderson, professor of mathematics in Cambridge University, both of whom lost
                     their eyes by small pox while they were infants, and yet, in after life,
                     obtained such celebrity for their learning and acquirements. Then there was
                     Didymus of Alexandria, who flourished in the fourth century, and was the
                     preceptor of St. Jerome. He became blind in childhood, yet was deeply versed in
                     every branch of science, and so conversant in ecclesiastical history and
                     controversial theology, that he was chosen to fill the chair of the Alexandrian
                     school. He was pronounced the most learned man of the age, and was the author
                     of numerous valuable works.
                  It is an established theory, I believe, based upon the maxim of practice
                        making perfect, that by the loss of the sight, the
                     remaining senses are sharpened, being called into exercise to supply its place.
                     The touch, especially, being most employed, becomes so exquisitely
                     subtle that it has been playfully remarked, that many of the blind, although
                     deprived of their eyes, can see with their fingers; and I have read of a
                     sculptor who had not seen a ray of light for ten years, yet carved two marble
                     statues, with correctness and skill, from memory, produced a good
                     likeness of the persons he intended to represent. Be that as it may, we were
                     astonished at the extreme neatness and delicacy of a variety of mechanical
                     works executed by the blind inmates of the institutions we visited; even
                     clock-making was carried almost to perfection.
                  We were so fortunate as to call one morning when a singing class was in full
                     chorus, and thereby had the benefit of quite a melodious concert, for they sung
                     remarkably well, and we noticed, among the female voices, several which were
                     full, clear and sweet.
                  The class kept excellent time, guided by the tapping of a light wand upon a
                     music desk in front of the leader, who flourished it aloft with the many
                     gesticulations usual upon such squally occasions. We lingered
                     nearly a half an hour listening to his bevy of warblers, and amused too, at his
                     varied motions and emotions, if there chanced to tingle upon his
                     quickened ear the dismal sound, or semblance, of a false note.
                  The memory of the blind is singularly retentive; so much so, that some have been known to recognize
                     persons whom they had not met for years, merely by the tone of their voices.
                     Their entire separation from outward scenes, brightens and improves this
                     faculty as well as their mental perceptions.
                  The laughing philosopher, Democritus of Abdera, in Thrace, is said
                     to have voluntarily destroyed his bodily sight, in order that his
                        mental contemplation might be uninterrupted by exterior
                     objects. If he did, I think he proved himself more of a fool or
                     madman than a sage, and doubtless soon had cause to "laugh the wrong side
                        of his mouth," (as runs the old saying,) for making the silly
                     experiment.
                  To me no earthly evil or misfortune appears so great and awful as
                     total blindness! and I have been perfectly amazed to hear some persons aver
                     that they would choose being in that state, in preference to being deaf and
                     dumb, if compelled to suffer one or the other of these stupendous afflictions!
                     They adduce as a reason for this (to me) strange choice, that the blind appear
                     generally cheerful and gay, and the mutes sad and morose. They should consider
                     that when one sees the blind in company, or with a companion, it is beholding
                     them under the most favorable auspices. They may then be excited or enlivened
                     by those around them, and, for a while, thus made to forget their misery, or at
                     least to feel it less sensibly; whereas, it is at such periods that the mutes
                     experience most fully the unhappiness of their condition, so cruelly
                     incapacitating them for joining in the conversation and merriment of the
                     moment. The mute, 'tis true, can but seldom enjoy social intercourse, and is
                     dead to mortal voices and heavenly sounds, all of which are free to the blind;
                     but then, the latter, poor wretch! is shut out from God's most glorious light!
                     and the view of all the beauties, the sublimities, the wonders of nature!
               
               
                  NO. VIII.
                  THREE QUEER VILLAGES AND OTHER THINGS IN HOLLAND.
                  We were sojourning for a week in Amsterdam. The season, the fall of the year,
                     and the weather generally cold and misty—but one morning when it was clear and
                     exhiliarating, we proposed an excursion to the country, and after debating
                     whither we should wend our way, decided on visiting the villages of Berkeslow
                     and Broeck, and set out accordingly.
                  Crossing the water in a row boat and landing at the toll-house, we thence
                     proceeded on foot to Berkeslow. The houses which constitute this little village
                     are painted of divers colors—blue, red, pink, green, yellow, brown and lilac!
                     and a few are painted black—thus varying from one extreme to another, that is,
                     from being of all colors, becoming of no color at all. The general
                     appearance of the place reminded us of Burlington, in New Jersey.
                  We passed en route the grand canal of Holland, which unites the river Wye with
                     the Zuider Zee, and was cut for the purpose of allowing vessels of the largest
                     size to reach Amsterdam without discharging a portion of their cargoes, which
                     they were formerly obliged to do, in order to get over a bar. This canal is
                     said to be the largest in the world, and is indeed a stupendous work! We
                     witnessed the passage of a vessel of considerable magnitude tude, and were told that a short while previous,
                     a man of war, mounting 120 guns, had been carried through the enormous locks
                     with ease and safety.
                  At Berkeslow, we endeavored to procure a boat or a carriage, to convey us to
                     Broeck, but failed in each attempt; so nothing daunted, though much
                     disappointed and somewhat fatigued, we even determined to continue our journey
                     on foot rather than turn back, and a rough and a tough time we had of it!
                  Broeck is several miles from Amsterdam, but alas! for us, we made a mistake in
                     the road and thereby nearly doubled the distance. The path lay over an
                     unfinished causeway, composed of loose stones; these hurt our feet; then the
                     wind rose, and assailed our bonnets and faces with the usual blustering
                     rudeness of Old Boreas and his attendant guests from the North sea. Yet on, on
                     we trudged, with a patience and perseverance quite equal to those of the
                     phlegmatic race through whose country we were thus toiling. At length we
                     attained the object of our labors, and quickly discerned that it was well worth
                     the difficulties we had surmounted in getting to it. Such a peculiar, such a
                     queer kind of a town or village! we never had beheld in the course of our
                     peregrinations, either in Europe or America, and it is surprising that no
                     description of it has been given in any of the various narratives of travellers
                     through Holland which I have read. Indeed we should not have known
                     of its existence and proximity to Amsterdam, but for the loquacity of our
                     "maitre d' hotel," who was what "Mrs. Malaprop" would have designated as a good
                     natured and talkative "sort of a person." She told us, besides, of
                     many other things deserving the attention of "lookers on in Holland."
                  Broeck is remarkable (even in Holland, where every place is neat)
                     for its perfect neatness and tranquility. No drawing room could be more
                     exquisitely clean than its nicely paved alleys, for I cannot term them streets,
                     they are so very, very narrow! They are not more than four or five feet wide, I
                     should think, with the exception of the main street, which is tolerably
                     spacious, and like the others, paved with glazed and shining tiles, daily
                     sprinkled with sand—probably for two purposes, to prevent one from slipping,
                     and for the sake of tidiness. Not a vehicle of any kind is suffered to be
                     brought into the town, nor an animal permitted to enter it, unless some of the
                     feathered tribe may chance to alight there in the course of an ærial
                     excursion.
                  In one of the streets, we observed a small flock of crows, pecking about quite
                     as much at their ease as if in a wilderness, nor did they evince the least fear
                     or concern at our passing very near them; yet they were not domesticated, and
                     had alighted merely for a short time, for in less than half an hour they were
                     again on the wing towards some other spot.
                  The houses of Broeck, like the houses of Berkeslow, are of many colors, and
                     each one has a certain door next the street, which is never opened, except on
                     the occurrence of a wedding or a funeral in the family. At all other times the
                     entrance is through the back doors of the dwellings; and by these may be seen,
                     whenever there has been a fall of rain or snow, a pair or pairs of wooden
                     slippers, intended for the use of all comers, who, to avoid soiling the floors
                     within, put off their wet shoes and leave them without, and in place of them,
                     wear the sabots. They are never in much
                     demand, for there is little sociability ity or visiting among the people of the place.
                     We were told that they rarely left their homes, even in fine weather; and in
                     our ramble through the village, we did not encounter more than ten or twelve
                     persons. Near the centre of the town was a pretty lake, upon the borders of
                     which, several storks were feeding. These birds are held in veneration in
                     Holland, as well as in Germany; it is deemed sacrilegious to kill them, and
                     considered a favorable omen by the supersitious, if they take up their quarters
                     in the chimney, or on the roof of a house. One cause of their being so valued
                     and preserved is, that they destroy venomous insects and reptiles, and the eggs
                     of serpents. Their usual resort is the stable yard.
                  We visited a beautiful garden, the property of a wealthy "Mynheer," named
                     Bakker. Besides flowers and shrubs, trees and rivulets, statues and miniature
                     bridges, a pigeon and summer house, a la
                        Chinoise, and a green house teeming with geraniums in full
                     blossom, it contained a rustic cottage, which was quite a curiosity, not merely
                     from its completeness without, but for its contents. It was a picturesque
                     thing, with a low, thatched roof, and a single apartment, furnished in the
                     usual style of such dwellings. In it, three automatons, or wooden figures, were
                     seated on rush bottom chairs—an old woman with a spinning wheel before her, an
                     old man holding a reel, and a sportsman with a gun. Each was painted, dressed
                     and arrayed so naturally, and was so life-like in appearance, that on seeing
                     them unexpectedly, we involuntarily started, and believed for a moment, that we
                     had intruded upon the domestic privacy of a living group. Scarcely had we
                     recovered from this surprise, when another was given us——whilst we were busily
                     examining the automatons, our cicerone, who was the gardener of the earthly
                     paradise we had been perambulating, slipped unperceived by us into a closet in
                     the rear of the cottage, and put in motion a small wheel connected with the
                     wooden figures by a spring ingeniously contrived and concealed. No sooner was
                     this spring touched, than the old crone began to spin with all her might, and
                     the old man, with equal energy, to wind his reel, and puff smoke from a pipe he
                     held in his mouth. Where the smoke came from, and how it was produced, Heaven
                        knows!—we did not discover—but cheerily it curled away. The
                     sportsman was the only inactive one of the company; perhaps he was too tired
                     after a hunting excursion to move—for as we found him, so we left
                     him—listlessly resting upon his gun. Around the cottage was a bright array of
                     pewter plates and dishes, and some copper kettles and pans. You could almost
                     see your face in their polished sides and surfaces; and the shelves upon which
                     they stood were as clean and white as deal boards could be scoured. By the bye,
                     I have omitted, in speaking of the automatons above, to mention the most
                     ingenious and wonderful thing in their construction, viz: that their heads and
                     eyes moved, and it was really diverting to observe their motions and
                     glances.
                  On the way back to Amsterdam, we stopped at several farm houses, to see the
                     arrangement of the cow stables, which had been represented as remarkably neat
                     and clean, and verily there was no exaggeration in the account. A description
                     of one may suffice for all, as they were very similar in every respect: a long
                     low building was divided on one side into fifteen or twenty stalls, in each
                     stall was an open window, above a trough filled with hay or other food. Each
                     cow was haltered and fastened to a post, and so thoroughly curried and rubbed, that her skin
                     was sleek and shining; and we remarked, that with few exceptions, all the cows
                     we saw were black and spotted with white. When the cold is severe, a woolen
                     cover is girted on, to keep them warm. The floors of the stalls were planked,
                     and there were pipes for conveying the water and cleansing them several times a
                     day. On the side of the building opposite the stalls, was a range of doors
                     communicating with the various apartments of the family, and with the dairy,
                     than which nothing could be more complete. Its capacious basins of cream and
                     milk, and pots of golden-hued butter, were tempting to behold! The main passage
                     of the house, and I believe the only one, was this space between
                     the stalls and doors described, but it was not in the least disagreeable—such
                     perfect cleanliness and order prevailed throughout the whole establishment.
                  On these farms large quantities of excellent butter and cheese are made, the
                     sale of which contributes mainly to the support of their thrifty owners.
                  Much to our comfort and satisfaction, we succeeded in obtaining a boat, after
                     leaving Broeck. This was pulled along by a man upon the shore, and as it glided
                     upon the surface of the canal, we were quite astonished at the immense numbers
                     of wild geese, which clamored above and sometimes even fluttered around us. We
                     were also struck with the grotesque costume of the country women who passed us.
                     Some of them wore full plaited chintz petticoats and short gowns with tight
                     sleeves, round and flat crowned caps, with stiff fluted borders to garnish the
                     face, but not so much over it as to conceal a large and heavy pair of gold
                     earrings. Several, who seemed of a higher grade than the ordinary class, had
                     their foreheads decorated with gold or gilt bandeaus, set with brilliant
                     stones, and secured to their caps by a clasp on each side of the head. The
                     women of Holland, like those of Germany, (I allude to the lower classes,) are
                     great drudges. We met one driving a cart loaded with cheeses, and two others
                     toiling with a wheelbarrow quite overstocked with vegetables of divers kinds;
                     one pushed it along, while her companion dragged it by a rope attached to the
                     back of it; but it seemed very hard work, and they made slow progress.
                  We reached Amsterdam at sun-set, and, on approaching the town, a sound of
                     music, as it were from the clouds, saluted our ears; the clocks were chiming a
                     tune, as all the clocks of Holland do, before they strike the hour. On the way
                     to our lodgings we saw two men clad in deep mourning surtout-coats, with
                     streamers of black cloth, bound with black satin ribbon, fastened to their
                     backs; they wore cocked hats with flowing crape bands, and their shoes were
                     adorned with enormous silver buckles; their appearance was so strange that we
                     could not help enquiring of a passenger in the street, what was their vocation,
                     and were informed they were bearers of funeral invitations. A few days
                     afterwards we had an opportunity of witnessing a funeral, and a heartless scene
                     it was! Four men thus equiped, "in mockery of wo," one might truly say, walked
                     after the hearse, in company with eight others in mourning; but no sooner was
                     the coffin deposited in the grave, than all of them jumped into the hearse and
                     rode off as rapidly and merrily as if on a party of pleasure. The remaining
                     persons, who formed the procession, quitted the cemetery with almost as much
                     levity; there were only a few females present, and they, like myself, stood
                     aloof, and were merely spectators.
                     The coffin and hearse were peculiarly shaped and decorated; the first was
                     perfectly flat on the top, and widened gradually from the foot to the head.
                     There were three coffins in one grave, placed one above another! A by-stander
                     told us, that after a certain period, allowed for the decomposition of the
                     body, the bones of the dead were taken up from the earth and deposited in a
                     room over a church; and when that was full, the bones were removed
                     to a ship, kept for the purpose, and carried out to sea! The hearse resembled a
                     flat-sided narrow coach; it was surmounted with a ghastly escutcheon,
                     consisting of a sculptured death's head and cross-bones, entwined with laurel
                     leaves; over the door, behind, was a large hour-glass, between a pair of
                     death's wings. The driver was clad in black, and wore, what seemed to me, the
                     usual badge of menial public office in Holland, a
                        cocked-hat. The horses were black, and covered with palls that
                     almost touched the ground.
                  Our next aquatic excursion, from Amsterdam, was to the village of Saardam,
                     famed for ship-building and wind-mills, of which a goodly number were whirling
                     away as briskly, when we arrived, as in the days of the pilgrimage and
                     peregrinations of the knight of La Mancha and his pursy squire.
                  The weather was cold and misty, but we were snugly wafted on a small steamer,
                     that plied daily between Amsterdam and the little haven we sought. The
                     inhabitants of Saardam are said to have boasted, that if given only two months
                     notice, they could build a ship for every week in the year—fifty-two ships in
                     twelve months! What a task!! But it was neither their ships nor their
                     wind-mills that allured us to their village, but a simple rude
                        hut, a venerable relic of departed greatness—in plainer terms, it was
                     the hut in which the Czar of Russia, Peter the Great, resided, during two
                     years, for the purpose of studying and practising the art of ship-building; to
                     which he was prompted by his unquenchable thirst for universal knowledge. Here
                     in disguise, and under the assumed name of Michaelhoff, he sedulously labored,
                     with common workmen, until he had acquired the information and skill he desired
                     to possess. I am no friend to despots, however dazzling and fascinating their
                     mental qualities and attainments may be; and my recollection of some
                     occurrences and traits, mentioned in the annals of the renowned Czar, as I
                     stood within his lowly habitation, were not by any means of a pleasing nature.
                     I thought of his furious and ungovernable fits of passion—the cruel punishments
                     he caused to be inflicted, and sometimes even assisted at personally!—of his
                     unkind treatment and unjust repudiation of his first wife, Eudocia
                     Feodoreuna—his indifference and harshness to their only son, the unfortunate
                     Alexis Petrowitch, who, though a man of intemperate and vicious habits, was
                     still his child, and, perhaps, had acquired those very habits in
                     consequence of his father's shameful neglect of his education; but, above all,
                     I thought of the dark deep stain, impressed upon the Czar's character, by the
                     suspicious and mysterious death of that same ill-fated son, and my admiration
                     of the abilities and brilliant achievements of the Emperor was almost lost in
                     the remembrance of his brutality and tyranical sway.
                  A lofty shed, covered with flaming red tiles and resting upon open arches, is
                     erected over the hut, to shield it from storm and sun. Within are two small
                     rooms; that on the left hand was the Czar's work-shop; that on the right,
                     through which you enter, was his chamber, and, they assure you, contains the
                     identical articles of furniture he used, viz: three triangular chairs, painted ash-colour; a
                     long oaken table and a cupboard. In the closet is shewn a very broad, low
                     shelf, upon which he laid his bed. The hearth and chimney were extremely wide,
                     the former paved with immense square bricks, and each side of the fire-place
                     was covered with glazed white tiles, adorned with pictures, done in brown, such
                     as I have often seen in old-fashioned houses in New-York. Over the mantelpiece
                     were two inscriptions, upon marble slabs, inserted into the wall. Upon one were
                     engraved the names of "Peter Magno," "Alexander,"—and we were told that the
                     Emperor Alexander put it there, with his own hands, after the battle of
                     Waterloo; but it is not probable that he took that trouble, when masons were so
                     near and numerous. The second inscription was placed there by order of
                     government, and was very long. In 1825, an inundation overspread the floor of
                     the hut to the depth of several feet, but subsided without doing any
                     injury.
                  Before leaving Saardam, we visited a collection of landscapes, figures, birds,
                     flowers and animals, cut out of white paper, and so inimitably executed, that
                     they resemble beautiful reliefs in marble; and in a neighbouring church, we saw
                     a curious picture, representing a ferocious bull which had killed a man and a
                     woman. The picture hung over their tombs.
                  In the same church was a singular pulpit, supported by a pelican, feeding its
                     young with the blood from its breast; meant, I suppose, to be emblematical of
                     the blood of the Redeemer, shed for us.
                  We returned to Amsterdam in rain and snow, both falling at the same time; thus
                     ended our day's adventures, and thus ends my narration for the present.
               
               
                  NUMBER IX.
                  A SOJOURN AT GHENT.
                  * * * * * No, my promise is not forgotten, and if you will rest
                     with me under the shade of this wide-spreading tree, which brings to mind the
                     famous elm at Worms, I will comply with your desire, and continue my
                     reminiscences, happy to know that they afford you amusement.
                  We were, last evening, admiring a fine engraving of Ghent, and now I will tell
                     you about some remarkable things we saw there. We remained only a few days, but
                     they were rendered very agreeable by the kindness and hospitality of the Duke
                     and Dutchess of Saxweimar, who reside in the city, he being commandant of
                     it.
                  You may remember our becoming acquainted with him at Albany and Lebanon, in the
                     state of New York, where he joined our party in an excursion to the Shaker
                     village—his afterwards visiting us here in Richmond, and being, that same
                     summer, one of our fellow-passengers in the voyage to Liverpool? Well, when he
                     met us accidentally, two years afterwards, in a church at Ghent, he greeted us
                     most cordially, introduced us to his family and entertained us most hospitably
                     at his palace; where we dined in company with several intelligent and
                     distinguished foreigners, like ourselves, invited guests.
                  The Duke, as you know him personally, it is needless to describe to you,
                     farther than, that he was as gay and agreeable at home as we found him abroad,
                     and quite as humorous and full of anecdote. The Dutchess, who is sister to the
                        present Queen Dowager of England,
                     was a tall, dignified, gentle-mannered woman, as quiet as his Grace was lively.
                     In the evening their three carriages were drawn up in front of the palace, to
                     convey those, who choose to go, to the theatre, to hear Madame Mondonville
                     sing. She was there considered a great vocalist; but we did not
                     think her comparable to Mademoiselle Sontag, whom we had heard, a few months
                     previous, in Paris. Guillon, and his pupil Dorus, accompanied her on the
                     flute.
                  The theatre of Ghent is neither large nor handsome, but we were struck with the
                     peculiar appropriateness of the decoration of the first and second tier of
                     boxes. On the pannels of the first, the best scenes, from the chief works of
                     various Dramatists, were painted; and above these, on the pannels of the second
                     tier, busts, painted in relief, represented the authors
                     themselves.
                  Now, all this is but a preamble—the things I am to describe to you, as being
                     remarkable, are as follows: and, as chief, I will begin with the Beguinage, an
                     establishment of religious females; whose number, at the period of our visit,
                     amounted to seven hundred. They resided in a collection of small houses, built
                     within the same enclosure, and dedicated to different Saints, the name of each
                     Saint being inscribed, in large letters, on each front door. In the midst of
                     this little town (so one may call it) stands the church; this bears the name of
                     Saint Elizabeth, who is considered the Patroness of the Beguines,
                     as the members of this extraordinary sisterhood are termed. Nuns,
                     they cannot be styled, for they take no vows, and are at liberty to return to
                     the world, and society, whenever they choose, and even to marry!
                  Only single women are ever received as members, and none need apply who cannot
                     pay a stipulated sum, and produce a certificate of her respectability and
                     worthiness. Each lives upon her own resources, and if unable to hire a servant,
                     must cook and wash for herself. There were, generally, three or four residing
                     in the same dwelling; some, however, who were more fortunate in possessing a
                     larger portion of this world's goods, kept their own domicil. The sisterhood is
                     divided into companies, and every company is under the charge of a directress,
                     and a superior reigns over all. They had a flourishing school for
                     poor children—taught them to read and make lace, and the work was sold for the
                     benefit of the little pupils and their parents. Some of the children were not
                     more than six years old, and it was quite astonishing to witness their
                     dexterity and rapidity, in moving the pins and weaving the meshes of the
                     lace.
                  At night we went to see the Beguines at vespers, and a solemn sight it was.
                     They were clad in long white veils; and in the dim light of their cathedral,
                     which was furnished with only a few scattered lamps, they resembled kneeling
                     spectres. For a considerable time the effect was kept up, by their remaining
                     perfectly motionless. They were a cheerful, lively set, in the morning, while
                     engaged at their various employments; but in the evening, a more demure and
                     sanctified collection of faces you never beheld!
                  This gave me a favorable opinion of them, for I like to see Christians gay and
                     cheerful at all times, unless they are under the rod of affliction; and while
                     at their devotions, in public or private, when they cannot be too serious and
                     contemplative.
                  The next remarkable thing I remember seeing, was the funeral of a youth of
                     fifteen, who was a pupil in the Royal College of Ghent, and was so much beloved
                     by his companions panions that they
                     would not suffer his corpse to be carried in a hearse, but bore it to the grave
                     on their shoulders while the hearse followed empty. They wore black crape bands
                     on their arms, and were preceded by a boy decorated with a broad orange
                     coloured ribbon, from which was suspended several medals, which the deceased
                     had gained in contests for literary honors. The coffin was covered with a white
                     silk pall, richly embroidered, andon the top of that stood a basket, made of
                     silver bullion, and filled with artifical flowers.
                  We loitered on the pavement till the mournful procession had passed, and was
                     lost to our view in turning the corner of a street. A previous engagement
                     prevented our witnessing the ceremony of consigning the body to the tomb, which
                     we regretted, as it would have been an interesting as well as solemn scene; and
                     you know my predilection for whatever kindles deep and sacred feelings.
                  In the course of our rambles, next morning, we entered the Town Hall; and
                     there, collected in a spacious room, we saw more than a dozen babies, in the
                     arms of as many nurses. On asking the cause of this marvellous infantine
                     assemblage, we were informed the children were brought there to be baptised;
                     that the laws of the country enacted, that as soon as a child was born, the
                     father, accompanied by two witnesses, should go to the chief magistrate and
                     give him notice of the birth and sex of the child, (which are immediately
                     recorded,) and that afterwards, when old enough, it was usually taken to the
                     same place to be christened.
                  Near this room was another, called the "Hall of Marriage," in which the
                     votaries of Hymen were united, for better or for worse, by the civil
                     magistrate. I can't say anything in favor of either of these customs. I think
                     baptism and marriage are rites too sacred and solemn, to be performed by any
                     other than a minister of religion.
                  By the bye, talking of children, reminds me that we saw a tomb in
                     the church of St. Nicholas, at Ghent, which was erected over a man and his
                     wife, who had thirty-one! and lost them all in a
                        month!! So said the inscription upon the stone. I do not believe
                     it!
                  In the cathedral, we were astonished at the singularity of design, and the
                     beautiful carving of the pulpit. It was of wood, richly sculptured, and
                     ornamented with marble bas reliefs. The top or ceiling was supported by the
                     branches of two trees, filled with leaves and golden apples, one of which a
                     serpent (alias his Satanic Majesty in that shape) held in his mouth, while his
                     scaly length entwined the trunk of the tree. At the foot of the steps, leading
                     up to the pulpit, stood two angels, the size of life, and made of white marble,
                     pointing to the reptile. Under the pulpit (which was of antique form, and
                     rested on a stand or stem) were the figures of Time and Truth; the latter
                     grasped an open book. A curtain, admirably carved and of wood,
                     enveloped the top of the pulpit, and was raised in front by two little
                     angels—also of white marble—bearing a golden cross.
                  The baptismal font was almost as singular as the pulpit, and consisted of an
                     azure and star spangled globe, resting on angels amid clouds of white marble.
                     The cover was decorated with a silver cloud, a golden cross and serpent. It was
                     said to be the identical font that was used at the christening of the Emperor
                     Charles the Fifth, who you know was born in the city.
                  We descended into the subterranean portion of the cathedral, to see the tomb of
                     the last Bishop of Ghent. It was
                     composed of a material called "pierre de touche," (touch stone) by which the
                     purity of gold was tested; if unadulterated, it left a mark. I
                     entirely forget whether we experimented on the occasion; I rather
                     think 
                        w
                        we
                     
                     did, although, at this distant period of time, I cannot determine;
                     but one thing is sure, the result has made no impression on our
                        minds if the gold did upon the stone.
                  
                  The cathedral is rich in marble columns, monuments, statues and paintings.
                     Among the pictures is the "paschal lamb," by Van Eyck, sometimes styled "John
                     of Bruges," whence he came. He is reputed to be the inventor of the art of
                     mixing colors with oil.
                  We visited a convent of the order of "La Visitation," where bobinet was
                     embroidered. It was done by poor orphans whom the nuns took under their
                     protection until twenty-four years of age, when, having by that time learnt the
                     trade, they were sent forth into the world to support themselves, by their own
                     skill and industry.
                  We saw them busily plying their needles, and observed, with surprise, that the
                     most intricate and difficult patterns were imitated without paper or marks to
                     assist them; the meshes served as guides. We were desirous to have witnessed
                     the manufacturing of lace, but had encountered such delay and trouble ere we
                     obtained admission to the bobinet establishment, that we resolved not to
                     attempt an inspection of a lace one. The Abbess was old, morose, and so
                     disobliging, that she would not have let us in, had it not been for an order
                     from the Vicar General, an aged and affable priest, who treated us with much
                     suavity and kindness; we also found "sister Anne," a young nun who went about
                     with us as cicerone, very amiable and communicative; she was very lively too,
                     and carried us into a parlour to shew us some pictures and a piano: "Here, she
                     said, we amuse ourselves with dancing quadrilles every evening, and the
                        novices play the part of gentlemen." On expressing
                     my amazement that dancing, generally one of the
                        bug-bears of religious communities, should be allowed in the
                     convent, she replied that they there considered it not only an innocent, but a
                     rational amusement, and a great contributor to health: "If we were to mingle
                     with the world, and spend money and time in dressing up ourselves for the sake
                     of dancing, we should view it very differently; but here there is no such
                     desire or inducement, and we dance merely for the pleasure of the music and the
                     benefit of the exercise." A sage process of reasoning! thought I, and we came
                     away well pleased with "sister Anne" and her argument.
                  In the commencement of our conversation, beneath this "lord of the forest," I
                     alluded to the great elm at Worms, which it somewhat resembles; and before
                     leaving our umbrageous retreat I will mention a tradition concerning it, that
                     is firmly believed by the people of its neighborhood, in fact by most of the
                     ermans; it is rather incredible, I confess, but you shall hear it
                     nevertheless: it is said to have been planted by the Reformer himself, during
                     the sitting of the Diet at Worms in 1521, when he appeared before Charles the
                     Fifth, and so eloquently disputed with the Pope's nuncio, on the subject of the
                     new faith, then just shedding a glimmering light over the Christianized
                     world.
                  One morning Luther was warmly maintaining the truth of his doctrine, while
                     accompanying some members to the Diet: As they walked along, he, twirling round
                     a small switch he had picked up, suddenly stopped, and thrusting it into the ground, exclaimed with great
                     fervour: "If this twig should live and grow, then is my doctrine sound and
                     true; if it should perish, then am I deceived and in error, and I solemnly
                     invoke the aid of Heaven thus to prove, whether my faith be right or
                     wrong!"
                  The next day, on passing the same spot, lo! the little branch had taken root
                     and budded!! Such a miracle, you may suppose, soon converted many persons to
                     the Lutheran belief.
                  And, now, let us wend our way homewards, for a storm seems brooding in the sky,
                     and my reminiscences have come to a close for the present; some future time,
                     perhaps, I may resume them.

                  A SKETCH FROM NATURE.
                  Near Richmond, Virginia, on the banks of James River, that great and rapid
                     artery of the "Old Dominion," stands Powhatan, a beautiful time-honored
                     mansion, the hereditary seat of the Mayo family. The spot is peculiarly
                     interesting, as being the site once occupied by the Indian chief whose name it
                     bears, and the abode of his gentle daughter, Pocahontas.
                  Traditionary lore informs us, (and who would wish to doubt?) that it was the
                     scene of her romantic attachment, and interposition for her ungrateful lover,
                     Captain Smith. The very stone upon which his head was laid for decapitation,
                     when, like a guardian spirit, she appeared and rescued him from the death-blow,
                     is pointed out in the garden, while a more massive rock in the house yard is
                     designated as the simple and unlettered sepulchre of her relenting father.
                  Around this rock a few young cedars are planted, and on its smooth grey
                     surface, the impressions of two feet may be traced; faint indeed, but still
                     there they are, evidently the print of a child's and a man's foot; when,
                        how, or by whom engraven, none living can tell. On a
                     neighbouring height, o'er towering the river, is the Mayo Cemetery, where
                        venerable erable cedars, and
                     other trees of yore, shelter some antique granite tombs and several white
                     marble monuments of modern date, which, though less interesting to
                     a disciple of "Monk Barns," are more precious to individuals of the present
                     generation. Besides these sacred memorials, there are many stoneless, turfy
                     hillocks, whose long grass, waving in the summer gale, whispers to the heart
                     the names—the unchiselled, yet unforgotten, cherished names—of dear ones
                     reposing below.
                  'Tis a sweet and tranquilizing spot; and often at the close of day, my fancy
                     loiters over its beauties and melancholly attractions, for within its solemn
                     precincts lie buried my own Dead! Thus sadly musing one evening,
                     busy thoughts wove themselves into the following stanzas: 
                        
                           In twilight's musing, mystic hour,
                           Visions of the past come o'er me,
                           And Mem'ry, with her thrilling power,
                           Brings the loved and lost before me.
                        
                        
                           Those who now in graves lie sleeping,
                           Near Powhatan's*
                               fast flowing tide,
                           Around whose death-couch we stood weeping'
                           When they look'd farewell! and died!
                        
                        
                           
                           *The Indian appellation and ancient name of James' River.
                        
                        
                           Oh! whose tombs the light is gleaming
                           Through each tall dark cedar's crest,
                           And the slanting sun-rays streaming
                           Athwart their mournful place of rest.
                        
                        
                           In the dim hour they appear!
                           I trace their features! hear them speak!
                           'Tis but a dream—they are not here—
                           And tears bedew my burning cheek.
                        
                        
                           From Earth they are forever gone!
                           Forever from our home land riven!
                           They left us lonely—one by one—
                           Called to a brighter home in Heaven.
                        
                        
                           Death, ruthless, broke the cords of love,
                           Which sweetly bound our hearts together;
                           Removed the idols of our grove,
                           And doomed the flowers of Hope to wither.
                        
                        
                           Some left us in their strength and bloom—
                           O'er their young forms the dirge we sung;
                           Grief-struck, we bore them to the tomb,
                           And laid them there, our sires among.
                        
                        
                           And some departed ripe in years,
                           Whose annals, like a moral page,
                           Instruct us to resist Earth's snares,
                           And emulate a virtuous age.
                        
                        
                           Be not the precious record slighted,
                           But studied as the ev'ning star,
                           When to the 'wilder'd and benighted
                           It shines a guide to homes afar.
                        
                        
                           Then will it prove to us a mine
                           Of golden thoughts and precepts pure;
                           Teach us to sue for faith divine,
                           Life's bitter trials to endure.
                        
                        
                           Lead us to seek God's holy fane—
                           To kindle, at his altar there,
                           Devotion's sacred, Heaven-born flame,
                           The life-breath of the Christian's prayer.
                        
                        
                           The flame which lights our way to bliss,
                           And constant burns in densest gloom,
                           Infuses strength the rod to kiss,
                           
                           And makes each thorn a flow'ret bloom.
                        
                        
                           Thus our Loved of the "spirit land"
                           Still shall speak, from their blest abode,

                  OBITUARY STANZAS, ON THE DEATH OF A BELOVED CHILD.
                  
                     Oh! where is she whose eyes' dark blue,
                     And glossy, raven hair,
                     And lips and cheeks of rosy hue,
                     And brow benign and fair,
                  
                  
                     Were render'd lovely by a heart
                     Where every virtue glow'd,
                     And by a mind where Heav'n and Art
                     Rare bounties had bestowed?
                  
                  
                     Alas! she is no longer here—
                     She was too good, too pure!
                     To linger on this earthly sphere,
                     Where sin and grief endure.
                  
                  
                     Reader! she was her parents' pride—
                     Their source of hope and pleasure!
                     Now, both are to their hearts denied—
                     Now, gone! their richest treasure!
                  
                  
                     Oh! 'tis as if a meteor bright,
                     With quick and sudden gleam,
                     Had crossed their path, and made Life's night
                     More dark and dreary seem!
                  
                  
                     
                        So good, so lovely, and so dear!
                     At eight years old to die!
                     The awful stroke is hard to bear,
                     Though sent by Him on high.
                  
                  
                     Nor can we ever "kiss the rod,"
                     Or say, "Thy will be done!"
                     Unaided by Almighty God,
                     
                     His Spirit and his Son.
                     
                  
                  
                     Then let our prayers ascend to Heaven,
                     This blessing to implore—
                     That strength may to our souls be given,
                     Whilst weeping, to adore!
                     
                  
               
               
                  Lines on the Death of a Beloved Niece,
                  MARIA MAYO SCOTT, WHO DIED AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN.
                  
                     Chant the requiem for the dead!
                     The beautiful and young;
                     For her whose spirit pure has fled
                     To realms from whence it sprung.
                  
                  
                     Tell of the virtues she possessed,
                     Who on the bier lies low,
                     With cold, clasp'd hands upon that breast
                     Which ever felt for woe.
                  
                  
                     Sooth ye her parents' dire dispair,
                     To such bereavement doomed;
                     Then chant the requiem as ye bear
                     Their loved one to the tomb.
                  
                  
                     Oh! she was beauteous as the rose,
                     And joyous as the doe
                     That lightly bounds o'er Alpine snows,
                     Beneath the bright sun's glow.
                  
                  
                     Pure she was as a chrystal rill,
                     Within its banks of flowers;
                     Sweet as the fragrance they distil
                     Around the richest bowers.
                  
                  
                     Ah! gently lay her in the grave,
                     With solemn rite and prayer;
                     
                        He who has ta'en is He who gave—
                     Murmur we may not dare.
                  
                  
                     Then chant the requiem for the dead,
                     The beautiful and young;
                     To Heaven her sainted soul has fled,
                     The realm from whence it sprung.
                  
               
               
                  
                  TWILIGHT.
                  
                     Sacred to me the twilight hour—
                     
                        Then Memory, with magic power,
                     Recalls her look—her voice—
                     And Fancy soars with rapid flight
                     From Earth to Heav'n, where seraphs bright
                     Around God's throne rejoice.
                  
                  
                     Among those seraphs sees she one,
                     Whose beaming eye and radiant zone
                     Seem brighter than the rest;
                     It beckons! speaks!—"Dear mother, see!
                     Behold how in Eternity
                     
                     Thy favour'd child is blest!
                  
                  
                     Here all is holy, pure and fair—
                     Here enters, never, sin nor care;
                     But love and joy prevail:
                     Our Father's wond'rous works to scan—
                     To praise Him for redeeming man,
                     And each new spirit hail,
                  
                  
                     Form our delights, and may be thine,
                     My mother! if thou wilt resign
                     Thyself to His decree:
                     Unmurmuring, run thy mortal race—
                     Trust, love, obey, and through His grace
                     Thou soon shalt be with me!"
                  
                  
                     My God, let not the call be vain!
                     Help me each murmur to restrain,
                     And grant me faith and love:
                     Oh! ever bend me to thy will,
                     Whate'er it send—be it suffering still,
                     Or blessing from above!
                  
               
               
                  THE MANIAC.
                  
                     Fate sheds o'er me her deepest gloom—
                     A miserable wretch am I!
                     Blacker than shades of night my doom—
                     Would I could lay me down and die!
                  
                  
                     What fearful memories o'er me steal!
                     How wearily wears the passing day!
                     In vain to Heav'n each sad appeal,
                     Though hourly for relief I pray.
                  
                  
                     Lingering thus on Life's bleak shore,
                     While waves of sorrow round me roll;
                     Wreck'd hopes my flowing tears deplore,
                     And fell Dispair weighs down my soul.
                  
                  
                     Yes—thou art mine, and I am thine,
                     Thou vulture of the human heart!
                     Beneath thy ravages I pine—
                     Where'er I turn, dread power! thou art.
                  
               
               
                  THE HARP OF THE DEPARTED!
                  
                     Strike not that harp! Alas! how could I bear
                     Again its mellow, dulcet sound to hear?
                     When ev'ry note of those silvery cords,
                     With eloquence keener than piercing words,
                     Would tell of the past, and the lovely Dead,
                     And of hopes that died when her spirit fled?
                  
                  
                     Ah, touch it not! to me each thrilling tone
                     Would sound more plaintive than the ring-dove's moan;
                     Would seem that voice beloved, now hushed in death!
                     
                        The voice that was sweet as a zephyr's breath
                     When it comes perfumed with odors of flowers,
                     The richest exhaled from the loveliest bowers.
                  
                  
                     Strike not the harp! My very soul would weep,
                     As o'er its chords thy snowy fingers sweep.
                     Oh, be it ever thus!—untouched, unstrung!
                     
                     And on its treasured frame, pale wreaths be hung—
                     Emblems of her, whose bright and early bloom
                     So soon has wither'd in the cold, cold tomb!
                  
               
               
                  
                  LINES IN MEMORY OF THE LATE MRS. HENINGHAM H. LYONS, OF RICHMOND, VA.
                  
                     I knew thee in our girlhood, when life was fresh and fair—
                     Our hopes as bright as morning's light,
                     Our hearts devoid of care.
                  
                  
                     And well do I remember the merry, happy hours,
                     We spent in play each holiday
                     'Midst singing birds and flowers.
                  
                  
                     How often, with dear school-mates, such pleasant walks we took,
                     In youthful ranks, along the banks
                     Of our canal and brook.
                  
                  
                     In those days, those happy days, how bright thy cheeks did
                        glow,
                     With rosy health, the richest wealth
                     Kind nature can bestow.
                  
                  
                     Thy hair was of a golden hue, bewitching was thine eye,
                     And Cupid's wile seemed in thy smile,
                     And fragrance in thy sigh.
                  
                  
                     And well do I remember, how in the sprightly dance,
                     Thy winsome grace and beaming face
                     Would rivet many a glance.
                  
                  
                     In after years of womanhood, we greeted thee a bride;
                     Beneath the sun, no lovelier one,
                     E'er stood by bridegroom's side!
                  
                  
                     Time glided on with silken wing—we saw thee a fond mother;
                     A beauteous race thy home did grace,
                     Each rivalling the other.
                  
                  
                     On, on sped Time—then sickness came—then death!—Thou past from earth!
                     Ah, many a tear upon thy bier
                     From weeping eyes gushed forth!
                  
                  
                     Yes, friend beloved and cherished! we've looked upon thee dead!
                     In shroud arrayed—on death-couch laid—
                     Then borne to earth's cold bed!
                  
                  
                     And there, within the open grave, we heard the thrilling sound
                     Of the clods that slid on thy coffin's lid,
                     When the spade was passed around
                  
                  
                     By those among thy funeral train who joined in the sad rite,
                     And piled that heap, above thy sleep,
                     Which hides thee from our sight.
                  
                  
                     'Tis true our grief is selfish, for we know that thou art blest
                     In Heaven above, where all is love,
                     And the weary soul finds rest.
                  
                  
                     Yet tears will fall like rain-drops, when mem'ry turns to
                        thee,
                     And fondly traces scenes and places
                     Were thou wert wont to be:
                  
                  
                     Then paints the gentle virtues which so adorned thy life,
                     Gracing each sphere, filled by thee here,
                     Of sister, mother, wife.
                  
                  
                     Farewell, farewell, sweet spirit! our guardian angel be;
                     Pray for us! Pray! Guide us on the way
                     That leads to Heaven and thee.
                  
               
               
                  
                  THE MOTHER'S LAMENT.
                  
                     I love to listen to the murmur'd song
                     Of zephyrs revelling o'er beds of flowers;
                     Their airy music, as it floats along,
                     Speaks to my heart of past and hallowed hours,
                     When that sweet rainbow of my life—our boy—
                     Solaced each care and heighten'd every joy.
                  
                  
                     Brilliant in beauty as the humming-bird,
                     When its soft plumage glitters in the sun—
                     Sportive as lambkin of the fleecy herd—
                     As gentle too—was our lamented one.
                     His merry laugh still echoes in mine ear;
                     His fairy footsteps still I seem to hear!
                  
                  
                     And can it be? Oh, is it not a dream?
                     That he has left, forever, earth's fair scene!
                     He, that was so loved, so beauteous, and so bright!
                     Who, to my soul, was breath, was life, was light!
                     In the dark tomb has that dear form been laid?
                     Was't by his bier we knelt and wept and prayed?
                     While funeral rite and psalm, at twilight dim,
                     Was said and chaunted (Oh, my God!) o'er him!
                     
                     'Twas even so!—Death claimed him for his own,
                     And made us desolate, heart-stricken, lone!
                     Now, oft like Cain, I feel as if my share
                     Of earthly wo is more than I can bear.
                     Now, soon to rest within that deep cold grave
                     Where sleeps my child—so still!—is all I crave,
                     Till the last trump shall peal along the skies,
                     And the awaken'd, conscious Dead arise!
                     Then in communion sacred, blest and sweet,
                     Our angel cherub we again shall meet.
                  
               
               
                  THE INVOCATION.
                  
                     
                        
                           Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them
                              who shall be heirs of salvation?
                        
                        HEBREWS, chapter x, verse 17.
                     
                  
                  
                     Gentle Spirit, hover o'er me,
                     Be my guardian day and night;
                     Help me, keep me, I implore thee!
                     Guide me to the realms of light!
                  
                  
                     Now, an angel bright with glory!
                     Fancy paints thee to mine eyes;
                     Yet fond nature will deplore thee,
                     Though thou art in Paradise.
                  
                  
                     Oh, thou wert by me more cherished
                     Than aught else on earth beside;
                     And with thee those hopes have perish'd
                     Which so cheered my life's dull tide.
                  
                  
                     Worldly pleasures no more charm me—
                     From their spells I now am free;
                     Thoughts of death no more alarm me,
                     I would die to be with thee,
                     
                  
                  
                     Come, then, loved one! hover o'er me—
                     Leave me not, by day or night;
                     Aid me, keep me, I implore thee!
                     Guide me to the realms of light!
                  
               
               
                  
                  ON THE DEATH OF THE LATE MRS. MARIA B. MURRAY, OF NEW YORK.
                  
                     Stranger.
                     
                        "In mournful peals, prolonged and clear,
                        A solemn knell falls on the ear;
                        And see! slow moving o'er yon plain,
                        A dark draped hearse and funeral train!
                        Oh, whose the form thus borne along,
                        And followed by that weeping throng?"
                     
                  
                  
                     Mourner.
                     
                        "She who, there, in death reposes,
                        Was to our sad hearts most dear!
                        He who all events disposes,
                        Called her from this earthly sphere:
                     
                     
                        Called that tender wife and mother,
                        By so many loved so well!
                        From this fair world to another—
                        And with grief 'our bosoms swell.
                     
                     
                        Goodness—genius—beauty—wealth—
                        
                           All were her's—a precious dower!
                        But, ah, the needful boon of health
                        
                           Denied—she faded like a flower!
                     
                     
                        Ne'er shall loving eyes behold her 
                        Grace again her cheerful home!
                        Never more fond arms enfold her!
                        Never more to us she'll come!"
                     
                  
                  
                     Stranger.
                     
                        "Calm thee, mourner! cease bewailing!
                        Think how she in Heav'n is blest:
                        Then let faith o'er woe prevailing,
                        Each rebellious thought arrest.
                     
                     
                        Oh, lament her not so deeply:
                        To rejoin her now prepare;
                        Let her pure example keep thee
                        From the sins which taint us here."
                     
                  
               
               
                  A MONODY ON THE DEATH OF JOHN ROBERTSON, OF PHILADELPHIA,
                  Who died at Richmond, Va., Nov.22, 1832.
                  ADDRESSED TO HIS MOTHER.
                  
                     Mourn not for him, that gentle youth,
                     Whose bosom was the seat of truth—
                     Of virtue, and of honor bright,
                     Of all that could our hearts delight.
                  
                  
                     Ah, mourn him not! an angel now,
                     With God's own signet on his brow;
                     He roves the skies, and his the love
                     Of cherubim and saints above.
                  
                  
                     With them he shares the bliss of Heaven,
                     The glorious boon to pure ones given;
                     And he was pure, your gentle son—
                     Then weep not that his course is run.
                  
                  
                     So fitted for a happier sphere,
                     Would you have had him linger here,
                     Amid these tainted scenes of earth,
                     Where hope and joy scarce have their birth,
                  
                  
                     Ere from us they are rudely torn,
                     And we left weeping and forlorn?
                     Our life is like the autumn leaf,
                     Varied in hue, its bloom as brief.
                  
                  
                     And can you wish him back again,
                     To feel the stings of grief and pain,
                     Which are the doom of all our race 
                     While its perplexing maze we trace?
                  
                  
                     Would you recall his ransomed soul,
                     In mercy freed from sin's control,
                     And re-subject it to that power,
                     So baneful e'en in Eden's bower?
                  
                  
                  
                     Ah, no! though numbered with the dead,
                     For him let not our tears be shed,
                     Nor sighs of bitter woe expressed!
                     Oh, why bewail the Dead thus blest?
                  
                  
                     Flow for ourselves, ye rapid tears!
                     For when from earth these disappears,
                     One of the worthiest of her train,
                     
                        Our's is the loss—their's the rich gain!
                  
               
               
                  LINES ON THE DEATH OF MRS. JOSEPH MARX.
                  
                     Mother beloved, farewell! thy cares are o'er
                     And thy dear spirit treads that blissful shore,
                     The "promised land" of rest—
                     And yet we mourn and languish for thee here,
                     And to thy mem'ry shed the bitter tear,
                     With direst grief opprest.
                  
                  
                     And when assembled round the household hearth,
                     So late the scene of sweet domestic mirth,
                     And joys serene and pure—
                     Oh, then, we feel the dreary void that's there;
                     We miss thy voice—we see they vacant chair,
                     And our sad loss deplore.
                  
                  
                     Mother beloved! we miss thee every hour,
                     When morning glows or evening shadows lower,
                     Or night's dark veil is spread.
                     But there is one who loved thee—now so lone!
                     Sickness is on him still; and thou, whose kindly tone
                     Didst soothe him,—thou art dead!
                  
                  
                     Oh may thy spirit visit his repose
                     In the calm hour, when mystic dreams disclose
                     Their changeful fantasies;
                     And may thy tomb be unto us a shrine,
                     Whereal, from this cold sphere, to scenes divine,
                     Our thoughts and hopes shall rise.
                  
               
               
                  STANZAS ON THE DEATH OF MR. JOSEPH MARX.
                  
                     Peace to thy shade! Oh, thou who wert most kind,
                     Most generous, noble and sincere;
                     In thee how many virtues we beheld combined,
                     Now "lost to sight, but still to memory dear!"
                  
                  
                     Thou wert the loving father and the faithful friend,
                     The tender husband and the brother true;
                     Thou wert the cordial host, and oft would hie to blend,
                     With thee and thine, a social happy crew.
                  
                  
                     At noon-tide they would gather round thy festive board;
                     At eve oft circle gaily round thy hearth,
                     And there, blithe as its blaze, each gleeful soul forth poured
                     The merry jest, awakening harmless mirth.
                  
                  
                     There were thy children, too, and one beloved who trod
                     With thee the maze of life, thy fate to share—
                     Ah, where are they? In other homes! And she? With God!
                     And thou? We trust thou'rt gone to join her there.
                  
                  
                     For thou hast past from earth, and lonely is they hall,
                     Where erst both sparkling wit and wine went round;
                     While welcome wreathed each cup, and greeting kind met all,
                     And airy footsteps tripped to music's sound.
                  
                  
                     O, well may all, who read these sad and simple lines,
                     Garner the solemn warning they convey,
                     That as the shade of night before the sun declines,
                     Thus silently and surely fade away
                  
                  
                     The pageantries of earth!—its hopes, its joys, its care;
                     Then let us strive, while time to us is given,
                     (Time flies apace, and dread eternity draws near!)
                     To seek the narrow path which leads to Heaven.
                  
               
               
                  
                  EPITAPH FOR AN INFANT.
                  Occasioned by the Death of a sweet Babe, the infant son of Mr.
                     and Mrs. JEFFERSON PEYTON, during the summer of 1851.
                  
                     Here, stranger, pause and read
                     Upon this little tomb,
                     How earthly blessings fade,
                     And perish in their bloom.
                  
                  
                     A tender form lies here,
                     Committed to the dust,
                     That lived but one short year
                     Ere God resumed his trust.
                  
                  
                     Beneath this little mound,
                     Where oft the violet blows,
                     Deep, deep within the ground,
                     We laid our withered rose.
                  
                  
                     We planted it in earth,
                     We hope to bloom in Heaven;
                     For pure as at its birth,
                     To God our flower was given.
                  
                  
                     And when the orbs of night
                     Gleam on the sacred spot,
                     The breeze, in whispers light,
                     Murmurs, forget me not.
                     
                  
               
               
                  THE ADIEU.
                  TO ONE WHO HAD BEEN A COMFORTER IN AFFLICTION.
                  
                     Dearest Marie! Fare thee well;
                     May gentle breezes waft thee on!
                     Thine absence breaks a pleasing spell,
                     And sadness reigns, now thou art gone!
                  
                  
                     Thy presence soothed my stricken heart,
                     Thy converse cheered my spirits' gloom;
                     Alas! alas! that we must part!
                     And I my lonely tasks resume.
                  
                  
                     Forget me not, mine own sweet niece;
                     On thee, my thoughts and love shall rest;
                     Adieu! On Earth, mayst thou have peace;
                     In Heaven, the raptures of the blest!
                  
               
            
            
               
               SMILES AFTER TEARS.
               "VIVE LA BAGATELLE!"
               
                  THE WHITE SULPHUR SPRING OF VA. IN 1836.
                  A DESCRIPTIVE BALLAD.
                  
                     Oh, the White Sulphur Spring! the White Sulphur Spring!
                     How pure, how limpid and cool are its waters!
                     Ev'ry year thither borne upon Hope's buoyant wing,
                     Hie the Brave, and the Fair, and the
                           Rich, from all quarters.
                  
                  
                     Some go to seek pleasure, and some to woo health,
                     And others (like Cœlebs) in search of a wife,
                     Whose virtues and charms, tho' unaided by wealth,
                     Shall solace their cares and enrapture their life.
                  
                  
                     But others there are (the base, sordid elves!)
                     Who sigh not for these—their object is
                           money;
                     
                     Ye favoured of Fortune, take care of yourselves!
                     Ah, heed not their love-tales, tho' melting as
                           honey!
                     
                  
                  
                     Oh, the White Sulphur Spring! the White Sulphur Spring
                     Can cure ev'ry evil that ever was known!
                     Gout, fever, dyspepsia, and each horrid thing
                     That e'er worried the flesh or tormented the bone!
                  
                  
                     How verdant its lawn in the depth of the mountains!
                     How snug are its cabins, all ranged in a row!
                     What spruce beaus and belles daily quaff at its fountains!
                     
                        So gay and so stylish!—they make quite a show!
                  
                  
                     When the dinner-bell rings, what a throng sallies forth
                     Of maidens and bachelors, husbands and wives;
                     Of Locos and Whigs, from East, West, South and North—
                     All talking and walking as if for their lives!
                     
                  
                  
                  
                     At table, what scrambling!—what bustle and clamor!
                     
                        Here, gentlemen calling; and there, servants
                        running—
                     Old Vulcan's stout myrmidons, while at the hammer,
                     Could not have occasioned a clatter more stunning!
                  
                  
                     But enough of Terrestrials! Haste we to Paradise,*
                        
                     
                     Where dwell those bright houries whose soft silken chains
                     Have entwined many hearts, and forced them to sacrifice
                     Friendship's bland feelings for Love's racking pains!
                  
                  
                     
                     *A range of cabins called "Paradise row," from their location.
                  
                  
                     You'll find there Miss B., Miss C., and Miss W.,
                     And some other belles who in Richmond reside;
                     But beware of their charms!—they have pow'r to trouble you,
                     And cause you a torturing ache in the side.
                     
                  
                  
                     From Baltimore, Boston, Philadelphia, New-York;
                     From Louisville, Lynchburg, and Edenton city,
                     Are fair ones and rare ones!—just look in that walk!
                     "Tis filled with the graceful, the beauteous, the witty!
                  
                  
                     There are songstresses also among the gay train,
                     Whose soft notes enchant as they fall on the ear,
                     Like those of the syrens whose ravishing strain
                     Ulysses of old dared not venture to hear.
                  
                  
                     At night, should you wend to Terpsichore hall,
                     
                     You'll see there assembled a brilliant collection,
                     Who form, ev'ry evening, a sociable Ball,
                     Where quadrilles and waltzes are danced to perfection.
                  
                  
                     There are Judges and Gen'rals whose names I could mention,
                     And Doctors and Lawyers and Statesmen of fame;
                     But to lengthen this ballad is not my intention,
                     'Twould be too laborious each one to proclaim.

                  THE FLOWER GIRL OF BADEN.
                  A BALLAD.
                  
                     "Flowers! flowers!—who'll buy flowers?"
                     Cried a beauteous maiden;
                     "They're bright and fresh—just culled from bowers
                     Within a mile of Baden.
                  
                  
                     Here blend the lily and the rose,
                     With richest odors laden;
                     They scent the very air that blows
                     Along the streets of Baden.
                  
                  
                     Or would you violets, to perfume
                     The trunks your clothes are laid in?
                     Behold them in my basket bloom—
                     You can't find such in Baden."
                  
                  
                     Thus every day, at early dawn,
                     Did pretty Minna Vaiden
                     Trip o'er the verdant, dewy lawn.
                     To sell her wares in Baden.
                  
                  
                     And truly, she came not in vain
                     With lovely nosegays laden;
                     She sold them all, and caught a swain—
                     A rich one, too—in Baden.
                  
                  
                     Not only her bouquets he bought
                     Of the sweet, smiling maiden;
                     But he the humble cottage sought
                     Wherein she dwelt near Baden,
                  
                  
                     And ask'd her for her heart and hand—
                     His suit did Cupid aid in;
                     So she his prayer could not withstand,
                     As was soon known in Baden.
                  
                  
                     For ere that summer by did glide,
                     The blushing blue-eyed maiden
                     Consented to become his bride,
                     And share his home in Baden:
                  
                  
                  
                     
                        Provided that her mother, dear,
                     Would leave the cot they staid in,
                     And move to town, there to be near
                     Her daughter when in Baden.
                  
                  
                     'Twas thus arranged, and in the fall
                     The happy Minna Vaiden
                     Was wedded to young Rodolf Hall,
                     The Banker's son in Baden.
                  
                  
                     And now she lives a lady bright
                     As ever eyes were laid on!
                     In stately mansion, on the right,
                     Just as you enter Baden.
                  
                  
                     There she rears far dearer flowers
                     (A rosy boy and maiden)
                     Than those she cultured once in bowers,
                     Within a mile of Baden.
                  
               
               
                  Verses sent, with a Satin Pin-Cushion, to a Clergyman, in 1832
                  
                     Accept this little gift, my friend;
                     Tho' trifling, yet perchance 'twill tend
                     To make you think of me,
                     Whene'er for holy rite or prayer,
                     Your gown and surplice you prepare,
                     And act for love or fee..
                     
                  
                  
                     And when you preach, cold hearts to warm,
                     As smooth and graceful as its form
                     May all your periods be!
                     And bright and pointed as its pins,
                     Yours arguments against our sins,
                     Whilst rapt, we list to thee,
                     A dolorous letter to a friend,
                     About a squirrel's cruel end,
                     Addressed to Mrs. C.M.B.
                     By the writer, J.M.C.
                  
                  
                     Dear Caroline, prepare your ear
                     A melancholy tale to hear;
                     One that perchance will cause a sigh,
                     Nay, draw a tear from your bright eye.
                     This morning, just as I awoke,
                     In came the cook and thus she spoke:
                     (Her words I do remember well,
                     For as upon mine ear they fell,
                     They seemed a solemn, sad prediction
                     Of that which now is my affliction.)
                     "Madam," said she, in doleful tone,
                     "Your darling squirrel, Bun, is gone!
                     I've hunted for him here and there,
                     In this place, that place, everywhere,
                     In vain! To find him I despair—
                     And much I fear the cat's caught Bun!"
                     Alas! her fears have proved too true,
                     As shall be quickly proved to you,
                     For, in the cellar, on the ground,
                     His skin and bones have since been found.
                     Ill fated Bunny! Precious pet!
                     Thy winning ways I'll ne'er forget!
                     Thy severed limbs lie by me yet;
                     Ah, how they kindle fond regret!
                     Why couldst thou not have been content,
                     And kept within thy snug cage pent?
                     Then, thou wouldst not have been o'er powered
                     And by thin enemy devoured.
                     But thou werst ever like a child,
                     Too prone to gambol and be wild,
                     And never grave or melancholy—
                     Well, dearly hast thou paid for folly!
                  
                  
                  
                     But I must cease to grieve and prate,
                     And haste in few words to relate
                     When, how and where was brought to pass
                     This deed so dire. Alas! Alas!
                     It seems that, tired of being quiet,
                     Bunny resolved to have a riot;
                     So, feeling nor demure nor sage,
                     He most unwisely left his cage,
                     Last evening—about six o'clock,
                     (Poor little fellow! What a shock!)
                     And sported round and round the house,
                     As frolicsome as any mouse.
                     While thus he entertained himself
                     Forth stalked grimalkin, horrid elf!
                     And when his tempting form she saw,
                     She pounced upon him with her claw,
                     Dragged him below, and eat him up!
                     Doubtless because she chose to sup.
                     I wish she had been drowned or strangled
                     Ere my favorite she so mangled,
                     Tearing piecemeal, limb and feature
                     Of the pretty, playful creature.
                     When e'er I think how he was slaughtered,
                     I'm fain to have her hung and quartered.
                     Really she merits such a death,
                     For robbing the dear thing of breath:
                     In such a savage manner too;
                     But t'was cat-like—was't not?—Adieu.
                  
               
               
                  IMPROMPTU, ON A SARCASTIC YOUNG LADY.
                  
                     She's very pretty, and she's very smart—
                     What pity 'tis! she's also very tart;
                     
                     But for her tongue, her face might win each heart
                  
               
               
                  NERVOUS FEARS; OR, A NIGHT IN A HAUNTED CHAMBER.
                  A LESSON FOR THE CREDULOUS.
                  
                     It was past midnight, and a taper's light,
                     Gleamed fitfully on the hearth;
                     All around was hushed, save the blast which rushed,
                     And roared like the sea when wrath.
                  
                  
                     'Twas an awful gale! and at times would wail,
                     Like a mourner over the dead;
                     The windows would shake, as if an earthquake
                     Began its havoc to spread.
                  
                  
                     In this trying state, at an hour so late,
                     Alone in the haunted room,
                     With bitter regret, I lament the bet
                     I had made to brave its gloom.
                  
                  
                     And then I declared, that should I be spared
                     To greet the next morning's light,
                     I would not again encounter such pain
                     For millions of diamonds bright;
                  
                  
                     For the richest prize, ne'er be so unwise,
                     As to venture to repose
                     In a place so drear, with no mortal near
                     To calm my fears if they rose.
                  
                  
                     At length the wind ceased, my terror decreased,
                     And I closed my eyes to sleep;
                     But the nap I sought was not to be caught,
                     For wide awake did I keep.
                  
                  
                     Feeling so dreary, restless and weary,
                     O, how I wished for the dawn!
                     The minutes seemed hours, wing'd by wicked powers,
                     So heavily they moved on.
                  
                  
                     The lamp would glimmer, burn dimmer and dimmer,
                     Then shed a blue light around;
                     
                     A shade on the wall resembled a pall,
                     Its fringes trailing the ground.
                  
                  
                     The old oak table, of hue so sable,
                     Looked like a funeral bier,
                     And each antique chair, stiff, high-backed and queen,
                     A cannon's stall did appear.
                  
                  
                     I lay still as death!—restrained every breath,
                     And traced the forms on the chintz—
                     They seemed to advance in a weird-like dance,
                     And their uncouth steps to mince.
                  
                  
                     I averted my face from the hideous race,
                     With their odd, fantastic gait,
                     And shuddering with dread, averted my head,
                     Expecting a direful fate.
                  
                  
                     Soon came a faint cry, and something ran by,
                     And scampered about the floor;
                     Round and round it flew, the lamp it o'erthrew:
                     I shrieked and remember no more.
                  
                  
                     Friends found me next day, as senseless as clay.
                     And cold as a block of ice;
                     At my bedside sat my favorite cat,
                     By her lay two slaughtered mice.
                  
                  
                     There was then no doubt of what caused the rout
                     Which scared me out of my wits;
                     Puss raised the turmoil, and upset the oil
                     In catching a treat for her kits.
                  
                  
                     And how she got there was equally clear;
                     In my haste the night before,
                     I quickly undrest and retired to rest,
                     Neglecting to latch the door.
                  
                  
                     Puss wandering astray, while seeking for prey,
                     And finding the door ajar,
                     Had slyly crept in; then followed the din
                     Of her predatory war.
                  
               
               
                  THE CURFEW BELL.
                  
                     Heavily borne on the evening air,
                     The toll of the curfew bell comes—
                     And, even should sorrow or sickness be there,
                     No light must illumine our homes.
                     'Tis the stern behest of the Norman king
                     Who sits upon England's throne;
                     Ah, little cares he for the ills it may bring,
                     For mercy by him is ne'er shown.
                  
                  
                     Not a ray of light
                     Through the livelong night
                     Allows he the shiv'ring and old,
                     As they cower along
                     On the dreary hearth-stone
                     While the wind blows shrilly and cold.
                  
                  
                     At the gay festal board
                     With its generous hoard,
                     The jest and the wine-song have ceased;
                     And, vexed and down-hearted,
                     The guests have departed;
                     The ill-omened bell stopped the feast!
                  
                  
                     O, that horrible bell
                     Seems a funeral knell,
                     Loud tolling o'er Liberty's grave—
                     But the period will come,
                     When the roll of the drum
                     Shall rouse from his torpor each slave;
                     For Saxons again their rights shall maintain,
                     And raise the war-cry, the proud king to defy.
                  
               
               
                  
                  THE FELON'S TRYST.
                  
                     Sister, we must part to-night!
                     Then meet me in the dim twilight,
                     Beneath the old oak on the green;
                     Ah, meet me then and there, Kathleen!
                     And sever from thy golden hair
                     One glossy tress—one ringlet fair,
                     A precious, sacred pledge of love,
                     To press my heart where'er I rove.
                     At twilight hour, upon the green,
                     Ah, meet me then and there, Kathleen!
                  
                  
                     Bring with thee, too, that book of prayer
                     Which saves (thou sayest) from despair
                     The wretch repentant of his crime,
                     And fills his soul with hope sublime.
                     Alas! I well deserve my doom,
                     Fraught as it is with shame and gloom.
                     But penitence comes now too late,
                     To shield me from a Felon's fate.
                     At twilight dim, upon the green,
                     Ah, meet me then and there, Kathleen!
                  
                  
                     Sister, when we breathe farewell,
                     A darksome tale I have to tell:
                     'Twill wring, I know, thy gentle heart.
                     Yet must be told thee ere we part—
                     Now fail me not!—for ere night wanes.
                     Disguised I leave our native plains,
                     To seek some distant foreign shore;
                     
                        Then, dear Kathleen! we meet no more!
                     At twilight hour, upon the green,
                     We part, to meet no more!—Kathleen.
                  
               
               
                  AN EPIGRAM,
                  Written on an Occurrence that took place as detailed in the
                     verse.
                  
                     Once upon a time an argument arose
                     Between two ladies—too colloquial foes.
                     
                     How eloquently each in turn descanted!
                     How rapidly! for breath each almost panted.
                     To irony at length they both resorted,
                     And thus quite sharply with each other sported.
                     Said C., "One must be wrapped in mental blindness
                     Not to perceive that you're the milk of
                        kindness!"
                     "Indeed!" cried I, "One must be milk and water,
                     
                     Not to perceive that you are cream of Tartar!"
                  
               
               
                  A RIDDLE, WITH ITS ANSWER.
                  
                     With twinkling eyes and glossy skin,
                     I'm sometimes plump and sometimes thin—
                     And dwell a little cave within.
                  
                  
                     At night, when most folks go to sleep,
                     I slyly from my doorway peep,
                     And if all's quiet, forth I creep.
                  
                  
                     O, then, on what nice things I dine!
                     Cheese, crackers, cake, but never wine;
                     
                     No taste for liquor e'er was mine.
                     
                  
                  
                     Well! when my savory meals are o'er,
                     And hunger twinges me no more,
                     Dear! how I scamper on the floor!
                  
                  
                     But my poor heart goes pit-a-pat,
                     If while my capers I am at,
                     I hear a footstep or a cat!
                  
                  
                     
                        Then, oh, how I do clip it home!
                     Quicker than when I forth did come
                     To eat, and through the house to roam.
                  
                  
                     Now, what am I? A dog? A hare?
                     Or what? Come tell me, lady fair:
                     "A mouse"—Ah, yes—you've got me there!
                  
               
               
                  
                  SOLILOQUY OF A HYPOCONDRIAC.
                  SCENE—A darkened room; rain pelting the window panes; Hypocondriac looks
                     out, comes forward, and groans.
                  
                     Heigh-ho!
                     What shall I do?
                     How desolate!
                     How hard my fate!
                     In truth I am
                     A wretched man!
                     Lone and dreary,
                     Dull and weary,
                     Melancholy,
                     Sick of folly.
                     Tired of life,
                     Its toils and strife,
                     Angry factions
                     And distractions;
                     Its inflictions
                     And restrictions,
                     Intermeddlings,
                     Petty peddlings,
                     Sland'rous stories
                     And false glories;
                     Its bustling din,
                     And scenes of sin;
                     Its doubts and fears,
                     Regrets and tears;
                     Its hopes betrayed,
                     And joys decayed;
                     Its spacious wiles,
                     Deceiving smiles,
                     Palling pleasures,
                     Changing measures,
                     Fleeting wealth,
                     And fading health;
                  
                  
                     Foolish notions
                     And commotions,
                     Eccentricities,
                     And duplicities;
                     Epidemics,
                     And polemics;
                     Its wrong pursuits,
                     And their sad fruits.
                     Tired, in short,
                     Of ev'ry sport,
                     Of ev'ry action
                     Or attraction;
                     Of frequent sighs
                     O'er broken ties;
                     Of probation,
                     Lamentation,
                     Self-denials
                     And hard trials!
                     Discontented
                     And tormented,
                     A prey to grief—
                     With no relief—
                     Soured and sadden'd,
                     
                        Almost maddened!
                     Fain would I quit,
                     Did Heav'n permit,
                     This gloomy maze
                     Of wo-fraught days,
                     Of months and years,
                     Replete with cares,
                     And void of joy
                     Without alloy—
                  
                  
                     Its dissensions
                     And contentions;
                     Its hard-earned gains
                     And useless pains;
                     Provocations,
                     Separations,
                     Speculations,
                     And vexations;
                     Its delusions
                     And confusions;
                     Endless losses,
                     Ceaseless crosses,
                     Animosities,
                     And pomposities.
                     Vain achievements,
                     Dire bereavements,
                     Distressing sights,
                     Invaded rights—
                  
                  
                     Be mine a grave
                     In earth or wave!
                     A wakeless sleep
                     Within the deep!
                     A lowly bed
                     Among the dead,
                     Who calmly rest
                     On Earth's cold breast,
                     In that repose
                     The Spirit knows,
                     When dispossessest
                     Of mortal vest.
                     Come then, oh Death!
                     Pass, pass, oh breath!
                     Cease throbbing! heart.
                     I would depart.
                  
                  Exit Hypocondriac.
               
               
                  AN ENIGMA.
                  
                     In the middle of day I always appear,
                     Yet am ever in darkness and sadness and fear.
                     I'm in anguish and pain, yet always in health,
                     In the midst too of happiness, pleasure and wealth.
                     I was formed since the flood, yet am part of the ark,
                     And seen in a candle, a lamp and a spark.
                     Tho' ne'er out of England, I'm always in France,
                     
                     Stay in Paris, Amiens, Bourdeaux and Nantes.
                     I'm found in the waves and the foam of the ocean,
                     In steamboats and cars, yet am never in motion.
                     I'm always in land, yet ne'er out of water;
                     I'm always in peace, yet encountered in slaughter;
                     In short, I'm in all things; There's no lake or sea.
                     Or island or cape, but contains little me.
                  
               
               
                  
                  ANSWER TO A NOTE FROM A FRIEND,
                  Accompanying the Present of a Fly Brush.
                  
                     I've just received, my generous friend,
                     Your beauteous gift and playful letter;
                     And in return my thanks I send,
                     Would I could proffer something better!
                  
                  
                     Oh! what a comfort it will be!
                     To have the busy, torturing flies,
                     Dispersed, and quickly made to flee,
                     From their assaults on meats and pies.
                  
                  
                     When shall we see you here again?
                     Ere long, we most sincerely trust!
                     To have you with us we are fain,
                     Whene'er we can, so come you must.
                     
                  
                  
                     And breakfast, dine, or take your tea
                     Which ever suits your taste or time—
                     Too much of you we cannot see;
                     'Tis true in prose as well as rhyme.
                  
                  
                     Suppose you come to-day and dine?
                     Ah, do! You'll give us all great pleasure.
                     Our roasting beef seems very fine;
                     Our hour is three, and then you've leisure.
                  
                  
                     The family join in this request,
                     And send their love, dear Mrs. T.
                     Now, pray don't wait to be more prest,
                     But hasten to your friend, J.C.
                  
               
               
                  Lines suggested by a Conversation with a Friend.
                  
                     I'd have no carved, elaborate stone,
                     Within some dim-lit stately dome,
                     Which crowds infest:
                     A grave—a rural grave for me,
                     Beneath some fragrant tree—
                     
                        There would I rest.
                  
                  
                     Blithe birds should carol o'er my head,
                     Bright dew-drops gem my verdant bed,
                     And flow'rets bloom—
                     And woodland breezes freshly blow,
                     Mingling with the flowers below
                     Their soft perfume.
                  
                  
                     Nurt'ring the turf to deeper hue,
                     And imaging the sky's rich blue
                     In mirror clear—
                     Transparent streams should purl around
                     Sweet requiems, murmuring o'er the mound,
                     In their career.
                  
                  
                     At morn, when fair, with rays divine,
                     Our glorious sun should o'er me shine,
                     Cheering and bright!
                     And each clear night, the paler beam
                     Of moon or stars above me gleam,
                     With silvery light.
                     Such be the place of my repose,
                     When Death shall end life's cares and woes!

                  AN ADIEU TO "INGLESIDE,"
                  The Seat of HENRY CARRINGTON, Esq., in Charlotte Co., Va.
                  
                     Farewell, sweet Ingleside! farewell!
                     To thee and all who in thee dwell,
                     Whose happy home thou art;
                     The pleasant hours that I have spent
                     Within thy halls, where reigns content,
                     Are graven on my heart.
                  
                  
                     May birds with music cheer thy bowers,
                     Thy garden teem with choicest flowers,
                     Fruits flourish on thy trees!
                     And sportive streamlets wend their way
                     Among thy hills, beneath the play
                     Of light and healthful breeze!
                  
                  
                     Green be thy woods! and bright thy skies!
                     And rich thy harvests in supplies
                     Whenever they come round!
                     And to thine inmates dear and kind,
                     With generous hearts and minds refined,
                     May Heavenly gifts abound!
                  
               
               
                  IMPROMTU STANZAS,
                  Written after a conversation concerning the Pleasures and Pains
                     of Memory.
                  
                     'Tis sweet to muse o'er Mem'ry's page,
                     E'en should we trace each line with tears;
                     Or smile as it recalls the age
                     Of happy childhood, void of cares:
                  
                  
                     When hearts were blithesome, warm and true,
                     Not sullied by a worldly feeling;
                     But pure as drops of morning dew,
                     Over violet blossoms stealing.
                  
                  
                     
                        Then Time stole by with footsteps light,
                     And scatter'd roses as he fled:
                     So thornless, sweet and heav'nly bright!
                     A radiance on Life's path they shed.
                  
                  
                     There are who'd taste of Lethes' stream,
                     Not so would I—I love the past!
                     And grief, or joy, be Mem'ry's theme,
                     I'll woo her poesy to the last.
                  
               
               
                  SONG,
                  Written by request, for a little girl to sing at a Fancy Ball, in
                     the character of a Swiss Peasant selling Love-knots.
                  TUNE—"Yankee Doodle."
                  
                     Who'll buy Love-knots? here they are,
                     For all who wish to marry—
                     For the Brave and for the Fair;
                     Come buy, and do not tarry.
                  
                  
                     For the old and for the young,
                     Who are in lone condition;
                     Whose wedding-bells have never rung,
                     
                        Here now is competition.
                  
                  
                     Then Lads and Lassies heed my call,
                     Approach, and do not tarry!
                     If ye are in sly Cupid's thrall,
                     Sure, now's the time to marry.
                  
                  
                     Come buy, come buy! do not delay,
                     Time, fast away is stealing;
                     And I can here no longer stay,
                     If vainly I'm appealing.
                  
               
               
                  
                  A TEMPERANCE SONG,
                  Written by request of the Musical Editor of the "Lady's
                     Book."
                  
                     Let's away to the spring, the clear cold spring,
                     With its water so pure and so bright!
                     Where early at morn, the lark plumes her wing,
                     Ere she soars to the regions of light:
                     Flutt'ring away so cheerily!
                     Trilling her notes so merrily
                     As she soars to the regions of light.
                  
                  
                     To the spring—to the spring!—the limpid spring,
                     Where the diamond-like bubbles arise,
                     As sparkling and bright as a jewelled ring,
                     And twinkling like stars in the skies.
                     Commingling, O so cheerily!
                     Then scatt'ring away so merrily!
                     And twinkling like stars in the skies.
                  
                  
                     Our thirst let us quench at the healthful spring,
                     'Tis refreshing as nectar divine!
                     No more of the grape's ruddy juice we'll sing,
                     Nor partake of its treacherous wine.
                     We quaff it off so cheerily!
                     And then repent so wearily!
                     Of drinking the treacherous wine.
                  
                  
                     Then hurrah for the spring, the cooling spring!
                     And farewell to the brain-heating bowl!
                     Its madd'ning contents to the dust we'll fling,
                     And our names on the Pledge we'll enrol.
                     When "Sons of Temperance," cheerily
                     We'll form our ranks, and merrily
                     Hoist her flag, which our names shall enrol.
                  
               
               
                  VERSES WRITTEN BY REQUEST FOR A MAY-DAY CORONATION.
                  SCENE: A garden—A group of young girls surrounding a rustic throne, upon
                     which one is seated—Another advances, holding a nosegay and a crown of flowers,
                     and addresses her as follows:
                  
                     We've chosen thee our Queen of May,
                     This golden smiling happy day!
                     And with these flowers, bright and gay,
                     Some of thy virtues will portray.
                  
                  
                     This Lily with its snowy bell,
                     Secluded in its leafy dell,
                     (Like ancient hermit in his cell,)
                     Of thy modesty doth tell.
                  
                  
                     This little Violet so blue,
                     This fragrant rose of beauteous hue,
                     Still wet with pearly drops of dew,
                     
                        Humility and sweetness shew.
                  
                  
                     And by this sprig of Box so green,
                     And this of Myrtle smooth and sheen,
                     And rich in blossoms,—may be seen,
                     Thy constancy and truth, fair Queen.
                  
                  
                     Upon this bud, now cast thine eyes,
                     'Tis a Camelia, and implies,
                     That in thy heart soft pity lies,
                     That tender link in human ties.
                  
                  
                     Thus having by these emblems shewn,
                     The gentle virtues, one by one;
                     Which to all present be it known, (looking round)
                     
                     Have thee entitled to this throne.
                  
                  
                     We offer thee the flow'rs, (presenting them,) and now,
                     Placing this crown upon thy brow, (putting on the wreath)
                     
                     Before thee with due homage bow, (bowing,)
                     
                     And love and fealty avow.
                  
               
               
                  
                  GUITAR SONG.
                  
                     A wake those notes again!
                     Repeat that silvery strain:
                     They tell of pleasure past,
                     Of joys that did not last,
                     Wither'd by grief's cold blast.
                     Then strike the light Guitar!
                     Ah, strike the light Guitar!
                  
                  
                     As evening's shadows fall,
                     Let melody recall
                     Those hours of pure delight,
                     When all life's hopes were bright
                     As stars that gem the night.
                     Then strike the light Guitar!
                     Ah, strike the light Guitar!
                  
                  
                     While each soft cadence flows,
                     My spirit will repose
                     And dream of that blest land,
                     That distant, golden strand,
                     Where home's dear turrets stand.
                     Then strike the light Guitar!
                     Ah, strike the light Guitar!
                  
                  
                     Tho' clouds of sorrow lower,
                     Yet hath thy touch the power
                     To calm this troubled breast,
                     And soothe my soul to rest,
                     So long by care opprest.
                     Then strike the light Guitar!
                     Ah, strike the light Guitar!
                  
               
               
                  THE POLKA SONG.
                  
                     Come, hie we to the Linden-tree,
                     That stands upon the verdant lea;
                     It is the place for mirth and glee—
                     The place for you, dear! and for me.
                  
                  
                     Then haste we to the Linden-tree,
                     That pleasant spot upon the lea;
                     And there we'll dance so merrily
                     Beneath the Linden-tree.
                  
                  
                     When tired, we'll seek the cooling shade,
                     Fanned by the zephyrs of the glade;
                     A tender youth and gentle maid,
                     In nature's rarest charms arrayed.
                     Then haste we, &c.
                  
                  
                     I'll tell thee, too, a tale of love,
                     Pure as the azure skies above,
                     Soft as the cooings of the dove
                     Which nestles in the neighb'ring grove.
                     Then haste we, &c.
                  
               
               
                  CANZONET.
                  
                     Though she loves another dearly,
                     And no kindness shews to me,
                     Yet my heart is her's sincerely,
                     Never more can it be free!
                  
                  
                     Oft to her my thoughts are straying,
                     Yet she seldom thinks of me;
                     Cease, fond heart, thyself betraying,
                     Let her not thine anguish see.
                  
                  
                     Could I win her love, what pleasure
                     Might be mine forever more!
                     It would prove to me a treasure,
                     Richer than Golconda's store!
                  
               
               
                  
                  The Page's Serenade of Mary, Queen of Scots.
                  
                     The brightest stars now gem the sky,
                     And moon-beams glitter on the lake;
                     Save where Loch-Levin's turrets high,
                     A dark and lengthened shadow make.
                     Refreshing odors scent the air,
                     Exhaling from some mossy dell,
                     Where blossom flow'rets wild and fair,
                     And grows the lovely Scotch blue-bell.
                     Sweet Queen, awake!
                  
                  
                     Æolian music floats along,
                     In plaintive murmurs on the gale;
                     As if the zephyrs in their song,
                     Thy sad captivity bewail.
                     The scene is beautiful to view!
                     The murmured music sweet to hear!
                     Then rise, fair Queen! one follower true,
                     Thy faithful minstrel, lingers near.
                     Fair Queen, arise.
                  
                  
                     Without thy presence, what to me
                     
                     Are nature's charms, or music's voice!
                     With thine united they must be,
                     To make this pensive heart rejoice.
                     Ah! then, sweet sov'reign! from thy tower,
                     Look out upon the skies and earth;
                     And add to theirs, thy beauty's power,
                     To call the minstrel's raptures forth!
                     Sweet Queen, arise!
                  
               
               
                  CHARADES.
                  
                     No. 1.
                     My first you'll find is either tasteless, bitter, sour or
                        sweet,
                     And we are told it flourished once in Eden's fair retreat,
                     My second is of divers kinds, and found all over earth;
                     'Tis smooth, 'tis rough, 'tis tall, 'tis short, and to my first gave
                        birth.
                     My whole is common to this soil;
                     It seldom needs the laborer's toil,
                     And often is the school-boy's spoil.
                  
                  
                     No. 2.
                     Pronounce my first, and 'twill appear
                     That I'm a twelfth part of the year;
                     And mine the pleasant task to bring
                     The choicest fruits and flowers of Spring.
                     My second is a title given
                     To young or old—a boon from Heaven,
                     Which yet, if wicked or perverse,
                     May prove no blessing, but a curse.
                     My whole denotes a man of trade,
                     And one of secret art, 'tis said,
                     Belonging to a Brotherhood
                     Known in the world to do much good.
                  
                  
                     No. 3.
                     My first will make a coward tremble,
                     My next will beaux and belles assemble,
                     My whole does mischief far and near,
                     And causes, oft, affliction's tear.
                  
                  
                     No. 4.
                     My first is Heaven born,
                     My second a child of earth,
                     My whole a fragile form,
                     Which dies soon after birth.
                  
                  
                     No. 5.
                     My first o'er earth soft radiance diffusing,
                     Inclines the Heaven-born mind to Heavenly musing;
                     
                     And erst it was an idol, at whose shrine
                     The Heathen bowed in Egypt's glowing clime.
                     My second swiftly darts from pole to pole,
                     Bright to the eye as Hope is to the soul!
                     My whole embellishes, with magic power,
                     A peasant's cottage or a monarch's tower!
                  
                  
                     No. 6.
                     My first and second and whole are
                        frail!
                     From all, the same sweet odors exhale,
                     Which often perfume the summer gale;
                     Nor are tints more beauteous seen in Heaven,
                     When Phœbus brightly sinks at even',
                     Than those kind Nature to each has given.
                  
                  
                     No. 7.
                     My first is seen in rain and hail—
                     In ocean, mountain, plain and vale;
                     If books you read or letters write,
                     In every page it meets your sight.
                     My second rears a verdant crest,
                     And wears a glossy, silken vest—
                     Is oft an epicurean treat,
                     And yet a torture most complete.
                     My whole sometimes in air is found;
                     Anon, one spies it on the ground:
                     'Tis of a giant race, yet small—
                     Like pride it towers, then has its fall.
                  
                  
                     No. 8.
                     My first is used in solemn rites,
                     And many a happy pair unites.
                     My second forms the miser's care,
                     And oft, 'tis said, has won the fair.
                     My first and second, when combined,
                     A gallant soldier brings to mind,
                     Who bravely fought, then life did yield,
                     On De la Palma's battle field;
                     Whose loss Columbia deplored,
                     Whose deeds are in her annals stored.
