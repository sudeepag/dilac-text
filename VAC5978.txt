            PREFACE.
            AS the marriage relation is regarded, by very many people, merely as a business-like
               arrangement, and not a holy bond of union, society witnesses the frequent
               interposition of parental authority, severing congenial souls, and inflicting wounds
               never to be healed on earth. With sordid parents, the nuptial tie is a consideration
               of dollars and cents, of family rank, of influential connections, etc., instead of
               true heart-affinity. Those who concur in this mercenary idea of wedlock will not care
               to read my story; while a larger and better class will, if I have been skilful in
               narration, peruse it with interest.
            This work is not a fiction, simply, for it is based upon actual events. The strangest
               part of the narrative is true; and there are persons living in New England who will
               recognize the incidents in the guise I have given them. It is creditable to human
               nature that most of us refuse to believe in such parental pride, malice, and cruelty as I am about
               to portray, except upon personal knowledge.
            That "The Mechanic's Bride" will be found interesting, and even exciting, I am
               confident. Believing that it has merits as well as demerits, I submit it to the
               public.

                           "A most poor man, made tame by fortune's blows;
                           Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,
                           Am pregnant to good pity."
                        
                     
                     KING LEAR.
                  
               
               READER, picture to yourself a pleasant chamber, nicely carpeted, tastefully
                  furnished, while a library of choice works, of history, romance, poetry, and
                  science, extends the whole length of the room, from floor to ceiling. My study—for
                  such it is—is located in the front part of a large, elegant dwelling-house, and
                  overlooks many charming scenes. Here is the highway, smooth and hard. How straight
                  it is for many miles, and how majestic seem those tall elm trees, on both sides of
                  the road, which fancy sometimes converts into giant sentinels, to guard the lonely
                  traveller, especially when seen by moonlight.
               Beyond the trees there is a large brook, and I can hear its music all the day
                  long, for it never seems to tire of its
                  song. I can see its waters from where I now sit, and they sometimes look very
                  dark, and sometimes glimmer with a silvery brightness. What a variety of flowers
                  grow upon the banks of this brook, inviting the bee to come and help himself to
                  their sweets, and fill his store. How busy he is, from morning till night, at work
                  always and singing always, uniting his ceaseless hum with the murmuring of the
                  waters.
               A pretty field lies beyond the brook, and it is burdened with tall herdsgrass and
                  waving grain. Still beyond is a green pasture,—very green now, for the showers
                  have been frequent of late,—extending to the top of a high hill, where there is a
                  grove in which the winds hold their maddest revels. The cattle are quietly
                  cropping the grass in this pasture; and, if their actions belie them not, they
                  enjoy it much. Beyond the hill, covered with woods, is the sky,—a portion of that
                  great dome which God built, a wonder and a glory forever.
               Are you surprised that I like my study?—that I consider the prospect beautiful? I
                  am certain that you would like it, too, if it were yours. Better than that, you
                  would like it though not yours, and wish the occupant all joy in the
                  possession.
               Well, I have spent many happy hours here; and a friend, who has been more faithful
                  than a brother, often comes to share my pleasures, or add to them,—I am sure he
                  does the latter. Yesterday, as we sat conversing of past events, he said to
                  me:
               "Elwood, I'll tell you what I want you to do."
               "Well, my friend, say on."
               "Write your autobiography: it would make an excellent book."
               "Do you think so?"
               "Certainly. Many interesting and strange things have happened in your life, and
                  you can write them out just as well as not."
               "I have ample time for it, but would it be best?"
               "It can't do any harm, and it may do good. You shall do it, Elwood."
               "If any body has a right to say shall to me, it is yourself; and, if
                  you actually desire it, and I can obtain the consent of another,—who, in all
                  deference to you, must be allowed to decide the question,—I will endeavor to write
                  the book."
               "Then I have you."
               "How so?"
               "That other person has already given her consent."
               "Well done, my friend! I must make up my mind at once to become an author. My pen
                  shall not lay idle for many a day after this, I give you my word; but if, by lack
                  of experience in book-making, I fail to make an interesting work, the blame must
                  fall upon you."
               "Perfectly willing to take it, for my shoulders are broad."
               "Yes; but they have never yet borne the
                  weight which captious criticism has the power to lay upon them."
               "Very true, and I fear they never will. Upon second thought, I don't know as I
                  care to make the trial, for I am now growing old."
               "I see that you are disposed to leave the field before the battle begins;
                  nevertheless, the book shall be written, if life and strength do not fail me."
               Our conversation ended here; my friend departed; and I am about to commence the
                  allotted task. How well I may succeed, the future alone shall determine. I don't
                  know exactly how to begin; but, so far as the interest of the story is concerned,
                  it will not matter much. So then——
               My father had never been wealthy, but, when he married, he supposed that he owned
                  a good farm. He paid every dollar of the purchase money, and was justly proud of
                  the achievement, for he had earned it all with his own hands, and so had nobody to
                  thank but himself.
               When he was thirty years old, he won my mother's love, and five years later they
                  were married. His anxiety to provide her a home, such as she was worthy of, caused
                  the happy day to be so long deferred. She would gladly have shared his lot
                  earlier, but he chose to wait. By strict economy and the most unremitting toil, he
                  succeeded in accumulating the requisite amount to purchase the farm upon which he
                  had set his heart. Then he joyfully claimed his bride. He was a good man, a lover
                  of justice, truth, and humanity, and she was a suitable helpmeet. She had a just
                  appreciation of the integrity and indomitable perseverance, which had carried my
                  father bravely through long years of hard labor, to secure a home which should
                  have all the comforts and attractions she could reasonably desire; and, in the
                  days of adversity which followed, she did not forget it.
               It was a pleasant place where my parents spent so happily the first two years of
                  their married life. The house was a large, two-story, old-fashioned building,
                  erected by a thorough mechanic, in a neat and substantial manner. The rooms were
                  spacious, high, and so arranged as to be very pleasant. The architect had drawn
                  his plan well, and I have seldom seen a dwelling better adapted to the wants of a
                  farmer and his family. Strangers were prone to remark, "How very convenient every
                  thing is."
               A short distance from the house stood a story-and-a-half building, which was
                  nearly new. The upper part of it was used for a granary, and the lower for the
                  storage of farming utensils. Beyond was the barn, a commodious, substantial
                  structure, which had been built but a few years, and was considered the best barn
                  in the county. All the buildings were clapboarded and painted white.
               In front of the house, quite a large yard was inclosed. With the exception of a
                  few flower-beds beds, nearly the whole
                  area was green. Roses bloomed in front of the windows, and there were large clumps
                  of lilac bushes on each side of the entrance way, while half a dozen luxuriant
                  fruit-trees stood as sentinels at convenient distances, on either side of the
                  well-trodden path, to ward off the ardent attentions of the sunbeams in the season
                  of oppressive heat.
               The farm was an excellent one, as the reader would naturally suppose from the
                  character of the buildings upon it; and yet, the former occupant went beyond his
                  means, and was obliged to sell. The land lay in convenient proximity to the
                  buildings and the highway, and was substantially fenced or walled. The stones had
                  been carefully gleaned from the tillage-ground, and there were no superfluous
                  bushes in fields or pastures. The place contained two noble wood-lots, one located
                  in front and the other in rear of the house; the former containing twenty-five
                  acres and the latter fifteen. The wood was in good part rock maple, interspersed
                  with beech, hemlock, bass, black and white birch, chestnut, walnut, and white
                  maple. The trees grew extremely large, and very compact, like a dense army of
                  giants. The sugar-maples were nearest the house, and much delicious syrup and
                  sugar was obtained from them annually.
               In one inclosure, used as a sheep pasture, which had a very high wall, and long
                  poles some two feet above, held there by stakes, were thirty chestnut trees, and
                  it was called the "chestnut orchard." It furnished a bountiful yearly supply of
                  that excellent nut. In the two pastures for cattle and horses, there were walnut
                  trees, of the variety called "shag-barks," which grew to a great height, and
                  spread widely their powerful arms. Every autumn they bent under the weight of the
                  sweet treasures they produced. The fruit trees, of which there were many, yielded
                  largely, and the quality of the fruit—apples, pears, quinces, peaches, plums, and
                  cherries—was superior. Of currants there were so many it was seldom they were more
                  than half gathered. Strawberries grew plentifully in the mowing fields, and,
                  though uncultivated, they were large and sweet.
               It was a gratification to walk over this farm in the "growing" season. How
                  luxuriant were the grass, the wheat, rye, barley, oats, and corn; and their
                  appearance never deceived, as on some land, for the soil here had bottom to it,
                  and the crops were vigorous.
               The buildings stood on a spot slightly elevated, so that there was a pleasant view
                  of the delightful scenery. All the land near by was gently undulating; but in the
                  distance there were high hills, green or covered with woods. Still farther on,
                  mountain-peaks were visible, of a darker blue than the firmament. Sometimes a mist
                  gathered about them all day long, and hid them from sight; again the clouds
                  enveloped them with huge robes of blackness; and then the lightnings flashed from
                  them, as they did from Sinai of old. But at sunset set their appearance was the most pleasing, for
                  red, white, and golden-tinted vapors arrayed them in gorgeous garniture.
               When a boy, I frequently travelled the road which ran through this farm and by the
                  buildings; and I could not help envying the happy possessor and his family, for I
                  knew that by right it belonged to my parents. My mother had often told me of their
                  happiness when it was their own, and the reason they lost it,—tears all the while
                  coursing down her cheeks. But she never alluded to the subject in the presence of
                  my father, for he, poor man, could not bear it. As they had waited for this home
                  so long, and toiled for it so incessantly, and were so happy when they obtained
                  it, they fondly hoped that it would be their only home on earth. Alas! how soon
                  were they doomed to the most cruel disappointment.
               When two years had elapsed, it was alleged that a gross fraud had been practised
                  upon my father, by the man who sold him the farm, and the purchase money must be
                  repaid, or the place given up. To raise such a large sum was an impossibility; but
                  he could not relinquish his rights tamely. With the faint hope that he might save
                  his little property, he resolved to contest the claim as long as there was the
                  least reason for hope. It was all in vain, however; after a year spent in costly
                  litigation, he was compelled to relinquish his hard-won and dearly-cherished
                  home.
               My father's name was James Gorden, my mother's, Mary Elwood, and I was christened
                  Elwood Gorden. We lived in the town of Dunfield. The reverse of fortune affected
                  my father more than my mother, for he had toiled fourteen long years, bending all
                  his energies toward one object; and now, to have the fruit of that labor swept
                  away at once was too much. The long period of doubt, followed by the fearful
                  reality, robbed him of health and strength, leaving him as helpless as a little
                  child.
               I was an infant when our fortune was thus doubly wrecked. My mother was now well
                  aware that our support must depend upon her energies alone. She had a brave heart,
                  and immediately formed her plans and carried them into effect.
               Two miles from the farm, near a small cotton factory, she rented part of a
                  tenement, and we removed there. Many bushels of grain and other provision, which
                  the generous land, once ours but now lost, had yielded for our support, were
                  carried with us to our new home; but, at the end of a year, the whole was
                  consumed. During this period my mother had devoted her time to the care of her
                  husband and child. She succeeded, however, in earning a few dollars with her
                  needle, by encroaching upon the hours of sleep.
               As our food was exhausted, some means must be found of purchasing more, or we must
                  apply to the town, and be sent to the alms-house. When my father was made to
                  understand our actual condition dition,
                  the effect upon him was beneficial. Weak and desponding, he left his bed, and
                  devoted himself to the care of his child. Relieved in a measure of two burdens, my
                  mother resolved to seek for employment in the factory. After some delay, her
                  services were engaged for the dress-room,—the place she preferred, for she could
                  return to her family at an earlier hour than if she worked in any other room.
               My father's heart rebelled against this arrangement; but there was no alternative,
                  and he must submit. The cross was laid upon him, to see the wife whom he dearly
                  loved performing the daily task of a mill-girl, besides attending faithfully to
                  the numerous wants of her household. He felt that her constitution was not
                  sufficiently robust for such unremitting toil. But she persevered, although it was
                  hard to be compelled to do so much. She often returned home weary and dispirited;
                  but her aching heart was soothed and comforted by the love of her husband and
                  child.
               Thus engaged, years passed away, no word of complaint escaping my mother's lips.
                  My father suffered much, but he was comforted with the assurance, that,
                  notwithstanding all our hardships, my mother felt that she had much to be thankful
                  for. She had visited houses, in her lifetime, which contained every material
                  comfort that heart could desire and yet, there was so much coldness, and such a
                  lack of love and sympathy, that she preferred her own humble lot to one of those
                  cheerless palaces.

                           Pierce into that; but I can see his pride
                           Peep through each part of him: Whence has he that?
                           If not from hell, the devil is a niggard;

                           "Away to heaven, respective lenity,
                           And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now."
                        
                     
                     KING HENRY FOURTH.
                  
               
               WHEN I was four years old, my father had in a measure recovered his health. He
                  had, previous to his marriage, labored beyond his strength, and, for many months
                  after the loss of his property, it was doubtful whether he would ever be well
                  again. That he improved so slowly was no marvel. As soon as the physician would
                  consent, he secured a situation in the factory, and it was no longer requisite
                  that my mother should perform double labor. Her release was opportune, for she
                  could not have held out much longer, her physical energies being continually
                  over-taxed.
               When I was five, my only sister was born, who was immediately christened Lissy. We
                  were very poor when the little helpless stranger made her appearance; but she was
                  none the less fondly welcomed. What a
                  treasure she was to me! a perpetual source of enjoyment! and I never wearied of
                  playing with her. We grew up to manhood and womanhood, loving each other dearly,
                  and our affection is warm to-day. I was her only brother, and she my only sister.
                  Our dear parents idolized us both.
               One fourth of a mile from our home lived a family by the name of Windsor. They
                  were considered wealthy, and they were so, for country people. When Mr. Windsor
                  married, a farm was his only property, and its value was much less than that of my
                  father. Two relatives dying soon after, he inherited from their estates an amount
                  sufficient to make him worth twenty thousand dollars. He was so elated by this
                  good fortune as to feel that his neighbors were beneath him, especially my
                  parents, who were among the poorest.
               Mr. Windsor had two children, Thomas and Marion. Thomas was two years older than
                  myself, and Marion a year older than my sister Lissy. We attended the same school,
                  were often in the same classes, played together at all seasons, and for years were
                  mutually fond of each other's company. I often questioned myself as to which I
                  loved best, Marion Windsor or Lissy Gorden; and I was equally unable to decide
                  which was the prettiest. Lissy's eyes were of a very deep blue, her cheeks red and
                  hair flaxen; while Marion had gray eyes, and soft glossy hair of a dark brown.
                  Many and many a time, when we were children, did I wind it around my finger,
                  wondering how it could be so beautiful and so silky to the touch. Marion's face
                  had but little color, and yet it was very lovely in expression, showing a pure
                  heart and warm affections. A casual glance, or a close study, convinced the
                  observer that she was a good and happy child.
               Before the lapse of many years, I began to perceive a change in Thomas Windsor. It
                  was gradual, but by and by the ugly fact stood out just as plainly as though it
                  had been sudden. In his intercourse with Lissy and me, he became distant,
                  reserved, and haughty. His conduct, however, scarcely disturbed my equanimity, for
                  I knew that in all the essentials of a noble character I was in no respect his
                  inferior. He desired his sister to withdraw herself entirely from our society, but
                  she heeded not his aristocratic wish.
               The winter that I was fourteen, Thomas' deportment had become insufferably
                  overbearing, while Marion was more intimate with Lissy and me than with any other
                  children. The boys and girls used to assemble on a high hill, for the purpose of
                  enjoying the exhilarating sport of "coasting." Almost invariably Marion coasted
                  with me, and thus early I knew that I loved her. The reader may smile, and say
                  that it was only a boy's love. Be it so; but the passion has never known any
                  abatement to this day. Ah, Lissy! dear as you were to me, and fondly cherished, I
                  could now decide which I regarded as the
                  most beautiful. That it gave you pain, when you perceived another was winning my
                  affections, so that you could no longer hold the first or even an equal place in
                  my heart, I never doubted. Poor as we were, and with but few friends, I could well
                  understand the value to you of a brother's love.
               I was a better scholar than Thomas Windsor, and that made him envious, for he
                  desired to exhibit superiority in all things. Hard study availed him not, for I
                  distanced him in every branch we engaged in. I was aware that he hated me for
                  it.
               On a certain day, never to be forgotten, Mr. Windsor visited the school,
                  accompanied by strangers. Thomas and I were anxious to excel, and so we did our
                  best. My success was more decided than ever, and I noticed that the strange
                  gentlemen regarded me with interest. Mr. Windsor's face wore an expression of
                  mingled vexation and anger. When I caught his eye, I realized that he was my
                  enemy.
               That night, when we left school, Thomas was in no amiable mood. A number of us
                  went to the hill, for the purpose of coasting; and, after we arrived there, I
                  asked Marion to coast with me. She was about to comply with my request, when
                  Thomas told her that she must not.
               "Why may I not slide with Elwood?" she asked.
               "For the best of reasons, if I chose to give them," he replied; "but I want you to
                  slide with me."
               "Well, I shall not, if you do, for Elwood asked me first," she said.
               "That is right, Marion," I remarked. "Hop on, and we'll soon see which will go the
                  fastest."
               "You had better attend to your own sister, and let mine alone," said Thomas.
               "My sister is well provided for," I replied; "and, if she were not, possibly I
                  could attend to them both."
               "You are getting to be a little too large for your boots," he exclaimed.
               "And so are you, sir," I retorted.
               "My sister shall not associate with such a mean fellow as you, Elwood Gorden, if I
                  can prevent it," said Thomas. "She has done it too long, already."
               "Why, Thomas Windsor!" said Marion, "you ought to be ashamed of yourself. Elwood
                  is not a mean fellow, and you know it; he is real good, every body says."
               "Every body don't say it, for I don't," said Thomas. "You may praise
                  him as much as you like,—who cares? Perhaps you will be his wife, some day, and
                  then he can send you into the mill to maintain him, as his father did
                     his wife."
               "You are a wicked boy," said Marion, "and I will never love you any more,—see if I
                  do."
               "And I care but little if you don't," he rejoined. "if you are so intimate with a
                  beggar."
               
               "Beggar!" I said with much heat, "beggar! Thomas Windsor, why do you call me a
                  beggar?"
               "You can see the house where you live," he said, pointing with his finger; "it is
                  no great shakes, any way, and there are two families besides yours in it. If I
                  lived so meanly, I would not hold my head quite so high."
               "We are poor," I replied with suppressed anger, "but honest. We are not beggars,
                  though; we never have been beggars; and, unless God so wills it, we never shall
                  be."
               "That is true," said Marion, "and Thomas is very wicked for saying such things.
                  But don't you mind him, Elwood. I love you a great deal better than I do him."
               "You and I shall never quarrel, Marion," I said, "even if your brother does abuse
                  me. We shall always be friends."
               "Friends!" cried Thomas, contemptuously. "My sister will be taught to seek her
                  friends among her equals, and not among the low and vulgar."
               "Thomas Windsor," I said, "quit your insults at once, or you may have reason to be
                  sorry. I am as good as you, and more than your equal. Who did best at school
                  to-day, you or I? Mind is better than wealth, a thousand times; and, if you have
                  more of the latter, I have more of the former."
               "You are a great brag," he said, "and I always knew it. What a giant mind you
                  have! Daniel Webster will be cast into the shade one of these days. But, unluckily
                  for you, sir, some of the greatest dunces learn the easiest. There, El. Gorden,
                  you have tried to frighten me,—see what you've got by it,—guess I shall say what I
                  please."
               "I am afraid you will get to fighting," interposed Marion. "Let us have a slide,
                  Elwood. I am sorry my brother uses you so; he does very wrong." And the tears
                  flowed from her beautiful eyes.
               "And one great dunce would be very glad to learn as easily as I. He made such a
                  complete failure, to-day, and was so mortified, that he is more ugly than
                  usual,—which is needless," I could not help retorting.
               "You are an impudent puppy, and a low-lived dog, El. Gorden; and, if you give me
                  any more of your sauce, I'll whip you soundly. You talk in this way
                  to me, when your mother had to work in the factory to maintain you
                  and your lazy, shiftless father!"
               By this taunt I was greatly exasperated, and could endure Tom's insolence no
                  longer; so I sprang toward him, and with one blow laid him senseless at my
                  feet.
               With a wild cry Marion ran to him, and took his head upon her lap, and tried to
                  recall him to life. "You have killed him!" she said, "my own dear brother. O! I
                  will never love you any more, you cruel,
                  wicked boy! I shall hate you always!"
               In a sort of stupor I listened to her words; but, as Thomas did not move, I felt
                  alarmed. Breaking through the crust, I sprinkled the soft snow upon his deathly
                  pale face. He soon revived, and, with the help of his sister, arose to his feet. I
                  expected an attack from him as soon as he should sufficiently recover, and so I
                  was ready to defend myself. He seemed in no wise anxious for a fight, but regarded
                  me with loathing and contempt. He had supposed, as he was older, that he could
                  whip me with ease; but, as my fist had made a very sudden acquaintance with his
                  head, and proved a little too hard for it, he had no inclination to run the risk
                  of another blow. When he and Marion started for home, she was crying bitterly.
               "I do not like you, Elwood," she said, "and I never will slide with you again,
                  never!"
               I knew that the blame lay with her brother, and angrily replied: "I don't want you
                  to love me, and you may keep your liking to yourself, and welcome. I won't ask you
                  to slide with me again, for I shall take my own dear sister, who is enough better
                  than you."
               I stood and watched them for a while; then, taking Lissy by the hand, started for
                  home. I made her promise that she would say nothing about the quarrel to my
                  parents, for, though I had no intention of keeping it from them, I chose to inform
                  them myself. That evening was the most gloomy I had ever experienced, and I
                  retired early. In the silence of my chamber I communed with my own thoughts. I
                  felt that Marion had been very unjust. She had censured Thomas as much as had I;
                  and, when I punished his scurrility, after extreme patience on my part and fierce
                  threats from him, she ought not to have been so much offended. She did not like
                  me, she had said, and I had replied that she might keep her liking to herself, and
                  welcome; and yet, O consistency! I was so much attached to her, loved her so well,
                  that I wept myself to sleep.

                           By violent swiftness, that which we run at,

               THAT I had committed a grave offence in the eyes of Mr. Windsor, in thus rashly
                  punishing a rich man's son, I had no doubt. I knew he would demand the most ample
                  satisfaction, and its nature I could well surmise. Money he could not have, even
                  if willing to receive it. To make a sufficient atonement, my back must be bared to
                  the rod, and the weapon of torture and disgrace be applied with excessive
                  severity. Ever afterwards his influence would be exerted against me in every shape
                  whereby he could do me injury. But the thought of these things occasioned me less
                  anxiety than the words of that little girl, who had called me "a wicked, cruel
                  boy," and said she would "never love me again," but should "hate me always." If
                  she and myself were reconciled, I could face the others like a man.
               In the morning, I informed my parents of what had occurred. They regretted that I
                  had struck the saucy fellow, but they did not censure me.
               When Thomas Windsor and his sister arrived at home, he told the story of his
                  beating, but falsified it much. According to his account, I was the aggressor.
                  When he had finished, Mr. Windsor was much enraged, and threatened to send me to
                  prison.
               Marion listened to her brother with much surprise, for she had not supposed him a
                  slanderer and liar; and, when she heard her father say, in his wrath, that I
                  should go to prison and stay there, she was greatly agitated.
               "Father," she said, "Thomas has not told you the truth."
               "Just like her," said Thomas, "to stick up for Elwood Gorden. She likes him a
                  thousand times better than she does her own brother."
               "In what respect has he deviated from the truth?" inquired Mr. Windsor.
               "Don't ask her," said Thomas, "for she will say any thing to screen him."
               "Silence," said Mr. Windsor, "and answer only when I speak to you. Come, Marion,
                  let us have your version of the story; for, before I take any steps to punish
                  Elwood, I want the whole truth."
               By this time Marion was sobbing bitterly, and it was some minutes before she was
                  able to comply with her father's commands. She finally gave a plain, unvarnished narrative of the facts,—for
                  Marion Windsor could give no other.
               "I am surprised, Thomas," said Mr. Windsor, "that you should be guilty of such
                  falsehoods. The excited state of your feelings is your only excuse. It will be
                  impossible to send Elwood to prison, but he must be punished. He may plead insult
                  in justification, but that shall not save him; a person of his standing in life
                  must not be allowed to strike a child of mine with impunity. He shall expiate the
                  offence by submitting to a well-merited castigation, and it must be something more
                  than boy's play. Since he is so fond of striking, he shall learn the delights of
                  being struck. As for you, children, I forbid your associating with the Gordens any
                  longer. They are mere paupers, at best, whom nobody, who is anybody, thinks any
                  thing of. I ought to have put a stop to the acquaintance ere this."
               "I don't want to associate with them," said Thomas. "I have scarcely noticed them
                  this long while, and should not have done so at all, if Marion had only kept clear
                  of that rascal Elwood."
               "Well," said Mr. Windsor, "Marion is young, and therefore excusable; but she knows
                  what my commands are now, and must obey."
               "I am real glad she must," said Thomas, "for she likes El. Gorden and Liss. better
                  than anybody else who attend school."
               "Is that true, Marion?" inquired her father.
               "I like them very much," she answered. "Lissy is always kind to everybody."
               "But don't you know that you ought not to associate with people in their
                  circumstances?"
               "And why may I not associate with them? I think them all very good."
               "They may be clever, with the exception of that ruffianly boy; but that is not the
                  point. Look at their position, in society: why, it's a great deal below par."
               "You mean, that they are very poor."
               "To be sure. The wealthy never associate with people in such a low station as
                  theirs. The two classes move in different spheres. Those things which prove amply
                  sufficient for the poor fail to satisfy the rich, and so they must be kept
                  separate."
               "But, if the poor behave as well, are they not just as good?" pursued the little
                  casuist.
               "You don't seem to understand the matter, Marion. When you are older, you will be
                  better able to make proper distinctions."
               "I am afraid I never shall, for I love Lissy Gorden just as well as though her
                  folks were worth millions."
               "Well, we shall teach you to keep in your place, and she must learn to keep in
                  hers. You are but children, now, and some things may be overlooked. You will soon
                  be a young lady, Marion, and I trust you will conform to your parents' precepts,
                  and not manifest a vulgar taste by associating with those whose rank is far beneath yours. Society
                  makes very nice distinctions, and they must be heeded, at least by my family. Why,
                  child, Lissy Gorden's mother was obliged to work in the factory, to keep them from
                  starving."
               "I know it, but is she any worse for that? She don't seem so to me; I think her a
                  good woman. Lissy told me the reason that her mother had to work in the factory.
                  Mr. Gorden was not to blame at all, but somebody was,—it was too bad. I couldn't
                  help crying when she told me about it. The man who did the wrong will get his
                  punishment, I guess. I hope he will, for he ought to."
               At these words Mr. Windsor changed color, and his lips trembled as he attempted to
                  speak.
               "Well, Marion, you beat all," said Mrs. Windsor. "I had no idea that you were
                  forming such low tastes. I shall see to you, hereafter, myself. It would not
                  surprise me now to hear you say that you thought Elwood Gorden the best boy in the
                  neighborhood."
               "Madam, please not to interfere," said Mr. Windsor, austerely, addressing his
                  wife. "I intend to settle this matter myself. Woman has her proper sphere, and man
                  his. Everything which does not relate to her own domestic concerns, which she
                  touches, she only complicates. Silence on the part of a woman, when cases like
                  this occur, is the best argument she can offer. And so you think Elwood Gorden a
                  very fine fellow, Marion?"
               "She likes him better than she does me," said Thomas. "She is always a-sliding
                  with him."
               "Do you like a boy that knocks down your own brother?" inquired Mr. Windsor.
               "I do not like him for that, and I told him so," replied the noble girl. "But he
                  has always been good to me, and he is the best scholar in school."
               "This conversation has continued long enough," said Mr. Windsor. "Hereafter, your
                  associates must be from a different class. As to that young ruffian, I will see
                  that he is punished as he deserves."
               That night one little heart was very sad. In its moments of resentment, it fancied
                  that it had shut me out; but I was there still. Marion was grieved that I had
                  struck her brother, but she regretted saying that she should always hate me. She
                  felt anxious because of her father's threatened correction; and, when her lips
                  moved in prayer before she slept, I was sweetly remembered.
               The next day, at school, I saw that Marion shunned Lissy and myself. I soon
                  discerned that she was watched closely by her brother. In the afternoon, those
                  speaking eyes were repeatedly fixed upon my face, and their expression manifested
                  more sympathy and good will than hatred.
               During the day, Mr. Windsor called upon my parents, and was very abusive,
                  demanding that I should be most severely whipped. My father would not consent thus
                  to degrade me. He was so much of a Christian as to tell Mr. Windsor that he would have had me submit to tenfold
                  the insults heaped upon me, rather than that I should punish the aggressor so
                  violently; still, the provocation was very great, and no chastisement could be
                  submitted to. Mr. Windsor went home in a rage.
               For some years after this, we were subjected to much persecution and to mean,
                  petty annoyances. Mr. Windsor had the power to do us injury, because we were poor
                  and he was rich. An agreement had been made between my father and a Mr. Manning, a
                  relative of Mr. Windsor, that, as soon as school closed, I should be taken as his
                  apprentice to learn the carpenter's trade. He immediately sent us word that he had
                  concluded to dispense with my services. Mr. Windsor owned stock in the factory;
                  and he succeeded, by false representations, in procuring my father's dismissal.
                  This was a great misfortune, and caused us much suffering, so that we often went
                  supperless to bed. Slanders against my mother were put into circulation, which
                  went the rounds for a time, while many in town were made to believe that I was a
                  graceless scamp. These trials we bore with all the philosophy we could summon. I
                  often thought that, had I foreseen what my parents and sisters were to suffer
                  because of the rash manifestation of my resentment, Thomas Windsor might have
                  insulted me until his malice had spent itself.

                           "Forgive me, Valentine; if hearty sorrow
                           Be a sufficient ransom for offence, I tender it here."
                        
                     
                     TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA.
                  
               
               I HAD no opportunity to speak to Marion for some days after the quarrel, for her
                  brother was ever watching us. At last, as what I considered good
                  fortune would have it, though bad for him, he was taken sick with a
                  fever; and for the remainder of the term I improved opportunities.
               When I first addressed the dear girl,—one noon-time,—she hesitated to reply, as
                  though she was fearful that some one was listening, or that it would be wrong for
                  her to do so. But my impetuous nature would not brook delay. Although her eyes had
                  beamed a full assurance that she bore me no ill will, yet I must hear it from her
                  own lips.
               "Marion," I asked, "do you still hate me?"
               "No, Elwood," she replied. "I felt angry with you when I said that."
               "I am very glad that you do not. Your parents and brother hate me?"
               "I fear that they do."
               "If you feel kindly toward Lissy and me, why do you shun us?"
               
               "Because," she answered, almost weeping, "because—father says I must."
               "I feared as much. It is too bad, Marion."
               "I know it is. You will not hate me because my parents are your enemies?"
               "O no!"
               "Do you like me, Elwood?"
               "Yes, dear Marion; and, even though you cannot talk with me much, I shall always
                  love you dearly. Don't forget or dislike me, will you?"
               "No, no, Elwood, I cannot."
               "I am sorry that I struck your brother, but he was very insulting."
               "I know he was. I wish you had curbed your temper; but still I like you, just the
                  same."
               "You are a good girl, Marion. Will you tell me what was said the night after the
                  quarrel?"
               "Yes, if you will go into the school-house, where we can talk
                  uninterruptedly."
               I did as Marion requested. She had an excellent memory, and related to me the
                  bitter speeches of her brother and father, already detailed.
               When she had finished, I asked her if she meant strictly to heed her parents'
                  commands, and hereafter to hold no intercourse with Lissy and me.
               "O, I know not what to do," she said. "I wish to obey my parents, but it is hard
                  to slight those I love the best."
               "It is not right," I replied.
               "I know it is not, and yet it seems dreadful to disobey my father."
               "It was wrong for him to utter such a command, very wrong. It is unnatural to shun
                  those we love most. God does not require that."
               "I can't attend the same school, and never speak to you or dear Lissy at all; but
                  we must be less intimate than we were."
               "I know it, Marion. If we are very cautious, your parents may never be the wiser.
                  I said harsh things in reply to your words which sounded so unjust; but forgive
                  me, won't you?"
               At this moment the teacher entered, and our conversation ended. It was resumed
                  afterwards, however, and continued frequently, while the term lasted. But, as we
                  were only children, much of our chit-chat would not be worth transcribing.

                           "Good Mistress Page, for that I love your daughter
                           In such a righteous fashion as I do,
                           Perforce, against all checks, rebukes, and manners,
                           I must advance the colors of my love,
                           And not retire."
                        
                     
                     MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR.
                  
               
               IT was a serious disappointment to me and my parents, when Mr. Manning sent word
                  that he could not receive me as an apprentice. As my father was too poor to give
                  me a liberal education, it was early decided that I should learn a trade. He had
                  often talked over the matter with me, and I uniformly expressed a liking for the
                  trade of a carpenter. The reason was, that I had exercised my ingenuity, with such
                  rude tools as I could get, in constructing water-wheels, which were swiftly turned
                  by a brook running near our house. I had also made shelves for the few books that
                  we possessed; a neat chest for my clothes; taken off one of the old doors to the
                  house and replaced it with a new one; and executed many other jobs in a neat and
                  workmanlike manner.
               My parents were desirous that I should be apprenticed prenticed to some one in
                  Dunfield, and as near home as possible. Mr. Manning lived but a mile from our
                  house; and, as he had the reputation of being a kind and indulgent master, we
                  considered ourselves very fortunate in the engagement. But, through the
                  machinations of Mr. Windsor, our pleasing plans were all overturned.
               The next winter was long and severe. It was for us a period of trial, as my father
                  could find employment only a small portion of the time.
               In the spring, affairs looked more hopeful. In spite of Mr. Windsor's ill will, my
                  father's services were in continual demand, while the neighboring farmers gave me
                  enough to do in the planting season. Our home again smiled with plenty. No longer
                  did we close our eyes in sleep to dream of tables groaning with an abundance,
                  which some evil spirit prevented us from reaching, or which ever vanished as our
                  hands approached.
               Early that summer, a carpenter, by the name of Mackay, moved into our
                  neighborhood. He was an excellent man, of indomitable perseverance and superior
                  business tact. He frequently employed my father; and in time became so friendly
                  toward me as to lend me his tools whenever I wished them. He seemed to like me
                  very much, and often invited me to his house. He asked me, one day, in the
                  presence of my father, what occasion I had to use carpenter's tools so often. I
                  blushed, but made no reply. My father here remarked that I was quite a genius, in my way, but
                  excessively modest about it.
               "Does he construct what he undertakes without much difficulty?" inquired Mr.
                  Mackay.
               "I don't know as I am an impartial judge," replied my father, "but I think he
                  does. He has always had a passion for making something ever since he could hold a
                  jack-knife. He began by whittling out playthings for himself and sister, and now
                  he makes any thing he sets his mind upon."
               "I am glad to hear this of you, Elwood," said Mr. Mackay; "and, with your leave, I
                  will examine the evidences of your skill."
               My heart was palpitating wildly when he accompanied me home. According to his
                  request, I showed him all the different articles I had manufactured. He examined
                  them critically, and, as I could well perceive, with much interest. When he had
                  finished, he asked me if I had ever worked with a carpenter.
               I replied in the negative.
               "You are, then," he said, "a natural mechanic, and I want you to go to work with
                  me immediately. What say you to that?"
               "O, I should like it above all things," I replied.
               "Spoken like a man. Now let us return and see your father, for you have the genius
                  to make your way in the world."
               "Do you think so?"
               "I don't think,—I know. I have always liked you, Elwood,
                  and I expect to see you grow up to be an excellent citizen and an enterprising
                  man. If your father is willing, you shall go to work with me at once."
               My father was immediately made acquainted with Mr. Mackay's wishes. "I have
                  learned your history," he said to him, "and it interested me much. Your fortune
                  has indeed been a hard one. To earn money as you did, by the most severe toil, and
                  lose it all without any fault of your own, is very trying to the stoutest heart.
                  Such rascality is shameful, and the men who practise it are a set of thorough
                  scoundrels. If everybody estimated them as I do, their number would speedily
                  decrease. You have an influential enemy, I hear, Mr. Gorden, and you may always
                  count upon me as a friend in any emergency. I hope that better days are in store
                  for you. Your son is a natural mechanic; and, were I as avaricious as some men. I
                  should try to secure his services on the usual terms for apprentices. I am willing
                  to do much better than, and pay him wages from the first, letting him board with
                  you when convenient. I will teach him all I know myself, and then I must be
                  content to be 'left in the lurch,' as the saying is; for, if he applies himself,
                  he will surely outstrip me."
               My father shook Mr. Mackay's hand warmly; he was scarcely able to express his
                  gratification in words.
               For my own part, I had never been so happy in all my life. I could now learn the trade I
                  preferred; remain at home; and at the same time aid my parents.
               The matter was satisfactorily arranged, and I commenced work under as faithful and
                  kind a master as ever boy had. My success was greater than even he or I
                  anticipated; and, by the time I was twenty-one, father and myself had twelve
                  hundred dollars in the savings bank.
               I attended school two or three months every winter, and by earnest diligence
                  obtained a better education than many whose opportunities were greatly superior.
                  Thomas Windsor was kept at school nearly all of the time, but he was not able to
                  enter college until he was twenty-one.
               Seldom could I obtain an interview with Marion. Neither of us outgrew our childish
                  love. She was only fifteen, when we met one day, by accident, in the beautiful
                  little cemetery of Dunfield. A strange place—the reader will say—to make love in;
                  and yet I fancy that it has been done by older people than we were. It was a
                  lovely day, and we were both glad to meet thus. We were soon seated in a retired
                  spot, and conversed at our leisure.
               "I am so happy to see you once more, Elwood," she said, leaning her head upon my
                  arm. That arm soon stole round her waist, and our hands were locked.
               "It is strange that we should meet thus," I replied, "but some irresistible power
                  drew me here to-day."
               "And I felt that I must come, though I am sure I can't tell why."
               "Are your parents as hostile to me as ever?"
               "Yes, dear Elwood, and I fear their hatred increases. Thomas writes to them that,
                  if they are not careful, I shall one day be your bride. They try to make me say I
                  dislike you, but I cannot do that, for it would be untrue."
               "Your words give me courage. Don't let them set you against me, Marion."
               "That they can never do. I have always loved you, and I always shall."
               "And this heart can bear no image but yours. I have great fears in relation to
                  you, Marion. As soon as you are a little older, your parents will wish you to
                  marry; they will desire to unite you to some wealthy man, and not to a poor
                  mechanic."
               "I shall never consent to it, say what they will. They may command, but in that
                  matter I shall disobey. You are very kind to me, notwithstanding father and mother
                  dislike you so much. They have injured your parents and yourself all that they
                  could, Elwood."
               "I know it, Marion; and I have forgiven them for your sake."
               "I am so glad! And have you forgiven me for saying that I should always hate
                  you?"
               "Yes, dear, long ago. That was a trifle to forgive give. Those who love much will forget and forgive,
                  not only little things, but great things."
               "And you have forgiven great things for my sake, dear Elwood. You have been made
                  to suffer because you liked me, and O! you may be compelled to suffer much
                  more."
               "I know it, my own; and, could the blows of enmity reach me alone, I would not
                  murmur. You say that I have suffered. Alas! have you not suffered as much? I doubt
                  not you have, Marion; and I believe you will be true. Therefore, if your parents
                  remain inflexibly opposed to me, I fear for you greatly. The future looks
                  dark."
               "I know it, Elwood; but love shall yet brighten all the clouds."
               "Heaven grant that it may be so! I have great faith in such love as I believe ours
                  to be; were it not for this, I should despair."
               "So have I, dear Elwood; and I will die before I will marry another! I am very
                  young, I know, and my parents command me not to see you at all, on pain of their
                  displeasure. These clandestine meetings are not to my liking; but what other
                  course is open to us? It may be wrong, but I cannot, will not obey them, and they
                  ought not to command me to slight and shun the one I so dearly love."
               "Some parents are as cruel as death," I replied, bitterly. "Hearts must be
                  sacrificed to wealth or station. I abhor such sentiments."
               "They are very unjust, Elwood; but for my sake, do not hate my parents. They have
                  done much for me, and have claims upon me for reverence and affection. I love
                  them, and wish you could love them too. I don't expect that, while they ill treat
                  you; but pray don't return evil for evil."
               "Well, I will not. But could you be happy with me in an humble home?"
               "O yes, I would rather live with you in a rude cottage than to dwell in a palace
                  without you. Your fortune I would share gladly, whatever it may be. As young as I
                  am, I have thought of it much, and there is no true happiness for me without
                  you."
               "Bless you, my dear one, bless you! Let your parents threaten as they may, you
                     shall be mine, Heaven willing; and, if I have health, I will
                  provide you with a home that neither your parents nor yourself shall be ashamed
                  of."
               "Of that I feel confident. I have heard with pride of your great mechanical skill.
                  It vexes my father much that you should succeed so well."
               "I see plainly that his hatred is implacable. Be it so; our faithful love shall
                  conquer all things."
               "So it shall, dear Elwood; and, with that belief, we can keep up good courage. But
                  I must not tarry longer now, for my parents suspect that I still love you, and
                  that we sometimes meet, in spite of their watching and spying."
               "When shall we meet again?"
               
               "Can you come here in exactly two weeks?"
               "Yes, dear Marion, but it seems an age."
               "Be cheerful, Elwood, and the days of our separation will soon be over."
               With a long, lingering farewell, and more than one unspoken salute,
                  we left the cemetery, and returned to our respective homes.

               WHEN I commenced learning my trade, I had one great purpose in view,—it was, to
                  help my father repurchase the farm he had lost. I informed Mr. Mackay of the
                  project. It pleased him much, and he promised his assistance.
               "You are a noble fellow," he said; "and, if success is not yours, it shall not be
                  for want of a helping hand from me."
               He kept his word faithfully, and I astonished my parents more than once by
                  carrying home a large sum of money. When they proposed purchasing a small farm, I
                  opposed it. They acquiesced, but thought it strange that I was unwilling to aid
                  them in securing a more comfortable and more permanent home than the tumble-down
                  tenement we occupied. My sister censured
                  my course, for she felt, and rightly too, that the "old folks" ought to have a
                  good place in which to pass their old age. With Mr. Mackay's advice I kept my own
                  counsel, and worked on diligently.
               My employer, being an excellent business man, had accumulated a handsome property.
                  When I was twenty-one, my mechanical abilities were vastly superior to his. On
                  that day he presented me a splendid copy of Shakspeare, and very generously
                  offered to take me into partnership. I accepted his offer without a moment's
                  hesitation. We were more than usually successful, and at the end of a year, I had
                  money sufficient for my contemplated purchase. The owner of the farm—or more
                  properly, the occupant, for he had never half paid for it—was very willing to sell
                  all the land and buildings, also the stock and farming tools.
               The money that I had earned had been placed in the savings bank in my name. I
                  frequently had my own book and father's likewise in my possession. When the day
                  arrived for the payment of the purchase-money, I withdrew our joint savings,
                  consummated the bargain, and received a deed. The house was then completely
                  repaired according to my directions. Under the superintendence of Mrs. Mackay,—who
                  became deeply interested in the plot,—it was thoroughly cleansed, from attic to
                  cellar; new furniture was procured; and a day fixed for the removal thither of my
                  parents and sister.
               The morning of that day was exceedingly beautiful, and I invited our family to a
                  ride. As soon as we had left, our humble household goods were packed up and taken
                  to the dear, familiar farm-house. At noon we stopped at a hotel, took dinner, and
                  spent considerable time in viewing a beautiful village cemetery, not far away.
                  Having remained as long as was necessary in order to arrive at tea-time, we
                  started on our return; but in due season I changed the course, and drove in the
                  direction of the farm.
               When we had almost reached there, I informed the family that I had agreed to call
                  at the "old place," and take supper, for our friends the Mackays were there. This
                  they thought very strange; but, before many questions could be asked, I drove up
                  to the door. What questions they did ask, however, it taxed all my shrewdness and
                  Yankee circumlocution so to evade that they should not suspect any thing until all
                  was ready for the denouement.
               
               Our friends came out to welcome us with beaming faces. They invited us into the
                  parlor, and, soon after, to tea. As we sat down at the table, my mother said:
               "Why, Mr. Mackay, when did you move here?"
               "Not long since," he replied.
               "I must say, that you keep your movements very secret."
               "Very true, our move-ments," he answered smilingly.
               
               "And so this is your old home, mother," observed Lissy. "It is a nice place,—I
                  wish that I could live here."
               "It seems like the happy old times to be here once more, don't it, Mary?" asked my
                  father.
               "Yes, James," she replied tremulously, almost weeping. "We were happy here; but
                  the bitterness of privation is passed, and I am reconciled. We lost our home,—a
                  beautiful home, too,—but God gave us two as good children as ever blest a
                  household."
               "Very true, Mary," replied my father. "What a hard lot was yours, immediately
                  after our great misfortune. There are many furrows on your face which would not
                  have been there, but for the villany that was practised towards us. Thank God, we
                  are quite happy again!"
               "Having overcome all your troubles," said Mrs. Mackay, "I heartily sympathize with
                  you, for your last days shall be your best."
               "I hope they will have a better home than they have now," said Lissy, glancing at
                  me.
               "I hope so, too," said Mr. Mackay, "for they deserve it."
               "That is what I have always told Elwood," said Lissy.
               The conversation was now ingeniously turned, by Mr. Mackay, to the farm, the
                  quality of the soil, the number of acres of woodland which my father left, and
                  other items of like nature.
               Mr. and Mrs. Mackay and Lissy ate quite heartily ily, especially the latter; but
                  father, mother, and myself had little appetite. Their thoughts were busy with the
                  scenes of their old home and their trials since; while my heart swelled with
                  emotions of a peculiar and indescribable nature. Our friends pressed me to eat,
                  and mother said she was fearful that I was unwell.
               When supper was ended, Mrs. Mackay and Lissy went into the kitchen, and the latter
                  immediately exclaimed:
               "Why, mother! how much these look like our chairs. I never should know the
                  difference."
               "Nor I either," said Mrs. Mackay.
               Mother immediately went out to see them. The effect of one glance was such that
                  she clung to Lissy for support. An old neighbor, who had been let into the secret,
                  had arranged them, and they looked very much as they did when they stood there
                  twenty years before. Other things now attracted her attention, and she looked
                  keenly at them with a puzzled air, at last exclaiming:
               "These are my things,—I know they are. Say, Lissy, are they not ours?"
               "I should think they were,—I can almost declare they are. Look at the old bellows!
                  I am sure, now."
               Mother turned and gazed at me. Suddenly a new light seemed to break upon her. She
                  sprang and caught me to her heart, exclaiming:
               "This is our home,—O! tell me, Elwood, is it not? You cannot speak: I
                  know it is. O! Elwood, what a joyful
                  surprise is this. So much like you, my dear, dear boy."
               "Is it our home?" said Lissy, clapping her hands. "O! don't say it is not. We can
                  be so happy here."
               I wanted to speak, but found it no easy matter. Finally, I was able to stammer,
                  "It is ours."
               Lissy now caught me round the neck, and thus both mother and sister held me in a
                  close embrace.
               Father was unable at first to comprehend the exciting scene; but, when he did, he
                  was deeply moved. And now each room was visited in turn, and every thing
                  pleasurably examined.
               "Well," said mother, "you have contrived this surprise with great skill, I must
                  confess; I could not have done it better myself."
               "But the mystery to me is," observed father, "where you obtained the money to
                  accomplish all this."
               "Yours and mine combined," I said proudly; "and we are not one cent in debt.
                  Pardon me the liberty I have taken. At the time I withdrew the money from the bank
                  which was placed there to my account, I withdrew yours also, and I have spent the
                  whole except two hundred dollars, which I now return to you."
               "O no," said my father, with much emotion; "keep it, my boy, for it is yours. I do
                  not want it."
               "No, father," I replied, "you may need this and more. I shall not keep it."
               "But where did you get the remainder?" he inquired.
               "I will enlighten you," said Mr. Mackay. "Elwood and I took a large job, which
                  proved a lucky one. The amount which we realized was in proportion to the risk;
                  this, and what we made on smaller contracts, gave him the means to accomplish an
                  object which he long ago set his heart upon."
               "Then that was the reason," said Lissy, "why you opposed the purchase of a small
                  farm. I see that I did you injustice."
               "I have had this project in view for many years," I replied.
               "And nobly have you accomplished it, my dear boy!" exclaimed mother. "O, this pays
                  for all!"
               "For those many hard years of toil, mother," I said, "when the whole burden came
                  upon you? Not yet, but it may."
               We were now in the parlor; and ere long Mrs. Mackay came in, and said that we ate
                  so little at supper, and looked so solemn, she had prepared tea again, and she did
                  hope that we would now eat like Christians. In the best of humor, we all repaired
                  to the table, and this time did ample justice to the good things set before
                  us.
               The evening was spent as joyfully as we could desire, each one feeling excellent reasons for
                  gratitude to Providence.
               The next morning, our friends bade us good-by, leaving a truly delighted family
                  behind. Old neighbors soon flocked in, each with a kind word, and right glad was
                  my father to shake their honest hands again. Lissy was flying hither and thither,
                  all day long, singing as merrily as a lark.
               A few days after, she saw Marion and told her this little history, describing,
                  with a sister's partiality, the part I had acted; and the two gentle girls cried
                  for joy in each other's arms.

                           "For aught that I could ever read,
                           Could ever hear by tale or history,
                           The course of true love never did run smooth;
                           But either it was different in blood;
                           O cross! too high to be enthralled too low!
                           Or else misgraffed in respect of years;
                           O spite! too old to be engag'd too young!
                           Or else it stood upon the choice of friends."
                        
                     
                     MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM.
                  
               
               MARION and I continued our clandestine meetings at different places, as often as
                  we thought it advisable. O, how precious were those moments, and how much we said
                  during them.
               At last Mr. Windsor became aware of our intimacy. He was very wroth, and Marion
                  was obliged to listen to a tirade of abuse, of the most scurrilous and vulgar
                  character. Without my knowledge, she was sent some distance from home, to school.
                  I learned her location in a few days, for she sent a letter to me, addressed under
                  cover to Mr. Mackay. She had taken this precaution, because she feared that, if
                  directed to me, her father might get possession of it. Here is the letter:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "DEAR ELWOOD,—You have learned ere this that I am away from home. My
                              father, by some means, discovered ered our intimacy. O Elwood! you can
                              have no idea how he talked to me; my heart rebels against him now. I
                              did not think he could use such language to his own child,—his only
                              daughter. He says that, if I marry you, he will disown and disinherit
                              me; but I will, let the consequences be what they may. My blood is up
                              now, and I never was so determined before. Don't despair, dearest, for
                              all will yet be well. You must come and see me, but not just yet. * *
                              * * I am pleasantly situated here, and enjoy myself as well as can be
                              expected. New studies engross much of my time, but I cannot win my
                              thoughts from you. Every night, before I close my eyes in sleep, my
                              thoughts ascend to the dear God, asking his blessing and protection
                              for the one who is dearer to me than life.
                           "I know not what stratagems my father has taken; but, if you address
                              your letters to me, they may be intercepted. Please superscribe to my
                              chum, Nellie Wilkins, and then I think they will come safe to your
                              own.
                           
                              "MARION."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Never did a letter receive a fonder welcome. I was very anxious in relation to
                  Marion, for I knew her father to be capable of mean and wicked deeds. I sent a
                  reply immediately, and in a few weeks visited the town where she had been sent. I
                  had written what day I should arrive, and agreed to leave the coach half a mile
                  from the village, and wait for her. The coach had scarcely gone from sight ere she
                  appeared. The ardor of our meeting may be left to the reader's imagination to
                  picture.
               When I left home, I did not design being absent more than two or three days; but
                  the golden hours which we spent together were too precious to be relinquished so
                  soon. Every evening was passed with Marion, and no one was aware of my presence,
                  but Nellie Wilkins.
               After a week, however, I returned to Dunfield. Letters now passed between us twice
                  a week, and their contents were devoured with a pleasure such as lovers only can
                  appreciate.
               But we could not endure a long separation, knowing that no barrier was between us
                  which might not easily be overleaped; and so, after a few months, I made Marion
                  another visit. This time the fates were less propitious, for, Nellie Wilkins
                  having made a confident who proved treacherous, the teacher learned of my
                  presence, and informed Mr. Windsor.
               He came on with all possible speed, ascertained where I boarded, and called upon
                  me. I politely requested him to be seated.
               "Why do you dog the steps of my daughter?" he asked.
               "I do not dog her steps," I replied.
               "But I contend, sir, that you do."
               "And I contend, sir, that I do not."
               "Well, young man, it is rumored that you are determined to marry my daughter,
                  whether I am willing or not."
               "Not an unpardonable sin, I hope, admitting the rumor to be true."
               
               "But, sir, I despise you, and I utterly forbid you to speak to Marion again."
               "If you had a right to command, and you were worthy of obedience, I should give
                  some heed to your words; but, as it is, sir, you might as well spare your tongue
                  and curb your temper."
               "I will put you in prison, sir. This to me? Who do you take yourself to be,
                  sir?"
               "An honest man, Mr. Windsor; and you are aware, I presume, that Pope says such a
                  man is 'the noblest work of God.' Do you ever venture to class yourself in that
                  category?"
               "No matter whether I do or not. Zounds, sir, I can't bear this impudence! You had
                  the audacity once to strike my son, and I have a great mind to break my cane over
                  your head!"
               "Don't attempt that, I beg of you. I am attached to your daughter, and I desire no
                  quarrel with her father. I would much rather be friends with you; but I notify you
                  that I allow no man to strike me with impunity."
               "Attached to my daughter! That's where all the trouble lies. You have succeeded,
                  by your devilish arts, in making her think that she is in love with you. Why don't
                  you seek a companion in the sphere where you belong? I would rather see her
                  married to a town pauper than to yourself!"
               "I don't think you can have your choice, sir. You may use as insulting language as
                  you please. Better that you should heap your abuse upon me, than upon that
                  sensitive being whom any man might well be proud to call his daughter."
               "I should have been proud of her, I doubt not, if it had not been for your
                  machinations, you cunning, low-lived knave! After I have been at all this expense
                  and trouble, you must still follow her here, to discommode me still more. You
                  sha'n't have her, you villain, if you try ever so hard! My daughter shall marry
                  worthy of her parentage, and not some mean cub, who has hardly got a hut to stay
                  in. Keep away from her,—let her alone,—and all trouble will be at an end. But, if
                  you don't, as true as there is a God in heaven, I will make you repent of it!"
               "Mr. Windsor, your threats I regard not. You have already injured me all that you
                  could. I now fear you not in the least. I love your daughter, and she returns my
                  affection. On account of a foolish pride, you would separate us forever. You have
                  not the slightest regard for Marion's happiness, though you know her excellencies
                  and virtues. Your heart is cold and hard and swollen with purse-pride. But you are
                  fighting against true love,—against a wise and tender Providence, that favors
                  constancy,—and you can't succeed."
               "I am fighting a low churl, and I will succeed. Don't flatter
                  yourself that you will ever accomplish your object. Marion knows better than
                  foolishly to throw herself away. I had hoped to find you wise enough to give up this silly pursuit
                  of my only daughter; but there is no reason in you, so I will bid you good-day,
                  sir."
               "Good-day," I replied, "and may God bring you into a better frame of mind."

                     KING HENRY EIGHTH.
                  
               
               AS Mr. Windsor failed to wring a promise from Marion that she would see me no
                  more, he compelled her to return with him to Dunfield. And now commenced a course
                  of treatment which almost entirely alienated her affections from her parents. They
                  took every occasion to mortify her. Bitter words of reproof were dinned in her
                  ears from morning till night, and their every look repelled her. All her steps
                  were watched, and if she corresponded with any one, her letters were read; and so
                  she refused to write at all. At night she was locked into her chamber without a
                  light.
               I tried in vain for a long time to obtain an interview with Marion. One night, at
                  twelve o'clock, I stood under her window. She had arisen from her couch and sat
                  looking out, and she saw me. She noiselessly lifted the sash and said:
               "Elwood, is that you?"
               
               "Yes, dear Marion," I replied.
               "I am so glad that you think of me enough to come here sometimes; but you must be
                  careful, for it is dangerous. Do not run the risk often, will you?"
               "No; but it seems good to be near you, even if I cannot see you. Alas! Marion, I
                  know that you are a captive, a prisoner, now."
               "I hear the maid moving,—you must away. Here is a letter (dropping it down): have
                  you got it?"
               "Yes."
               "Then good-night, dear Elwood."
               "Good-night, dear, dear Marion."
               She shut down the window, and I hastened home to read my precious epistle. I was
                  so glad to receive it, and so much interested in the contents, that I have
                  imagined my readers will thank me for allowing them the privilege of perusing
                  it:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "MY OWN ELWOOD,—Father and myself came directly home from——; and,
                              since then, I have been very closely watched. Would you believe it?—I
                              am locked into my chamber every night, and the lamp taken away. All
                              the windows have been fastened, a screw put through each; but, after
                              all, they are baffled, for I have procured an old screw-driver, and
                              have taken out one of the screws, or else I should be half-smothered
                              in this close room. I take the precaution to restore the screw to its
                              place every morning. As I can open a window, I hope to give you this.
                              I have twice seen you, at night, from my window; but, as I could not
                              then open it, I was unable to speak to you. Dear Elwood, how glad I
                              was to know that you were so near. 'Tis love that draws you hither;
                              but do be careful, dearest. My father's hatred towards you is fearful;
                              I tremble when I remember what he has said. Should he see you here, in
                              a moment of passion, I know not what he might do. It would not
                              surprise me should he shoot you dead, under pretence that he took you
                              for a house-breaker; for, although he is my father, I have learned
                              that his anger is terrible when it is fully roused. Great caution must
                              be exercised.
                           "But I am glad to know that you are sometimes near. As I have seen you
                              looking up to my chamber, I have fancied you my guardian spirit, who
                              would keep all danger away. But these prison-like walls separate us.
                              How monstrous that two hearts, that love so well, should have such
                              barbarous obstacles between them.
                           "I have secured a little night-lamp, but dared not light it until I
                              had carefully put down both curtains, lest the reflection should be
                              seen by some of the family. I shall keep it, and the implement that
                              unfastens my window, carefully concealed.
                           "My home is now a dreary place for me; it has been turned into a
                              prison; and my jailers never give me a kind word, but many cruel ones.
                              I try to keep up good courage, and my heart is brave. You can have no
                              idea how terrible it is every day to face an angry father, and hear
                              the cruel taunts of a mother who has outlived the memory of her young
                              affections. But for your sake, Elwood, I can endure all things. I know
                              that you love me, and that is the anchor of my hope. Let
                              the cruel storm of hatred and malice rage on,—your love shall safely
                              bear me up, so that, God willing, I may arrive at the haven of
                              domestic peace at last.
                           
                           "Are you ever fearful that I shall yield to the wishes of my parents,
                              to escape persecution? If so, dismiss your fears, for I am not moved
                              and shall not be. A clandestine marriage, you have told me repeatedly,
                              is our only hope. It may be so; but I have believed that, when my
                              parents saw my affections irrevocably fixed upon you, they would
                              relent. Let me still cherish this faith. I am sure,
                              Elwood, that all must be well at last, through God's blessing.
                           
                              "From your constant

               With peculiar emotions did I read this letter. I was indignant at the usage Marion
                  received, while I admired her noble, brave spirit, that would not bend or break
                  beneath the heavy burdens which were laid upon it. I kissed the letter again and
                  again, and slept with it near my heart. What a treasure she was to me, and how
                  closely were her heart-strings intertwined with my own!

                     MERCHANT OF VENICE.
                  
               
               AS the "old homestead," which we had regained, was two miles from my place of
                  business, I boarded at Mr. Mackay's. My host and hostess were deeply interested in
                  my love affair, and anxious that I should defeat all the arts of the Windsors, and
                  make Marion my own. In business, success continually crowned our efforts, giving
                  me the assurance that I should ultimately win a competency. When I visited my
                  father's house, which we now called the "old homestead," my heart was gladdened to
                  witness the content and happiness there. Much pride was in my sire's heart, for he
                  was proud of his wife, proud of his children, and proud of his farm. He cultivated
                  the soil on scientific principles, and so he secured excellent crops. He was aided
                  in his work by two men and a boy, the crops being sufficient to remunerate them for their labor, and enable him to
                  live in comparative independence. He delighted to show me his corn, wheat, and
                  fine fields of grass. My mother actually grew younger in appearance after she
                  returned to her old home. How cheerful she was, and what a beautiful expression
                  clothed her earnest, thoughtful face! And Lissy, too, the dear girl,—"the angel of
                  the household,"—she filled our home with sunshine and song.
               It was not often that Marion ventured to address me from her window, for she
                  feared a discovery. Once a fortnight she dropped me down a most welcome
                  letter.
               Not long after her return from school, her brother came home from college,
                  accompanied by a young Southern student, After he had been there a month, the
                  following was the letter I received from Marion:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "DEAR ELWOOD,—My brother returned from college a month since, as you
                              have probably been informed ere this. Very hard things has he said to
                              his sister, since his return, because of her love for you. O! shall I
                              never hear kind words or behold loving faces again? I am sometimes
                              weary of this strife, as no hope yet glimmers in the future.
                           "When you have read the above, will you think I am preparing to yield?
                              I beg you not to harbor such a thought for a moment. While life lasts,
                              I shall be true to you and you alone. Though I may be often weary, I
                              shall not falter.
                           "A young man from South Carolina, a college friend of my brother, came
                              here with him. His father is said to be a very wealthy slaveholder.
                              His name is George Washington Stanton. Very romantic, is it not? He is
                              a high-spirited young gentleman, full of Southern fire, and not any
                              too well stocked with brains. If he is not much superior to other
                              people, he is woefully mistaken; but, whether mistaken or not in his
                              estimate of his abilities and worth, he can never be made to think
                              himself in the wrong, for he knows just little enough to suppose
                              himself well posted on all subjects.
                           "I wish he had spared us this visit, for, however much my parents and
                              brother may like him, I greatly dislike him. Only think, Elwood, to
                              what distinction have I arrived! The very first moment that the eyes
                              of Mr. Stanton beheld me, he thought himself irrecoverably in love.
                              Alas, poor me! I am now subjected to a new persecution. My family are
                              delighted with the idea of my becoming the wife of such an honorable
                              gentleman. Thomas especially favors the scheme, and speaks in glowing
                              terms of Stanton's abilities, his father's wealth, and most
                              aristocratic connections. To hear him talk, you would suppose that, by
                              marrying Stanton, I should occupy a station equal to that of a
                              princess,—being the mistress of hundreds of slaves, whom, of course,
                              God created for no other purpose but to minister to my whims and
                              capricious indolence. Now I have no ambition in that direction; and,
                              if I had, George Washington Stanton would not be the chosen one
                              through whom should flow such exalted distinction. But he
                              is much in love, though, or fancies he is. All day long he is at my
                              side, if he can possibly manage to keep there, while I vainly try to
                              shake him off. Don't talk to me of the indomitable perseverance of the
                              Yankees, after this. Let them look at this noble Southron, and hide
                                 their diminished heads. O,
                              those leaden black eyes! they stare at me by the hour, like an owl's.
                              They have a wonderful power over me, producing an effect which nothing
                              else ever did, for they keep my eyes on my work or my book. If I do
                              happen to catch their glance, the spirit of mortal heaviness
                              immediately comes over me.
                           "My father has informed me that Mr. Stanton would joyfully make me his
                              wife, and he tried to show me the advantages of such a match; but,
                              either from his lack of ability to present the subject in its most
                              attractive light, or from my lack of wisdom to appreciate, he failed
                              to make the desired impression. My father plainly perceived his
                              failure; and, as usual, he was excessively angry. He drew a contrast
                              between the wealthy slaveholder's son and the 'low-bred mechanic'
                              (pardon me for writing the offensive words); and told me how proud he
                              should be to see his daughter wedded to the former. Brother Thomas has
                              expended all his sophomoric eloquence on the same topic, producing the
                              same effect,—namely, nausea. The love-smitten swain has not yet
                              formally proposed, but I expect every day that he will. My father has
                              commanded me not to refuse him; but I shall, and in so decided a
                              manner that even his stupidity will not fail to comprehend it.
                           "How glad I was to receive the letter which you passed up to me. I
                              shall expect another soon. The aspect of the present is hopeless,
                              indeed; but something whispers that we shall yet be united, and I
                              believe it, and in this faith find my only happiness. Don't despair,
                              dear Elwood, and pardon me that I cannot now accede to your wishes.
                              The hours are passing swiftly, and I must go to rest. Good-night, my
                              own! may angels watch and guard you.
                           
                              "MARION."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Not long after this I met Thomas Windsor, near the spot where I gave him the
                  beating, when we were boys. We had not spoken to each other since the lesson in
                  civility I administered to him. The expression of his face was one of mingled hate
                  and haughtiness.
               "I have the honor," he said, "of addressing Mr. Elwood Gorden, I
                  believe?"
               "My name is Elwood Gorden," I replied indifferently.
               "And my name is Thomas Windsor."
               "I am aware of that fact, sir."
               "I am glad that you are. Do you remember, sir, the scene which was enacted on this
                  spot many years since, when, assassin-like, you felled me to the earth?"
               "I recollect it well. Even the most minute events which then occurred are as fresh
                  in my mind as the transactions of yesterday; but I regret to perceive that your
                  manners were not permanently improved by that deserved chastisement."
               "Deserved!" he cried, swinging his cane menacingly. "Be on your guard as to what
                  you say, sir, or I shall punish you for that ruffianly attack, and for your long
                  list of offences since."
               "Mr. Windsor, you have a weapon and I have none; but be assured that I do not fear
                  you. I confess that, for various reasons, I have regretted striking you; your
                  punishment, however, was well deserved, for your insults were sufficient to warm up the coldest blood. I seek no
                  quarrel with you, sir, and, notwithstanding the past, would much rather be your
                  friend."
               "Friend! I choose my friends among my equals; and, had you always done the same,
                  my parents would have been spared a vast deal of anxiety, mortification, trouble,
                  and expense. Any one might know that you were a baseborn puppy, by your attempt to
                  delude and separate from her family the sister of one whom you had so outraged as
                  you have me. Your name is spoken only with disgust in our house; and yet you are
                  plotting and contriving to bring our pretty Marion down to your own mean
                  condition."
               "Whether I am your equal or not, let the world judge. I see plainly that you want
                  to pick a quarrel, and would provoke me by insults to lift my hand against you
                  once more. Say what you please,—I shall not resent it with blows. For Marion's
                  sake I will forbear, though my blood be on fire. Pour out, then, all the foul
                  phrases which have been so long coining in your shallow brain. I can hear them,
                  and it may be well for you to be rid of them. But, sir, let that suffice, for it
                  will not be safe for you to go any further."
               "What a cringing coward you are! From my soul, I despise you. Because of you, base
                  ingrate, my sister is a prisoner in her own father's house. Why do you trouble
                  her? what are your intentions? You can never marry her; and what satisfaction can
                  you derive in causing such mischief?"
               "My motives, sir, are honorable, as you know very well. Marion loves
                  me, and the persecution to which she is subjected, because of her devotion to me,
                  is monstrous. A brother should be a protector, while you are her worst enemy."
               "It is false. In seeking to save her from a dishonorable marriage, I but manifest
                  a brother's interest in her welfare. That interest I shall not abate."
               "Would you force her to marry against her will? How would you like the same
                  treatment?"
               "I should deserve it, were I as foolish, inconsiderate, and blind. 'Monstrous,'
                  sure enough, to act so unnaturally, forgetting not only the customs of society but
                  the claims of blood. I have a friend, wealthy and honorable, who has proposed for
                  my sister's hand. My parents greatly approve of him, and so do I. He is worthy of
                  a princess, and my sister will marry him."
               "She will not, so you may as well set your heart at rest."
               "She will, for we are all determined upon it. Mr. Stanton is of gentle blood. His
                  father is a wealthy, chivalrous Southern gentleman, owning a large plantation and
                  hundreds of servants. The son is a true Southron, and will not brook interference.
                  He has all the ardor and fire of the generous South. He knows not as yet the
                  obstacle in the way of his happiness, but, sir,—and it will be well for you to
                  weigh my warning carefully,—if you do not give me your word of honor that you will immediately write to Marion that the
                  connection between you is broken off forever, I will inform him of all the facts;
                  and then, woe be to you!"
               "Ha, ha, ha! how considerate! how condescending! Really, sir, how shall I express
                  my thanks? Should I not be a gallant lover to be thus frightened from my
                  allegiance? Of all your insults, this is the most sneaking. Go speedily to your
                  friend of gentle blood, and tell him, from me, that Marion and I have
                  long been pledged lovers, and that only death can sever the sacred tie."
               "I will, rash youth, and you will soon have cause to repent your hasty
                  resolution."
               "Don't be frightened, Mr. Windsor, for I am not. If your Southern friend
                     is a gentleman,—which admits of a doubt, while he flaunts and
                  blusters on the proceeds of oppression, inflicted upon innocent human beings,—if
                  he is a true gentleman, he will no longer proffer his love where it
                  is not wanted. But, if he follows the customs of the plantation, and supposes that
                  woman was created merely to gratify his passions, then will he act as basely as
                  the rest of you."
               "He is not one to give up a valued object lightly, or hesitate about removing
                  obstacles in his path, be assured of that, you dirty mechanic."
               "If Marion tells him plainly that she does not want his love; that she cannot
                  return it; that her affections are already bestowed upon another; and he continues
                  to urge his suit, joining your whole family in their villainous persecution, then
                  he is a scoundrel, and you may tell him I say so, if you like."
               "If it were not that he will punish you as you deserve, you beggar's brat, I would
                  this moment administer chastisement, in my friend's behalf. But the account will
                  yet be settled amply,—no mistake about that," was the closing threat with which
                  the young blackguard walked away.
               The turmoil of my feelings was indescribable. O God! to what a pitch of frenzy was
                  I wrought up, and yet I had preserved outward calmness. How slowly the fire burns
                  when it is almost entirely shut from the air, and yet it still keeps eating away,
                  spreading itself wider and wider, until it reaches the atmosphere, when it
                  suddenly bursts into a flame. I had managed to smother most of my resentment at
                  the gross insults which were heaped upon me by Tom Windsor; but, in a few moments
                  after his departure, my passions burned like fire.
               "No," I cried, "I will not submit to such indignity. I will punish the villain
                  immediately. No man, whoever he is or whatever station he fills, shall spit out
                  his venom at me unpunished!"
               I made all haste to overtake young Windsor, intending to chastise him as he
                  deserved. But I suddenly stopped, at the thought of Marion, and queried with
                  myself thus: "Shall I strike her brother? Will she love me as well if
                  I send him home to her bleeding from wounds caused by my own hands, because he has insulted me? Would it not
                  widen the breach between her family and myself? Would it not cause the dear girl
                  to suffer still more?" At that moment I seemed to see her beautiful eyes looking
                  reproachfully into mine.
               I sat down, and gave vent to my outraged feelings by weeping like a child. "God
                  pity me," I said, "for all this is so hard to bear. Dear Marion, you have saved
                  me; and, whatever your brother may say, I will not harm him. God grant that you
                  may be my guardian spirit always."

                     KING HENRY FOURTH.
                  
               
               A FEW nights after the meeting with Thomas Windsor, I received another letter from
                  Marion. It ran as follows:
               
                  "MY DEAR ELWOOD,—I am very anxious for you, lest you should be left to do what
                     you will have cause to repent of, and what will add to the bitterness of my
                     already too bitter cup. I know how insulting my brother can be when angry, and
                     I know how high-spirited you are: dear one, do be careful, for my sake.
                  "A few days since I fell asleep in my chair,—for I had slept but little the
                     night previous,—and I dreamed that you and Thomas were engaged in a hot
                     dispute. Because of the invective which he heaped upon you, your passions got
                     the better of your judgment, and with burning anger you were about, as of old,
                     to strike him to the earth. I sprang to hold you back, when I awoke, very glad
                     to find that I had been dreaming.
                  
                  "When Thomas returned, I looked curiously into his face, and it was so terribly
                     dark that I feared you had met; but I was glad to believe that nothing worse
                     than words had passed between you. Did he treat me as a brother ought, I would
                     have asked him the cause of his trouble; but, as circumstances were, I thought
                     it best to remain silent.
                  "Mr. Stanton has very generously made a tender of his valuable person; and O
                     how tender-ly (forgive the pun) he did it! I was alone in the
                     parlor, reading, when he came in and seated himself by my side. He attempted to
                     take my hand, but I recoiled from the touch as though he had been a snake.
                  "'Do not be so coy, my lady,' he said. 'You certainly should know, by this
                     time, what my sentiments toward you are.'
                  "'How should I, when you have never told me?'
                  "'Actions, miss, speak louder than words. But, lest you should fail to
                     understand me, I will be plain with you.'
                  "'Go on, if you please.'
                  "'Having your parents' and brother's approval, I make bold to declare to you
                     that I love you.'
                  "He now attempted again to take my hand; but, failing,—"'Will you not let me
                     take your hand, after all this?' he said, with an expression and manner of
                     great condescension. 'I love you, Miss Windsor; I have loved you since the
                     first moment we met. This will explain my subsequent conduct, I doubt not. My
                     intentions, miss, are honorable, for I wish you to become my wife. By accepting
                     me you will secure great happiness, I doubt not, for us both. I await your
                     answer.'
                  "'Mr. Stanton, I suppose that I ought to thank you for your proposal; but I
                     cannot answer it favorably.'
                  "'Your answer surprises me, miss. Are you aware of my position in the
                     world?'
                  "'I am, sir.'
                  "'You cannot be in your senses to slight such an offer as this. Why, think of
                     all the advantages of being my wife! You will not be obliged to pour out the
                     water to wash your own hands. You will not even have to dress yourself;
                     servants will await your bidding in all things. You should reflect well before
                     rejecting such good fortune.'
                  "'I am so unfortunate, sir, as to have always thought my hands were given me
                     for some good purpose. I cannot possibly persuade myself that they were made
                     for idleness. To be in as helpless a position as a babe has no charms for me.
                     This is a world of Divinely-ordered industry, and my desire is to do my share
                     of work, and not compel other persons to do it for me in addition to their own.
                     To place myself in a condition in which I can live on unrequited toil, and
                     escape all labor, is what I have no desire for,—not the slightest. If I require
                     the services of others, they must be amply compensated. I cannot even respect
                     the man who, because he has the power, forces his fellow creatures to spend
                     their strength for him for nought, while he is so utterly lacking in all the
                     nobler traits of manhood, that he is content to live a lazy, slothful life,
                     accomplishing nothing, and yet all the while fancying that he is a superior
                     being to those who earn an honest livelihood with their own hands. These are
                     plainly my sentiments, sir; and I trust you will be wise enough to heed them,
                     and not again urge me to enter into a relation which should be holy, a union of
                     souls.'
                  "'You astonish me, miss. I perceive that you sympathize with those fanatics,
                     the abolitionists. Your brother has the same opinion of the crazy, pestilent
                     crew that I have. The major part of
                     them are no doubt honest, though deceived; but, as for the leaders, if we ever
                     catch the scoundrels at the South, we will hang them upon the highest tree we
                     can find.*
                      What are you Northerners, your factory girls, the large majority of
                     your people, but slaves, hard-working slaves, more degraded than the jolly
                     Africans, who so excite your sympathies? Could your hirelings exchange places
                     with them, they would be the gainers. Once my wife, you would soon
                     be rid of your false notions of society. Some were made for toil, while others
                     were created for a higher purpose. To dig and sweat, from day to day, would
                     degrade them to the abject condition of the slave. The dray-horse would be out
                     of place on the racecourse, or the racer harnessed to the dray. You have been
                     in bad company, evidently, and your head has been filled with foolish
                     prejudice.'
                  
                     
                     *Senator H. S. Foote's threat to John P. Hale.
                  
                  "'And it is of such strength that I shall not be rid of it soon, rest assured
                     of that.' I here arose, went to my library, and selected that little volume of
                     poems, by John G. Whittier (presented to me by yourself), which is so brimming
                     with noble sentiments, love of justice, liberty, and right, with intentest
                     hatred for oppression. Turning to 'The Yankee Girl,' I requested my
                     aristocratic suitor to read it.†

                        Which the long evening shadow is stretching before,
                        With a melody sweet as the music which seems
                        Breathed softly and faint in the ear of our dreams.

                     yourself to read such contemptible doggerel. The author ought to have a coat
                     such as geese wear, and be driven from respectable society. Humph! what stuff

                     doggerel. The author is my favorite poet, for his poems give evidence that his
                     great heart beats for all humanity.'
                  "'Perhaps I have been a little hasty, Miss Windsor. If so, I crave your pardon.
                     We do not allow such books where I came from. It would be as much as a man's
                     life is worth to write and publish verses like those. I don't doubt your
                     honesty, in the least, but your sympathy is entirely misplaced, uncalled for,
                     unnecessary. A happier people do not exist than the slaves; and this I know,
                     for I have always lived among them.'
                  "I doubt it very much; but, if I believed it, I should still sympathize with
                     them, and labor to break their bonds, because realizing their terrible
                     degradation. No people can be happy in bondage, unless all that is noble in
                     them has been crushed out.'
                  "'I tell you, miss, that you are mistaken.'
                  "'You think so,—I think otherwise.'
                  "'I am certain that one like you, although in an error now, may yet be made to
                     see the eternal fitness of things. Let me be your loving teacher, and I will
                     show you what is right and proper, in this slavery question.'
                  "'You may rest assured, sir, that, were I your pupil, my progress would be too
                     slow for your quick Southern blood.'
                  "'O, never fear, miss! You are prejudiced, that is all; a few weeks in our
                     beautiful clime, where you could witness the affection between master and
                     servant, and see the contented, cheerful faces of the blacks, would remove it
                     all. I am quite willing to trust your generous nature.'
                  "'You have my answer, sir.'
                  "'What! you—you don't—don't mean—that—that you re-reject me
                        entirely?'
                  
                  "'I do, sir.'
                  "'This is pretty well, I must confess. My friend's sister reject me thus, and
                     without one word of apology to soften the blow? I had a right to expect
                     something different, miss. I consider your conduct insulting.'
                  "'I am sorry that you are offended, but I cannot help it. Your manner and your
                     language, sir, are very ungentlemanly. One would suppose that you thought I was
                     under obligations to accept you, whether I liked you or not. Sir, I was not
                     born a slave. No man shall ever have the right to call me wife, unless I love
                     him devotedly.'
                  "'It may be that you knew such an one previous to seeing me.'
                  "'I will be frank with you, sir, though you do not deserve it. My heart was
                     given, long ago, to one who is every way worthy to have and to hold it forever;
                     and to him alone shall I give my hand.'
                  "'You talk as independently as a queen. Does your family approve your
                     choice?'
                  "'They do not, but are most bitterly opposed to it. I am a prisoner in my
                     father's house,—all my steps are watched,—and I am locked into my chamber at
                     night. You see how I am persecuted, and O! sir, if you have one honorable feeling in your heart, you will not
                     add to my unhappiness by persevering in a suit which you now see must be
                     hopeless.'
                  "'Madam, I love you, and some mean churl has placed himself between me and the
                     object of my desire. You know but little of Southern character, if you suppose
                     we ever relinquish that which we have once undertaken to gain. Your parents and
                     brother have consented, and you have no right, as a dutiful daughter and
                     sister, to thwart their wishes. Their will should be your law. With their
                     consent, I have a better claim than another can have. Be wise, then, and give
                     me the right to call you my own, and this unnatural state of things will
                     speedily cease.'
                  "Thereupon he attempted to clasp my waist; but I repelled him, with a specimen
                     of Northern 'free speech,' as follows:
                  "'Stand back, sir, and never again lay one of your foul hands upon me! Know
                     that I despise you from the bottom of my heart, and would sooner wed an Irish
                     bog-trotter than you. Since you are so dull of comprehension, plain words are
                     needed; and I trust that you now understand me.'
                  "'You are exceedingly impudent, miss. My blood boils at such insults. It may be
                     that I shall have the power and the right some time to avenge them."
                  "'Never, sir, in the way you dream of. I can die, but I will not
                     be your wife.'
                  "'We shall see about that, mark me if we don't; and you may yet be glad to
                     humble yourself in the dust, for what you have said to-day.'
                  "Leave the room, sir, or I will; and don't flatter yourself that I shall ever
                     place my happiness in the keeping of such a knave and ruffian."
                  "Giving me a look of baffled malignity, Stanton quitted the room.
                  "In an hour from that time a scene was enacted here which would have astonished
                     you, had you witnessed it. Once, I could not have borne it. My father, mother,
                     and brother, found with difficulty words to express their outraged
                        feelings. I had shamefully insulted a guest, a gallant Southern
                     gentleman, who had honorably sued for my hand. I must make full reparation
                     immediately,—on my bended knees beg his pardon, and assure him that I gladly
                     yielded him my heart and hand, and was proud to receive his in exchange.
                  "As I would do nothing of the kind, the storm of indignation and vituperation
                     raged furiously. I bore up under it as well as I could. You must judge what I
                     suffered. I tried to make them hear to reason, but in vain. Ah, Elwood, I am
                     ashamed of my own flesh and blood! Why, they ought to have kicked the fellow
                     out of the house,—it was what he richly merited, for his discourtesy and
                     abusive threats toward a lady. But ah! poor me was wholly to blame.
                  "When their wrath had somewhat cooled, father ordered me to my chamber, and I
                     have not been permitted to leave it since. All this is terrible to endure, but
                     I bear it cheerfully for your sake. I did not know, until the trial came, that
                     I could be so brave. For all this suffering, I feel that you will love me an
                     hundred-fold. Love for parents, love for my brother, has nearly all gone now.
                     You are my only earthly reliance.
                  "I tremble for you, Elwood, as Mr. Stanton has threatened vengeance on his
                     rival, if he meets him. Be on your guard, but do nothing rashly. Remember that
                     my weal or woe is in your hands. Stanton has no benevolence, no honor, no true manliness, though he is such a
                     fine sprig of Southern 'chivalry.' If it were not for the restraints of the
                     law, I doubt not he would be ready to imbrue his hands in your blood. As it is,
                     he will harm you in any way he can.
                  "I cannot tell when my father's anger will so abate that I may be allowed to go
                     down stairs again. Probably not until he is satisfied that this is not the way
                     to subdue me.
                  
                     "Yours for time, and, God willing, for eternity,

                     KING JAMES.
                  
               
               ALTHOUGH George Washington Stanton had been in Dunfield two months, yet I had not
                  seen him. I had heard much of the vices of Southern character; of the peculiar
                  influences under which boys were educated, that tended, instead of checking their
                  passions, rather to excite them. I knew that the slaveholder looked upon the
                  mechanic, the laborer, with contempt. From what Marion had written, it was evident
                  that Mr. Stanton had no correct ideas of right and wrong; that, though I had long
                  been engaged to Marion, he would not recognize my claim at all, but considered me
                  an intruder, an obstacle in his path, to be got rid of by some "chivalrous"
                  method, such as the bludgeon or the bowie-knife.
               
               I regretted much the necessity that seemed to devolve upon me of preparing for
                  self-defence. I procured a sword-cane and a revolver, determined—if it came to
                  fighting—to sell my life as dearly as possible. I would not court a conflict, but
                  resolved to defend myself. I had not long to wait for a rencounter.
               I had visited the "old homestead," and was returning to Mr. Mackay's on foot, when
                  I met Thomas Windsor and Mr. Stanton. Doubtless they were watching for me.
               "Mr. Gorden," said Thomas, "I have the pleasure of introducing to you Mr. George
                  Washington Stanton."
               "Thank you," I replied. "Mr. Stanton, I hope you are well."
               "I am very well, indeed," he answered. After a pause, he said further: "Excuse my
                  abruptness and brief acquaintance, Mr. Gorden; but is it true that you claim the
                  hand of Mr. Windsor's sister?"
               "Mr. Stanton," I answered, "when you will prove to me that you have the right to
                  ask that question, I will answer it."
               "The proof ought to satisfy you. Having abundant means at my disposal, I have
                  proposed to make the lady my bride. Her parents would rejoice to call me 'son,'
                  while my friend, here, would be most happy to change the endearing term to one
                  more dear, even that of 'brother.' Are not these reasons sufficient?"
               "They are not, sir; and yet it suits my mood to answer your question. I do claim
                  her hand."
               "By what right?"
               "The right which is conferred by the possession of her heart."
               "O, that is all gammon! The silly girl may have fancied that she loved you; but
                  let her look at the subject fairly, and she will see it in a different light. I
                  take it, sir, that your station is too low to wed a lady like her."
               "And I take it, sir, that my station is far above yours. I wrong no man, and wish
                  that justice may be done to all. I honor merit in the palace or the cottage;
                  intellectual culture has my homage; I earn with my own hands the bread I eat and
                  the garments I wear; but I call no man master, and would not look up to a
                  king."
               "I told you he was a bold-spoken knave," said Thomas.
               "I perceive that you were right," said Mr. Stanton. "You are well adapted, Mr.
                  Gorden, I doubt not, for the station you occupy, and if you never attempted to
                  step out of it, you would do well enough. But you seek to drag Miss
                  Windsor down to your own level,—I would lift her up to mine: which
                  has the better claim to her hand?"
               "I would make her the wife of a man who recognizes the rights of all. I should not
                  expect to lift her up, for she is already highly exalted. It would be making a
                  fearful leap downward, for her to take your position, sir,—that of an
                     oppressors sor of our race. But why
                  bandy words, or make odious comparisons? The lady loves you not, and never
                  will."
               "Be not too sure of that. You are the only obstruction in the way of my success;
                  and, by Heaven! that shall be removed. You must give up all pretensions to Miss
                  Windsor."
               "I must!"
               "That is precisely what I mean, sir."
               "Let me tell you, Mr. Stanton, that you are either a knave or a fool, to talk in
                  this fashion. Who gave you the right to dictate my proceedings?"
               "Mr. Gorden, I did not meet you to-day with the intention of inflicting injury,
                  for I trusted you would hear to reason. I am not to be balked by you, sir. A
                  'greasy mechanic' shall not defeat a purpose which is as fixed as the everlasting
                  hills. The contest may end peaceably, if you will do as I desire; but, if not,
                  then be a fool, and take the consequences."
               "You swagger, sir, as though you were my owner. Please to understand that in this
                  portion of the land one man is as good as another, and that threats like yours are
                  simply ridiculous. I am a man of peace, and despise brawls and duels; but I notify
                  you that, if attacked, I shall defend myself and vindicate my honor."
               "Your honor! Mr. Gorden, hearken a moment. I have told you that I had no wish to
                  harm you; but, if you do not immediately remove your vile carcase out of my way,
                  then I will do it myself, though I take your life."
               "You are a chivalrous young gentleman, truly! I consider it beneath the dignity of
                  an honorable man to hold further conversation with you."
               At this moment Mr. Stanton drew a pistol from his bosom, and aimed it at my
                  breast. Just as he fired, I struck it with my cane, and the ball cut through my
                  clothes, and slightly wounded my side. The ruffian immediately fled.
               Thomas Windsor remained long enough to learn that I was not dangerously wounded.
                  When he was satisfied of that fact, he said:
               "You had a very narrow escape, Mr. Gorden."
               "I believe you, sir. And this cowardly assassin has been selected for your
                  sister's husband, has he?"
               "Not cowardly, sir. It is customary, where he was reared, to punish such fellows
                  as you. I warned you in season of your danger, but you would not hearken and be
                  wise. You have escaped death as by a miracle; and now it will be well for you to
                  take heed. Another encounter, and you may sleep the sleep that knows no
                  waking."
               "The law will lay its hand upon your friend, my dear sir, and perchance place him
                  where he cannot attempt to murder honest people."
               "Come, come, now, that would be cowardly. A fair fight is my motto. Mr. Stanton is
                  as generous and as brave a soul as I ever met. Had you killed him in the
                  encounter, he would not have wished that
                  any appeal should be made to the law. If you take that course, it may involve us
                  all in difficulty."
               "So far as I am concerned, Mr. Windsor, you are safe,—not on your own account,
                  however, but because you hold the relationship of brother to one who is dearer to
                  me than life. As for Mr. Stanton, he is guilty of an attempt to murder me; and, if
                  caught, he must answer at the bar of justice."
               "You had better let the matter drop where it is, and forever banish the notion
                  that my only sister will become your wife. Come, take my advice, and thus the
                  whole difficulty will be settled."
               "I want no advice from you, sir, especially since you are the accomplice of a
                  murderer."
               "You wrong me there. I did not meet you for any such purpose."
               "For your sister's sake, I hope you did not; but appearances are all against you.
                  You have given me advice gratuitously, and I would not be in your debt: so now
                  listen to me. Seek Mr. Stanton immediately, and inform him that his only safety is
                  in flight, and then use your influence with your parents to have your sister set
                  at liberty, and hereafter act toward her as a brother ought,—that is, be her
                  protector and not her oppressor."
               "From the past you may judge how much your advice will affect me, sir. Good-day to
                  you."
               I proceeded immediately to Mr. Mackay's, and related my adventure. He procured an
                  officer, with great dispatch, to arrest Stanton, but the latter could not be
                  found.
               A fortnight after this I went to Mr. Windsor's, for the purpose of delivering a
                  letter to Marion, and receiving one from her. It was about midnight when I
                  approached the house. I perceived a dim light in her chamber. The dear girl was
                  watching for me, and carefully lifted the sash when she saw me, and said:
               "Elwood, is it you?"
               "Yes."
               "I am so glad to hear the sound of your voice once more. Strange things have
                  happened here: Mr. Stanton has suddenly left us, and I cannot learn where he has
                  gone. I was fearful that he had taken your life, and fled. I hope he will never
                  return here again. Are you well, Elwood?"
               "Yes, Marion. I have a letter here for you, that will impart all the news. Are you
                  quite well?"
               "I am. O, I would so like to talk with you longer; but it will not do. Who knows
                  but that hated Stanton is listening now? I fear he is not far away. Pass up the
                  letter, and I will throw you mine."
               I tied the letter to a pole which I kept secreted for the purpose, and was just
                  lifting it to Marion, when I heard a suspicious noise near by. I turned my head,
                  and saw George Stanton. He held a gun, and almost instantly fired. I felt that I
                  was shot. The murderous scoundrel fled, and Marion screamed in terror. The blood was pouring from my
                  side; but, with the assistance of the pole, which I still held, I kept my feet for
                  a few moments, and then fell to the earth.
               I heard Marion cry out in great agony, "Elwood, my own Elwood! O, speak to me. He
                  has killed you——" Her voice now sounded as though dying away in the distance,
                  until I could not hear it at all. A moment longer, and I had lost all
                  consciousness.
               Many days elapsed before my senses were regained, and the events which transpired
                  I subsequently learned.
               As Marion addressed me in vain, she sprang to the door and made frantic efforts to
                  open it; but, failing, she returned to the window and rashly leaped to the ground.
                  She sprained one of her ankles badly, and was otherwise injured, but the poor
                  child knew it not. Springing to my side, she addressed me in words of frantic
                  endearment; she chafed my forehead, tore open my vest, and laid her hand upon my
                  heart. Finding that it still beat, she cried aloud for help, and, tearing pieces
                  from her dress, endeavored to stanch the wound.
               Her parents, brother, and the domestics came out, and ere long many of the
                  neighbors arrived, including Mr. Mackay.
               "Who is injured?" inquired Mr. Windsor.
               "Elwood, my own Elwood," said Marion.
               "Your own Elwood!" he retorted, sneeringly. "Come away, girl. How came you out of
                  your chamber?" and he tried to drag her from me, but she threw her arms
                  frantically around me, and would not relinquish her hold.
               When Mr. Mackay arrived and looked into my face, he exclaimed: "God's love! it is
                  Elwood Gorden. I have feared this, Mr. Mason," he said to a near neighbor who was
                  present. "Mount a horse, ride for dear life, and obtain a surgeon. Why is Mr.
                  Gorden allowed to lie here, Mr. Windsor? Why have you not had him carried into the
                  house?"
               "I will have none of the Gordens in my house, Mr. Mackay," replied the
                  brutal-minded man.
               "I am astonished, Mr. Windsor, at your lack of humanity. If he is not mortally
                  wounded, to remove him now might be the cause of his death,—it must not be
                  done."
               "I can't help it; my house shall afford no shelter for such low fellows as
                  he."
               "An attempt has been made upon his life once before, and your son was an
                  accomplice. Mr. Windsor, beware, for there is such a thing as law. Thomas Windsor
                  can be arrested for this and the former attempt."
               There were now twelve persons present, and the cry was, "Open the door, you old
                  savage, or your house will not be standing to-morrow night at this time!"
               The doors were opened, upon this; I was carried in, and laid upon a bed; and soon
                  the surgeon arrived.
               
               It was found, on examination, that I had two wounds, one in the left side, and
                  another through the right arm. I was not aware of the fact at the time; but the
                  villain, to make sure of his purpose, shot at me twice in quick succession. The
                  doctor declared that the balls had touched no vital part, and, by proper care and
                  nursing, there was some hope for me. But I must remain undisturbed for many weeks,
                  as immediate death would follow removal.
               Mr. Mackay noticed that poor Marion, when she arose to follow me into the house,
                  though so intensely excited, walked very lame. He called the attention of the
                  doctor to the fact.
               "Marion," said the doctor, "you are quite lame: have you also been wounded?"
               "No, doctor," she replied. "I was so excited that I jumped from my chamber window.
                  My ankle is very painful."
               "No marvel, you rash child. If you are not injured more than that, you may thank
                  your stars. A regular Sam Patch leap, upon my soul; and, perchance, a leap for
                  life,—at least for his life,—for, had you not stanched the blood, his
                  life might have ebbed away on the spot."
               "O, Dr. Spaulding, don't think of me,—I am not hurt,—but save him. O, don't let
                  him die, doctor!"
               "I will do all that I can. You are not injured, eh?" Laying his hand upon her
                  ankle, he asked: "How came this so swollen, then? If any persons will tell
                  monstrous fibs, it is young girls when they are in love."
               Dr. Spaulding remained until morning, attending to the wants of his two
                  patients.
               Mr. Mackay had a long talk with Mr. Windsor, and insisted that I should remain at
                  his house until it was safe to remove me; and that Marion might be with me
                  whenever she chose. Officers were searching for the assassin, whom people
                  suspected of being Mr. Stanton. One word from Mr. Mackay, and Thomas Windsor would
                  be arrested. Trembling for his son, Mr. Windsor dared not demur, but promised all
                  that was required; and so I remained undisturbed, and Marion was my nurse, while
                  life trembled in the balance and long after I was convalescent.
               The wound in my side was fearful, and nearly caused my death. I should judge that
                  I lay for several days utterly unconscious. The first clear remembrance I have was
                  the fancy that I had been in the battle of Monterey, got terribly wounded, and was
                  left upon the cold ground to die. I thought of my parents far away, and how they
                  would mourn when they learned that their son was slain. And then I thought of our
                  dear Lissy, my sweet sister, and wondered what she would say if she knew that I
                  was lying thus, bleeding out my life. And it seemed to me there was another person
                  who would probably mourn for me; but for
                  a long time I was unable to make out who it was. By-and-by I realized that it was
                  Marion,—that she was the dearest one of all.
               As I lay there, expecting soon to die, a beautiful Mexican girl came, sat down by
                  my side, laid my head upon her lap, bound up my wounds, and soothed me to rest.
                  Looking up into her face with gratitude, I was surprised to see that she resembled
                  Marion Windsor.
               My doctor was something of a hydropathist, making frequent use of cloths wet in
                  cold water; and once I imagined myself at sea, and shot in battle by a pirate who
                  had a face like Stanton. I fell over the vessel's side into the water, and sank;
                  down, down, down many miles I swiftly passed through the liquid element, and yet
                  how long it seemed before I reached the bottom! But I was there at last, lying
                  upon my back, looking far up at the great ships sailing above me. I felt that I
                  must die soon of my ghastly wounds; and then I could not breathe; I felt as if
                  stifling, dying. A mermaid now came to me, took me in her arms, and carried me
                  swiftly to her cave, where she dressed my wounds, and sang me into delicious
                  repose; and she, too, had the face of Marion. Thus my thoughts continually ran on,
                  the scenes ever changing, pain and pleasure, hope and despair following each other
                  rapidly.
               One morning I imagined that I had fallen from a large factory which Mr. Mackay and
                  myself were erecting in L——. My injury seemed fearful, for I could not arise from
                  the ground. I must lie there until help arrived. I employed my thoughts in trying
                  to account for the cause of my fall. Certainly I had worked on buildings for
                  years, and never fallen before; why should I now? It struck me as a great mystery.
                  Just then I heard a voice say, in tones of love and grief:
               "O! will he never speak again? Will the wandering senses never return? O Elwood,
                  dear Elwood! speak to your Marion once more. She loves you. Would God I had died
                  for thee!"
               She now bent down and pressed upon my lips one long, ardent kiss. After this she
                  sat near me, and laid her head upon my breast, and wept long and bitterly.
               On first hearing her voice, I half-recognized it as that of Marion, and tried to
                  answer, but I could not. Any effort to move my limbs was equally futile. But the
                  agony of her sobs and tears at last broke the spell. Reason returned once more to
                  its deserted throne, and my scattered senses were speedily recalled from their
                  wanderings.
               "Dear Marion," I said, faintly, "is it you?"
               With a startled cry of joy, she lifted up her head and looked into my face.
               "O, Elwood! speak again,—let me hear that voice once more."
               "Yes, dear Marion."
               "There, that will do; I had forgotten. The doctor said I must have the most
                  perfect command over myself or you might receive irreparable injury jury. In my anxiety, I had forgotten the caution.
                  You will be quiet for my sake, I know, and then you will soon be well again."
               "But I don't understand where I am. This is a strange room. Let me think. My arm
                  and side. O, I remember, I was shot by Stanton."
               "Yes, dear, and you have been so ill. But you will recover, the doctor says."
               "Whose house is this, Marion?"
               "My father's. You were so badly wounded that it was impossible to remove you
                  elsewhere. I have been your nurse, dear."
               "And shall you continue to be?"
               "O yes, for I will persuade the doctor to keep you here for a long time."
               "Dear Marion, this is almost worth being shot for. Where is Stanton?"
               "He has not been taken, although a large reward has been offered. The bloody
                  wretch will never show his face here again, and I am thankful for that."
               "So am I. Why, he meant to kill me! Better be dead, Marion, than married to such a
                  man."
               "O yes; but I never could have married him. It is so pleasant to hear you talk
                  once more. But I sha'n't let you speak another word, and so you must lie very
                  quiet, and go to sleep."
               I knew Marion was right; and yielding trustfully as a little child, I was soothed
                  into the land of dreams; and now it was a lovely land, a land of health, of
                  beauty, and pure enjoyment.
               As before stated, I remained at Mr. Windsor's house long after I became
                  convalescent. Marion, feeling some delicacy about urging the point herself,
                  persuaded Mr. Mackay to request the doctor to forbid my removal, until I had
                  nearly recovered.
               "What shall I say to Mr. Windsor?" was the kind physician's question.
               "O, hang it!" was the answer, "tell him that Mr. Gorden has an internal
                  difficulty, which renders his removal, at present, dangerous,—and, doctor," added
                  my humorous friend, with a smile, "you know that he has."
               "As a professional man, Mr. Mackay, I am unable to deny it; and Miss Windsor's
                  situation appears to me equally critical. But I suppose the pretence will be what
                  is called a 'white lie.' Physicians often make use of harmless deceptions,—it is a
                  part of their practice."
               "But you know, doctor, that, if Mr. Gorden should be removed now, and Marion not
                  allowed to visit him, his recovery would be retarded very much."
               "Yes, I think you are right. He shall stay just as long as old Windsor will let
                  him."
               The plan worked admirably, and the hours which both of us had long sighed for were
                  now our own. We improved them well; and more blissful moments mortals seldom know.
                  The past was in a measure forgotten, and we thought little of the future. I have
                  known joy since, but never greater than
                  was then experienced. Every day served to unite us in closer love and
                  confidence.
               Mr. Windsor told Marion that he should perform his agreement with Mr. Mackay to
                  the letter. He disapproved of it in toto; but,
                  for Thomas' sake, he should submit to the curse for a season. He warned his
                  daughter against giving me any encouragement, or allowing herself to become
                  attached to me, for she should never be my bride. However, he well knew his
                  blustering threats were all in vain, for our hearts were already wedded. Of this
                  he was probably convinced before; but, the day after the last attempt upon my
                  life, he had indisputable proof. It will be recollected that I had tied a letter
                  to a pole, to reach up to Marion, and she was about to drop one down to me. Both
                  these letters fell into the hands of Mr. Windsor, and from them he learned how
                  devoted was our affection, and that we had partially succeeded in foiling his
                  plans. It was useless to be angry then, for I was lying at death's door, and
                  Marion, by his consent, acted as my gentle nurse.
            
            
               CHAPTER XII.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "When we in our viciousness grow hard,
                           (O, misery on't!) the wise gods seel our eyes;
                           In our own filth drop our clear judgment; make us
                           Adore our errors; laugh at us, while we strut,
                           To our confusion."

                           "If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day,
                           When I shall ask the banns, and when be married."
                        
                     
                     TAMING OF THE SHREW.
                  
               
               A MONTH had passed, yet nothing was heard of George Stanton, though a vigorous and
                  extensive search had been made for him. As he had twice attempted my life, it was
                  thought that he deserved arrest and punishment. Though he was successful in
                  eluding for the time the clutch of justice, his hiding-place will by-and-by be
                  made known.
               My presence was so offensive to Mr. Windsor, that he continually importuned the
                  doctor to have me removed; but the latter had ever ready some plausible objection,
                  and so I remained. That Mr. Windsor half-suspected advantage was being taken of
                  the equivocal position of his son, I did not doubt; but he thought it impolitic to
                  allude to it.
               It was of course quite unpleasant for me to remain under the roof of a man who had
                  done me such grievous injury; and only
                  one consideration kept me there,—my attachment for Marion, and the certainty of
                  our total separation again if I left. Perhaps it manifested a lack of self-respect
                  for me to stop one moment longer than was necessary; but then, I was in love; I
                  could have the dear one with me day after day; and who could blame me for
                  resolving to remain?
               The excitement had in a measure died away, and the officers of the law had relaxed
                  their efforts to find the culprit, when Marion received a letter from him, written
                  at sea, and sent by an inward-bound vessel:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "ON BOARD STEAMER ATLANTIC, Sept. 4th.
                              "MISS MARION WINDSOR:
                           
                           "Dear Miss,—Feeling it to be unsafe to remain in my own country, I am
                              now fleeing from it. Have you ever asked yourself the question, why it
                              is that George Washington Stanton is hunted as a felon and driven to a
                              foreign land? It is well worth your while to reflect, miss. I have a
                              warm, brave heart, and laid it generously at your feet, and you
                              spurned it. I had a right to be surprised, indignant I may say. There
                              are noble ladies everywhere who would have gladly accepted the prize.
                              Such would have thought you mad.
                           "Why did I turn from them and worship at your altar alone? Need I tell
                              you? A great many fair ones, and those in exalted stations, had
                              bestowed their smiles upon me; but, until I saw you, I never loved;
                              and when you rejected me with disdain and contumely, I felt unwilling
                              to give you up. Are you not aware that, the more difficult an object
                              is to win, the more the truly brave are incited cited to strive for
                              it? Such was the effect of your rejection upon me.
                           "You were candid enough to inform me that I had a rival; and judge of
                              my astonishment, when I learned his station in life! With your
                              friends' approval of my suit, I felt that he ought to resign his
                              claims at once; but the unreasonable puppy very saucily refused. I
                              attempted to punish his insolence in chivalrous Southern fashion; but
                              failed, and under your fanatical Northern law became liable to fine or
                              imprisonment for an assault. Good friends provided me with a sure
                              retreat.
                           "I still cherished the hope of gaining your hand. It seemed impossible
                              to relinquish you to another. At night I often came out of my
                              hiding-place, and watched near your chamber, believing that I had an
                              exclusive right to guard and protect you.
                           "It was my fortune, or misfortune, to detect you in a clandestine
                              interview with the fellow who had caused all the trouble. I knew that
                              your hand properly belonged to me; and, when I learned that you still
                              had interviews with the low-born hireling, that letters passed between
                              you, and heard you speak of the 'hated Stanton,' my blood was on fire.
                              The event that followed was what ought to be expected of Southern
                              boldness and honor, kindled by Yankee presumption.
                           "An asylum was immediately provided me until I could with safety
                              escape; and now I am in a noble vessel, on old ocean's swelling
                              billows, swiftly speeding from my native land.
                           "You are still very dear to me, and it is time that your heart was
                              touched. All that I have done has been for your sake. For you I have
                              broken the laws,—for you I am hunted like a wild beast,—for you I was
                                 confined in a very small
                              room, during the most sultry days and nights of the season,—for you I
                              am undergoing banishment from my country and friends.
                           "Dear Miss Windsor, this is my last appeal. If all the efforts and
                              sacrifices I have made cannot move your obdurate heart, nothing can.
                              Learn to love me; and in a few months I will return, and bear you in
                              triumph to my own sunny land, where you shall know every joy that
                              heart can wish.
                           "If your heart should relent, you can write me, for your brother will
                              give you my address. Think no more of the base ingrate, Gorden, but
                              love the one who can lift you up to the glorious heights of wealth,
                              ease, and fashion.
                           
                              "From your ever faithful
                              "GEORGE WASHINGTON STANTON."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               "Well," said Marion, when she had finished reading this precious letter, drawing a
                  long breath, "could impudence and ignorant self-assurance go farther? Why! what
                  does the fellow think? Twice he has tried to murder the man I love, and now,
                  forsooth, he sagely concludes that I ought to love him, as a sort of remuneration.
                  I did not suppose he was such a fool. Had he succeeded in taking your life, as he
                  intended, he would have thought his claim perfect."
               "It is very possible that he supposes he did succeed, though he may have learned
                  his failure from your father or brother; for I doubt not one or both of them aided
                  to secrete him."
               "From what he writes, I should judge so. How sorry I am that they should aid in
                  screening such a wretch from justice."
               "It is lamentable, and I hope they may live to see their error. Strange that
                  people can be so blinded."
               "But you will not love me less on account of their sins?"
               "No, dearest; rather will I love you more for being so faithful when their enmity
                  is so deadly. What happy hours we have spent together since the assassin attempted
                  my life. He little thought this would be the result."
               "Such is often the righteous recompense of the wicked. The result which they would
                  prevent, by any means, however vile, is accomplished through their aid. They peril
                  soul and body to win a coveted treasure, and yet are doomed to see it snatched
                  from them."
               "And, if permitted to succeed in their base designs, the fruit they pluck is like
                  the apples of Sodom, all ashes and bitterness. But, to pass from that: do you know
                  that I must soon leave you?"
               "O yes; and I fear that such blissful hours will not return again for a long
                  time."
               "So I fear, unless you will be persuaded. Marion, I ask you, candidly, what hope
                  there is that your parents will ever consent to our marriage?"
               "I fear the hope is faint. But circumstances may influence them. Once I could not
                  have expected pected this. You are much
                  beloved and highly respected, Elwood. Report says that you are rapidly gaining
                  wealth. By-and-by, I doubt not, you will become a man of property and consequence,
                  and then my father will consent."
               "Marion," I said, sadly, "if I did not know how well you love me, I should think
                  you were speaking in irony. If were are to wait for all that, I feel like giving
                  up at once."
               "I would not flatter you, Elwood; but all I have said, and even more, is probable.
                  As to speaking ironically, there is too much of sorrow in the past, and of doubt
                  and danger in the future, to admit of a jesting tone."
               "Then why not be mine now?"
               "O Elwood, I am both ready and willing; but I would not have the curse of both of
                  my parents and my only brother."
               "After all their wrong-doing, do you fear curses from them? To me, they would seem
                  likely to operate by the rule of contraries."
               "Forgive me, Elwood, if in so important a step I desire the approval of some of my
                  own family. Let us wait for a more auspicious hour."
               "It must be as you say; though I much fear that such an hour will never come. We
                  have opportunities now which may not soon be ours again. We might be married in
                  this very room, with due precaution. Put off the happy day, if you will; but God
                  grant that you may not regret it."
               "O Elwood," exclaimed she, tearfully yet tenderly, "I hesitate to be yours now,
                  though I so much wish it. You know I desire no greater good, and that I have faith
                  in you as I have in no other earthly being. I may soon feel differently, if my
                  father persists in separating us."
               "He will persist, for Mr. Mackay tried to frighten him into a promise that we
                  should have his consent to marry. He yielded on other points, but was inflexible
                  on that. O, there is no hope."
               "Don't speak so despondingly, Elwood. Though we may be torn asunder for a season,
                  brighter days will come."
               "Thank you for the assurance, and so I will hope on. It will be harder than ever
                  now to live without you."
               "I know it; and, when I think of what has happened and of what may be before us, I
                  am almost persuaded to consent to your proposal of a speedy marriage."
               "Reflect upon it well, Marion, and you may see the subject in a favorable light. I
                  cannot believe that it is right to separate two beings who love devotedly,—whose
                  heart-strings are interwoven. Believing thus, my first duty is to you and yours to
                  me. I honor my parents, I love Lissy; but you come first, and you always will. You
                  are mine, Marion, and I am yours,—knowing this, I would overleap every
                  obstacle."
               "You are very much in earnest, dear Elwood, and of that I will not complain, if your warmth
                  does not turn to vexation. Don't urge me any more now. While I would find my chief
                  happiness in you, I would not separate myself from all of my own blood."

                     ROMEO AND JULIET.
                  
               
               I LEFT Mr. Windsor's house soon after the foregoing conversation with Marion; I
                  went to the "old homestead," much to the gratification of my parents and sister.
                  The anxiety of a mother, when a child is in danger, is well known, and she feels
                  that no one can do quite so well as herself. My mother, though deeply anxious on
                  my account, came but seldom to see me. Mr. Windsor had caused us so much suffering
                  that she disliked to enter his dwelling at all.
               At twilight, the evening after I went home, mother induced me to sit on a low
                  seat, and lay my head upon her lap, boy-fashion.
               "O Elwood," she said, "how glad I am to have you at home once more! The past weeks
                  of your illness have been very long indeed. It is wonderful that you escaped with
                  your life. What a wretch was that
                  Stanton, to make a second attempt to kill you! I tremble when I think of it. With
                  all his boasted 'chivalry,' he is just as much a murderer as though you were cold
                  and silent in the grave. He meant your destruction, and it seems like a miracle he
                  did not accomplish it."
               "I think so, too; but it was not decreed. I shall soon be well again, I hope. One
                  good has been gained by this, I trust,—Marion is delivered from his hateful
                  presence."
               "That is a great mercy to her, certainly, the poor child. Only think of Mr.
                  Windsor wishing to marry his only daughter to such a bloody villain, because he
                  has wealth, and that wealth in human beings! Were it not a great crime to rob
                  God's children of their freedom, to buy and sell them like cattle, severing
                  forever the holiest ties, yet I should consider the position of the slaveholder a
                  very dangerous one, and I would not willingly allow a child of mine to share his
                  perilous lot."
               "Mr. Windsor seems to worship wealth more than aught else, and the position of a
                  slaveholder he actually covets. I have been told that, when a good farm was his
                  only property, he was a very different man. Fifteen or twenty thousand dollars,
                  coming to him so suddenly, wrought a marvelous change, and since then he has been
                  anxious to see his children immensely rich. Wealth is the only good there is in
                  the world. If a man has that,—it matters not in what it consists, or by what means
                  he obtained it,—he is worthy of all honor. Property in human bodies and souls is
                  just as good as in any shape. Whips and chains, groans and tears, or breaking
                  hearts, appal him not, for the glory of Mammon overshadows them. If a man has a
                  fortune, he is worthy of all honor; without one, merit is undiscernible, even with
                  a microscope."
               "Poor deluded man! His good fortune, as many call it, did change him, but not very
                  much, I think. I knew him in my younger days, and he did me the honor to ask me to
                  be his wife."
               "He did? I never heard of that before. It accounts for some things which have
                  seemed mysterious."
               "To what do you refer?"
               "His enmity."
               "I have sometimes thought so; but, as he seemed not offended at the time, I feared
                  the impression might be unjust. I did not like him then, for he seemed cold and
                  heartless. The evil was in him, and the property he inherited brought it out
                  clearly."
               "Probably you are right; but I think the mainspring of his malignity was your
                  refusal to become his wife."
               "Very likely. He has been instrumental in causing us much sorrow, but has thereby
                  only added bitterness to his own cup. No one need envy him his wealth, for he is
                  not happy. His countenance gives no indication of blessings received ceived in thankfulness and truly
                  enjoyed, but the reverse."
               "So I have always thought. Verily, he has his reward."
               "Indeed he has. I am very happy now, Elwood, and so is your father and Lissy. If
                  you had been taken from us by the hand of violence, what could we
                  have done?"
               "Mourned for me, my mother; but still, confiding in a heavenly Father's love,
                  continued on life's journey as before, performing every duty faithfully unto the
                  end, and so found much even of earthly happiness."
               "Well, I hope so; but it would have been an irreparable loss. It is delightful to
                  possess our old home again; but for you, this would never have been effected."
               "Possibly it might."
               "O no. I saw hard times, Elwood, when you were a babe. How you used to cling to me
                  when you thought I was about to leave you to be absent many hours. I was obliged,
                  though it pained me much, to take your hands from my neck, and place you in your
                  father's arms. My heart ached then to leave you so; but you have since well repaid
                  for all my heart-aches."
               "If so, I will be thankful and take courage, notwithstanding my position is so
                  annoying, and my spirits so often depressed."
               "Poor boy! and do you love Marion Windsor so much?"
               "I do. O, life is worthless without her."
               "I have regretted that you ever formed an attachment there."
               "Why, mother?"
               "Not because I object to her at all, but because you have suffered so much in
                  consequence. There are better families where you would have been welcomed. Now,
                  her parents, brother, and all her relatives, so far as I know, are bitterly
                  opposed to you. If you ever marry her, this bitter feeling will be very
                  unpleasant."
               "I know it; but happiness in married life does not depend, in my apprehension, on
                  the approval or disapproval of one's relatives. If the man and the woman whom the
                  law declares to be one are not really so,—if they lack true affinity,—it matters
                  little whether friends approve or not."
               "I am aware of that; still, such approval is always very desirable."
               "Very true; but, if it cannot be, give me that which is most
                  desirable. If yourself, with father and sister, were as much opposed as Marion's
                  friends, though I love you very dearly, I would marry her. Happiness in married
                  life depends more on mutual love than on all things else. Without that, I would
                  not give a fig for the favor of friends, or even boundless wealth. Where the
                  husband and wife disagree, the question is often asked, which is to blame? If they
                  are divorced, and one of the parties marries again, and lives happily, the
                  inference is drawn at once that the
                  fault lies mainly with the other party. Now this may be righteous judgment; but it
                  is just as likely to be the reverse, for the great obstacle in the way of
                  happiness was the lack of affinity."
               "But do you not believe that a couple who marry for convenience, or family
                  considerations, or who are mistaken in supposing there is congeniality between
                  them, may live together without quarreling, and so be measurably happy?"
               "O yes. The better educated class seldom quarrel; but they enjoy not the truest
                  happiness of married life. When one requires sympathy, the other is cold, and thus
                  it is from day to day. They are not one, but two; no union has been consummated
                  except in the eye of the law."
               "All you say sounds very reasonable, Elwood; but how came a bachelor to know
                  this?"
               "I learned it by observation, and from friends thus situated, whose hearts were so
                  overburdened that they wanted my sympathy. When painful thoughts gather, it is a
                  relief to pour them into some friendly ear. More than once have I been made a
                  confidant, and so learned strange secrets."
               "But if you should succeed in making Marion your wife, how do you know that there
                  would not be a lack of affinity between you?"
               "Perhaps I may not know it absolutely, but I think I do. We have loved each other
                  from childhood, and, though separated much of the time, yet have we been together
                  enough to know that we belong to each other. There was nothing in the
                  circumstances of my childhood to attract the regard of a young girl; and since
                  then, though an improvement has taken place, yet there is little to boast of. O!
                  my mother, doubt not our fitness, and never for one moment suppose that I can
                  marry any one else."
               "I do not wish it, Elwood. Marion has always seemed like a daughter to me, and her
                  faithfulness to you, under such harsh treatment, is worthy of all praise."
               "So I think. She will yet be mine, for Heaven has so willed it."
               I remained at home until entirely restored to health, and during that period I saw
                  Marion several times. For some reason she was no longer kept a prisoner; why, I
                  have never learned, but presume that it was on account of the indignation of the
                  people. It was generally supposed that Mr. Windsor had secreted Stanton, and aided
                  in his escape. Some thought that he incited the cowardly assassin to attack me. In
                  the then excited state of feeling, a mere trifle might have caused Mr. Windsor's
                  house to be mobbed, and himself and his hopeful son roughly handled. He was aware
                  of this, and no doubt a temporary check was thereby placed on the working of his
                  malignant passions.
               I did not visit Marion at her father's, anticipating that he would order me away;
                  but I saw her often in the little cemetery, where I vainly urged her to end the
                  difficulty by at once giving me a husband's right to protect her. She still
                     procrastinated nated, hoping
                  ultimately to gain her parents' consent.
               When I asked why she still hoped, she said that her father had certainly softened,
                  for she was now free to come and go when she chose. I tried to convince her that
                  but a slender foundation existed for her hopes, but the poor girl would not wholly
                  dismiss them.
               Mainly because of my wishes, Thomas Windsor was not molested, but returned to his
                  class in college. When he graduated, he joined his friend Stanton in the old
                  world.
               During the winter I rarely enjoyed interviews with Marion; but, when spring came
                  with its genial weather, we met as frequently as before. Our interviews were
                  necessarily brief, but much of happiness was crowded into those stolen
                  moments.
               In the month of April of this spring, I gave Mr. Mackay a hint of some crude plans
                  which had been forming in my mind for many months, of an improvement in machinery,
                  which, if it could be effected, would be of great service in cotton mills. He was
                  deeply interested, and questioned me at length, drawing out all my ideas,
                  approving of some, and showing the fallacy of others. Our conference ended by a
                  mutual agreement to give the subject a thorough investigation; which we did,
                  putting our thoughts on paper, and comparing notes, until we were entirely
                  satisfied that the scheme was practicable.
               Mr. Mackay was intimately acquainted with one Joseph Gardner, an excellent
                  machinist, and a man of original inventive genius. Such aid as he could give we
                  must have; and, after the subject had been explained to him, he was more
                  enthusiastic than ourselves. An arrangement was made that he should commence the
                  model at once, each sharing the expenses and the profits of the enterprise. He
                  entered actively upon the work; and, when seemingly insurmountable obstacles
                  arose, they were overcome by mutual consultation. Thus for long months did we
                  concentrate and direct our best thoughts and energies.
               Mr. Mackay and myself still continued our regular business, taking contracts for
                  building, employing many hands, and securing good returns. There was but one thing
                  lacking to make my happiness as complete as I could expect to enjoy on earth.
                  Entertaining no hopes that Mr. Windsor would relent, and receiving but little
                  encouragement from Marion that she would consent to a union against her parents'
                  wishes, I felt deeply anxious, and at times almost disheartened. It is remarkable
                  how much one may sometimes endure. But for the pressure of business, and the
                  excitement attendant on our new invention, my health might have been ruined.

                           Shakes like a thing infirm? O Cicero!
                           I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds
                           Have riv'd the knotty oaks; and I have seen
                           Th' ambitious ocean swell, and rage, and foam,
                           To be exalted with the threatening clouds;

                           Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.

               MARION and I continued our clandestine meetings until September. The last time we
                  met was on a beautiful evening at sunset. It was at our old place. The heavens
                  were gloriously brilliant; the cool breezes, sweeping through the trees, produced
                  rustling music, which calmed our unquiet hearts, and gave harmony to our thoughts.
                  We wandered by the silent graves, and conversed of life in all its aspects. For an
                  hour we were very happy; and then we noticed that a cloud was rising in the west.
                  With the rapidity of enchantment it flung its dark masses into the heavens. Anon,
                  forked lightnings leaped like angry gods from its bosom, and thunders rolled in
                  awful majesty, seeming to make the whole universe tremble. Under its folds the
                  winds gathered in ghostly armies, and rushed out, with their many shrieking
                  voices, as though shouting in battle.
               For some minutes the grandeur of the scene absorbed all other thoughts; but,
                  realizing that the rain would soon fall, we quickly hastened away. Before we
                  reached the street, I felt drops upon my hands; and, knowing that it was
                  impossible to arrive at any dwelling-house in season, we sought shelter in a small
                  building in the cemetery. The door was fastened; but, throwing myself powerfully
                  against it, I broke the lock, and we entered. Not many moments after, the rain
                  poured down as I imagined, when a child, it did at the time of the deluge.
               In this building we found a seat attached to the wall, which we gladly occupied,
                  for the tempest raged with unabated fury for more than three hours. It was the
                  grandest storm I ever knew. A vast deal of damage was done, and many persons were
                  killed by lightning. We heard terrific crashes repeatedly, as the thunderbolts
                  were hurled to the earth; we saw the red sheets of flame, and listened to the
                  mighty rushing wind and the madly-driven torrents; and yet our souls were unmoved.
                  Folded in each other's arms, we feared not; and, though Egyptian darkness soon
                  gathered about us, the time did not
                  seem long. We sat some minutes in silence. I was the first to speak.
               "Marion," I said, "I expected, when we sat down here, to find you greatly
                  agitated, and your heart palpitating violently; but you seem very calm."
               "I am very calm," she replied, "for I am with you. It is a fearful tempest, and
                  once I should have been frightened at the thought of being caught in a place like
                  this at night, and in such a storm. But your arms hold me, and there is peace at
                  my heart. Are you content to be here?"
               "Yes, darling. I am as calm as you. It is strange! Here we are, in the home of the
                  dead; a terrible tempest is raging around us; the night is very dark; and yet we
                  have no fears, no regrets that the suddenness of the storm prevented us from
                  returning."
               "No, dear; I have not one. I had much rather be here with you than anywhere else
                  in the world without you."
               "I could not better describe my own feelings. I cannot see you, but I can hear
                  your voice and feel your touch, and so I receive joy which I should search for
                  elsewhere in vain. Not such a storm as this, or such a place, do I dread, if I can
                  be with you; but separation from you,—O! Marion, it has already been too long. I
                  am so happy here, but so wretched when away from you. I beg of you to think of it
                  well. Ask yourself seriously if it ought to continue much longer."
               "I will, dear Elwood.—What a terrible crash! The lightning must have struck very
                  near us.—I am well aware that you must suffer intensely, for I experience deep
                  sorrow from the same cause. I scarcely know what to do, but I feel that matters
                  should not remain much longer as they are. If my parents do not change soon, I
                  must be yours, and end this cruel suspense."
               "I like to hear you talk thus, for it gives me hope. We cannot love better than
                  now, and our confidence is mutual. When separated, we are miserable; but in each
                  other's society, we are crowned with happiness. We find joy here, in the midst of
                  this terrible tempest. This should teach us that we may pass through the storms of
                  life together, hand in hand, without fear."
               "I did not require to be taught that, for I have long felt sure of it. Dear
                  Elwood, such shall be our happy lot."
               "I thank you for saying it; and God grant that your prophecy may prove true. Do
                  not wait very long, Marion, for time is too precious. I want you now:
                  the years pass so swiftly that we have but little time here, at most. What is to
                  come I would spend with you."
               "I feel that it should be so; and, after one more earnest plea with my parents, I
                     will be yours, Elwood."
               "Bless you, love; and, if you must make the plea, do it immediately, and
                  communicate the result to me. If you fail,—as heretofore, and as I am sure you will,—longer delay will not only be
                  useless, but dangerous."
               "You are right, and I will do as you request."
               When the storm ceased, I accompanied Marion home.

               A FORTNIGHT elapsed without my seeing Marion or hearing from her. I felt deep
                  solicitude, on account of her father's probable anger when she asked his assent to
                  our marriage. I feared he might separate us widely for a long period.
               While in this state of anxiety, I received the startling intelligence that Mr.
                  Windsor and his family had left town, and his house was closed. I sought
                  immediately to learn where they had gone, but none of the citizens could enlighten
                  me. Hoping soon to receive a letter from Marion, I bore up courageously under this
                  new trial.
               After a month of suspense, the much-desired epistle came. Marion had taken the
                  precaution, as of old, to direct it to my friend Mackay.

                           "MY DEAR ELWOOD,—Your poor Marion has repented when too late. Would
                              that I had become your wife
                              six months ago! During the long weeks since I was brought from
                              Dunfield, I have suffered bitterly, and am now almost broken-hearted.
                              When I have reflected upon your harrowing uncertainty about me, I have
                              accused myself of cruelty in not acceding to your request. Well, it
                              cannot be helped now, and repining is useless.
                           "A few days after that eventful evening in the cemetery, I summoned
                              sufficient courage to ask my father to consent to our marriage. I told
                              him how well we loved; that you alone had my heart, and that I could
                              not give my hand to another.
                           "He was excessively angry; but, as I plead with all the earnestness of
                              despairing love, he seemed to soften, and told me that he would think
                              of it. His face looked dark, and I liked not its expression; but still
                              I hoped that my wish would be granted. Foolish girl! how was I
                              deceived.
                           "Four weeks since, he informed me that I must be ready in two hours
                              for a journey. When I reminded him of my request, he scowled
                              hideously, but said not a word. From that moment my mother did not
                              leave me until we were ready to start. We came immediately to
                              Baltimore. Our journey was pleasant, and I should have enjoyed it very
                              much under other circumstances. O, could it have been in your society
                              alone, dear Elwood!
                           "I found every thing fresh and beautiful in this city, for the
                              frost-spirits do not come here early, but remain at the North until
                              the leaves and flowers are all dead. Making our journey so speedily,
                              spending a part of the time in sleep, the scene around seemed like
                              magic.
                           "Immediately on our arrival, my father, to my great surprise, rented a
                              house with requisite furniture; and this is to be our home until next
                              spring, and perhaps longer. In many respects I like Baltimore: it has
                              elegant buildings, neat and pleasant streets, and many monuments; but
                              its slavery I do not like. With the knowledge that liberty is but an
                              empty name; that men and women are robbed of all God gave them; that
                              they cannot call their limbs their own; that they are liable to be
                              sold like beasts on the auction-block; that hearts, which are wedded
                              as closely as ours, may be forever torn apart at any moment; that
                              little children may be snatched from the maternal bosom, and consigned
                              to men or devils, whichever will bid the highest; that
                              men, ay, and women, too, may be subject to the whip and other
                              indignities and abuses, with none to help,—in the lurid light of all
                              these enormities, the city looks gloomy and forbidding, for what is it
                              but a vast prison-house?
                           "I have seen many of the slaves here, and, as a general thing, they
                              are well clothed and appear comfortable. My father says that he is
                              better pleased with the system than ever. Alas! I well know that
                              slavery here is very different from that of the plantation, the
                              cotton-field, and the rice-swamp,— 
                                 
                                    "'Where the slave-whip ceaseless swings,
                                    Where the noisome insect stings,
                                    Where the Fever Demon strews
                                    Poison with the falling dews,
                                    Where the sickly sunbeams glare
                                    Through the hot and misty air.'
                                 
                              
                           
                           "But even here many of the slaves apparently chafe in their fetters. I
                              do not like to look into their faces, except to read their hearts, for
                              bondage has left its cruel traces.
                           "My father took an early opportunity to inform me what his object was
                              in coming to Baltimore.
                           "'Marion,' he said, 'I have commanded you, again and again, to dismiss Elwood Gorden from
                              your thoughts; but you have refused to obey. To one whose position is
                              worthy of you I have pledged your hand; and that pledge
                                 must be kept, and it shall be. I bade you
                              cease all intercourse with young Gorden; but in this, too, you have
                              disobeyed. Your infatuation is a marvel to me,—it is entirely
                              unaccountable. I felt anxious to remove you beyond the fatal spell; to
                              take you from the neighborhood of one who has not a spark of
                              manliness, and no regard to decency, that you might have an
                              opportunity, in the midst of new scenes, of being restored to your
                              right mind.
                           "'Our arrangement to comehere was made at great inconvenience and
                              expense, but it was all for your good. It is high time that you
                              learned to consult my wishes, and, if you begin now, I will cheerfully
                              forgive the past. If you will do as I desire, I may yet have a
                              daughter to be proud of, and my old age be cheered by seeing you in a
                              position which will cause thousands to envy you.
                           "'Mr. Stanton is hasty and inconsiderate, but he means well. He loved
                              you too dearly to see you holding clandestine interviews with one so
                              far beneath him. In a moment of frenzy, feeling it to be a duty to
                              chastise the intruder, he went beyond what are deemed the rules of
                              propriety at the North, and he thought it best to seize the
                              opportunity for a foreign tour; but he has the most solemn and binding
                              promise that he may yet return and claim you as his bride. It is
                              useless for you to name Elwood Gorden to me in connection with
                              marriage, for I would rather see you dead, than his wife.'
                           "I have been watched very closely, so that I could not write or send a
                              letter before; but I now attend school, and have an opportunity for
                              writing and going to the post-office. I want to hear from you, Elwood,
                              very much; but you had better not write now, for your letter would
                              fall into father's hands, and I should not receive it. But I must hear
                              from you in some way, for many months will pass before we can meet
                              again. I have no acquaintance that I can trust, so you must direct to
                              a fictitious person-age. O, I like not this deception, but it is
                              cruelly forced upon me. I must baptize myself with a new name, and
                              here it is: Ella Bowditch. I shall inquire for a letter soon. I long
                              to see you, but it might not be prudent for you to come to Baltimore;
                              yet you must do as you think best. O Elwood! I trust there is yet a
                              happy future for us; but God only knows. Do write soon. Good-by.

                              MARION."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               When I had read this letter, I resolved to make a journey to Baltimore
                  immediately; but, on further reflection, gave it up. Our business required every
                  moment of my time for the present; and, when that should slacken, Mr. Gardner, the
                  machinist, needed my assistance in perfecting our invention,—in fact, he could not
                  dispense with it, as the idea had originated with me. To this, then, as the
                  greatest enterprise of my life, did I apply closely during the winter months; but
                  not until the next May was the machine completed. It fully realized our
                  anticipations. We forthwith applied for a patent, which was not granted, however,
                  until another spring. "The law's delays" are proverbial, and I fully realized them
                  in this case; but I subsequently learned that many inventors fared much worse than
                  we. Had we been poor, probably others
                  would have reaped the benefit of our invention.
               Marion and I corresponded during the winter, which was all the solace we had. Each
                  sought to comfort and cheer the other. We loved devotedly; we had suffered much;
                  we were cruelly separated; and consequently our letters were
                  love-letters in reality. Many readers will call those which I have
                  already given very silly, they so abound with endearing expressions; but the
                  suppressed ones would be open to still harsher criticism. Let persons of colder
                  blood sneer, if they see fit: we would not have spared one
                  affectionate phrase.

               IN the first month of summer Marion's parents returned to Dunfield. For three long
                  weeks I sought in vain to learn whether she came with them. Exercising due
                  caution, I went night after night to see if I could discover a light in her room;
                  but none appeared, nor was there any sign of the chamber being occupied. What
                  could it mean? Was she a prisoner in some other room in the house? I thought it
                  very probable, as her father had such a wicked, cruel heart. After scanning all
                  parts of the building for many successive nights, I became convinced that, if she
                  was in it, great precautions had been taken to deprive her of a light, and prevent
                  her from appearing at a window. The
                  reader can surmise how wretched and weary I became, from continual nightly
                  watching and disappointment. But, at the end of the period mentioned, I received
                  the following letter from the object of my anxiety:

                           "MY OWN DEAR ELWOOD,—You have doubtless been very anxious because I
                              did not return with my parents. When I last wrote, I expected to do
                              so.
                           "We left Baltimore in May, and came immediately to this State. We
                              spent one week at Niagara, which I enjoyed very much. O Elwood! as I
                              gazed upon the mighty cataract, and heard the thunders of the rushing
                              flood, how much I wished you were present! It is always so. If I
                              behold any thing grand, beautiful, or soul-inspiring, I want you with
                              me, and then my joy is increased an hundred-fold. God grant that we
                              may yet behold Niagara together, with none to molest or make us
                              afraid. As I watched the rainbows which played around the glorious
                              scene, new hope sprang up in my heart, and I looked forward with a
                              clear eye of faith to the happy day when we shall be all in all to
                              each other.
                           "From Niagara we journeyed to this town, Cumberland. My father's
                              eldest brother, Horace Windsor, resides here. After a week had
                              elapsed, my parents informed me that they were about to start for
                              home, but that they should not take me with them. My uncle had engaged
                              me—he having the requisite authority—to teach the school in his
                              district, and I was to board with him.
                           "I have made this arrangement,' said my father, 'for your good alone.
                              It was never my intention to educate you for a teacher, being able to
                              support you without a resort to any avocation; but I think the
                              experience will be beneficial. Your mind will be occupied, and that is
                              what you need. I have been well satisfied with your deportment in
                              Baltimore, and I hope you have withdrawn your affections from the
                              low-born fellow who is so unworthy of them. If I am not deceived, you
                              now take a more reasonable view of the matter. If I was sure that all
                              thought of becoming the wife of Gorden had been dismissed from your
                              mind, I would not leave you here, for we shall miss your company very
                              much.
                           "'You have been the victim of a misplaced attachment, which fact is
                              extremely mortifying to all your friends. The spell may not be
                              entirely broken; and, should you return now, he whose arts once led
                              your will captive might renew his presumptuous efforts; for some men,
                              even though low and baseborn, have a wonderful power over female
                              hearts. When you are entirely disenchanted, cured of your folly,
                              restored to your right mind, the danger will be over, and then your
                              parents will welcome you home.
                           "'The past, my daughter, warns me that I cannot trust you. I would
                              have you remain here, and continue teaching, until you are sure that
                              every particle of affection for Gorden has departed forever. I venture
                              to predict that, within a few months, he will marry some farmer's
                              milkmaid,—which the Lord grant, for your sake and that of your
                              friends.'
                           "To this unfeeling speech, and many similar ones, I answered not a
                              word, but my heart rebelled. I think it was well that I remained
                              silent, for in the vexation of the moment I might have said that which
                              would have been a sure cause of our continued separation.
                           "I commenced my school just a fortnight since, and like the employment
                              well. What can be more noble than to teach the young, and store their
                              minds with knowledge; I look upon the good teacher as a public
                              benefactor. Under other circumstances, and with the sensation of
                              freedom, I could be quite content.
                           "You will ask, if I am willing to marry you now? Yes, dearest, I am.
                              All my scruples are gone, and I would have you come soon. Delays seem
                              to me as dangerous as they do to you. Hoping soon to see you, I
                              subscribe myself your own
                           
                              MARION."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               At the earliest possible moment after receiving this letter, I started for
                  Cumberland, having first informed my parents of my contemplated journey, and its
                  purpose,—to rescue a distressed damsel from the twin demons, Mammon and Pride.
               On my arrival in Cumberland, Marion was in school. I immediately called upon her,
                  and we agreed to be married as soon as the session was through. The school closed
                  at an early hour, when we repaired with much dispatch to the house of the only
                  clergyman in the town, but he was absent on a journey. After a brief consultation,
                  we thought it best to be married by a justice of the peace; and, having found one,
                  the nuptial knot was tied. There was a good hotel in the village, and there we
                  concluded to pass the night, Marion taking the precaution to send word to her
                  uncle that she should stay with a friend.
               Early next morning, I received a telegraphic dispatch that my father had been
                  taken suddenly ill, and that, if I would see him alive again, I must instantly
                  return. The cars were to start in a few minutes, and I told Marion she had better
                  go with me; but she replied that, as all her apparel was at her uncle's, and there
                  was no time to obtain it, she deemed it advisable to remain, and teach the school
                  until some one could be found to take her place. There was no danger now, she
                  gently urged, for we were married. I gave a reluctant consent, promising to return
                  for her soon.
               Reaching home just in season to receive my father's parting blessing, my presence
                  was of great comfort to him in his hour of dissolution; and, in subsequent days of
                  never-to-be-forgotten agony and doubt, the thought that I had cheered his last
                  moments gave me much consolation. Had I known what two affectionate hearts were to
                  suffer, I might not have gone to him; and had he known the same, he would hardly
                  have wished it. And yet, with his great paternal love for me, and my strong filial
                  regard, how could I refuse his last request?
               After my father was placed in the silent grave, I remained with my mother a few
                  days, to comfort her in her great affliction. Had I obeyed the impulses of my
                  heart, I should have hastened without delay to greet the wife of my bosom; but my
                  only parent was suffering from an irreparable loss, mourning for the husband of
                  her youth, and she begged me to remain; and I could not, in such an hour, forsake
                  her. She would not, she declared, detain me many days, for that would be
                  unreasonably selfish.
               
               The fifth night after my father's funeral, I had a dream which made a deep
                  impression on my mind. I thought I stood before the altar, with Marion's hand in
                  mine, and, just as the clergyman was about to pronounce us husband and wife,
                  George Washington Stanton rushed in, caught her in his arms, and, with the speed
                  of the wind, sprang out the door, leaped upon a horse held by Thomas Windsor, and
                  fled. In a few minutes I had mounted a fleet steed, and started in pursuit. How
                  rapid was his flight; but I followed him, determined to win back my bride or
                  perish in the attempt. I repeatedly struck the spurs into my horse's sides, urging
                  him on as if life and death depended on the result. We rushed through the forests,
                  over the hills, and across the plains, with the same mad precipitancy, and still I
                  did not gain upon him. At last, his horse, from the greater burden, fell exhausted
                  to the earth. I now felt sure of triumph; but, when reining in my steed, the
                  wretch drew a pistol and fired. I fell, severely wounded; but one foot caught in
                  the stirrup, and my horse renewed his flight with me thus dangerously
                  entangled.
               Marion gave a loud shriek, and fainted; but the last sound I heard was the demon's
                  loud, triumphant "Ha, ha!" as I was dragged swiftly from her sight.
               In a few minutes I had lost all consciousness, and yet seemed to know when my foot
                  was released, and I was left bleeding upon the ground. Lying there, fearfully
                  wounded and bruised, it seemed impossible that I should ever recover. People,
                  however, came, took up my apparently lifeless body, bore it to a place of shelter,
                  and summoned physicians, who dressed my wounds.
               I lay many days senseless, and long afterwards I suffered bitterly. I thought much
                  of my lost bride, and longed for the hour to come when I could go in search of
                  her. She was in the hands of a villain, and I must save her.
               In dreams, the mind seldom acts consistently; and, as a necessary result, much is
                  absurd and contradictory. At points of interest or danger, we suddenly break the
                  thread, and all that is past is consigned to oblivion; ere long we commence anew,
                  and perchance in the midst of some interesting or exciting scene, never querying
                  at all how we got there. We feel that we are in the right place, and go ahead.
               How long a time I slept without dreaming is not to be ascertained; but I suddenly
                  found myself well, and was unconscious of having suffered injury. I realized that
                  my wife had been stolen by the villain Stanton, and I was seeking for her day and
                  night. I visited many strange, dark places, and witnessed awful scenes of woe and
                  madness. I saw creatures, which resembled men and women, in chains, and their
                  shrieks and wailings seemed to freeze my blood with horror. Their bodies were
                  naked, their eyes sunken, fierce, and blood-shot, and their hair in frightful
                     disorder. They foamed at the mouth,
                  gnashed their teeth, lacerated their flesh, and howled all the while as though
                  they were beasts of prey, or were experiencing the torments of the damned.
               I was often in the wilderness, by night and by day, ever engaged in my weary and
                  fruitless search.
               Finally I learned that Marion was confined in a small cell, the prisoner of
                  Stanton,—the sole condition of her release being submission to his will. I heard
                  her utter my name in accents of fondness and despair. I knew that my hand alone
                  could open her prison-door. I resolved to hasten to her relief; but, to my horror,
                  found that I could not move a limb. I was bound, hand and foot, by invisible
                  cords. And then I thought that Stanton, through the aid of the devil, had
                  bewitched me. In the agony of total despair, I tried to break the enchantment,
                  that I might give freedom to my wife. The effort awoke me from my dream.
               I did not sleep again, and sought to throw off the painful impression which this
                  horrible vision had left. On awaking, I was in profuse perspiration, and as weary
                  as though I had been long engaged in the most exhausting labor. Conceiving that
                  Marion might really be exposed to danger, I decided to start immediately for
                  Cumberland.
               At breakfast, I informed mother of my intentions. She gazed at me inquiringly, but
                  did not object. While I was packing my trunk, she came in, looking deathly
                  pale.
               "What is it, mother?" I inquired in great agitation.
               "O Elwood," she replied, "how selfish I have been to keep you here."
               "Dear mother, do tell me what you mean."
               "News has come that your wife is insane!"
               "Insane! who told you that?"
               "One of the neighbors, who heard it from her father. He said that she had a number
                  of fits in succession, and, when they ceased, it was found that reason was
                  dethroned, with no hope of a restoration."
               "Mother!" I gasped, almost choking with anguish, "these are lies as black as hell.
                  I left her happy and well, and I never saw so beautiful an expression upon her
                  face as she had then. She felt that we were now united in bonds which no power but
                  God's could break. I fear for her, because a dark game, worthy of fiends, has long
                  been played. O! that I could go to her on the wings of thought; but no, I must
                  wait for the lazy cars to take me there. Depend upon it, mother, there is foul
                  play."
               "Elwood, Elwood, don't talk so; do be calm. I pity you, but be assured that you
                  require the most philosophical fortitude now. You must act with promptness, but
                  yet with due deliberation. That Marion is in great danger, because of the
                  wickedness of her relatives, there is certainly cause to fear. God grant you
                  wisdom to defeat all their plans."
               
               "Help me to get ready, mother, and I will start in the first train for
                  Cumberland."
               The carriage was soon at the door, when my mother bade me God-speed, and I was
                  borne swiftly away. I arrived at the station just in season to take the express
                  train, which carried me rapidly, and yet I thought very slowly,
                  towards my destination. How much I wished the train would go with greater speed. I
                  was impatient when we stopped for wood and water. I had read of an insane man
                  acting as engineer, who finally resolved to make no stops at all, but crowd in the
                  fuel, and attain a velocity such as was never known before. I almost wished our
                  engineer would rush ahead with the same mad precipitancy.
               I arrived at Cumberland the next morning, and went immediately to the house of
                  Marion's uncle. My ring brought him to the door.
               "Is Mrs. Gorden in?" I inquired.
               "I have never had the honor of an acquaintance with a lady of that name," he
                  replied.
               "Is Marion Windsor here?"
               "No, sir."
               "Can you inform me where she may be found?"
               "I cannot."
               "When did she leave here?"
               "A few days since."
               "What was the cause of her leaving?"
               "She was taken with a fit, and one followed another until she had six, which left
                  her insane."
               "Well, sir?"
               "It was necessary to remove her to an insane hospital, which was done without
                  delay."
               "What hospital?"
               "I am not at liberty to tell."
               "Who removed her there?"
               "Her friends."
               "I will thank you to inform me which of her friends."
               "That I don't choose to do."
               "Was it her father?"
               "I have once refused to inform you who it was; but you may be sure of one thing,
                  whoever did it had a legal right."
               "I doubt that, sir."
               "Why so?"
               "Because no one has a legal right to do anything of the kind, excepting
                  myself."
               "And pray how came you by that right, sir?"
               "I am her lawful wedded husband. I trust that is an answer to your question."
               "It would be, were it true; but, sir, I don't believe one word of it."
               "I see that you are in the plot. I have told you the simple truth, and therefore I
                  bid you beware, for I will sift this foul conspiracy to the bottom."
               "O, you may threaten as much as you please; nobody will be frightened. Have you
                  asked all the questions you wish to, sir?"
               "No—yes, as I only receive falsehoods in reply."
               
               "You are no gentleman; so good-day to you." And, bowing very politely, but as
                  though in mockery of my agony, he shut the door in my face.
               I believed scarcely a word he uttered; so proceeded to make inquiries elsewhere.
                  All I could learn was that an elderly gentleman had been seen in Cumberland, and
                  that Marion left the place in his company. In a state of mind bordering upon
                  distraction, I returned to Dunfield.

                           "O conspiracy!
                           Sham'st thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,
                           When evils are most free? O then, by day,
                           Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
                           To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy,
                           Hide it in smiles and affability:

                           Not Erebus itself were dim enough
                           To hide thee from prevention."
                        
                     
                     JULIUS CÆSAR.
                  
               
               IT is now requisite to go back, in my story, to the period when Thomas Windsor and
                  George Washington Stanton were at college. These young men contracted the habits
                  of drinking and gambling, but, as a general thing, indulged within bounds. They
                  visited, not unfrequently, the gambling-hells in a neighboring city, sometimes
                  winning and at other times losing small sums of money. The passion for play daily
                  grew stronger. Now and then they were concerned in a drunken brawl, where blows
                  were given, without regard to friend or foe; but still they did not take
                  warning.
               One memorable evening, before Thomas returned home in company with Stanton, the
                  former won a thousand dollars soon after he entered the gambling saloon. His
                  success greatly elated him, and he drank deeply. A few hours later he had lost all that he had gained, and was
                  five thousand dollars in debt. Terribly excited, he applied to his antagonist—a
                  son of the keeper of the saloon—the most insulting epithets, and when the latter
                  retaliated, he struck him, and the blow was returned. The passions of both were
                  now fully aroused, and they manifested their brutality by battering each other's
                  heads, and finally Tom Windsor stabbed the young man—named Rand—severely with a
                  sword-cane. The sight of blood, shed by his own wicked hand, sobered Tom very
                  suddenly. He attempted to flee, but his associates in crime held him fast. One of
                  the party was a surgeon, and dressed the wound, declaring that no vital part had
                  been touched, though it was doubtful if the wounded man could ever entirely
                  recover. It appeared that Windsor was more culpable than Rand; and, should a
                  judicial trial take place, in all probability he would be sent to the
                  penitentiary,—in any event it would be a terrible disgrace.
               On conferring with the father of Rand, he expressed a willingness to hush up the
                  affair for a "consideration." It was evident that the health of his son was
                  ruined, and he might never recover from his wounds. The five thousand dollars
                  which he had won from Thomas Windsor must be paid, and five thousand more in
                  compensation for the injury. Mr. Stanton interceded for his friend, and finally
                  Mr. Rand agreed to take three thousand instead of five. Stanton had inherited
                  fifty slaves from his grandfather, and he gave his bond for the payment of the
                  eight thousand dollars,—Thomas assuring him that his father would rather pay it
                  than to see his only son exposed to the State prison, or deeply disgraced, even if
                  he escaped.
               Before the company separated, they all bound themselves, by a terrible oath, not
                  to reveal the transactions of that night. They swore that, if either did reveal
                  them, the rest would hunt him to his death. The bond was then signed, and the
                  guilty parties went to their homes.
               It was some days after Thomas returned to Dunfield, before he could summon
                  sufficient courage to speak of the subject to his father. When the latter
                  comprehended the whole of it, he was astounded, and he told Thomas that to pay
                  such a sum, and the expenses of his education, would make them all beggars.
               I have stated that Stanton soon became enamored of Marion Windsor; and when he
                  learned that her father would have to make a forced sale of his property, at a
                  great sacrifice, in order to raise the money, he offered to bear the burden
                  himself, if he could have Marion for a wife. His proposition was deemed a
                  god-send, truly, by the father and son. The only difficulty in the way was to gain
                  Marion's consent.
               Stanton's wishes had seldom been thwarted, and hence his self-conceit was
                  enormously developed, and his habit of domineering had become second nature. Therefore, when Marion said
                  "No" to his suit, he resolved that she should say "Yes." Whether she loved him or
                  not, he would marry her. He fancied that he loved; and in a low, limited sense of
                  the word, perhaps he did.
               Finding himself spurned by the object of his desires, he held a long consultation
                  with her father and brother. He told them plainly that, unless she married him, he
                  should demand payment of the bond, or deliver Thomas up to justice. It was
                  thought, if I could be disposed of, the path would be clear. My death was not
                  desirable, if I could be frightened into a compliance with their demands. Stanton
                  declared that, if I did not yield, he would take my life,—he thought he should be
                  justified in the act. Was a "greasy mechanic" to stand in the way of a chivalrous
                  planter's son? But, in case of an encounter, whether deadly or otherwise, a place
                  of concealment for himself was requisite.
               The three now entered into an agreement, and bound themselves by a solemn oath to
                  abide by it while life should last. Stanton was to pay the bond, and Marion should
                  be his wife. The eight thousand dollars made her his, body and soul. Force should
                  not be used until other expedients had failed.
               After this unholy and monstrous bargain had been formed, and their oaths had been
                  taken with hands upon the Bible, they planned a hiding-place, in case of
                  emergency.
               The house in which Mr. Windsor lived was three stories in height, and, the year
                  before, he had added a large L to it. A part of this was still unfinished. Two
                  persons were present on the night of the affray in the gambling-house, whose
                  services were very much needed; one was a carpenter, and the other a mason. They
                  were sent for, the project was explained to them, and the work began. A large
                  chimney was carried up as far as the second floor, then a room was constructed
                  over it extending to the roof, as though the chimney had been continued on. To
                  complete the deception, a wooden chimney of ample dimensions projected from the
                  roof, with glass framed in near the top to shut out the rain and snow. This
                  afforded sufficient light through the greater part of the day, excepting in cloudy
                  weather. Means were taken for proper ventilation, also to warm the closet-like
                  apartment from the furnace. This room was so constructed that the human voice
                  could not be heard out of it,—even the most piercing shriek.
               Two doors led into the room, both self-locking; the inner one two feet from the
                  outer; and near the top of the former a part of the pannel could be removed,
                  making an opening through which food and drink might be passed in. Both of the
                  doors were unlocked with keys on the inside, but the person entering opened them
                  by touching hidden springs.
               
               On the first floor was placed a very large boiler, which frequently had water in
                  it. The chimney contained an oven and a place for ashes. Lest there should be
                  suspicion that it was not built for what it seemed, ashes and bits of wood were
                  placed under the boiler. When the work was all done, they successively tried their
                  voices in the apartment, to see if any sound could be heard within or without the
                  building. They became satisfied that it was impossible; and were well pleased with
                  their ingenious device.
               The expense of this hiding-place for a criminal was shared between Mr. Windsor and
                  Stanton. It was the design of the former, when he made an addition to the house,
                  to erect a chimney in the place which the false one occupied; and, in fulfilling
                  his part of the contract, he felt that it did not involve direct loss.
               In this room was Stanton concealed after he made the two attempts upon my life,
                  and so all the efforts to find him were ineffectual. The Windsors informed him
                  that, in his last attempt, I had been wounded very severely and perhaps fatally;
                  but they thought best not to let him know that I was under the same roof, lest
                  they should be unable to restrain him from taking my life. In justice to them, I
                  will here say that they had never counselled him to murder me, but only to
                  frighten and mutilate me so effectually that I would gladly resign the hand of
                  Marion.
               As a large reward was offered for the arrest of Stanton, and many officers were
                  seeking him, it was thought best for him to leave the country awhile, hoping time
                  might modify Marion's dislike toward him.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "O monstrous treachery! Can this be so,
                           That in alliance, amity, and oaths,
                           There should be found such false dissembling guile?"
                        
                     
                     KING HENRY SIXTH.
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,
                           Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver shedding tears,
                           Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire."
                        
                     
                     TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA.
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Happy is your grace,
                           That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
                           Into so quiet and so sweet a style."
                        
                     
                     AS YOU LIKE IT.
                  
               
               THE instant Marion's uncle learned of her marriage, he telegraphed to her father,
                  and the latter forthwith came to Cumberland. Marion trembled when she saw him
                  approaching; but he seemed less angry than she had anticipated. As he signified a
                  desire to see her alone, she led him to her room.
               "Is it true," he inquired, "that you are married to Elwood Gorden?"
               "Yes, father, it is."
               "And so you have disobeyed my solemn commands!"
               "I could not help it, father, for we had long loved each other dearly. Forgive me,
                  for he was more to me than my own life."
               "You are a foolish girl. I had fondly hoped, better things of you. Well, well, it
                  can't be helped now, so we must make the best of it. Your mother and I would not
                  be forever alienated from our only daughter. You must return home with me, and
                  then I trust we shall be able to arrange matters satisfactorily."
               "I would rather remain here, and continue my school until Elwood comes."
               "It would not look well for you to teach, now that you are a bride; and then it
                  will only cause your husband a journey here for nothing."
               "Still, I would rather remain."
               "Don't be obstinate, child, but, as you have married against my wishes, do now as
                  I desire, and return with me, that every thing may be settled amicably."
               "And will you go directly home, father?"
               "Why, certainly; and I want to reach there before your husband leaves, and so save
                  him time and expense."
               "Well, father, I will go with you, since you so much desire it; but, if I
                  consulted my own impulses, instead of giving heed to your wishes, I should remain
                  until Elwood comes."
               They set out for Dunfield without delay, and reached there the next evening. It
                  was dark when they left the cars, and they were not seen, to be recognized. A
                  domestic, according to instructions
                  tions, had taken a carriage to the depot and left it, and Mr. Windsor and Marion
                  rode home in that.
               Mr. Windsor pretended immediately to send for me. Mrs. Windsor seemed very glad to
                  see her daughter; and she, poor child, was happy because of their supposed
                  readiness to forgive her, and restore her to their love.
               While they were waiting for me, as they pretended, Mr. Windsor asked Marion if she
                  had ever seen the place where Mr. Stanton was concealed while the officers were
                  searching for him. She replied in the negative.
               "It is one of the queerest little hiding-places ever made," said Mr. Windsor;
                  "would you not like to see it?"
               "I am not particular about it," she replied.
               "Come, wife, suppose we all take a peep at it," Mr. Windsor said. "I presume you
                  never saw any thing more 'cutely contrived in your life, Marion. The work was done
                  when you were absent on a visit."
               "How far is it?" Marion inquired.
               "Why, child, it is here in the house, so you won't have to go far,—only into the
                  new part and up stairs. It's one of Thomas' inventions, the cunning dog!"
               Not suspecting treachery, my wife cheerfully went with them. The doors that led
                  into the prison were open, and the whole interior could be seen. It contained a
                  cot bed, one chair, a table, looking-glass, etc. Marion had suspected nothing,
                  when formerly living at home; and the discovery that the chimney was a false one
                  surprised her much. While she was gazing into the room in astonishment, her father
                  suddenly pinioned her arms, pushed her in, and shut the inner door. In a moment
                  she realized that she was betrayed, and she sank upon the floor, as pale as
                  death.
               "O my father," she exclaimed, "you cannot mean this!"
               "Mean it!" he said, triumphantly, "you disobedient fool, I do mean
                  it. You thought you could outwit your old father; but you will learn your mistake,
                  by-and-by. I told you, long ago, that a child of mine should never marry a Gorden;
                  but you did it, and now learn your fate. You shall not live with him. Never dream
                  of seeing his face again, or at least until he has another wife. Word has been
                  given out that you are crazy, and confined in a mad-house. The first statement is
                  true; and as for the latter, I have provided an asylum for you which is perfectly
                  safe, and where you will remain until you have amply atoned for your
                  stubbornness."
               "Father! father! O, do not shut me up here! Let me go to my husband, or I shall
                  become crazy indeed. You cannot be so cruel. What will Elwood do when he learns
                  that I am lost? I must go to him, I must—O, stay me not!"
               "But you can't go. As to your husband," cried the old tyrant, sneeringly, "ha, ha!
                  I want the whelp to suffer. I have got
                  him now where I can hit him on the raw, and he shall feel the lash, and the blood
                  shall run, until he learns the folly of braving the wrath of his betters. No, no;
                  you shall not go to him."
               "I will go, I will!" said the brave-spirited girl, springing at the
                  door, and trying to open it. "I beg—I pray that you will not keep me here."
               "You can try your strength on that door when-ever you please. You will find it
                  excellent exercise, and I trust it may do you good. It will probably stand about
                  as many efforts as you will care to make, and then be just as good as new."
               "Mother, my own mother! will you not plead for me? Father will hear to you, I
                  know. Can you consent that your own child, your only daughter, shall be kept a
                  prisoner in such a place as this? Will you, mother, have the heart to let me be
                  separated from my dear husband? O! say to father that you will not
                  consent to this, and then he will let me go."
               "You are my child," she replied, "although it is true that you have seldom acted
                  toward me as a child should. I told you my wish that you should marry Mr. Stanton,
                  and commanded you again and again to have no intercourse with Gorden. How well you
                  have obeyed me! You deceived both your parents, and now take your reward. You must
                  remain here until Gorden marries again, or until you are ready to sue for a
                  divorce, and promise ise to become the wife of George Washington Stanton."
               "O mother, you cannot be so cruel! A wife already, yet you would have me promise
                  to wed again! Was such a monstrous thing ever heard of?"
               "You are doomed to remain here until you do promise,—even until he
                  comes to take you to his sunny home."
               "I hope you are satisfied now," added Mr. Windsor. "Solitude will bring
                  repentance. You are perfectly safe here, and had better not waste your strength in
                  screaming or yelling, for it won't do a bit of good. When the doors are both shut,
                  not a sound can be heard. I know, for we tried it thoroughly. In the house and
                  out, it is just the same; so it will be well for you to husband your strength,
                  having lost your husband. We shall keep you well, and you may write,
                  or read, or sew, or do nothing, just as you choose. I don't see why you can't
                  enjoy yourself finely."
               "O, this is some awful dream!" exclaimed Marion. "If I could only wake and find
                  myself with my own Elwood, all fears would depart. But it seems so real—ha, ha,
                  ha! it must be a dream, though; and yet here I am; it is myself; and I am locked
                  into this diabolical place. Those who hold the relation of parents have done
                  it,—they now behold my agony unmoved. Have they human hearts?"
               "There, there," said her father, "don't take on so. Dry up your girlish tears, or you'll make
                  yourself sick. We do pity you for being so foolish, and bringing this great
                  trouble upon us all."
               "Pity! the pity of the wild beast for its prey,—of devils for their victims in
                  hell!"
               "Now that ain't pretty, my child. Such expressions are not at all becoming in a
                  young lady. The ingenuity of this room I think will amuse you. The funniest part
                  is the window, which is the chimney through the roof. It is very curiously
                  contrived. We knew that, if we placed the glass upon the top, people would
                  discover it, and become suspicious; so we put it six inches below. To carry off
                  the water, there is a tube entirely hidden from view, which conveys every drop of
                  it to the roof, and no one would ever suspect it, unless they went up to it, and
                  that we don't intend they shall do at present. Of course, you are now aware that
                  the chimney above is wood instead of brick. You never saw a window contrived in
                  that way before; it will always let in the light, and you will not require either
                  curtain or blind, for nobody can look in."
               "You have said enough to insult your victim. Have you no mercy at all? I have
                  called you father and mother heretofore, but I know you as such no longer. Those
                  endearing terms shall never pass my lips again, in speaking of or to you, while
                  life lasts. I am no longer your child, but your much-abused slave!"
               "It is all folly to talk thus. You will feel differently ently, by-and-by.
                  Reflection and solitude will do the work. I hope you will have a good night's rest
                  after your long journey, and so much useless excitement. Make yourself as
                  contented as you can, my child, and then you will be quite happy."
               They handed her a light, and some water, and then replaced the pannel and shut the
                  outer door. It made a heavy dull noise as it swung to, and seemed a death-knell to
                  her hopes. She set the lamp on the table, threw herself upon the little bed, and
                  wept long and bitterly. But one may not weep always, though the heart is breaking.
                  She arose from her cot, took the light, and examined every part of the room. She
                  was satisfied that escape was impossible. Standing under the false chimney, she
                  looked through it, and saw a star in the heavens. She was instantly comforted by
                  the thought that the eye of God was upon her, when there was none to pity or to
                  save, and that He would have compassion. She kneeled down by her bed, and poured
                  out her burdened soul in prayer.
               "O! my Father and my God, thy poor, wronged child would seek thee in the hour of
                  her desolation. If I have forgotten thee in more blessed moments, O forgive. Thou
                  knowest how wickedly I have been betrayed by those who should protect me. Father,
                  soften their hearts, and lead them to repentance, that they may speedily open my
                  prison-doors. Teach thy despairing child resignation, and may she wait calmly for the hour of
                  deliverance. And O, my God! comfort the husband of my love. The wife of his bosom
                  torn from him, may he not be left to despair. May he never doubt my faithfulness,
                  but live on, believing that we shall meet again. Let this faith abide in the
                  hearts of both, to give us comfort. Father, I thank thee that, in this lone hour,
                  new hope is born. The blossom shall come out; the ice shall melt and disappear;
                  the cloud shall pass away, bearing a rainbow upon its surface. We shall meet again
                  in thy good time, and sorrow shall be swallowed up in great joy. Let thy guardian
                  wings be over thy children, to keep us safely for evermore. And thine, O heavenly
                  Father, shall be the glory and the praise. Amen."
               When the trembling captive arose from her knees, she felt more calm. She believed
                  that deliverance would ultimately come, but how or by what means she could not
                  surmise. She knew that I would not give up the search for her while life remained
                  to me, and she trusted in my shrewdness and energy to find a clue to her prison.
                  What she cared for most was separation from me,—a long incarceration,—and the
                  agonies which I must endure in the tedious, fruitless search.
               Marion now sat down, and planned some method of occupying her time. For one thing,
                  she resolved to keep a journal of all that occurred, and of her own meditations
                  from day to day. She began it then, and continued it for many weary days after.
                  She wrote until past midnight; then went quietly and hopefully to rest.
               A few hours' slumber refreshed her, and she arose at the summons of Mr. Windsor to
                  receive food for the day.

                           And as my fortune ripens with my love,
                           It shall be my true love's recompense."
                        
                     
                     KING RICHARD SECOND.
                  
               
               ON arriving at Dunfield, I learned that Mr. Windsor had returned, but no one had
                  seen Marion. The domestics were privately questioned, and declared that, if she
                  came with him, they were ignorant of the fact.
               Being fully aware that no one had the right to restrain my wife of her liberty, I
                  called upon Mr. Windsor immediately. He saw me before I reached the house, and
                  came out to meet me.
               "Mr. Windsor," I asked, "where is my wife?"
               "Your wife! how should I know where your wife is? This is the first time that I
                  ever knew you had a wife."
               "I don't like to accuse a man of your years of falsehood; but, sir, I
                     know you to be guilty of it."
               "You are an impudent puppy,—so, take that as a sufficient reply."
               "Mr. Windsor, I married your daughter, against your will, it is true. I left her
                  at Cumberland, and by some means you persuaded her to place herself in your power.
                  You know where she is, and I demand information of her without delay. You have no
                  right to restrain her of her liberty; and, if you continue to do so, it will be at
                  your peril."
               "You take for granted what remains to be proved, sir."
               "And it will be proved. I have visited Cumberland in search of Marion; and, though
                  your brother would tell me nothing but lies, I became satisfied that she left with
                  you."
               "I should think you would doubt your wife's fidelity, from her taking 'French
                  leave' when so soon expecting you."
               "No, sir, I doubt her not at all. You deceived her: that was the reason she left,
                  and no other. Being married, she fancied it would do to trust you. Now, sir, I
                  require you to lead me to her presence!"
               "Modest, upon my soul! I deny that Marion has ever been married to you, and so I
                  have a right to secrete her from you, if I choose. The girl is insane, and has
                  been sent to an asylum, where she is properly cared for, and may in time be restored; though that is somewhat
                  doubtful. She had dangerous fits, to begin with, of which she was relieved by the
                  use of very powerful remedies. If you speak the truth in relation to your
                  marriage,—which I deny,—it was undoubtedly the cause of her illness; and so you
                  have to thank yourself for the great evil that has come upon her."
               "Mr. Windsor, how can you stand there and utter such outrageous lies? You
                     know Marion is not insane, and she has not been ill unless your
                  cursed deception and cruelty have made her so. This is a terrible business, sir,
                  and it had better stop where it is. How could you, old as you are, and with hair
                  already whitening for the grave, engage in such a hellish plot as this?"
               "Well, Mr. Gorden, if you know more about the matter than I do, you should not
                  come to me for information. As to your profanity, it is worthy of you."
               "Mr. Windsor, you are my wife's father, and I would not injure you, or make this
                  matter public, or at all events any more public than it is already. But, if you do
                  not tell me where my wife is secreted, I will use legal means to compel you."
               "Do your utmost and your worst, Mr. Gorden,—I fear you not!" And thereupon, the
                  hard hearted man returned to his house.
               As there was no other alternative, the legal measures which were requisite to
                  obtain the end desired were immediately adopted. Mr. Windsor came into court, and
                  denied that I had ever married his daughter. The burden of proof was thus thrown
                  upon me. I had given the marriage certificate to Marion, and so it was necessary
                  to send to Cumberland for the deposition of the justice, for no witnesses were
                  present. Judge of my dismay when news came that the man had closed his business in
                  town, and gone to parts unknown. I lost no time in making another journey to
                  Cumberland; but the search was fruitless.
               So, then, the plot was deeper than I had supposed. It was at present impracticable
                  to prove my marriage, and therefore I could not compel Mr. Windsor to bring my
                  wife into the presence of the court. Alas! I had made two fatal mistakes. The
                  first was in allowing her to remain at Cumberland on any consideration; and the
                  second, in giving the marriage certificate into her hands. Thus she seemed lost to
                  me, beyond recovery.
               I had doubted the story of her being sent to an insane asylum, and was half
                  convinced that she was a prisoner at home; and so I went, night after night, and
                  frequently during the day, and scanned the building on every side, to see if some
                  signal would not be shown to let me know that she was there.
               While watching, one afternoon, I saw Mr. Windsor leave home in his carriage. I
                  resolved at once to call upon his wife; so I went to the door and rang the bell. A
                  servant appeared, and I requested
                  quested to see Mrs. Windsor. When she came, I bowed to her and said:
               "As you are a woman, possessing, I hope, in some degree a woman's heart, I have
                  come to see if you will not give me information respecting my wife."
               "Well, sir," she replied, "you have made us a great deal of trouble; and, now that
                  you have driven Marion insane, I did hope that you would keep away, and mind your
                  own business."
               "I have not made the trouble, madam, but you have made it for yourselves. Marion
                  and I loved each other from early childhood, and we have been legally married. Now
                  I have the right to protect her."
               "If Marion's senses are ever restored, and she wishes to see you, she will send
                  for you, sir; and until then your company can be dispensed with."
               "Mrs. Windsor, you know, as well as I, that the story about Marion's insanity is
                  false. I will agree to abide the test if you will take me to her. If she says that
                  she never desires to see me again, crazy or not, I will be governed by her
                  wishes."
               "It would not be best to excite the poor child any more. I could not answer for
                  the consequences, were she to see you again. When a child has been guilty of a
                  great act of disobedience, the remorse is terrible."
               "Remorse! will not the time come when Mr. Windsor and you will feel remorse?
                  Marion does not feel it, though. That she is suffering intense agony I doubt not,
                  but not from remorse,—she mourns her last fatal mistake. Had she consulted me,
                  whether, in any contingency, to confide again in her parents, I should have
                  counselled her against it."
               "You have too long given her such counsel; and you see what the result is. As you
                  have been the sole cause of this irreparable mischief, you ought to be satisfied,
                  and forever dismiss my daughter from your mind."
               "If you expect me to be guilty of such desertion, you are greatly mistaken. I
                  shall never give up the search for Marion while I live. I believe she is a
                  prisoner in this house; and, if you have a heart of flesh, take me to her! You
                  know, Mrs. Windsor, how fearfully she is now suffering because she is restrained
                  of her liberty, and separated from her husband. Think, O! think what your own
                  feelings would be if you were thus wronged! I beg of you not to harden your heart,
                  but let mercy and kindness enter it, and then I shall not plead in vain."
               "Such talk is entirely useless, Mr. Gorden, and worse than useless; for, if I had
                  the power to take you to her, I would not do it. Rather would I separate you as
                  widely apart as the poles."
               "And you are a woman! a wife and mother! O my God! can it be possible? Poor, dear
                  Marion, Heaven protect you in this dark hour, and strengthen your Elwood to bear
                  up bravely to the end. Mrs. Windsor,
                  may God give you space for repentance."
               "And you too, sir, for you greatly need it. You had better go now, and not trouble
                  yourself to come again."
               "Madam, if Marion is in your power, beware what you do to her! If you are
                  determined to keep her a prisoner, beware that you go no further! I believe that
                  you are accessory to a crime as black as perdition,—the kidnapping of my wife, and
                  the hiding of her from her legal protector. To cover up your wickedness, the
                  vilest falsehoods are coined and circulated. This conspiracy would disgrace
                  pirates; but let it not go too far. I am on the track of the conspirators, and
                  shall yet learn all!"
               Marion's insanity was not generally believed in, although the report had been
                  widely circulated. A very few persons, however, professed to credit it; they
                  affected to understand the whole matter, and, when the subject was mentioned,
                  vaguely hinted that Marion had found me so different from what she anticipated,
                  that the thought of having become my wife drove her to madness.
               But the people of Dunfield were becoming so much incensed against Mr. Windsor,
                  that he expressed himself willing to have his house searched, with this
                  stipulation, that I should not be one of the party, though Mr. Mackay might act in
                  my stead. Without informing him of the day or the hour they would come, a number
                  of gentlemen made him a call, and examined every room, from the attic to the
                  cellar, but without discovering any ground for suspicion. My disappointment was
                  great, for I had fondly hoped they would detect Marion's place of concealment. The
                  search convinced them all that the lost one was not there, and so I felt it was
                  useless for me to continue watching the house.
               Being now quite weary and almost ill, from anxiety and nightly vigils, I went home
                  to my mother and sister. O! how grateful I was for the sympathy which they poured
                  into my desolate and aching bosom. My mother had become reconciled to her great
                  bereavement, and there was returning sweetness and beauty in her countenance.
               I learned for the first time that Lissy was engaged, and had been for some months.
                  It was a case of love at first sight, but she acknowledged having acted hastily. I
                  perceived that she was not happy; and, as her welfare for life depended on this
                  step, I counselled her to break the engagement, if her betrothed proved unworthy,
                  or if she could not bestow upon him her whole heart. Others might regard such an
                  engagement as sacred; but, to me, marriage, without perfect confidence and
                  affection, was a sacrilegious thing. Her intended did not visit her while I was at
                  home, for he had gone—so he wrote—to the South, on business.
               I remained at home for two weeks, and was urged to tarry longer and recruit my
                  strength, I looked so pale and
                  grief-worn; but I could not,—I must go in search of my lost bride.
                  After having made an arrangement with my partner, to be absent an indefinite
                  period, with an aching and desponding heart, I left Dunfield.
               The report had gone abroad that Marion was insane, and had been sent to a
                  hospital. The former story I believed to be a vile falsehood; the latter I thought
                  might be true. I had often heard of persons being confined in insane asylums, who
                  were not mad at first, but were finally made so by imprisonment in such places.
                  The overseers of lunatic hospitals had in some cases been deceived by the
                  rascality of relatives, and sometimes they were bribed to become parties to the
                  horrible barbarity. If Marion was confined as a lunatic, the latter course alone
                  had been resorted to. That her parents were capable of such malignant cruelty, I
                  had ample reason for believing.
               I determined to visit the lunatic hospitals throughout the country, for where else
                  could I seek her? I was admitted, with very little difficulty, into a large number
                  of lunatic asylums, and witnessed scenes of the most painful description. Some of
                  the insane appeared very refined and intelligent, and seemed to be in full
                  possession of their reason, unless one happened to touch on a particular subject.
                  One man announced himself as the Hon. Daniel Webster; and he "supposed he might
                  say, without giving offence, that he was the greatest of living statesmen." He
                  wanted me to hear a speech which he had prepared, with much care, respecting the
                  northeastern boundary question; and immediately commenced his harangue. A woman,
                  to whom I was introduced, said it must not be supposed she was a lunatic, for she
                  owned the hospital, and was there for the sole purpose of taking care of her
                  property, having learned by experience that it would not do to trust to hirelings.
                  Many of the patients in the hospitals, however, were so imbecile or so frantic as
                  to have but few traces of humanity remaining. Alas! that God-like reason should
                  ever be so crushed out.
               After I had visited the hospitals in New England, it occurred to me that, in the
                  dream before related, I had witnessed these harrowing scenes, and that Stanton,
                  aided by Thomas Windsor, had stolen my bride. Possibly they had returned from
                  Europe, and had succeeded, by chicanery or violence, in taking Marion to South
                  Carolina. Acting upon this idea, I immediately started for that State; but there
                  my search was as fruitless as elsewhere. I learned that the young reprobates were
                  in Italy, when last heard from.
               It was now spring, and I received a letter from Mr. Mackay, stating that I had
                  been elected to represent the town in the General Court, and I must return
                  speedily. Our patent was also secured, and it was important that my voice should
                  be heard before the enterprise proceeded further. Mr. Mackay advised me not to
                  decline the office which my fellow townsmen had honored me with. In relation to my wife, her whereabouts continued
                  unknown, but he believed the mystery would be solved by-and-by. He advised me to
                  wait watchfully but patiently, and not ruin my health and waste my energies by
                  continuing a useless search. If Marion was in a lunatic asylum, the officers had
                  been bribed, and I should not be allowed to see her, for they knew it would be
                  unsafe for them to admit any one to her presence who was not concerned in the
                  plot.
               All this appeared very reasonable, and, as duty called me, I decided to return. I
                  arrived home in due season, and was heartily welcomed by my numerous friends. That
                  night I was serenaded by a number of the citizens, and their sympathetic songs
                  brought tears to my eyes. Ah! when in trouble, the voice of friendship is
                  sweet.
               We made immediate arrangements to dispose of our invention. A large manufacturing
                  company became the sole purchaser, and I soon found myself worth fifty thousand
                  dollars.
               I took my seat in the legislature, and performed the duties pertaining to the
                  station to the best of my ability. Through my instrumentality, a committee was
                  appointed (of which I was chairman) to investigate the condition of the insane
                  hospitals in the State. We performed our mission thoroughly, but I obtained no
                  clue to my lost bride.
               After the adjournment of the legislature, finding no rest at home, I again
                  travelled over the country, in search of the missing one. In order to obtain ready
                  admission to the hospitals, I carried with me a certificate from the Governor and
                  Council of my own State. This was of much service, in securing prompt admission
                  and civil treatment.
               After spending six months in futile wanderings, I returned once more to Dunfield,
                  where I was again chosen to the legislature. But for the entreaties of friends, I
                  should have declined the honor, for I was broken in spirit and ambition.
               My success greatly mortified Mr. Windsor, and he tried by every means in his power
                  to defeat me; but he helped far more than he hindered. He was heard to say that he
                  would rather sacrifice a thousand dollars, than I should be chosen to represent
                  the town.
               A short distance from Mr. Mackay's was a lot of land which I had often admired,
                  uttering to him a strong desire to purchase, and build a house upon it. When I
                  returned this spring an elegant dwelling had been erected on the spot by Mr.
                  Mackay, and was nearly finished. He invited me to examine it. I expressed myself
                  delighted.
               "But why have you built this?" I asked. "You don't intend moving here?"
               "By no means. My poor friend, you have searched in vain for your wife, and from
                  the depths of my soul I sympathize with you. I would not have you cherish bright
                  hopes only to be disappointed; but I believe she will yet be found."
               "God grant, my ever faithful friend, that you may prove a correct prophet," I said
                  with much emotion. "Through your aid I
                  have risen from poverty to affluence, and have the confidence and esteem of my
                  townsmen; but how readily would I sacrifice all,—yes, all,—if Marion
                  could be restored! O my friend, God only knows how I have suffered since she was
                  so cruelly stolen from me! But, thank Heaven, I am still sustained by hope, and by
                  the consciousness of rectitude."
               "It is well that you are; and something tells me that you will not be kept long in
                  this cruel suspense. I have built this house, Elwood, as a gift to your bride,
                  with the firm belief that I should yet have the privilege of presenting it to her
                  in person, and for many years witnessing her happiness while dwelling here."
               This announcement filled my eyes with tears, and I replied in a broken voice: "O,
                  I thank you, and, in the name of the dear lost one, I bless you. Most noble,
                  generous friend, may God grant that your faith shall be crowned with
                  fruition."
               At times, indeed, I was almost overwhelmed by despair; but this incident cheered
                  my heart and brightened my hopes.

                     MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM.
                  
               
               ON a cloudy afternoon in the autumn of 1847, two gentlemen, named Henry Morrison
                  and Charles Edmonds, were angling on a pond ten miles from my home in Dunfield.
                  They were very intimate friends, and were travelling around the country, partly
                  for pleasure and partly for business. In order to enjoy themselves
                  best,—journeying or stopping, just as they pleased,—they procured a horse and
                  buggy in preference to "riding on the rail," or in a stage coach. Being fond of
                  sporting, they took their guns and fishing-tackle, having wisely determined to
                  recruit their jaded physical powers by hunting and angling. For a number of days
                  they had rare sport; but, on the afternoon alluded to, their luck was almost
                  unprecedented.
               "How plentiful the fishes are here, Charles," said Henry Morrison. "And they are
                  as ravenous as sharks. You have only to
                  drop in your hook and lo! out comes a fish; and what fine, handsome fellows they
                  are. By Jove, I like this."
               "So do I, and all the better that we did not anticipate such luck," said Charles
                  Edmonds. "But I'm the victor so far, for I have caught the most. I tell you what:
                  I am fond of pickerel, and mean to try for some."
               "So do; any thing in the shape of fish will bite to-day. We'll have a feast when
                  we get to the hotel in Dunfield. My! you have caught one quickly, and a noble one,
                  too. Something big has taken hold of my hook,—there he is, the largest fish yet.
                  Well, perch is good eating."
               "And there is another pickerel, larger than your perch, Henry. This is fun. I have
                  gained a pound a day since we started, and probably I shall gain two pounds
                  to-day."
               "I hope so, for you are lean enough now. Here comes another. Hurra! a trout, of
                  all things."
               "So it is. I had no idea we should find trout here; I suspect they must have been
                  manufactured for this particular occasion. But here is another pickerel, larger
                  than either of the others. What glorious fishing!"
               Thus engaged, the two friends became so excited that the "feathers from the wings
                  of night," to use Longfellow's expression, were shook thickly around them before
                  they observed it.
               "I say," said Henry, "it is growing dark fast, and we have a trip of ten miles
                  before us."
               "So it is. We must be off in double quick time."
               "And have a ride in darkness and rain, or I am no weather prophet."
               Hastily pulling for the shore, the young men put their fishes in the carriage and
                  drove rapidly towards Dunfield. The wind now blew briskly from the south, and ere
                  long the rain began to fall in torrents, beating into their faces. The moon was
                  not out, and soon it was so dark that all the world seemed one wide waste of
                  blackness. Not an object could be discerned; the hand held close before the eyes
                  could not be seen.
               In a brief space of time, the clothes of the travellers were completely drenched.
                  As they had never been in that part of the country before, they pursued their way
                  with difficulty and uncertainty. Having rode a sufficient length of time, as they
                  thought, to reach the village, they stopped at a house to inquire, and learned
                  that they had gone four miles out of their way. Receiving very minute directions,
                  they continued on, the storm increasing rather than abating. Morrison was driving,
                  or rather holding the reins, for he let the horse take his own course in the more
                  than Egyptian darkness.
               Edmonds finally saw a light glimmering in the distance, and pointed it out to his
                  companion. They had travelled some miles without being aware of passing a single
                  house.
               "That looks cheerful," said Henry. "I wish there were a hundred of them."
               
               "And then you would suppose Dunfield to be close at hand," Charles observed in
                  reply.
               "Certainly, or some other village, which would be quite as welcome, if I could
                  only find shelter from this terrible storm."
               "It's a severe one, truly. What a long ten miles we have travelled, and no sign of
                  the village yet."
               "We may have missed our way again."
               "Shouldn't wonder if we had, it is so very dark. The wind and rain are sufficient
                  to blind any one, without the darkness."
               "That's a fact. But I am glad you have found your tongue once more. I never yet
                  rode with anybody who could talk worth a copper in the dark. Just at the time when
                  one feels the need of a friendly voice, all is still as the grave. Had not yonder
                  light come in view, you would have kept silence for half an hour longer, I
                  presume."
               "And you likewise. The fact is, Henry, you feel just as little like conversation,
                  when taking such a gloomy ride, as anybody else."
               "You may be right; but why is it? I have been in company with young girls,
                  everlasting chatter-boxes, equal to talking down six lively fellows like you or
                  me, who were as speechless as statues when riding in the dark. I confess, I don't
                  understand it."
               "I shall not try to enlighten you when it is so confounded dark as it
                  is now. The storm is increasing, and in my view, Henry, it is exceedingly
                  dangerous riding. I am tired of it. We have been on the road two or three hours,
                  and no sign of Dunfield yet. What do you say to applying to yonder dwelling, for
                  entertainment for man and beast?"
               "I agree, provided you will make the application, Charley."
               "Why will not you make it?"
               "Me! I would ride till doomsday before asking for entertainment at a private
                  house, perfect strangers as we are."
               "It might be dooms-night to us, if we should keep on. You are too
                  ceremonious, Henry."
               "I can't help it, Charles. Confound those fishes! if they hadn't been so greedy,
                  we should have avoided this."
               "Better say, if we had not been so greedy."
               "Just as you like, Edmonds. But if you don't fancy appearances there, we won't
                  stop, even if they are willing to accommodate us."
               "You are too particular, on such a night as this. 'Any port in a storm.' I should
                  not marvel at all if that house contained a bright-eyed damsel, whom you will be
                  very loth to leave."
               "Nonsense, Charles! I never saw a woman yet that I would snap my fingers at."
               "You would be an unmannerly dog if you did. We are both considered incorrigible
                  bachelors. Thirty years old, and no bright eyes have shot Cupid's arrows into our
                  hearts yet. I don't believe you will always live a bachelor. I know you too well for that. If there is a man on
                  earth designed by nature and education to make a woman happy, you are that man.
                  Now, Henry, wouldn't it be decidedly romantic if our buggy should be overturned
                  near that dwelling, and one or both of us half-killed, which would detain us days
                  or weeks; giving you an opportunity to get bewitched by the only daughter, whom
                  by-and-by you shall marry?"
               "What nonsense, Charley! You don't catch me to marry a country hussy. I sha'n't
                  expect to find female attractions under that roof. Now, mark my prediction of the
                  family there: an old couple of seventy-five, whose faces have forgotten that such
                  things as soap and water ever existed; a promising youth of forty, who knows just
                  enough to go in when it rains; and three squint-eyed, cross-grained, wrinkled old
                  maids."
               "Fie, Henry! you are a false prophet, and always were. I am certain that we shall
                  find the right kind of people, and be cordially welcomed. Any way, we can't
                  possibly go any farther tonight, Morrison. The storm grows more furious, and the
                  darkness can almost be felt."
               The house they were approaching stood on a spot slightly elevated above the road;
                  and the lights gleamed out very brightly, for the window-blinds were open. It had
                  the appearance, in the darkness, of a country hotel, and, to the wet, jaded horse,
                  it promised shelter and a full crib. Instantly he quickened his speed into a fast
                  trot,— a little too fast for safety,—and the result was, an overturn of the
                  buggy.
               Charles was speedily on his feet, and held the horse by the bridle; and his
                  presence of mind saved his friend, whose legs had become entangled with the reins,
                  endangering his life, perhaps, if the animal, which was very high-spirited, had
                  ran away. Morrison escaped, however, with a few slight bruises, while Charles was
                  not injured at all. Dark as it was, they soon learned that both shafts of the
                  buggy were broken.
               "This is most wretched luck," said Henry, despairingly.
               "You wicked wretch!" replied Charles, "to speak in that way after such an escape.
                  For my part, I think we have abundant reasons for thankfulness. Heigho! we shall
                  have to stop with the old maids now, whether they wish it or not."
               The people in the house had heard the crash, and some one appeared at the door
                  with a lantern. Henry held the horse, while Charles went to the house and procured
                  the welcome light. The frightened beast was soon released from the broken
                  carriage; and, having removed it from the road, Charles went into the house. To
                  his surprise, he found only an elderly woman and a beautiful girl, seemingly her
                  daughter.
               "Good evening, ladies," he said. "We have had the misfortune to overturn our
                  carriage, breaking both shafts; and, if it is not too much trouble, we should like
                  to remain here till morning."
               
               "How many of you?" inquired the woman.
               "Only two,—one besides myself," he replied.
               "Another gentleman, I suppose."
               "Yes."
               "Are either of you injured?" asked the young lady.
               "My friend is slightly bruised," he answered.
               "What say, Lissy," asked the woman, "shall we bid them remain, or send them to the
                  next house? It is not far, you know."
               The young lady looked into Charles' face inquiringly. "O, let them remain, by all
                  means, mother, for they are wet and cold, and perhaps injured severely."
               "I only hesitated," said her mother, "because all our men folks are absent.
                  Yourself and companion shall be very welcome. You will have to attend to the
                  horse, however. There is plenty of fodder in the barn. Have you taken tea?"
               "We have not," was the answer.
               "Can we remain?" asked Henry Morrison, as soon as Charles had shut the outer
                  door.
               "Certainly,—all right. No signs of the three vinegar-faced old maids, either."
               "Heaven be thanked for that. What sort of folks are they, really?"
               "You are too bad, Henry. Had you been injured as seriously as people sometimes are
                  by such accidents, you would have been thankful for the tender care of one of that
                  much-abused spinster class."
               "Well, I suppose so. I am always sinning, in your estimation, and shall have to
                  repent, one of these days. Who knows but that I may make atonement by marrying a
                  regular spinster?—A capital barn, this. Where are the men? They might have
                  furnished us with a boy, at least."
               "For shame, you fault-finder! You are not half so thankful as the horse: see how
                  pleased he acts."
               "You chide sharply. Here am I, bruised, soaked, chilled, and hungry, and yet you
                  won't let me complain at all."
               "I will not give you a chance to complain much longer, be assured of that."
               Having provided well for the horse, the gentlemen took their valises and basket of
                  fish and entered the house. Charles introduced his companion, and he in return
                  introduced Charles.
               "Our name is Gorden," said the elderly woman. "For a wonder, we two are alone
                  to-night, which I very much regret, on your account. Why, you have been a-fishing.
                  What a noble mess! I never saw a finer one. Doubtless you are very hungry. How
                  should you like some fried fish for supper?"
               "Exceedingly, if it would not be too much trouble," responded Charles.
               "No matter for the trouble," promptly observed the daughter. "I feel just in the
                  mood for cooking fish. But first I will show you to your chamber."
               Every thing in the room allotted to them was in the most complete order, and not a speck of dirt
                  could be seen. They found soft, pure water, and a pile of towels.
               "How are you pleased?" asked Charles, as soon as they were alone. His friend had
                  seemed to be in a state which might be deemed psychological ever since they
                  entered the house.
               "A beautiful home," he replied, "and what charming ladies! How motherly seemed the
                  elder, and how very lovely the younger. I tell you what it is, Charles, I never
                  saw a woman who struck my fancy as she does. What a treasure she will prove to
                  somebody, one of these days."
               "You surprise me, Henry. I had not thought your heart so very susceptible. Would
                  she answer to snap your fingers at, d'ye think?"
               "Don't banter me, Charley; for really I apprehend that I am in dangerous
                  company."
               "How should you like to exchange it for three snappish old maids?"
               "I would not exchange for anybody whatever."
               "I predicted that you would find a wife here. 'Ah Henry! it is I who am the
                  prophet; but, then, you despise a 'country hussy.'"
               "Pooh! But she's engaged ere this, I'll warrant you. Such a peerless gem could not
                  have been overlooked till this time,—the idea is preposterous."
               "Ha, ha, ha! You are in love at first sight. Hark! she is singing as merrily as a
                  red-breast; singing and frying fish at the same time. 'Dat's goot,' as a Dutchman
                  would say. I tell you what, Henry, she is a regular fish-woman."
               "Come, come! it is scandalous to speak thus."
               "So it is; but we may learn more of her before we shall be able to leave here. I
                  think she is heart-whole yet, and you have my gracious permission to win and wear
                  the priceless jewel, provided her market is not made, and you are adroit and
                  agreeable enough to gain her favor."
               Having renovated their wardrobe, they went down stairs. Mrs. Gorden invited them
                  to take seats in the kitchen.
               "You must feel very much chilled," she remarked, "after getting so wet. Our stove
                  was removed in the spring, and so we have an old-fashioned country fire, which at
                  present will be all the better for you."
               They gladly accepted the invitation, and sat down near the blazing fire, feeling
                  that there was not such another comfortable place in the whole world. Here the
                  fish was being fried, and O! delicious for such hungry stomachs, potatoes
                  also.
               Lissy Gorden was flying around nimbly as a squirrel; but she suddenly stopped, and
                  gazed anxiously into Henry's face.
               "You look very pale, sir," she said. "Are you not injured more than you
                  supposed?"
               "I am not much hurt, thank you," he answered. "I don't wonder that I am pale,
                  though, for to be overturned on such a night is sufficient to blanch the cheek of
                  the bravest."
               
               "So it is. Your escape was very fortunate. And are you not hurt at all?" she
                  continued, turning to Charles.
               "Not that I am aware of," he answered.
               "How glad I am," was Lissy's exclamation. "I regret your misfortune, but am
                  thankful that the accident happened so near our house."
               "Had it occurred elsewhere, you would have been saved all this trouble," said
                  Charles.
               "I beg of you not to call it 'trouble,' sir, for I assure you that it is a
                  pleasure,—only I shall claim my share."
               "What, of the fried fish?" asked Henry. "If you will partake with us, we shall be
                  very happy."
               "I do not approve of late suppers," said Mrs. Gorden; "but it is a long time since
                  we have had any fish. Lissy and I sat down to the table alone to-night, and the
                  result was, we ate but little. The excitement and exercise have sharpened our
                  appetites, and so we have concluded to aid you all that we can, with a due regard
                  to health."
               Both gentlemen expressed themselves much gratified at this condescension.
               The repast was soon smoking upon the table, and Charles and Henry did ample
                  justice to it, the ladies aiding as much as could have been expected. After tea
                  they sat by the cheerful fire and conversed until twelve o'clock. The strangers
                  thought both mother and daughter were very intelligent and entertaining. The
                  former told them that her husband was dead; that she had one son who resided in
                  town, but his business did not permit him to visit them often. On inquiring, they
                  learned that they were within two miles of the village of Dunfield.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXI.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "O, and I forsooth in love!
                           I, that have been love's whip;
                           A very beadle to a humorous sigh;
                           A critic; nay, a night-watch constable;
                           A domineering pedant o'er the boy,
                           Than whom no mortal so magnificent."
                        
                     
                     LOVE'S LABOR LOST.
                  
               
               WHEN they had retired, Henry Morrison was more disposed to converse about Lissy
                  Gordon than to address himself to sleep. To this Charles demurred. He declared
                  that he should not submit to it, for he was weary, and required sleep, and there
                  was little time before morning, at best. Henry would never confess how long he
                  remained awake; but Charles was soon in a profound slumber, from which he was
                  aroused by the breakfast bell. Contrary to their expectations, it was still
                  raining very fast.
               Mrs. Gorden and Lissy—or, if the reader pleases, my mother and sister—greeted the
                  strangers cordially.
               "You will not be able to leave us to-day," said my mother, "for the storm
                  increases rather than abates."
               "We can go to the village to-day and have our carriage repaired," said Henry.
               "I would not do that," said Lissy, "unless it is absolutely necessary. After
                  getting so wet last night, further exposure would be hazardous. No matter if it
                  storms a week,—you are welcome to remain."
               "I thank you," said Henry, giving the fair speaker a grateful look. "I know that
                  what you say is not merely idle compliment; so we will stay contented."
               The day was spent in reading, conversation, and playing various games. It
                  continued to rain until noon of the third day, when the two gentlemen went to the
                  village, to have their carriage repaired. The only wheelright in town was absent;
                  therefore they must procure another carriage, or wait till he returned. After a
                  talk with my mother and Lissy, they decided to remain. A week passed before the
                  carriage was repaired, and they improved it well. They hunted or fished nearly
                  every day; and, as they obtained plenty of game, and had excellent cooks, they
                  lived like princes.
               If Henry Morrison was smitten when he first saw our Lissy, he was deeply in love
                  when he bade her good-by. But "the course of true love never did run smooth," for,
                  alas! he learned that she was engaged. That she was pleased with his company he
                  could not doubt, though he thought her needlessly shy, even of a stranger, unless
                  peculiar reasons existed for it. Charles was desirous that his friend might win
                  Lissy, and he watched her demeanor in Henry's society. It evinced a mingled feeling of pleasure and dread, which seemed
                  mysterious; but the matter was explained the following Sunday.
               On Lissy's return from church, a gentleman came with her who was introduced to the
                  travellers by the name of Robert Bruce. He was a tall, kingly-looking man, with a
                  large head, high forehead, and a handsome, voluptuous face. His hair was very
                  dark, his eyebrows thick and black. His manners were exceedingly pleasing, and yet
                  there was an indescribable something about him which they did not like. He
                  conversed with great fluency and sprightliness, but his knowledge was evidently
                  more for show than for use. Notwithstanding some of his remarks were bombastic, he
                  was well qualified to make a deep impression upon a susceptible woman's heart.
               As soon as he came, Henry was very unhappy. He rightly divined that Bruce was
                  Lissy's accepted suitor. When he and his friend went to their chamber, they left
                  Bruce and Lissy in the parlor. Henry's disappointment was intense. He could not
                  bear the thought that Lissy Gorden was forever lost to him. He sat down and leaned
                  his head very dejectedly upon the window-sill.
               "My friend," said Charles, "you are very unhappy."
               "Yes, Charles, I am. O! she is the only woman I have ever seen that I can love.
                  She is promised to another, and I cannot honorably sue for her hand. You will
                  think me weak, foolish; but the world has lost all its charms for me. What a dear
                  girl she is. But am I too late? Can it be that she is engaged?"
               "I will be frank with you, even though it pain you much. I believe she is."
               "Then all is lost!"
               "Yes; and yet perhaps not."
               "But where is the hope, Charles?"
               "She has promised to marry him,—granted; but he will never make her happy. She may
                  marry from a mistaken sense of duty, thinking she cannot honorably withdraw; but,
                  if she does, she will sacrifice herself without benefiting him."
               "You have spoken my own thoughts; but, being interested, I thought myself liable
                  to entertain prejudices against him. What are the grounds of your opinion?"
               "She has a large, warm heart; he has but a little, cold one. He is more in love
                  with himself than with her. He affects great knowledge, but it is all on the
                  surface. I am convinced, also, that he is a decided male flirt. She pleases his
                  fancy; he thinks he should be proud of her beauty, proud to exhibit her to his
                  acquaintances. His love for her is made up of pride, vanity, and passion, but
                  there is no soul in it. After they have been married awhile, he would tire of her,
                  and she of him, and then her lot would be lamentable indeed."
               "It is all too true, Charles. O! this ought not to be; would that I could save
                  her. But it is too late, too late!"
               
               "Don't despair, my friend, for I think she now sees the matter in its true light.
                  The thought of acting dishonorably cuts her to the heart; but the meshes he has
                  woven about her will be broken, if possible, and then—"
               "And then,—well, what then?"
               "You may win her."
               "O! that it were possible."
               "Keep up a brave heart, my friend. You are worthy of each other. He is not true to
                  her, and that she will learn, by-and-by; though I doubt not he intends to marry
                  her. When she is convinced of his unworthiness, she will dismiss him."
               "And should it be so, will she think of me?"
               "She thinks of you now, if I can read her thoughts. Were it not for her
                  entanglement with Bruce, as soon as she could learn your true worth she would
                  pledge you her heart."
               "I thank you for such cheering words, and yet I have but little hope."
               The last Charles recollected that night, Henry was walking the chamber in great
                  distress. In the morning his tell-tale face showed that he had scarcely slept.
               "How have you rested, Henry?" Charles inquired.
               "But very little. Charles, we ought to leave here to-day."
               "O no, we cannot do that, and besides, it would not be best. Lissy ought to see
                  more of you before the separation."
               Lissy was pale and seemingly wretched when the family met at the breakfast-table.
                  As she looked inquiringly into the face of Henry Morrison, the expression of her
                  own softened, changing to one of interest and sympathy. Charles thought, as he
                  watched her intelligent countenance, that she perceived Henry's unhappiness, and
                  more than half-surmised the reason. The meal was the saddest, most unsocial they
                  had partaken of in that house. A shadow had fallen and obliterated the sunshine
                  from their hearts.
               After breakfast, the two friends took their guns and went to the woods. They were
                  very successful, and returned in season for dinner; and now the shadow had fled,
                  and the conversation flowed easily and naturally, and so the repast was eaten with
                  zest.
               They remained two days longer, and then Charles was satisfied that Lissy Gorden,
                  even though engaged to Robert Bruce, was yet as much pierced by Cupid's arrows as
                  was Henry Morrison.
               When the two friends took their departure, Henry and Lissy bade each other a sad
                  "good-by," but not "farewell," for Mrs. Gorden had invited the gentlemen to visit
                  them again, which they both agreed to do.
               Having to transact business with Mr. Mackay and others in town, they were detained
                  a day or two longer at the village. I had the pleasure of an introduction, and
                  they seemed gratified to know me. They
                  spoke in grateful terms of the kindness and hospitality of my mother and sister. I
                  judged them to be excellent, noble-hearted fellows, and I have never had cause to
                  change the opinion then formed.

                           "O bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
                           From off the battlements of yonder tower;
                           Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
                           Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
                           Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
                           O'ercovered quite with dead men's rattling bones,
                           With reeky shanks, and chapless skulls;
                           Or bid me go into a new made grave,
                           And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
                           Things that to hear them told have made me tremble;
                           And I will do it without fear or doubt,
                           To live an unstained wife to my sweet love."

                           "Though all the world should crack their duty to you,
                           And throw it from their soul; though perils did
                           Abound, as thick as thought could make them, and
                           Appear in forms more horrid; yet my duty,
                           As doth a rock against the chiding flood,
                           Should the approach of this wild river break,
                           And stand unshaken yours."
                        
                     
                     KING HENRY EIGHTH.
                  
               
               INCARCERATED in so small a room, seeing no one but her parents, and seldom
                  speaking to them, time seemed to pass very slowly to Marion. She did not, however,
                  augment her sorrows by yielding to despair, but kept her mind employed as much as
                  possible. She wrote in her journal every day, read interesting books, and occupied
                  many hours with her needle. Once a week she wrote a long letter to me, inditing her thoughts as though
                  she fondly believed I was soon to peruse them.
               One source of consolation was the belief that I was continually searching for her,
                  and that I would not relinquish the search until she was found. And yet there was
                  little probability that I should find her. No one knew where she was hidden but
                  her parents, and they had resolved to imprison her until a most wicked object was
                  accomplished. If the law would protect me in searching the house, still it would
                  be in vain. She could not see any mode of deliverance; and yet her faith in my
                  final success never wavered.
               A week after she had been in durance vile, her father went into her room.
               "I have come, my daughter," he said, "to have a candid talk with you."
               "Don't call me your daughter, I pray," she replied. "Say what else you please, but
                  spare me that."
               "I had hoped to see you become more reasonable, after spending a week in this
                  place."
               "If you suppose such treatment will change me, by-and-by you will learn your
                  mistake."
               "And you are unwilling that I should call you my child?"
               "You hold the relation of father to me, I well know; but you have forfeited all
                  claim to my love, respect, or obedience."
               "I have not been able to secure obedience heretofore, though a very indulgent
                  parent; but I have you now where you cannot disobey as formerly, and here will I
                  keep you until you learn to do as I wish."
               "Then I shall remain here while life lasts. But, Mr. Windsor, the hour will come
                  when you would give worlds if this had never happened."
               "O, never fear that! I am but doing my duty. You have married against my positive
                  injunction, and in the sight of Heaven the wicked covenant is null and void, and I
                  mean it shall be so by the laws of the country. When that contract is ended,—as
                  ended it shall be,—then Mr. Stanton will return and receive you as his bride."
               "A dark plot this, very dark, and one that will only bring shame upon yourself and
                  my mother. I will never consent that my marriage shall be annulled,
                  and I would not, though the assassin's knife were at my heart. And if it were
                  annulled,—hear me, Mr. Windsor, and mark it well,—yes, if it were
                  annulled, rather than give my hand to the villain Stanton, I would spend a long
                  life in this horrible place, or endure the agonies of a protracted death. Like the
                  lepers of which we read in the New Testament, I would rather live in a tomb and
                  sleep with the dead. I could bear poverty, imprisonment, sickness, with my
                  husband, for I love him; but Stanton is a wretch, a murderer. I have vowed at the
                  altar to be true to Elwood while life lasts, and I will be true, ay,
                  and I would be, did I know that the next hour wild beasts would tear
                  me in pieces. Better that this crime
                  cease at once, and then I will try to forgive you. But, if you feel that you must
                  continue it, do so; yet don't flatter yourself that you will succeed."
               "You speak very bravely, after one week's experience of this proper restraint. I
                  should have waited longer, I now see plainly. When weeks shall have been
                  protracted into months, and months into years, I fancy you will talk more
                  humbly."
               "Never! Have I no sense, think you, of right and wrong? Am I utterly destitute of
                  principle, that I should submit to foul dishonor in order to obtain my liberty? If
                  I were free, if I had never taken the vows of a wife, I would choose this room for
                  a home a thousand times rather than be wedded to the assassin Stanton."
               "I repeat it, you have tried this life only one week; so I shall wait for time to
                  do the work."
               "And you will wait until you witness the utter destruction of all your unholy
                  plans."
               "We shall see,—we shall see."
               A month after this interview, Marion was visited by her mother, who inquired if
                  she would then submit to the wishes of her parents. The brave girl replied that
                  she never would submit. They might make that prison her abode for
                  life, or withhold food, and drink, and raiment; still, she would remain faithful
                  to the husband of her love.
               As Mrs. Windsor could not move the unflinching bride, she gave her a history of
                  the quarrel in the gambling-house between Thomas and young Rand, speaking
                  eloquently of the services of Stanton in rescuing an only son and brother from the
                  clutches of the law.
               "And now, my daughter," said Mrs. Windsor, when the story was ended, "I trust you
                  will see our conduct in a different light. Your father knew that he must sacrifice
                  his property, his son—"
               "Or his daughter," interrupted Marion.
               "You are mistaken, there, for he had no thought of sacrificing you. A wealthy
                  gentleman desired your hand, and, if the difficulty had never occurred, we could
                  not have expected a more eligible match. It was just what we had always wished,
                  and we readily gave our consent. Had you married him, as you should have done, all
                  would have been well."
               "And there you greatly err, Mrs. Windsor, for I should have known endless trouble
                  and shame, had I been married to such a base-hearted wretch."
               "You do him injustice, Marion, for he is a very gallant, chivalrous gentleman.
                  True, he was inconsiderate, but not base."
               "He had murder in his heart, Mrs. Windsor, for he did his best to kill Elwood, my
                  dear husband. Providentially he was thwarted."
               "You now understand, Marion, the position in which your father is placed. How can
                  you hesitate a moment longer?"
               "If you have told the truth, the danger to which Thomas is exposed is not half as
                  great as that of Mr. Stanton, and one may be offset by the other. If your husband loved his child as a parent should,
                  he would willingly sacrifice a part or even all of his property, rather than force
                  such an alliance upon her."
               "We had become accustomed to the luxuries of life, and we were growing old, and
                  how could we manage without property?"
               "Every thing should be sacrificed to principle; but you would only have been
                  obliged to relinquish half your worldly possessions, and the remainder would be a
                  competence."
               "We desired to do something for Thomas and for you also. If we had paid the eight
                  thousand dollars, we could not have given any thing to either of you while we
                  lived."
               "And so I was to be sold 'down South,' like thousands of other young women. The
                  bargain was cunningly made, but it will never, never be
                  fulfilled!"
               "Don't say that, when so much depends on its fulfillment. You were not to be sold,
                  my daughter, but you were to be the wife of an honorable gentleman. We never could
                  have given our consent to your marrying Gorden, under any circumstances."
               "I know it, though he is so worthy, and I love him so dearly. But we
                     are married, thank God, and we shall yet live together in
                  peace."
               "Banish such thoughts, for they can never be realized. Will you not consent to
                  journey to the South with Stanton, and there sue for a divorce, and, when it is
                  obtained, marry him, to save your old father's property, and your brother from
                  disgrace and a prison?"
               "No! I would not be guilty of such a crime, for any conceivable object. What have
                  you all been to me that I should make such a terrible sacrifice, and turn my young
                  life into a living death? Parents and brother I have none."
               "What base ingratitude is this! You have forgotten who cared for you when a child;
                  who supplied all your wants with a liberal hand; who clothed, fed, and educated
                  you,—yes, you have forgotten it all. It is the way with children, and parents
                  should not be surprised."
               "What I received at your hands every child has a right to claim, because of the
                  relation which exists between parents and children. The former are in duty bound
                  to protect and provide for the latter. This is the law of God and the law of man.
                  In doing thus by me, you only did your duty; you would have been inhuman had you
                  done less. I felt your kindness before I knew of your cruelty, and I loved you and
                  was thankful. Since you have so wronged me, I feel no gratitude because you
                  performed merely your duty in my childhood."
               "You are very obstinate, and I fear that only long imprisonment will subdue you.
                  Your mother would have gladly opened your prison-doors, but you will not hearken
                  to her counsels."
               "My mother? I have no mother. You hold
                  that relation by blood, and that is all. Love and parental regard for you have
                  been crushed out by your cruelty; so talk no more of being my mother. I am your
                  prisoner, but not your daughter."
               "I regret that I must leave you in such a mood, but it is vain to talk more."
               "Very well. Continue your foul treatment, but rest assured God will give me
                  freedom!"

                           "We men say more, swear more: but, indeed,
                           Our shows are more than will; for still we prove
                           Much in our vows, but little in our love."

                           But lend and give, where she is sure to lose."

                           One whom the music of his own tongue
                           Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;
                           A man of compliments, whom right and wrong
                           Have chosen as umpire of their meeting."
                        
                     
                     LOVE'S LABOR LOST.
                  
               
               MY sister had attended school in a neighboring village, and there she became
                  acquainted with a young lady by the name of Jenny Bruce. A friendship—as is often
                  the case with young girls—suddenly sprung up between them, which for a time was
                  very devoted. One was seldom seen without the other. They occupied the same room,
                  pursued the same studies, dressed alike, and loved each other dearly. Such
                  intimacy is very interesting, but seldom very lasting.
               Jenny often spoke in glowing terms of her brother Robert, whom she regarded with
                  all a favorite sister's partiality. She
                  told Lissy that she loved her better than anybody else in the world, except this
                  model brother. As Lissy had a very susceptible heart, she became anxious to see
                  him. "I hope you will love him," said Jenny, "for he is so noble and good; and
                  then I should be supremely happy to have you for my sister."
               During vacation, Lissy made her school-friend a visit, and was thrown into
                  Robert's dangerous company. He walked and rode with her. He descanted eloquently
                  of poetry and romance, sculpture and painting, for he had an excellent memory. Was
                  it any wonder that the young, ardent girl became his captive? He liked her, and
                  from the first felt sure of his prize, for he had often tried his fascinations
                  with entire success. Many a bosom had ached because of his perfidy; but it
                  gratified his vanity to feel that he had such power over the female heart.
               When he made a proposal of marriage, Lissy accepted him unhesitatingly. She was
                  quite happy for a time, but the more she saw of him, the less was she pleased. She
                  learned that he was vain, egotistical, his knowledge shallow, and his love mostly
                  concentrated on his own precious self.
               The moment Lissy saw Henry Morrison, she felt that he was a man to be loved and
                  trusted. And yet, she thought, were she free to choose, she would be less hasty
                  than before. She desired to be released from her engagement; but she stood in so
                  much fear of Bruce that she hesitated to mention the subject.
               On the Sunday night that Henry Morrison was so unhappy, as soon as he and Edmonds
                  had left the room, Mr. Bruce arose and took a seat upon the sofa with Lissy; and,
                  putting his arm around her, he pressed passionate kisses upon her lips. She
                  endeavored to turn her head away.
               "What is the matter, love?" he inquired.
               "I am unhappy, Robert," she said.
               "Unhappy, when your lover's arm is around you? That is not very flattering to me,
                  my angel."
               "Don't call me such extravagant names, if you please. I do not like them."
               "Why, you are out of sorts to-night, Lissy. I must call you what I believe you to
                  be, my peerless one."
               "There it is again, O you flatterer."
               "What, do you object to that, too? What a strange woman! In all my experience
                  with—the world, I have not found one just like you. And I am glad that I have not,
                  for you are as much in advance of them as light is more attractive than
                  darkness."
               "Flattery still. Robert, I am tired of it, and, besides, I want to have some
                  serious talk with you."
               "What can my charmer have to do with serious things? Now I don't like serious
                  things. Are the flowers serious, the birds, the streams, or the sun-shine? No, no,
                  'away with melancholy.'"
               
               "And yet you must listen."
               "O certainly, if you say so."
               "Robert, in a thoughtless moment I pledged you my heart and hand——"
               "In a 'thoughtless moment'? Lissy, I am astounded!"
               "Don't be angry with me, for I can't bear it."
               "Go on, my love, but refrain from such cruel expressions as those."
               "I have promised to be your wife."
               "Well?"
               "But I fear I shall never make you happy."
               "O, pooh! you mean that you fear I shall never make you happy?"
               "I doubt whether our natures are adapted to each other."
               "Why, Lissy, what can have turned your head?—one of those bucks up stairs?"
               "That is disrespectful, Robert. I wish to be plain-hearted with you; and, with my
                  present sentiments, it would be wrong to marry you."
               "Miss Gorden, I am angry with you, for uttering such cruel words after we have
                  been plighted lovers a whole year. In all my experience with—the world, I have
                  never been used so before."
               "Pardon me, Robert. I would not do you wrong; but should I give my hand without my
                  heart?"
               "Then you have been practising deception for twelve long months?"
               "You should not say that, for I thought I loved you, and that we could be very
                  happy; but I have had many doubts recently."
               "O well, dear one, all have doubts. Forgive me if I have said aught to wound. I
                  will wait until the doubts are all removed. Think not that I would lead you to the
                  altar while you had doubts. O no! I love, worship you, Lissy,—your beauty, purity,
                  good sense, refinement——"
               "There, there! Mr. Bruce do stop, for such flattery I cannot endure. You did not
                  flatter me so formerly, or else I was blind. You must now talk with more sense, or
                  forfeit all my respect."
               "I never saw a woman before who did not like to be praised. Well, if it don't suit
                  you, I will desist; though it is pleasant to say beautiful things to those we
                  love."
               "It is more pleasant to speak truly, and to be above flattery. O Robert, I once
                  had all confidence in you."
               "And you must continue to have confidence. Why, it is the star of love, the very
                  poetry of wedded life."
               "I declare, you grow more extravagant every time I see you."
               "You are very hard to be suited to-night. Well, I will forgive you. If my language
                  seems extravagant, you must charge it to my great affection. I love nature, dear
                  Lissy, very much. I watch the clouds, as they sail in the immense airy ocean above
                  me, until my heart is full. I see the sun when it mounts upward in resplendent
                     glory. The shining hosts of heaven I
                  worship. But from them all my thoughts turn to you, and there they ever remain,
                  like a fixed star."
               "I see that you are incorrigible,—it is of no use to remonstrate."
               "I think you must be ill to-night, and so my wild love does not touch your heart.
                  Why, you once hung with rapture upon my words, did you not?"
               "Alas! yes, but your words seemed noble and true then, and not so much like
                  high-sounding flattery."
               "They are just as sincere now as they were then."
               "Perhaps they are."
               "They were religiously so then, and they are so now."
               "I could better believe it were they less extravagant."
               "Then I will try to use language more suitable to your taste."
               "Would it not be well for you to discontinue your visits for a while, and in the
                  mean time let our engagement cease to be binding? We could then make up our minds
                  whether we loved each other or not."
               "By no means; we must not think of it. Lissy, I can't give you
                  up!"
               "Well, well, don't stay any longer to-night. I am very weary."
               "I knew you were ill. Yes, I will go; but, when I come again, I shall expect to
                  learn that the doubts have all been scattered by the light of love, as the clouds
                  by the morning sun, and as the wind scatters the shadowy mists. Good-night,
                  dearest," and he clasped her fondly to his breast.
               "Good-night, Robert," she said, with secret gladness. She soon retired, more
                  displeased with him than ever; she almost despised him; and the poor girl wept
                  over her precipitate pledges to him.
               Soon after this interview, Lissy became acquainted with the young woman who acted
                  as teacher of the district school. Being mutually pleased, the pair were soon
                  intimate friends. She was some years older than my sister.
               Calling at my mother's one Sunday evening, she met Mr. Bruce. Their mutual
                  embarrassment was extreme. The teacher soon took her departure. Lissy now demanded
                  an explanation, when Robert said that they had been acquainted some years before,
                  and, becoming offended with each other, they had not spoken since.
               The explanation seemed plausible, and yet Lissy did not believe it. An opportunity
                  soon occurring, she asked Julia Hines—the school-teacher—if she was ever much
                  acquainted with Mr. Bruce.
               "I have been," she replied.
               "You seemed to be mutually embarrassed when you met: are you not friends?"
                  inquired Lissy.
               "We are not."
               "Were you ever so?"
               
               "We were."
               "Will you tell me the cause of your estrangement?"
               "You question me very closely, Miss Gorden; and, if you think that I ought, I will
                  inform you of every thing."
               "I would not be too inquisitive, Julia, but is not the knowledge which I desire
                  requisite for my own welfare?"
               "Perhaps it is; but, should I disclose to you the whole history of our
                  acquaintance, it might pain you much."
               "I had rather bear the pain now than here after."
               "That is wise. Holding the relation I once did to Mr. Bruce, and as my friendship
                  with you has been brief, possibly you may find it hard to credit all I shall say;
                  yet you shall have nothing but plain facts, which it is a duty to make known to
                  you, since you wish it done.
               "Many years since, when I was only fifteen, Mr. Bruce came to our village to study
                  law."
               "To study law! Why, I thought he was educated expressly for a merchant."
               "In that you are mistaken. When quite young, he was thought to have brilliant
                  talents, and so was sent to school and fitted for college."
               "But he never went to college, did he?"
               "Yes, and was expelled at the end of a year. It was then decided that he should
                  study law; and for that purpose, as I have told you, he came to our village.
               "I was then considered very beautiful, and my head was filled with romantic ideas.
                  When I first saw Robert Bruce, I thought him a splendid-looking man, just the one
                  to make me supremely happy through life. What a handsome face he had! how
                  intellectual and kindly. He was, or pretended to be, equally pleased with me. He
                  came to my father's house often, and I learned to love him with all the ardor of
                  an untutored heart. He professed the same affection for me, and we were soon
                  affianced. I own it to my shame, that I was so ignorant, so blinded, as to
                  consider the pompous words he uttered almost god-like. I never saw a person more
                  fluent in conversation. He had but to open his mouth, and the long words flowed
                  forth as freely as water, and they had about the same strength. Many an hour have
                  we sat, with his arm around me, my face upturned to his, drinking in all the fine
                  things he uttered, as greedily as though they had been the essence of wisdom.
               "The year I passed in his company was a very happy one, for I believed in his
                  excellence, with scarcely a doubt. One thing I heard of him, and observation
                  confirmed it,—he was very indolent, and neglected his studies. He had been told in
                  his younger days, and fully believed the flattering tale, that he had great
                  genius. Everybody praised him, and the young girls were bewitched with him. He was thereby spoiled, and
                  rendered vain, egotistical, and a devout worshipper of himself,—self has his first
                  love now, and always had.
               "I was ambitious for him, and believed he had talent to stand at the head of his
                  profession. Being a student myself, I gently chided him for his remissness. He
                  replied that his own genius must be his guiding-star,—it was hard to bring it down
                  to poring over old musty law-books,—they were decidedly too dull and heavy for him
                  to chain his soaring intellect down to continually,—he must have relaxation and
                  amusement. By-and-by he informed me that he had concluded to relinquish the study
                  of law, and should return home to follow in the footsteps of his honored father,
                  and become a merchant. The latter, he said, was growing old, and required his
                  assistance; and as a dutiful son he ought not to withhold it.
               "This scheme sadly disappointed me, dissipating at once all my dreams of Robert's
                  brilliant career as a lawyer. I parted with him sorrowfully. He held me closely to
                  his heart, and poured honeyed words into my credulous ears. He declared that he
                  loved me devotedly, and in due time should return to claim me as his bride. I
                  requested him to write frequently, and he promised to do so. Kissing me again and
                  again, he bade me good-by, and departed.
               "He had spent much of his time with me for a year, and I now felt very lonely. Day
                  after day I went to the post-office, but no letter came. You may judge of my
                  disappointment. After the lapse of six months, a servant tossed one into my
                  lap."
               "And did he neglect to write for that length of time?"
               "He did. I have the letter with me. Would you like to see it?"
               "I should."
               "I thought of returning it, but finally decided to keep it, as a literary
                  curiosity. You will recognize the handwriting."
               Julia handed the letter to my sister, who eagerly perused it. It is so
                  characteristic that the reader shall have the same privilege:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "FRIEND JULIA,—Pardon me my long silence, for business of a pressing
                              character has rendered it impossible for me to write before. While
                              stopping in your romantic village, I became enamored with your
                              peerless beauty; and honestly, if you will believe me, I thought my
                              impressible heart was wholly yours. To live and die for you was the
                              aim of my ambition. While within the direct witchery of your wondrous
                              power, I was led on, step by step, my whole being completely under the
                              control of your beauty and transcendant graces. At your altar I
                              worshipped, and, had you been a goddess, I could not have adored you
                              more.
                           "On the day I left you, I tore myself from your arms, my heart-strings
                              all bleeding from the violence of the rupture. You remember what a
                              beautiful day it was; but, separated from you, I felt that chaos had
                              come again; the music of the heavenly songsters was all discord,—the
                              blue sky looked like brass,—the fleecy clouds were huge misshapen monsters, ready to drop
                              down and prey upon the world,—the sun was an immense ball of fire,
                              hateful to look at,—the breezes scorched instead of cooling my fevered
                              brow,—and I was sunk in the lowest depths of despair.
                           "When I arrived at home, business at once claimed my closest
                              attention. In due time I was enabled to reason with my thoughts
                              calmly, and then I found that my love had all been an illusion,—my
                              ardent nature had deceived me,—a diseased imagination had led me
                              captive, until I stood on the brink of a precipice. Thank Heaven! I
                              awoke in season to save you and myself. It would have been a fearful
                              thing to marry without love; we should both have been wretched,
                              Julia.
                           "You will understand it to be imperative, my friend, that our intimacy
                              should end at once. I trust the disappointment will not cause you much
                              pain. You have an affinity somewhere in the world, and at the
                              appointed moment you will find it, and then your peerless head will be
                              crowned with ecstatic bliss.
                           "Adieu, once wildly adored Julia; and believe me ever your friend,
                           
                              ROBERT BRUCE."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               "How very like his conversation," said Lissy, as she finished reading the
                  letter.
               "I am surprised to hear you. Is that letter like Robert Bruce's conversation
                  now?"
               "It is, very much like it."
               "And yet you keep his company, and are his promised bride?"
               "Yes, I regret to confess it."
               "I admire your candor; but, had I known you understood him so well, I should not
                  have made the confession which I have."
               "Why not?"
               "I thought you a very different person,—one who would despise such bombast. I had
                  hoped, as Mr. Bruce possessed talent, that ere this he might have learned to write
                  and speak without inflating himself like a balloon. He is the same man, then? I
                  regret it; but what pains me most is, that you, being aware of his empty
                  character, should continue the engagement. I am afraid that you admire his person
                  so much as to overlook the defects of his mind and heart."
               "In that you are mistaken. To be sure, I was as much fascinated with him once as
                  yourself; but I have completely grown away from him. I saw the truth only by
                  degrees, but I saw it clearly at last. You will censure me for continuing our
                  intimacy so long; but I did not wish to do any thing hasty or dishonorable. He
                  does not always talk so extravagantly, and his letters to me have been as free
                  from fustian and bathos as the speeches and sermons of many popular men; still,
                  they have been sufficiently inflated to disgust me at times. You will be less
                  inclined to censure, Julia, when I inform you that I had pretty much made up my
                  mind to dismiss him previous to this disclosure."
               "I am glad to hear you say so. For a person of your mind and heart to marry him
                  would only work woe for you both. You have indeed promised, but a bad promise
                  ought to be annulled."
               
               "So I think."
               "And so act. When I read the letter you have seen, I was surprised. Not because of
                  the avowal that Robert had ceased to love me, for I expected that; but because of
                  its inflated nonsense. Could it be possible that I had so wildly loved a man who
                  could write such sickening, unfeeling bombast? But there it was before me, in his
                  own handwriting. His handsome face and form were not near to distract my
                  attention; his rich voice did not charm me with its music, so that I forgot the
                  substance in listening to the sound.
               "Robert is not always so inflated, for sometimes he converses with much good
                  sense; but I am told that he has a fondness for wine, and that two or three
                  glasses will so stimulate his organ of self-esteem as to cause him to imagine
                  himself wholly unrivalled in the use of eloquent, graceful words in his
                  conversation. The ignorant listen with wonder, the wise with pity and
                  disgust."
               "You say that he drinks wine, and a few glasses will excite him?"
               "I have it from good authority."
               "That accounts for the flighty phrases which he now and then utters, for the
                  purpose of deepening my affection, and manifesting the greatness of his
                  genius."
               "His whole letter to me, Lissy, was false, as I have since learned. The day after
                  he left me, he met, in his father's store, a young lady who was very beautiful;
                  and from that moment I no longer had a place in his fickle heart. He won her love,
                  and, alas! it almost proved her ruin. She loved him with an ardor such as you and
                  I have not known. Mr. Bruce's letter made me very wretched for a time; but the
                  frivolous spell was broken by his rigmarole. Lissy, I have been truthful toward
                  you, because you wished it."
               "Thank you, dear Julia, for this revelation. See if I don't profit by it."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Abhorred slave;
                           Which any print of goodness will not take,
                           Being capable of all ill."
                        
                     
                     KING RICHARD THIRD.
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        "The loose encounters of lascivious men."
                     
                     TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA.
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool
                           Art thou, to break into this woman's mood."
                        
                     
                     KING HENRY FOURTH.
                  
               
               AFTER Marion had been imprisoned a few months, Mr. Windsor wrote to Thomas an
                  account of our marriage; of the events which subsequently occurred; and how Marion
                  was a prisoner in Stanton's old hiding-place.
               The following spring, the two friends sailed for America; and, using much
                  precaution, the oppressor, who had thriven by robbing human beauty and strength of
                  their rights, arrived at the house of Mr. Windsor. He came for the purpose of
                  taking possession of the woman for whom he had bargained. Her father informed him
                  that it was many months since he had conversed with Marion; but, as she had been a
                  close prisoner so long, he believed that, for the sake of regaining liberty, she
                  would joyfully accept his protection, agree to journey with him to South Carolina,
                  and there sue for a divorce, and when it had been obtained, become his wife.
               "And you say," said Stanton, "that her husband received a dispatch to the effect
                  that his father was dying, before the ceremony was completed?"
               "Yes, that was what the justice told me," replied Mr. Windsor; "but I have never
                  questioned her in relation to it, for I thought she might be tempted to deny
                  it."
               "How did you manage to get the justice out of the way?"
               "He owned some real estate in Cumberland, which he had been anxious to sell in
                  order to go to California. My brother made him an offer for it, as if in joke, on
                  condition that he would start for the land of gold, without informing any one of
                  his destination, within three days, as a steamer was to sail ere that time.
               "The justice immediately exclaimed, 'It is a bargain.'
               "My brother is a cunning dog; and he protested against it, declaring that he only
                  meant the offer as a joke, as he would have to sacrifice too much to raise the
                  necessary funds. But finally the papers were drawn up, and the business
                  settled."
               "Handsomely done! Your brother was certainly designed for a lawyer. But what
                  became of the fellow?"
               "He sailed for California as agreed, and that was the last I have ever heard of
                  him."
               
               "He may return, and then all the fat will be in the fire."
               "The fear of that induced me to write to my son. However, I don't think there is
                  much probability of it, as it was his intention to settle down there for life,
                  and, for aught we know, he may be dead ere this."
               "Very possible. And so you say that Gorden left, on the reception of the
                  telegraphic dispatch?"
               "Yes."
               "Well, I am glad that he did. What a little minx your daughter is. She ain't like
                  the girls off South; they give right up at once. A few tears and sighs, and then
                  all is sweetness and fair weather. Marion is both saucy and spunky; but I'll bring
                  her round."
               "Certainly; but don't act with too much haste, or you will ruin the whole plan.
                  You must curb your impetuous nature, and keep your hot blood down a little."
               "O, never fear, sir, I understand her like a book."
               "Yes, yes, but be very gentle, cautious, affectionate, and try to win her; for, if
                  she can be induced to go with you willingly, it will be so much better than to be
                  under the necessity of using force."
               "You are right, old fellow. Egad, I am impatient to see her, for she is devilish
                  bewitching. She must be mine, you know, whether willing or not."
               "O yes, but use all your arts to win her consent, for I can't bear the idea of
                  using compulsion."
               "Nor I; but, once out of this accursed abolition hole, and in my power, she'd soon
                  consent to take the necessary steps for a divorce from Gorden, I can tell
                  you."
               "And could she obtain it?"
               "What is to prevent? I have rich, influential friends, and besides, just let it be
                  known that she wishes to be freed from a miserable dog of an abolitionist,—from a
                  greasy Northern mechanic,—and the road is easy."
               "Strange that I had not thought of that. It will all come out right yet."
               "Here's the whole thing in a nut-shell. A beautiful, accomplished girl is yoked to
                  a vulgar abolitionist, one of the white slaves of the North, whose condition would
                  be vastly improved if he were sold 'down South.' She wishes to be free. Think you
                  there is so little chivalry in the Palmetto State that her bonds would not be
                  broken? I tell you they would be shivered, and thundering quick, too. I know
                  it."
               "So you do, boy. I long for the time to come when my wife and myself can go to see
                  you, and stop on your plantation through the winter months."
               "You shall come every winter, sir. Don't say 'No,' for I'll bear the expense. What
                  I have not got father has, and the old chap is as free with his chink as
                  grandfather was with his nigger babies;
                  and he gave away ten, just to spite their mother, who was a handsome wench."
               "Why did he do that?"
               "He took a fancy to her, and she did not like him. You can guess how it was. He
                  wanted to sell her away from the man she called her husband, as a punishment; but
                  she was such a capital seam-stress that my grandmother did not like to part with
                  her,—though she would have consented mighty quick, had she known what was in the
                  wind. The girl was clear grit, and persuasions and whippings were all in vain; and
                  so the old fellow gave away her babies as fast as they were born. Capital fun,
                  wasn't it?"
               "Rather expensive, I should think."
               "Yes, but he gave them to his children. He had such a devilish temper that he
                  wouldn't have cared a straw for the lass' feelings, if he could only punish her.
                  She used to take on about her lost brats awfully. I never saw a prettier piece of
                  furniture in my life than she was. She was almost white; had only enough of the
                  nigger to give her a rich, creamy sort of a look. Had she been mine, I wouldn't
                  have sold her for three thousand dollars."
               "It must be pleasant living at the South in the winter?"
               "You are right there, old boy. You shall try it, and we'll have such times as you
                  never dreamed of. A cellar full of wine; cigars of the first quality in profusion;
                  ham and sweet potatoes; blood horses at your command, fast but gentle; and slaves
                  to heed your every wish."
               "I shall be most happy to accept your hospitality, and spend the winters under the
                  spacious roof of my son-in-law."
               "You shall be most welcome, also Tom, brother Tom, as big a scamp as I am, but a
                  devilish good fellow,"—hitting Mr. Windsor some hard slaps upon the shoulder,—"he
                  shall go, too. I like Tom. He's not one of your puritanic, whining, long-faced
                  Yankees, but a gentleman. He ought to have been born at the South, for the North
                  is not worthy of producing gentlemen."
               "I wish he had been."
               "Do you? So do I. I'll tell you what: he shall marry one of our Southern girls,
                  and a good plantation, with niggers to match."
               "Better and better," exclaimed the old man, rubbing his hands. "Do you think you
                  can bring it about?"
               "I am sure of it. There are plenty of rich damsels who would jump at the chance to
                  nab him."
               "Tom is rather fascinating."
               "Exactly so. He's just the man to take a woman's heart by storm, and he shall do
                  it."
               "Then I shall have two children at the South, to spend my winters with. Now I like
                  that."
               "A merry old age, I say. But when can I see that pretty bird who has been caged
                  for me so long? I'm getting impatient."
               
               "Will to-morrow do?"
               "I suppose so, as I must be guided by you for the present."
               Stanton, it will be perceived, felt sure of his victim, and experienced much
                  pleasure in anticipations of his final triumph. The poor fool had no principle
                  himself, and supposed Marion would be perfectly pliant under his irresistible
                  address.
               Next day he went to her prison. She had hoped never to behold his face again, and
                  did not expect to, unless she succumbed to her parents. Had he been a ghost, the
                  poor captive would not have been more surprised and alarmed.
               "How do you do, Miss Windsor?" he said. "I am happy, very happy to see you."
               To this salutation she answered not a word, but stood regarding him with fear and
                  loathing.
               "Have you no word of welcome, Miss Windsor?" he continued.
               "Were you addressing me, sir?" she asked.
               "Certainly. Who else is there here that I could address?"
               "No one, sir; but, as you uttered a name which I relinquished long ago,—at least
                  it seems very long ago to me,—I thought I would make the inquiry."
               "I have heard something of the kind; but, as it was a very hasty, inconsiderate
                  step on your part, I supposed the old name would be kept until you could change it
                  for a better."
               "I have already made the better change, sir."
               "An act of disobedience which should forever render it null and void."
               "You are impertinent, sir."
               "Well, then, I withdraw the remark. I hope I now read you aright. The moment your
                  eyes fell upon me, you must have felt that I could deliver you from this hated
                  prison."
               "Since through your means I was placed here."
               "Miss Windsor, I—I—protest, you wrong me there."
               "You may protest, Mr. Stanton, as much as you please; but it will not avail you,
                  for I know that I owe these months of cruel suffering to you. I have
                  been torn from my husband, and incarcerated here, where I could be safely kept for
                  you; and now I am insulted by your presence and your words."
               "You will persist in doing me injustice. I have never ceased to love you from the
                  first moment I beheld your matchless charms; and, though you married my enemy, I
                  love you still. That marriage is not binding, because it was consummated against
                  right,—against the commands of all your family,—against my will and my claim; for
                  you were promised to me."
               "Mr. Stanton, I have suffered enough, the last year, without having to endure your
                  presence and your ill-breeding. I pray you, sir, leave me, and never come here
                  again."
               "Leave you? I cannot leave you, though you treat me so ill. Learning that you were
                  a prisoner oner here, I straightway
                  forsook scenes of interest and pleasure, flying on the wings of love, that I might
                  give you freedom."
               "Your words are treacherous. You have no desire to see me free, unless you can
                  make me your slave."
               "There you are mistaken again. That I would have you leave this hated place and
                  fly with me to my Southern home, is true, but not as a slave, nor to become a
                  slave. I would have you go there to enjoy true freedom, and to have measures
                  adopted to break your disgraceful bonds, when I will honorably make you my
                  bride."
               "I told you long ago, Mr. Stanton, that I did not and could not love you. It is
                  insulting to talk of love to a woman who is wedded to the man of her choice. But,
                  were I single, I would remain here a century rather than marry an assassin and a
                  kidnapper."
               "You talk sweetly, my lady bird. It is evident you have been studying the
                  blackguard's dictionary, and have made wonderful proficiency. Know that you are in
                  my power, and that I shall remain here as long as I choose, and come and go when I
                  please. As to the offensive epithets which you heap upon me, I shall pay you for
                  them all in good time. You are destined to be mine, and from that destiny you
                  cannot escape. So, madam, beware what you say and do. Your father and brother
                  consigned you to me, and sealed the agreement with a terrible oath. I will never,
                     never release them from it. I have matters so arranged that they
                  cannot escape my just vengeance, if they evade the bargain one iota, and they know
                  it. I can come to this room by day or night, and they will not lift a finger to
                  prevent it."
               "I know that I am in your power, Mr. Stanton, but that shall not prevent my giving
                  utterance to the language befitting the occasion, if you obtrude your vile
                  presence here. I wish to be left to myself. If you had any mercy or manhood, I
                  would beg you to depart, and never insult me by showing your face again; but mercy
                  or manhood you have none to be appealed to. Stay, then, as long as you will, and
                  come when your black heart bids you; but your only greeting shall be such language
                  as you have heard to-day, or my contemptuous silence."
               With a most demoniac expression in his face,—a mingling of ruffled pride, thwarted
                  passion, and vengeful fury,—the "chivalrous Southern gentleman" left the room.

                           A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch,
                           Uncapable of pity, void and empty
                           From any dream of mercy."

                           "O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet Heaven!
                           Keep me in temper; I would not be mad!"
                        
                     
                     KING LEAR.
                  
               
               WHEN Mr. Windsor carried Marion her food, the next morning, she said to him:
               "Mr. Stanton, whom I had hoped never to see more, has obtruded his hateful
                  presence here, and threatened to come again soon. Is it with your permission,
                  sir?"
               "Why, of course," he replied. "Your mother has informed you of our contract, I
                  suppose. Mr. Stanton has a right to visit you."
               "A right! Good God! is your daughter's honor nothing?"
               "Then I have a daughter? If I mistake not, you once disowned the relationship; but
                  I am glad to see returning wisdom and submission in you. Your honor is much to me,
                  my child, and therefore I would have you cease your disobedience at once. Mr.
                  Stanton does not wish to harm you in the least, but would make you his wife. I
                  know that his character is somewhat impulsive; but if you use him fairly he will
                  deal gently with you. Don't be obstinate any longer, Marion, and your old father
                  will love you as he did when you were a little, dutiful child."
               "How strange to hear you talk of loving. If you have any mercy, or if
                  you hope for it hereafter, don't let that miscreant come here again. He is utterly
                  debased, and he threatens me shamefully."
               "O, he won't harm you; only consent to break those hateful bonds, and he will make
                  you happy. We are all miserable now about you, and how easily you can remove our
                  sorrow. Your parents have commanded, and it is your duty to obey. 'Children, obey
                  your parents,'—that is the divine command, and woe to those who heed it not."
               "O, deliver me from such Satanic perversion of God's word."
               "There 'tis again. You learn very slowly."
               "Don't flatter yourself that I shall ever learn to welcome such degradation as you
                  urge upon me. Once for all, are you determined to let Stanton come here
                  again?"
               "Why, how can I help it?"
               "Surrender him to justice, as you should."
               "And so have your only brother sent to prison, to the disgrace of the whole
                  family? Are you aware that the young man whom he wounded is a cripple for
                  life?"
               
               "No, sir; but Thomas is not in the country, and so there is no danger."
               "You are mistaken. He has returned, but has not been home as yet. What sisterly
                  regard you manifest, in this willingness to see him a fugitive forever, from his
                  friends and his native land!"
               "I ought to have sisterly regard, he has been so unspeakably kind to me."
               "That is true, though you speak ironically. Thomas has always sought your good. He
                  would be proud to see you the wife of his friend."
               "Out upon such pride! O God! why am I thus forsaken, thus foully wronged by my
                  natural protectors? I rejoice that I have a heavenly Friend, a sympathizing
                  Father. I will plead no more with you, but put my trust in Him."
               "May He teach you to obey your parents. I will see Stanton, and tell him to be
                  more gentle, and not to worry you too much, but to wait patiently as I have done.
                  Good-morning, my child. May you soon come to your senses, and be a blessing and a
                  comfort to us all."
               When her father had gone, Marion thought of her wrongs, and the hopelessness of
                  relief, until her brain grew wild with indignation and anguish. She walked her
                  little room in a state of intense excitement.
               "O! I shall go mad," she said. "When is all this to end? No light dawns upon me,
                  but all is dark as the grave. How shall I escape? How find deliverance? That
                  scoundrel will be here again,—he will not relinquish his purpose. O horror! that I
                  must endure his presence. I once supposed I had a mother, but her heart is harder
                  than flint, or she would save me. O! how this poor brain aches; and I can see
                  nothing before me but dishonor or death."
               The terror-stricken girl now sank upon her knees, and poured out her soul in
                  prayer. Long did she supplicate the God of the oppressed, and on arising she was
                  calm and comforted.
               At the earliest convenient opportunity, Mr. Windsor said to Stanton: "Marion
                  complains that you are rather harsh with her; that you threaten to take
                  unwarrantable liberties."
               "Well, I did get a little excited, I own, she was so deuced saucy. She is enough
                  to provoke a saint."
               "I know she is, but you must bear with her, as we do. She'll come round right,
                  only be patient."
               "I don't see any signs of it. Hang it all! I am tired of waiting."
               "Be patient, be patient, my son, and she will love you all the better for it,
                  by-and-by. She is my daughter, and you must not go too far."
               "O, never fear. I thought, if coaxing would not work, threatening might."
               "I wouldn't try it, but wait a while, and in the mean time be very loving, and
                  you'll win her. I want to see her your wife, but it pains me much to be obliged to keep her a prisoner. I wish that
                  miserable Gorden was dead,—he has made me trouble enough. How nicely every thing
                  would have worked, but for him. Now do be gentle with her."
               "Well, I will, but I like not this procrastination."

               MY sister took an early opportunity to write to Mr. Bruce. She chose not to await
                  another visit from him, having learned still more of his unworthiness. The letter
                  is worthy of being given in full:
               
                  
                     "DEAR SIR,—
                  
                  "In the last conversation we held, I told you that I did not feel willing to
                     become your wife, for the reason that we were ill adapted to each other. Since
                     then, the conviction has been rapidly growing upon me. I must now tell you
                     plainly, sir, that I have not sufficient affection and respect for you to make
                     you happy, or to be happy myself, in the matrimonial relation. Under such
                     circumstances, though in an unguarded moment, without due consideration, I
                     promised to be yours for life, yet I feel the promise ought to be broken.
                  
                  "That I do not love and cannot respect you as a wife should, would be a
                     sufficient justification for the step I now take; but I have other very potent
                     reasons. I have been informed of the scandalous treatment which Julia Hines and
                     others suffered from you. Have you no conscience, that you thus wound and crush
                     hearts with impunity? Does remorse never trouble you, when you reflect upon the
                     anguish you have caused to the innocent and confiding?
                  "You are too selfish, sir; your worship of self is your great sin. I know how
                     vain you are, how self-confident; but let me assure you, in all kindness, that
                     were you less so, you might be more of a man. At this moment your
                     self-assurance is so complete, that you fancy yourself a model of manly beauty,
                     while every grace sits enthroned upon your brow. But, sir, though you have a
                     handsome form and face, what are you in reality? Reflect for a while. Turn the
                     current of your thoughts backward to the days of your boyhood, when such
                     torrents of flattery were poured into your ears by injudicious friends. What
                     glorious hopes you had then,—what glowing anticipations of the future. You were
                     to be renowned for your scholarship, your genius, your eloquence and power.
                     Your young heart leaped, and your bright eyes flashed, when you thought of your
                     pleadings at the forum, and your efforts in legislative halls. Why have not
                     these anticipations been realized? Why is it, Robert, that you have
                     accomplished so little?
                  "Mr. Bruce, that I once loved you, I will not deny; but it was when I believed
                     you to be all you seemed. No one doubts that your natural abilities are good;
                     but a knowledge of the fact, in early life, together with the beauty of your
                     person, have proved the ruin of your bright hopes, and disappointed all your
                     friends. This language may seem severe, but it is the severity of truth; for in
                     this last communication to you I wish to write what shall be to your profit.
                     While I admit that your mental powers are superior to those of men in general,
                     yet it is equally true that you often manifest far less than common ability.
                     Your language being large, also self-esteem, approbativeness, and ideality,
                     your conversation is often ridiculously inflated. I am satisfied that,
                     notwithstanding your natural gifts, you think but little, and read but few
                     books of real merit. Your mind has been so long inactive that it has far less
                     vigor and clearness than in youth. Your intellect has sadly deteriorated, and
                     so have all the holier emotions of your being. And, as much as you have prided
                     yourself on the possession of a handsome face, that also obeys the same general
                     law. The powers of the mind cannot be allowed to run to waste, the voice of
                     conscience be stifled, the soul be dwarfed and beggared, without the
                     countenance bearing testimony to the general decline. The eye loses its fire
                     from heaven, while it catches that of hell; the lines of the face do not
                     indicate thoughtfulness and purity, but the reverse; and the original beauty
                     disappears. The intellectual, the spiritual qualities no longer light up the
                     features, but they reflect the selfish, animal traits only.
                  "Heaven bestowed uncommon gifts upon you, Robert, and you are responsible for
                     them. You received fully ten talents, but how have you used them? Think for a
                     moment, where are the fruits? where the increase? Ah! Robert, the reflection
                     must be sad, but let it teach you a lesson.
                  "From this time, cease to live such a vain, idle life, put your powers to some
                     use, and you may yet be an estimable man. Wherein you have done wrong, apply
                     the remedy ere old age overtakes you.
                  "Before I close, I must reluctantly mention one thing more. I have learned of your former career from
                     two persons,—the last one an old friend of May Appleton, the young lady whose
                     beauty so quickly won your fickle heart from Julia Hines. Because of your
                     treachery May's heart was left desolate. She is now an orphan, and destitute.
                     You know you solemnly promised to marry her, and that promise is binding upon
                     you now. It cannot be that your sister, who praised you so much to me, is aware
                     of your treachery. Miss Appleton lives in a distant city, and with her needle
                     supports herself and a young brother. She has loved you with true devotion. O
                     Robert! call back to your heart the nobler emotions which once throbbed there,
                     and then you will be impelled to seek the forsaken one. I pray you, hasten to
                     her; and, if she will forgive the past, make her your wife. Do not
                     misunderstand me. I would not have you marry her for form's sake alone,—better
                     that she should continue lonely and dependent,—but marry because you
                        can love her, if you will. By gentleness,
                     kindness, and sympathy, teach her to forget your cruelty, and to smile again;
                     and she will repay your affection with all the freshness of her youth. Here is
                     where atonement should be made.
                  "From this moment all communication must cease between us. Should you wish to
                     learn the residence of May Appleton, you can write to Ida Mason, whom you know
                     well. I desire not to see you again until repentance and reparation—those twin
                     angels from heaven—have found a place in your heart.
                  "With best wishes, I subscribe myself your friend,

                           "O God, defend me! how am I beset!

                           More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults
                           As would take in some virtue."

               THE unprincipled knave and miscreant, George Washington Stanton, had no idea of
                  relinquishing the prize which had been pledged to him by unholy oaths. So, in a
                  few days after his first visit, he went again to Marion's prison-chamber.
               After reflection, and to avoid becoming dangerously excited again, she resolved
                  not to notice or reply to any thing the ruffianly fellow might say. He remained
                  upwards of an hour, trying to draw her into conversation, and gazing impudently
                  into her face, which was still beautiful, though it had lost its plumpness and
                  color. He attempted to take her hand, but it was withdrawn with such dignity,
                  while withering scorn flashed from her eyes, that he did not repeat the
                  aggression. Becoming weary at last, the vile persecutor told her he should call again very soon, bade her
                  good-day, and departed.
               About this time he wrote the following letter to a college friend in South
                  Carolina:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "MY DEAR JOHN,—You wished to know, in your last, how I am succeeding
                              with the pretty Marion. I must answer, not swimingly, as the boys used
                              to say. She is a spunky piece, and deucedly impudent; but I like her
                              all the better for it. She has been in confinement a whole year, and
                              yet she will not yield in the least, and was saucy enough to tell me
                              that she thought it would be degrading to receive deliverance at my
                              hands. There's grit for you.
                           "In one thing, I believe I have been deceived by her rascally old fool
                              of a father. He wrote to his son, while we were in France, of her
                              marriage to a fellow by the name of Gorden; and said that the sickness
                              of his father called him from her before the ceremony was finished,
                              and the marriage consummated. Since I came here he has repeated the
                              same thing; but I believe he lied; and so I no longer desire her for a
                              wife. If I can manage to persuade her to go south, or take her there
                              by stratagem, she shall be my mistress, and that is all. Old Windsor
                              hasn't any idea that such is my purpose; but he couldn't help himself,
                              if he had. I have him in a tight place. That young gambler, Rand, is
                              crippled for life, and he and his father would like the chance to make
                              Tom fork over about five thousand dollars extra.
                           "As to the girl in question, I believe she suspects my intentions, for
                              she is as sharp as a weasel. You see, dear John, that I am in for it,
                              and I intend to win. If I cannot coax her to go south, or get her
                              there by some cunning trick, why, there is only one course left. In
                              war, all stratagems agems are justifiable, you know. The victory once
                              gained, no matter how, then all will be plain sailing.
                           "I am almost as much of a prisoner as the contrary witch whose
                              fascinations drew me here. You see, when I was here before, I made the
                              meddlesome, vulgar workingman, Gorden, who has since married the girl,
                              feel cold lead,—I believe I bled him handsomely. The miserable Yankee
                              sheriffs tried to arrest me, but I outwitted the whole gang. A large
                              reward hangs over my head, so I have to keep confounded shady. I am
                              here under an assumed name, for fear of the domestics, and those who
                              might inquire respecting the stranger. I wear a wig, and a large pair
                              of false whiskers. These, of course, I take off when I visit my
                              charmer.
                           "Hoping soon to be able to assure you that I have won a bloodless
                              victory, I remain, yours,
                           
                              "GEORGE WASHINGTON STANTON."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Thomas Windsor deemed it not prudent to return to Dunfield while his brother
                  scamp, Stanton, remained there, lest suspicion might be aroused. As it was, no one
                  supposed that the foppish stranger was the guilty assassin. I met him once, but no
                  thought of Stanton entered my mind. His disguise was complete. It was a marvel to
                  my wife that he was not arrested; but she saw him only in his ordinary dress.
               Stanton still continued his visits to Marion, trying his utmost to coax or drive
                  her to accede to his wishes. She had resolved that he might obtrude when he chose,
                  and say what he pleased, and she would hold her peace; but he was sometimes times so insulting that she would
                  forget her vow, and then he had a new revelation of her scorn and hatred of
                  him.
               One night, Marion awoke from a startling dream, and she was soon aware that some
                  person was entering her room. With a fearful shriek, she sprang to the floor, when
                  Stanton caught her in his arms.
               "Now, my pretty one," he said, "you cannot escape me."
               "Unhand me, wretch!" she answered.
               "Not until I see fit, you beautiful tigress. Ah, struggle as much as you please! I
                  can hold you tight. You have the real grit, and no mistake."
               "You are a vile ruffian to come here to-night. Have you no sense of decency at
                  all? Are you not aware that I hate, detest, and abhor you?"
               "Gently, gently, you vixen, for you are now in my power. It is time that you had
                  learned to act like a reasonable being. I am willing now to be honorable with you,
                  if you will let me; but, if you refuse, why, then take the consequences of your
                  folly."
               "What is your insolent purpose, sir?"
               "You know what I desire. I would make you my wife."
               "I am another man's wife now."
               "But in my State I can obtain a divorce for you, and then make you my own. Just
                  say the word, and I'll be as gentle with you as a lamb."
               "I beg of you, Mr. Stanton, leave me to-night. I want time to think, to reflect.
                  This is too sudden."
               "Ha! my haughty damsel, you can beg now, can you? You can call me something
                  besides 'monster, wretch, assassin?' I knew you would come to it. I shall humble
                  you, yet. You require more time, but you shall not have it; so now decide, my
                  charmer, will you be mine honorably?"
               His arms were relaxed somewhat, when Marion, summoning almost superhuman strength,
                  sprang from him; and, snatching a pair of sharp-pointed scissors that lay upon the
                  table, she plunged them into his breast, inflicting a severe wound. The scoundrel
                  fell to the floor as though he had been shot. Marion raised her hand to strike
                  another blow. But the dread of taking human life—even the life of such a miscreant
                  as Stanton—restrained her. Just then she thought of the keys which unlocked the
                  doors on the inside, and surmised that they were in Stanton's pockets, and that
                  she might obtain them and escape. As she was trying to find them, her persecutor
                  suddenly sprang to his feet, pushed her from him, opened the door, and fled.
               "You have baffled me this time, you she butcher," he said; "but you are still in
                  my power, and I shall secure a sweet revenge. The blood of a Stanton is not to be
                  shed without recompense."
               Marion was deeply mortified, to have the means of escape so nearly within her
                  reach and yet see them vanish.
               
               "Why did I not kill him?" she cried. "I had the power to rid myself of as vile a
                  wretch as ever the sun shone upon; and yet I could not do it. His life would have
                  brought me freedom, but how could I have his blood upon my soul? Thank God, for a
                  time he is powerless to injure me. O, when shall all this end? Elwood! dear
                  Elwood, are you seeking the lost? Merciful Father, guide him to me, that I may be
                  saved from utter despair!"
               Stanton immediately washed his ugly wound, and bound wet cloths upon it. In the
                  morning, he informed Mr. Windsor that he was unwell, and must take a journey for
                  his health; but would return ere many weeks. In the mean time he would advise the
                  parental jailers not to hold any communication with Marion, but leave her to quiet
                  reflection.
               Mr. Windsor promised that Stanton's wishes should be complied with; and the
                  dastardly villain took the first train for a neighboring city, where he placed
                  himself under the care of a surgeon. His physical habits were so bad, however,
                  that he recovered very slowly.
               Several days after Stanton's felonious assault, Marion's mother brought her food,
                  when the heroic girl asked:
               "Where is Mr. Stanton?"
               "In Boston," replied Mrs. Windsor.
               "When did he leave here?"
               "A week ago or more."
               "Are you aware that he came to my prison at night?"
               "Yes, he has just written us all about it, and regrets his imprudence very much.
                  He said that you, supposing his intentions to be evil, got so excited as to strike
                  him with some sharp weapon, and inflict a dangerous wound."
               "So I did."
               "Did he insult you, that you committed such an act?"
               "Insult me! The wound I gave him was all that saved me from a hellish outrage.
                  Will he return here again?"
               "I presume he will; but we have written to him that he must show you due respect
                  hereafter. He says, however, that he only meant to frighten you into a compliance
                  with his wishes in regard to a divorce, though he pretended worse things. We have
                  sent him a letter of sharp reproof, and he will understand that his course must be
                  totally different when he returns."
               "Mrs. Windsor, you are a woman, and I beg of you, as a woman with some sentiments
                  of virtue remaining, never to let Stanton enter my prison again."
               "I have not the power to prevent it."
               "You have. O, I am in danger, and you can save me!"
               "You can save yourself. The die is cast, and you must give up Gorden, and marry Mr. Stanton,—it
                  is vain to contend against fate. He would be kind to you, for he loves you with
                  true Southern ardor; all his acts show it."
               "I may die, Mrs. Windsor, but I shall never be Stanton's wife. I
                  shall not give up my husband, come what may."
               "Foolish child, how obdurate you are! I am almost out of patience with you myself,
                  and I wonder not that George, with his hot Carolina blood, should sometimes forget
                  himself, and proceed to extremes."
               "O! it is all in vain to appeal to those whose hearts are petrified by pride and
                  mammon-worship. I must depend on myself, and trust in God."
               In the ensuing spring, Stanton again came to Dunfield. He had resolved to adopt
                  such measures, this time, that his victim should not escape him.
               Unannounced as formerly, he again entered Marion's prison. His appearance threw
                  her into an agony of fear. He talked as insultingly as ever, while she, with
                  recovered calmness, treated him in the most contemptuous manner possible. Telling
                  her that he had no wish to push matters to a great length then, but would give her
                  two or three days for reflection, as she had formerly desired, he left her.
               The unfortunate girl was now in extreme terror, for she had little hope that her
                  parents would afford her any protection. What could she do? Her strength and
                  endurance, she knew well, were vastly inferior to the fierce, slave-driving
                  Stanton's; but she was inflexibly determined to meet the peril with Yankee spirit
                  and promptness.

                           "I know no ways to mince in love, but directly to say,
                           I love you; then if you urge me further than to say,
                           Do you in faith? I wear out my suit. Give me your answer;
                           In faith do, and so clap hands and a bargain."
                        
                     
                     KING HENRY FIFTH.
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "O, gentle Romeo,
                           If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully,
                           Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
                           I'll frown and be perverse, and say thee nay,
                           So thou wilt woo: but, else, not for the world."
                        
                     
                     ROMEO AND JULIET.
                  
               
               THE impression made upon Henry Morrison, by my gentle sister Lissy, did not prove
                  transitory. Charles Edmonds sought to convince him that he was allowing his
                  feelings to captivate his judgement; that it would be the part of wisdom to wait
                  until he could learn whether her affections were irrevocably plighted to another.
                  If they were, it was folly to think of her in any other light than as a
                  friend.
               To this good advice Henry listened with impatience, declaring that he could not
                  help loving Lissy, even if he knew she was betrothed to another. She was the only
                  woman that had ever touched his heart in the least.
               Edmonds replied to his friend by quoting from Hamlet as follows:
                     
                        "This is the very ecstasy of love:
                        Whose violent property foredoes itself,
                        And leads the will to desperate undertakings,
                        As oft as any passion under heaven,
                        That does afflict our natures."
                     
                  
               
               Lissy was much interested in Mr. Morrison. Her acquaintance with him, though
                  brief, had caused her to feel that his nature coincided with hers,—that their
                  souls were congenial. What his sentiments toward herself were, she often
                  wondered.
               Henry Morrison and Charles Edmonds did not visit Dunfield again until the
                  following spring. Henry had urged his friend to take the promised excursion, while
                  the sleighing was good,—the ride would be so exhilarating, and then he was certain
                  that my mother and Lissy were expecting them during the winter. Charles told him
                  that he hadn't a bit of fancy for a long cold ride; he should certainly freeze if
                  he attempted it. As for Henry, he was so warmly in love that an Arctic winter
                  would have had few terrors for him, provided he could see Miss Gorden again.
               As soon as the roads were in a passable condition, Henry again commenced his
                  importunities; but Edmonds was not ready until the middle of May. When the two
                  friends set out, it was a delightful time to travel, especially by private
                  conveyance, for the weather was charming, and nature was undergoing her vernal
                  change. The hill-sides and valleys were becoming greener every day; the young
                  leaves were bursting, to clothe the trees with matchless robes of beauty; many-colored flowers were springing up on every
                  side; and the melody of birds gushed forth all the day long.
               "We have chosen our time well," said Charles Edmonds. "The weather is just warm
                  enough for comfort; and how many beautiful scenes we are continually meeting! I
                  never saw the fields look greener so early in May. The aspect of the woods is
                  peculiar. Some of the leaves are fully grown, while others are but half-formed.
                  Don't urge the horse rapidly, or I shall miss many scenes which are very
                  lovely."
               "I am not fond of riding slowly. It seems to me this horse has deteriorated since
                  last year. I don't like to be forever in making a short journey."
               "It is you that have changed, Henry, and not the horse. A few months since, you
                  were as fond as anybody of passing along quietly and comfortably; now, the
                  fleetest nag is too slow for you. 'Country hussies' have a terrible effect upon
                  some people."
               "Nonsense, Charles! You know I never was fond of riding slowly, unless engaged in
                  an interesting conversation."
               "Granted; but I fail to introduce any subject now which is interesting to you,
                  and, if I ask you to lead in talking, I succeed no better. Drive on at full speed,
                  seems to be your motto just now."
               "Pooh! I am as willing to talk as I ever was, only I want to journey at a good
                  pace."
               "But what say to a little sporting, on our way?
               I am sure there is game in these woods, and we might find trout in some of the
                  creeks."
               "We'll shoot and fish to your heart's content after we arrive at Dunfield; but I
                  am decidedly opposed to it before."
               "Well, just as you say, for I see that the loadstone draws astonishingly. I really
                  hope Lissy has dismissed Mr. Bombastes, ere this, and that she will consent to
                  make you as happy as you deserve to be."
               "Thank you, Charles; but I never expect to be very happy again, for I must content
                  myself with her friendship merely."
               "Don't be down-hearted. I have never believed she would marry Robert Bruce."
               "Why not?"
               "Because she has too much good sense."
               "Therein lies my only hope. If Bruce had a mind and heart equal to his person, I
                  should never expect her to give him up. I think he has been flattered too much.
                  There was originally material enough to have made a superior man, but he has
                  wasted and perverted it."
               They arrived at my mother's about eight o'clock in the evening,—having rode sixty
                  miles,—and were cordially received.
               Charles Edmonds had not an envious or jealous disposition, but he was satisfied
                  that Lissy felt more pleased to see Henry Morrison than himself, though her
                  greeting to him was frank and sincere.
               Charles went gunning and fishing every day, for he was passionately fond of the sport; but
                  generally he was compelled to go alone, or with some neighbor, for Henry seemed to
                  find no pleasure except in the society of Lissy. He conversed with her much,
                  drawing out her thoughts on a variety of subjects. The knowledge which he gained
                  of her mind and heart served to confirm his previous impressions, and to teach him
                  her true worth. And she had her former favorable opinions of him strengthened; and
                  resolved, should he now propose, to accept him.
               Henry was by no means diffident, in matters he had set his heart upon; but now he
                  hesitated, for fear the engagement between Lissy and Bruce still existed.
               One pleasant morning, he invited her to take a ride, and obtained a cheerful
                  assent.
               In a casual way, Henry inquired for Mr. Bruce.
               "I have not heard from him for some months," replied Lissy.
               "You have not? That is surprising," he said.
               "Why so?"
               "Because I thought the relationship between you was very near and dear, and might
                  become more so."
               "Possibly that state of affairs did once exist between us."
               "Pardon me, Lissy, if you deem my questions impertinent; they are assuredly not
                  meant to be so. I confess, though, to being actuated by interested ested motives.
                  Can I make further inquiries without giving offence?"
               "O certainly; I have no objections at all, and will answer you candidly."
               "Thank you. If I were rightly informed, you have been engaged to Mr. Bruce?"
               "I have."
               "And has that engagement ceased?"
               "It has."
               "Are you now free to bestow your hand upon another?"
               "I am."
               "Have you no regrets, no wishes which cause you pain, in relation to your former
                  engagement?"
               "None. Feeling that it should not continue longer, I took the responsibility of
                  ending it. The act was mine, not Mr. Bruce's."
               "Just as I desired. Lissy, I will be as candid with you as you have been with me.
                  I told you I was actuated by interested motives. Since the first moment I met you,
                  on that stormy night, I have not ceased to love you. When I learned that your
                  affections were plighted to Mr. Bruce, I suffered keenly; but I doubted his
                  capacity to make you happy. I have known more of the heart-ache since than I had
                  ever experienced before; but still have cherished the faith that all would turn
                  out happily. You are now free. My sentiments towards you are most honorable,
                  confiding, and sincere. I desire to make you my wife. Lissy, I have spoken
                  plainly."
               
               "Thank you, Henry, for this candid avowal. It was not altogether unexpected. If
                  you can accept a heart so foolish as mine,—foolish as you know it to have been,—I
                  joyfully bestow it upon you."
               "For which I bless you! I desired such an assurance, coming from a frank and
                  generous nature. Ah! Lissy, I shall be delighted to repay your affection with
                  lifelong constancy."

                     MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING.
                  
               
               ALTHOUGH I no longer travelled about the country, seeking for my lost bride, yet I
                  was not idle or unobservant.
               One afternoon, while sitting in the dining-room at Mr. Mackay's, perusing a
                  newspaper, the Irish girl living with Mr. Windsor called upon Katy, our domestic.
                  They were in the kitchen adjoining, and the door was slightly ajar. My attention
                  was first arrested by hearing Katy say, "And are ye shure, Madge, that they niver
                  use it at all at all?"
               "It's jist that I am, now. Haven't I been there better nor fourteen wakes, and
                  niver a fire have they put under it? Yis, mum, I have; and I b'lave if it's a chamney at all, Katy, it's choked up
                  intire o' doin' nothin' so long."
               "Well, thin, it might, shure; but have ye iver tried it, Madge?"
               "Ah! be gorra, I did. Ye see, Katy, I thought it a powerful shame that the big
                  blaggard of a kettle should be a-sittin' there so lazy, whin it might hate the
                  wather so iligant. Miss Windsor tould me I nadn't use it; but one day, when master
                  and mistress had gone away, I jist put the shavins and the wood under it, and
                  touched a match to 'em, to hate all the wather there was in it. But, by the
                  powers! what a smoke I did make!"
               "Wouldn't the chamney dhraw at all at all?"
               "Is it dhraw that ye say, now? Well, thin, I should say it did; but, fath, it
                  dhrew the wrong way intirely. The fire, and the smoke, and the sparks, and the
                  canders, all came a-flyin' out into the room, as though the divil was behind
                  a-blow-in' them with all his might. Murther! how I did scrame. But, yer see, I had
                  the prisence of mind, as they cahl it, Katy; and I throwed on the wather, and put
                  out the fire. Och! you should have seen the work that it made. But I claned it all
                  up before master and mistress got home."
               "Why, Madge! you liked to have set the house afire."
               "And shure I did. You see, Katy, if it hadn't a-been for the prisence of mind, I
                  niver should have put it out at all at all."
               By this gossip I became much excited. Why was the chimney never used? If it was
                  actually a chimney, why should not a fire burn under the boiler? I now remembered
                  that I had never seen any smoke issuing from the new chimney.
               When Madge set out on her return, I followed and accosted her: "I heard you and
                  Katy, this afternoon, talking about the boiler at Mr. Windsor's," I said.
               "And did ye, now?" she asked.
               "Yes, Madge; and is it true that they never use it at all?"
               "Thrue as the blessed book itself."
               "And you tried it, and it would not draw, I heard you say."
               "Dhraw! Och! you should have seen it dhraw, thin. Murther! it dhrew the smoke and
                  canders all out into the room. Fath, now, it was as thick and black as Agypt! Ah!
                  Misther Gorden, I was nearly burnin' the house up."
               "I should think so. Madge, I suspect something terrible."
               "You do, now? What is it that yer afther suspecting, Misther Gorden?"
               "Can you keep a secret?"
               "A sacret? Sure, I'm dumb intirely, if that's what you mane."
               "Madge, if I may trust you, you can aid me very much; but, should you utter one
                  word, or even give a hint, it might be the ruin of all my hopes."
               
               "By the Hooly Vargin, I'd not be exposin' ye at all at all."
               "I don't think you will, for I believe you have a heart."
               "And shure I have: what would I be doin' widout it?"
               "I mean, a kind heart, loving and faithful."
               "Thank ye, sir," curtseying, "for the praise ye're afther givin'. Shure, thin, the
                  ould mither of me always said that me heart was as tinder as a boiled haddock; and
                  I think it is, for I niver could be hurtin' the laste thing, not even a fly, in
                  all me born days, batin' the 'skeeters, the blood-suckers. Many's the time I would
                  be blubberin' when I saw any crathur a-sufferin'. Once, whin I lived in Coork, our
                  Tommy—ye didn't know Tommy? it was the black cat, shure—well, ye see, Tommy came
                  home, and some murtherin' spalpeen had cut his tail off, and there 'twas, all
                  bleedin', and Tommy lookin' so sorrowful that I blubbered about it till I'd almost
                  broke me heart."
               "I perceive, Madge, that you are just the person I want; but you must be very
                  discreet and silent."
               "An' shure I will. I'll be as close as ould Mother Mulligrubs, and she has niver
                  spoken but once these twice ten years."
               "Is there any place where you can secrete yourself—hide so as not to be seen—in
                  the chamber which the chimney that would not draw passes through?"
               "No, sir, shure there's not."
               "Is there a key-hole in the door that leads into that chamber?"
               "There is none, sir. The door is fastened with a bit of a stick stuck over the
                  latch, with a corkscrew through it."
               "You do the cooking, mostly, do you not?"
               "Yes, sir."
               "Has any food disappeared that you could not account for?"
               "Well, thin, it has,—mate and praties, bread, pies, and cakes."
               "What do you suppose became of it?"
               "Shure, I don't know. The ould woman said they gave it to the poor."
               "Have you ever known an instance where Mr. or Mrs. Windsor gave any food to the
                  poor?"
               "Shure I niver have, now; and, upon my sowl, I don't b'lave they iver gave a
                  morsel,—they are so very close, sir."
               "Nor I either, Madge."
               "Shure, but what thin would they be doin' wid it?"
               "Madge, I believe that chimney is a false one."
               "That's just what I was tellin' Katy. I said I didn't b'lave any chamney was there
                  at all."
               "I suspect that between the chamber-floor and the roof a small room is
                  constructed, which serves for a hiding-place or a prison."
               "And what would they have that for, now?"
               
               And Madge opened her large eyes very wide with wonder.
               "What would you say, Madge, if my wife, your young mistress, was a prisoner
                  there?"
               "What would I say? By the powers! I would say that her father and mither were a
                  couple of murtherin' ould divils! What would I say, Misther Gorden? I would say
                  that the miserable spalpeens should be shut up there and starved to death, the
                  cruel ould blaggards."
               "Well, Madge, I told you that I suspected something terrible, and that was it. I
                  may be mistaken, but I think she is there."
               "Ah! shure, Misther Gorden, you're right, thin. And there's where the victuals all
                  went to. O cruel, cruel Madge! to be stayin' there all this while, and niver
                  thinkin' at all that the young leddy was there. O! me beautiful young mistress,
                  that used to be so kind to every body, shut up there all these long months, and I
                  so stupid as niver to be findin' it out." And Madge wept and lamented, manifesting
                  great distress and honest indignation.
               "Ah! such a good young leddy," she said. "The ould crocodiles, to be trating her
                  so,—may the divil burn ye both! I'll break the ould chamney down this very night,
                  and let her out, before I slape."
               "No, no, Madge, you can't do that; you must do as I say."
               "And shure I will, Misther Gorden, for you know better than I."
               "I want you to watch for a couple of days, and see if any food is carried up
                  stairs."
               "I will, sir."
               "You must be vigilant, keep your eyes always open, and yet not seem to notice any
                  thing in particular."
               "But how can I slape, sir, if I keep my eyes open all the while?"
               "I mean, all day long and in the evening, you must be on the watch, and yet not
                  appear to be."
               "I understand, sir, 'cause they would be suspectin' me. I'll smoke out the ould
                  rats for ye be sure o' that, sir."
               "After two days you must tell me what you have discovered."
               "Yes, sir, I will."
               "Madge, be very cautious, and you may be the means of giving your young mistress
                  her freedom."
               "Shure, sir, I will,—I wouldn't have them suspect me for the world, sir. Shure, I
                  pity ye, Misther Gorden; but don't be feelin' too bad about it, and we'll find her
                  yet. Wait a while, and whin I make the diskivery I'll be comin' and tellin'
                  ye."
               "That's right. Good-night, Madge."
               "Good-night, yer honor; and may the Hooly Vargin pertect ye, and the swate crathur
                  whom the murtherin' wretches have shut into an ould smokin' blaggard of a
                  chamney."
               
               The next forty-eight hours hung heavily upon my hands. I was fearful that the
                  new-born hope of discovering Marion might be blasted,—anxious lest Madge should be
                  imprudent, and so defeat my plans. As to her faithfulness, I had not a doubt.
               At the appointed time, I saw Madge approaching, and hastened to meet her.
               "Och! Misther Gorden," she said, with great earnestness, "I have found it
                  out."
               "What have you found?" I asked, much excited.
               "She's there! the young leddy is there!"
               "How do you know that, Madge?"
               "Ye see, sir, the night afther I left ye, afther they had all gone to bed, I went
                  up into the room by the chamney."
               "Well?"
               "I squat down there in the dark, and staid two or three hours, but I didn't hear
                  nothin', sir. Jist as I was thinkin' of goin' to bed, I heard somebody a-comin',
                  but I couldn't get out of the room at all."
               "You did wrong to go there, Madge,—it was very imprudent."
               "Shure ye'll pardon me, for I wanted to find her so much. Well, ye see, in came
                  Mr. Windsor, the ould tyrant."
               "He did?"
               "Yes, sir, and he had a basket in his hand, with some victuals in it. Whin he saw
                  me, he looked mighty scared. 'What in the world are you doin' here, Madge?' said
                  he.
               "'Shure, sir,' said I, 'I thought I heard the cat a-bouncin' round, and I came
                  afther her.'
               "'I thought I heard the dog,' said he (what a big lie), 'makin' a racket up here,
                  and I recollected that I did not give him his supper,' said he (the ould chate!—he
                  did, for I saw him do it), 'and so I brought some food up for him. Go to bed,
                  Madge. I have told you before not to sit up so late o' nights.'
               "'Yes, sir,' said I; but I didn't, though, for I watched until he went up into
                  that chamber again wid the same basket. I tried to peep in to see what the ould
                  curmudgin was a-doin', but he shut the door afther him."
               "You did well, Madge. What next?"
               "Well, ye see, this mornin' I thought I heard the cruel ould chap in that chamber
                  again; and, to make shure, I watched until he came down, and brought some dishes
                  and scraps o' broken victuals."
               "I am greatly obliged to you, Madge. Now you must give Katy a short call, and then
                  go home; but don't breathe a word to any one."
               "Shure I won't, Misther Gorden; so good-by to ye, sir, and may ye get her out this
                  very night."
               "Good-by, Madge. You shall be well paid for this."
               "Is it the pay ye are spakin' of? Bother on it for the pay! Jist show me the young
                  leddy under your own pertection, and
                  that will be pay enough, shure."
               I now sought Mr. Mackay, and reported to him what I had learned through the shrewd
                  house-maid.
               "And what inference do you draw from all this?" he inquired.
               "That the chimney is false, and my wife there a prisoner."
               "It may be so, though it don't seem probable."
               "Probable! what is there probable in relation to the whole of this infernal
                  business?"
               "You are very much excited, Elwood; but I wonder not. You need your best thoughts
                  now, so they must be kept cool and in good working order. A misstep, and all may
                  be lost. As for me, I am ready to assist you in anything you desire, and to
                  encounter peril, if necessary."
               "Thank you. I knew that I could rely upon you, and your invaluable aid I must
                  have. I believe Marion is there. Now what shall we do?"
               "In the first place, we want to learn, if possible, whether you are correct in
                  your surmises. If there be a room, through the chimney—which of course is false,
                  and most likely of wood—the light must pass in, for there is no window upon the
                  roof."
               "But a great deal of rain would beat through such a large chimney."
               "Very true; that's what puzzles me. Let me think. I have it. Admitting our
                  surmises to be correct thus far, it follows that glass is the protection against
                  the rain. If your wife is there, we have only to reach the chimney to learn the
                  fact."
               "And that we will do this very night."
               "By all means, for delays are sometimes dangerous. If we find a window in the
                  chimney, what shall we do,—break it?"
               "Yes—no, for the noise might cause an alarm. We will cut the glass."
               "I had not thought of that. I see that your senses are all on the alert; but,
                  Elwood, a word of advice: be not too sanguine."
               "Caution me not, my friend, for, before the clock shall have struck the first hour
                  of another morn, I shall have heard once more the voice of my own long-lost
                  Marion."
               "Which may God grant!"
               At midnight, we were at Mr. Windsor's house with ladders. As noiselessly as
                  possible, we placed one from the ground to the eaves, and the other from thence to
                  the new chimney. The latter, Mr. Mackay, standing on the former, steadied while I
                  went up. O, how my heart palpitated at this moment! What hopes and fears were
                  mine!
               Upon touching the chimney, I knew it was constructed of wood, and in a moment
                  after I was aware of another fact, which we had surmised, that within it a window
                  had been made, for my hand lay upon the glass. I was now so excited and indignant
                  that I had half a mind with one
                  powerful blow to dash it into a thousand pieces; but, realizing that such a course
                  would be unwise if not dangerous, I took my diamond and carefully cut out part of
                  a square of glass, which fell in. Marion heard the noise, and asked, "Who is
                  there?"
               As her voice came through the chimney, it had an unnatural sound; yet I recognized
                  it, and was so overcome as nearly to fall.
               "Marion," I said, "is it you?"
               A wild, joyous cry was her answer. I have never heard such a cry before or since.
                  "Elwood! my own dear husband! Speak again!"
               "Elwood comes to save you! poor, wronged one," I said, as soon as able to command
                  my voice.
               "I hear you, dearest; I know it is you!" she exclaimed, very brokenly. "I was sure
                  you would come! O, thank God! thank God!"
               "Thank God!" I repeated with fervor. "Have you been here all the while,
                  Marion!"
               "Yes, such a dreary while. When can you take me away?"
               "In the morning. If this had been known, the house would have been levelled to the
                  earth."
               "Don't delay, my husband, for Stanton is here, and I am in extreme danger."
               "Stanton here! What next? And does he come to your room?"
               "Yes, when he pleases. O! he is a villain of the blackest dye. Do save me from
                  him!"
               "I will, never fear. We are in peril here, my love; but you should keep a brave
                  heart, for ere many hours this hand shall break open your prison-doors."
               "I will be brave; but God speed you, dearest."
               We descended immediately, and having removed the ladders some distance from the
                  house, I went for a constable to arrest Stanton, while Mr. Mackay remained to
                  watch.
               It was about sunrise when I returned with the officer. Mr. Windsor had arisen, and
                  answered our summons at the door. We told him our business, and he denied that
                  Stanton was there. We informed him that we had good reason for disbelieving the
                  statement. At this, he stepped toward the chamber-stairs. Surmising that his
                  object was to go before, and give Stanton the alarm, so that he could flee to the
                  room where Marion was confined, I told him that, wherever he went, we should
                  accompany him. He then attempted to frighten us by bluster; but soon learned that
                  he was spending his breath for nought. As a last resort, he raised his voice to a
                  very loud tone, and declared with an oath that the person we were in search of had
                  not been inside his house since the day I had the first altercation with him.
               Believing Mr. Windsor meant to speak so loud that Stanton would hear him, we
                  mounted the stairs without delay. We soon entered the room of the culprit, who
                  sprang from the bed the moment we opened the door, and grasped his pistols; but
                  before he could use them they were struck from his hands and he was speedily
                  handcuffed.
               
               While on my way for the officer, I had called up a good friend, and requested him
                  to invite certain persons to meet me at Mr. Windsor's, to witness an event which
                  would utterly astonish them. Some twenty persons had now arrived, and we made our
                  way to the part of the house where Marion was incarcerated.
               "What do you want here?" inquired Mr. Windsor.
               "We wish to examine this chimney," replied Mr. Mackay.
               Mr. Windsor trembled. "These are high-handed proceedings," he said, "and, if the
                  law is adequate to meet them, you shall all feel its power."
               "You had not better threaten any one with law, after screening a
                  felon. It seems to me this chimney is remarkably spacious; I don't see the object
                  of it."
               "I designed keeping a large number of swine when I built it."
               "O, you did? But you changed your mind. Thought it would not prove a good
                  speculation, as you have not a forest of oak trees to supply acorns. People out
                  West have the advantage of you. Is there not a door that leads into the chimney
                  somewhere here?"
               "A door to a chimney!" exclaimed a number in concert.
               "Mr. Mackay is evidently crazy or drunk," said Mr. Windsor, in great trepidation,
                  however.
               "And you seem to be afraid of me, and well you may, for you have abundant reason.
                  You will oblige me very much if you will show me where the door is, Mr.
                  Windsor."
               "I know not what you mean, or what you want here; but I command every one of you
                  to leave this house instantly."
               "I am interested in the style of building you have adopted, Mr. Windsor. You
                  employed an ingenious workman. It deceives the most practised eye. I have a sharp
                  axe here; and, in time, can make a hole as large as a door,—at least, I will try
                  to do it." Suiting the action to the word, he struck into the wall.
               Mr. Windsor sprang forward to stop him, but several stout arms held him back.
                  Nearly every person present was filled with amazement at this strange proceeding
                  on the part of my friend; and yet they would allow no one to interrupt him. After
                  striking a few blows, Mr. Mackay commenced sounding for the door, which he soon
                  found.
               He now handed the axe to me, remarking that it was my right to break open the
                  prison. This was what I wished; and with desperate energy I struck the weapon into
                  the hard plank, and after a few blows the spring was broken, and the door flew
                  open. The people present, not in the secret, uttered an exclamation of
                  astonishment, and began now to comprehend our object.
               The inner door soon yielded, and my wife, with a wild cry of joy, sprang into my
                  arms. O! what an embrace was that. So long separated, and by such hellish means, we clung to each other in
                  indescribable transport. Words we uttered not, but our tears fell like rain.
               There were stout hearts among the men present, and eyes that had seldom been
                  moistened with tears; but they now wept freely. As to Madge, she talked, cried,
                  and laughed, all in the same breath. She caught Marion in her arms, as soon as I
                  gave her an opportunity, and talked to her as though she had been a little
                  child.
               "Ye poor crather!" she said, "darlin" little lamb, to be shut up here! Didn't I
                  help to find ye, ye blessed one? Shure I did. They niver would have known it at
                  all, but for Madge, ye darlint. Ye are safe now, ye purty bird; yer cursed ould
                  cage is broken, and the mate of ye has come, and he'll pick out the eyes of the
                  murtherin' ould hawk that got ye, so he will, ye dear, little, sufferin'
                  babby!"
               And then turning to Mr. Windsor, who stood as though transfixed to the spot, and
                  shaking her fist at him, she poured forth a torrent of objurgations:
               "O! ye ould baste, didn't I outwit ye? Wasn't I looking for the cat while ye was
                  looking for the dog, ye lying ould thafe of the world? Don't ye feel purty nice
                  now, ye botherin' spalpeen? I'd like to shut ye up here, and feed ye on bread and
                  wather for rest of yer days, and starve ye to death afterwards, that I would."
               And then, addressing my wife again, in a gentle, sympathizing tone, she exclaimed:
                  "Ye tinder lamb, to be caged up here so long, and yer darlin' mate not finding ye
                  at all. We've got ye now. Madge will pertect the darlint, so she will, and her
                  mate will too, ye purty little dove!" The faithful girl now resigned Marion to me,
                  and danced about the chamber in a perfect ecstacy of delight.
               Marion was very pale,—as white as the new-fallen snow. Her cheeks were much
                  sunken, her eyes unnaturally brilliant, and her whole countenance indicative of
                  severe mental suffering.
               "The hidden bride is found at last," said Mr. Mackay. "Give her joy. Three cheers
                  for Mr. and Mrs. Gorden!" cried our enthusiastic friend, and they were given with
                  a will. I now led Marion to a seat, and Mr. Mackay approached and shook her hand
                  and kissed her. To each one present she gave her hand; and then, as a carriage was
                  ready, she tearfully bade all good-by, and we were soon conveyed to the house of
                  Mr. Mackay, where my bride received a welcome as warm and hearty as though she had
                  been an own child.
               Some persons, who were present when my wife was set at liberty, resolved to arrest
                  her father, as soon as we were gone; but when they searched for him, he was
                  missing. Seeing that attention was withdrawn from him by their interest in the
                  discovery, and fearing the wrath of the citizens, he seized the opportunity to
                  escape to Canada, where his wife soon joined him.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXX.
               
                  
                     
                        "I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much another man is a fool
                           when he dedicates his behavior to love, will, after he has laughed at
                           such shallow follies in others, become the argument of his own scorn, by
                           falling in love."
                     
                     MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING.
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "A contract of eternal bond of love,
                           Confirmed by mutual joinder of your hands."
                        
                     
                     TWELFTH NIGHT.
                  
               
               WHEN Henry Morrison and Lissy Gorden returned from their ride, it was easy to
                  perceive, by their countenances, that something very agreeable to both had
                  happened. Two happier, better-satisfied faces never were seen in Dunfield. That
                  night, at tea, my mother remarked that she was expecting another friend on the
                  morrow.
               "O yes," said Lissy, "I had forgotten to tell you. The lady who taught our school
                  last season, Miss Julia Hines, is employed to teach it this season also, and she
                  is to board with us."
               "What sort of a person is she?" asked Henry.
               "I think her very interesting," said Lissy. "I hope you will both be pleased with
                  her, for my sake."
               "Or rather for her own," remarked Edmonds.
               "Yes," she answered, "for her sake, and for mine, too. I almost know that you will
                  like her, she is so good."
               "An estimable young woman," said my mother, "and an excellent teacher. I think you
                  will be pleased with her."
               "I am sure he will," observed Lissy. "I had made up my mind that he would be
                  interested, from the first."
               "Very likely," responded Charles. "I am generally interested in those who are
                  interesting."
               "And sometimes an interest is awakened that is lasting," Lissy said.
               "No reason for alarm in his case," remarked Henry Morrison, "for he has got beyond
                  feeling a particular interest in any woman."
               "Cool, upon my soul!" said Charles. "Well, some folks do feel their position. How
                  long is it, pray, since a certain gentleman of my acquaintance had a perfect
                  horror of 'country hussies?'"
               "Don't, Edmonds," implored Henry.
               "What does that mean?" inquired my mother, smiling good-humoredly, while Lissy
                  blushed scarlet.
               "I beg for mercy, Charles," Henry petitioned.
               "Don't show him a particle of mercy," said my mother, "for I doubt whether he
                  deserves it."
               "I have no such intention," Edmonds replied; "but, as in duty bound, will make a
                  clean breast of it. On the night when Henry and I met with that unlucky-lucky
                  accident in front of your dwelling, as we were slowly riding hither in the
                     darkness ness and storm, we saw a
                  bright light, and at once concluded that it came from a dwelling-house. We decided
                  to request entertainment for man and beast. Henry, as you know," bowing to Lissy,
                  "is very particular; and he proposed that we should continue on, if things were
                  not to our liking. He seemed to imagine that the house contained some half-dozen
                  old maids, more or less, and of such he has, or had, an especial horror. I told
                  him, in a bantering manner, that most likely he would find a wife there. He
                  saucily replied that he did not like 'country hussies.'"
               "Very good," said my mother. "He has only manifested a little inconsistency, which
                  we all do at times, and suddenly changed his mind."
               "Not a bit of it," said Henry, "for I have no especial liking for the article
                  now."
               "As you do not partake of your friend's prejudices," said Lissy, addressing
                  Charles, "there will be no obstacle in the way of your becoming interested in Miss
                  Hines."
               "And if the interest should be mutual?" said my mother.
               "Why, then, the next thing would be something else," Charles remarked,
                  laughing.
               That night, when Charles Edmonds retired, he could not dismiss Julia Hines from
                  his mind. Though the conversation respecting her had been carried on in a
                  half-jesting tone, he was curious to behold a young lady so highly esteemed by his
                  kind hostesses.
               Miss Hines, being detained by unforeseen causes, did not arrive at Dunfield until
                  three days after the time specified. She was a tall, finely-formed girl, with soft
                  brown eyes, hair glossy as silk, white teeth, and very handsome mouth. Her lips
                  were literally ruby in hue. Notwithstanding it bore the impress of sorrow, her
                  countenance was very engaging.
               It was the intention of Charles and Henry, when they left home, to be absent one
                  week; but, at the end of that time, Henry declared that he should stay some days
                  longer. Charles by no means regretted this decision; for his long-checked
                  affections now found an object in Miss Hines. She was not easily won, however. Her
                  heart-experience had been so painful that all she would consent to, in response to
                  Charles' remarkable assiduity and earnestness,—making up for lost time,—was to
                  hold a friendly correspondence with him. But frequent visits from Charles,
                  accompanied by Henry, during the summer and autumn, and an observation of the
                  happiness of the affianced pair, dispelled Miss Hines' coyness, thawed the icy
                  fetters of her love. When Thanksgiving came, there were extraordinary preparations
                  at the "old homestead," for a double wedding took place.
               Charles and Henry were partners in trade in an inland city; but they now
                  dissolved, in accordance with the wishes of my mother and sister, and Henry bought
                  out a store in Dunfield.

                     KING HENRY FIFTH.
                  
               
               WHEN Robert Bruce had read my sister's letter of dismission, he was very
                  angry.
               "Upon my soul," he exclaimed, "this is the most insulting epistle I ever received.
                  And so she thinks me almost a fool,—my language ridiculously inflated? Well, I
                  never was jilted before; and then how aggravating to have it done with such
                  impudence, as though Miss Gorden was vastly my superior! Curse me, if ever I'll
                  doubt again that women are everlasting tattlers. What miserable luck to have her
                  fall in with one of my old sweethearts, who was ready to blab every thing, as
                  though a gentleman of genius must always be as correct in his deportment as a
                  parish priest. What a saucy jade is Miss Gorden, to write thus to me! All
                  communication must cease, eh? In that she shall be gratified. But I'll be revenged
                  upon her, somehow, for I won't stand such insults!"
               Mr. Bruce, having thus vented his spleen at being paid off in his own coin, went
                  to his store, and scarcely thought of the matter again until evening brought an
                  hour for reflection. He felt less bitter than at first; and, as he pondered upon
                  his past career, he asked himself if Lissy's rebuke was not just. Had he made good
                  use of his talents? Had one of the hopes which blossomed with such promise in his
                  boyish days ever brought forth fruit? Had not the glowing predictions of his
                  friends respecting his future career all failed? Had he not drank in praise and
                  flattery until his head was turned, and he neglected the studies which once he
                  speedily mastered? Had he not worshipped himself, regardless of the praise and
                  service due to his Maker? Had he not wrapped himself in the garment of
                  selfishness, and lived for his own gratification? Had he not made promises of
                  affection only to break them, causing untold anguish, and leaving one heart
                  utterly crushed and desolate? "Ah, yes!" he thought, "Lissy's letter is all too
                  true." He had no desire now to seek revenge, for he felt himself justly punished.
                  His own sister had often pronounced his language very extravagant; and, as he
                  reflected upon the past, and reviewed what he had said and written, the conviction
                  of his folly could not be resisted. What was he now, and what might he not have been? Even Lissy Gorden had conceded to
                  him the possession of superior natural abilities,—which he had been a thousand
                  times complimented for,—and yet what did these gifts avail him?
               His retrospections finally settled upon May Appleton. He remembered how beautiful
                  and light-hearted she was; how charming and graceful; how full of vivacity and
                  innocent fun. He realized that he had loved her as well as his heart was capable
                  of loving. He had really intended marriage, and by the most devoted attentions had
                  won her heart, and she had trusted him as only such warm-hearted, enthusiastic
                  natures can trust. He had pledged himself to May by the most solemn vows, and she
                  had believed him; and then, growing weary of her, he had forsaken the
                  too-confiding girl, and left her to desolation and shame. This greatest sin of all
                  his frivolous life now began to weigh upon his mind. He wondered if May would
                  forgive him, and accept again the heart which had been so cruel, so faithless
                  toward her.
               The parents of Robert Bruce, from his boyhood, had desired him to become a lawyer;
                  and they were sorely disappointed, he well knew, when he ceased studying for that
                  profession. He queried whether he could succeed now. If he might not become
                  pre-eminent, could he not in a measure redeem the past? He resolved to attend a
                  good school for six months, and again commence the study of law. Ere many days he
                  mentioned the subject to his father, who had made him a partner in trade, and
                  obtained a reluctant assent. During that half-year he bent his energies to the
                  acquirement of knowledge, with undaunted perseverance and remarkable progress. It
                  was tedious at first, his mind had lain torpid so long; but every day saw
                  obstacles overcome and triumphs achieved.
               At the end of the specified time, Robert signified his desire to again study law.
                  This his father had not anticipated; but, having been apprised of his son's
                  success at school, he willingly consented, and engaged to furnish the requisite
                  means, if there was no more trifling.
               When Robert Bruce learned that May Appleton had removed from Albany to Boston, he
                  decided to pursue his studies at Cambridge. Without unnecessary delay, he repaired
                  to that time-honored seat of learning, and commenced his studies. He devoted his
                  mind steadily to the task, and soon won the respect of the professors and of all
                  his classmates. The most severe criticism which he experienced was in relation to
                  his inflated style. The tree was vigorous and gave good promise, but it required
                  thorough pruning. All his besetting sins he battled with manfully, and ere long
                  had them under his feet. He regarded his past life with regret and penitence,
                  while the future held out vivid hopes, beckoning him on.

                           The sole drift of my purpose doth extend
                           Not a frown further."
                        
                     
                     TEMPEST.
                  
               
               OUR scene will now change to a pleasant little chamber in a retired street of the
                  city of Boston. Every thing in this room shows the most perfect taste. It contains
                  a bed, table, looking-glass, half a dozen chairs, a neat stove, a piano, a few
                  choice books, and sundry little nick-nacks, such as persons of refinement like to
                  have around them.
               Near the table sits a young woman, sewing, her fingers flying nimbly, while at her
                  feet is a beautiful boy, gazing fondly into her face. She is still very lovely,
                  though her countenance shows traces of grief and suffering. She is small in
                  stature, active in all her movements, and graceful as a fawn. Her hair is of a
                  soft brown, and curls naturally; her complexion is very light; her expression is
                  animated and full of soul. As the reader has probably surmised, this is May
                  Appleton.
               She had naturally a very sweet voice, and early learned to play and sing. Being
                  passionately fond of music, and having saved a small sum by the rapidity with
                  which she made up men's garments, she purchased a piano, which was sold at auction
                  for less than one quarter of its actual value. This was a great source of
                  enjoyment to her, and she sung and played to her little brother, who was never so
                  happy as when listening to her music. But in another respect she had secured still
                  greater advantage. The neighbors heard her, and sent in their daughters to receive
                  lessons; so that now, for the first time in her life, she was a music teacher,
                  having four pupils and expecting more.
               "Henry," she said, addressing the little boy, "I want you to practise a while
                  now."
               "Yes, May," he replied; "but it is so very hard! I wish I could play as you can.
                  Why can't I?"
               "You will, child, when you have practised as much."
               "Did you have to begin when you were no larger than me?"
               "I did not commence so young, but the practice was just the same."
               "I wish I was older."
               "You wanted to learn now, Henry. It would be just as hard if you were older. You
                  must brave it out, and by-and-by you will play very sweetly."
               "Shall I, May?"
               
               "Certainly; you improve very fast."
               "Do I? Well, then, I will try, and so learn to play to you when you are
                  tired."
               "Yes, darling. It will be a great comfort to me."
               "You are a dear good sister;" and he kissed her, and went to the piano, and
                  commenced that drumming on a lesson which new beginners find so tedious.
               Robert Bruce thought every day of the forsaken one, but it was a long time before
                  he could summon courage to make her a visit. He had, of late, lost much of his
                  self-assurance, and in May's presence was convinced he should have none at all. He
                  realized that she would serve him right if she drove him from her presence in
                  scorn; but, for all that, he determined to see her once more. If it were possible
                  to make reparation for his dishonorable conduct, he would do it.
               When Robert arrived at May's chamber-door, on the afternoon of a pleasant summer
                  day, she was playing and singing. He stopped to listen, and the tones of her voice
                  were as sweet as of yore. He heard her distinctly, and it cut him to the heart;
                  but he knew that she had not forgotten him. Sweetly but sadly her voice sounded,
                  as she sung those touching lines: 
                     
                        "Thou hast learned to love another,
                        Thou hast broken every vow,
                        We have parted from each other,
                        My heart is lonely now.
                        I have taught my looks to shun thee,
                        When coldly we have met,
                        For another's smile hath won thee,
                        And thy voice I must forget.
                        O, is it well to sever
                        This heart from thine forever?
                        Can I forget thee? Never!
                        Farewell, farewell, forever!
                     
                     
                        "We have met in scenes of pleasure,
                        We have met in halls of pride;
                        I have seen thy new-found treasure,
                        I have gazed upon thy bride,
                        I have marked the timid lustre
                        Of thy downcast happy eye,
                        I have seen thee gaze upon her,
                        Forgetting I was by.
                        I grieve that e'er I met thee,
                        'Twere folly to regret thee,
                        Fain, fain would I forget thee,—
                        Farewell, farewell, forever!
                     
                     
                        "We have met, and we have parted,
                        But I uttered not a word;
                        Like a guilty thing I started,
                        When thy well-known voice I heard.
                        Thy looks were stern and altered,
                        And thy words were cold and high;
                        How my traitor courage faltered
                        When I dared to meet thine eye.
                        O, woman's love will grieve her,
                        And woman's pride will leave her,
                        Life has fled when love deceives her,—
                        Farewell, farewell, forever!"
                     
                  
               
               When the singer ceased, Robert rapped gently upon the door. May opened it, but
                  sprang back, almost fainting. He tried to speak, but the words choked him, and he
                  could not utter them.
               
               As soon as she could master her emotion, she said, "Mr. Bruce, why have you come
                  here?"
               "My motives, Miss Appleton, are good," he replied.
               "I would that I could believe it, sir."
               "That you doubt me is not surprising. But shall I come in?"
               "Yes, and be seated. Now I will listen to you."
               "Miss Appleton, I have cruelly wronged you."
               "You have, indeed, sir."
               "I called to see you because I would make all the reparation in my power."
               "What reparation can you make?"
               "I know not, and yet I can never be happy again unless atonement is made for the
                  evil I have wrought."
               "Mr. Bruce, are you sincere in this?"
               "I am, though it may be difficult for you to believe it. I am not what I was."
               "It rejoices me to hear you say so; but O! sir, attempt not to deceive me
                  again."
               "God is my witness that I have no such idea."
               "Tell me, Mr. Bruce, if this change be actual, what has produced it?"
               "You shall hear the whole history, though it be somewhat mortifying." He then
                  informed May of his engagement to my sister; of her dissatisfaction with and
                  dismissal of him; and, having her letter with him, read it aloud. He told May of
                  his subsequent career, and what he was doing now.
               She listened to the whole with great interest. "Much of this," he said, "is very
                  humiliating to me; but I have shown perfect candor. Now how can I atone for my
                  baseness to you?"
               "I don't know. Once I needed pecuniary aid so much that I would have accepted it,
                  even from you; but I require it no longer. For a while after your desertion I was
                  in the depths of dejection; but, summoning self-respect and religious hope, and
                  nerved by love for my dependent little brother, I have triumphed. I almost ruined
                  my health by arduous toil; but I am now expecting a sufficient number of music
                  scholars to enable me to give up sewing entirely."
               "You are a noble girl, and worthy of a better lot. Will you pardon me my
                  treachery?" asked the penitent man, sinking on his knees before her.
               "Arise, sir; kneel not to me, but to God."
               "But will you forgive me, Miss Appleton?"
               "Urge me not to-day. I had not expected this."
               "Where is your little brother?"
               "At school; you will not be able to see him to-day."
               "And may I come again?"
               "Yes, but not too soon."
               "Well, I will not. Good-by, and may God bless you."
               "Good-by, sir."
               When he had departed, May meditated long and intently, not without tears. Should
                  she forgive him? O yes, she could not find it in her heart to say, Nay. He had
                  repented, she was sure, for his whole
                  appearance was nobler and less conceited than when she formerly knew him.
               In two weeks Robert visited May Appleton again; and now she extended her hand and
                  bade him welcome. He sat down, took little Henry in his arms, and conversed with
                  him in a familiar manner. Soon after, Henry went to school; when May, with much
                  emotion, said:
               "Since you were here, you have scarcely been out of my thoughts, Robert, waking or
                  sleeping. I never prayed for revenge because of your treachery, and have always
                  hoped, even though you sought me not for pardon, that you would become a better
                  man. I have reflected well on what I am about to say, and I forgive you,—forgive
                  you all."
               "O blessed words!" he exclaimed, "how I rejoice to hear them. Your nature is most
                  gentle, May, and your heart full of goodness. You have said that you forgive me:
                  shall I offend if I ask to be fully restored?"
               "You shall be my friend always, if you are what you seem. O! I need a friend
                  sometimes. I am nearly alone in the world, having no relative except my little
                  brother, and he is entirely dependent upon me. I would gladly repose such
                  confidence in you that I may seek you for advice, as there are times when I sorely
                  need it,—at least, there have been in years past, and may be again."
               "May, pardon me, but I would be more than a friend."
               "I don't know as I comprehend your meaning. Would you be as a brother?"
               "More than that, May."
               "You surprise me. How can you be more than that?"
               "I would have the right to protect you always. I—shall I say it plainly?"
               "Yes, if you think best."
               "Well, then, I would marry you,—make you my own dear wife."
               "O Robert! your words sound strangely. Remember that I have heard them oft before,
                  and O! I had such faith in them, and was so deceived; how can I credit their
                  sincerity now?"
               "I cannot find it in my heart, May, to blame you, in the least. And, if you think
                  I manifest too much presumption, don't hesitate to say it, for I shall not be
                  offended."
               "You should not, for every promise which you made to me you broke, leaving me when
                  you knew my only hope was in you; and now you come, in hot haste,—pardon me if I
                  seem severe,—and ask complete restoration, ask me again to confide in your honor
                  and your love."
               "O! I believe I am always doomed to sin, and shall never do just right, though I
                  so much wish it. I now perceive that I should have waited until you had ample
                  reason to trust me, before asking so much; and yet I meant well."
               "I shall try to believe you; though in this matter I think you have been very
                  hasty."
               
               "I have."
               "You say that you would make me your wife. You have made the proposal, wishing my
                  assent. Robert, you have prided yourself, in days gone by, according to your own
                  confession, on your power over the heart of woman; and now you wish me again to
                  trust you implicitly, to yield up, without a doubt, the heart you lost by your own
                  folly. Will it surprise you if, under the circumstances, I infer that you still
                  consider yourself irresistible?"
               "No, it does not surprise me at all, for what I have now done justifies the
                  inference; and yet it would be an unjust one."
               "Possibly it would; but, admitting so much, will it be safe for me to rely upon
                  your constancy, when you have been so notoriously inconstant?"
               "May, you have not forgiven me."
               "Yes, I have, Robert; and, if I reject your love, I do not your friendship."
               "And perhaps the latter is more than I deserve."
               "Of that you can judge. I see you think me unkind, and yet I would not be so. But,
                  nevertheless, I must press the question home to you: can I confide in the
                  steadiness of your purpose to make me your wife and love me always, when you have
                  proved yourself untrue to many, and have once cruelly deceived me?'"
               "Your words strike home, May, and they wound severely; but I will be candid and
                  confess that you have abundant cause to regard me as unworthy of confidence."
               "True, and yet I pardon it all, and would retain your friendship; but seek not a
                  nearer relationship, for I cannot grant it."
               "Your decision is just, and yet it dashes to the earth all my hopes. Will you hear
                  my justification for such hasty action?"
               "Most gladly."
               "My first thoughts of amendment were associated with you; and, as I have pursued
                  my purpose steadily since resolving upon it, you have grown more and more into
                  your old place in my heart,—ay, you have a firmer position there than you ever had
                  before. From day to day, from month to month, I found myself hoping and longing
                  that you would forgive all, and consent to crown me with happiness, though I so
                  little deserved it. I did not intend to make you weep, dear May. You have
                  pronounced my doom, and I bend my neck to the blow, and acknowledge its
                  justice."
               "O, this is painful, Robert. I wish it had not been."
               "Well it has been my fate to make you unhappy, and I must leave you, for a shadow
                  ever comes with me."
               "You will not leave me in anger?"
               "No."
               "Will you not come to see me as a friend?"
               "Is it best?"
               "And why not, when I am so often lonely?"
               
               "I will come, if you wish it."
               "Thank you; and be not too much grieved by my words to-night, for I have not
                  intended to do or say aught that was uncalled for or unjust."
               "I believe you, May; and yet it is hard, for God knows that I love you
                  dearly."
               "So you told me long ago."
               "I did; but, if I know myself, I am a very different man now."
               "I believe you are; and, if I fail to discern the whole truth, let it not
                  discourage you, but remember that, though your reformation commenced many months
                  since, and has gone steadily forward, I heard nothing of it until a fortnight
                  since, and only then from your own mouth."
               "I perceive that the matter must appear differently to you from what it does to
                  me. I would say one thing more, and beg you to believe it."
               "Say on, Robert; for, since I have begun to trust you, it seems as natural as it
                  did of old."
               "Thank you. I knew that my whole treatment of you had been very culpable, and I
                  wished to make you all the reparation in my power. I respected you too much to
                  offer you gold, and I knew no method of fully atoning for my falseness except to
                  devote my life to your happiness; and, in order to do that, and have the devotion
                  acceptable to you, if acceptable it might be, I must love you, and feel
                  indubitably assured that my love would be inflexible forever. I had few doubts
                  when I met you a fortnight since,—subsequently not one. I offer this to you as my
                  justification."
               "I shall not doubt your words, my friend, and beg you to pardon whatever has
                  seemed harsh or unjust in me. We part friends?"
               "O yes, May. Not otherwise, for the world."
               After this interview, Mr. Bruce visited May Appleton quite frequently, inviting
                  her to places of entertainment or recreation, which gave variety to her monotonous
                  life. He became much attached to her little brother Henry, went with him to
                  various places of interest in the city and vicinity, and made him presents well
                  designed to gain the heart of a child; and the boy loved his noble-looking friend
                  next to his devoted sister.
               May soon realized that she was more and more drawn towards Mr. Bruce,—that he was
                  becoming requisite to her happiness.
               He did not forget that May had forbade his seeking a nearer relationship than that
                  of friend, for she could not reciprocate it; and months passed away before he
                  alluded to the subject again.
               One day May had been singing and playing to him, while he stood near, turning over
                  the leaves of the music. When she paused he took her hand, while he laid his other
                  caressingly upon her head. She lifted her eyes to his, with an expression which
                  was very beautiful, tender, and confiding.
               "O May!" he said, passionately, "is it always to be so? Am I to be debarred forever from your
                  heart as a lover?"
               "Will it make you very happy if I say, No?" she asked.
               "Yes, dear May!"
               "Robert, I was cruel to you one day; but my heart removed the interdict long ago,
                  and now I confide in you without a doubt."
               When Robert Bruce had sufficiently advanced to open an office as a counsellor at
                  law, he married May Appleton, and a happy couple they are. He is rapidly acquiring
                  practice, though one fault still clings to him,—in moments of excitement his
                  language is apt to be extravagant; but, on the whole, his oratory is good, and the
                  impression which he makes in court is favorable. May is very beautiful now, and
                  justly proud of her husband, who had the conscience to repent, the heart to atone,
                  and the energy, after having long wasted his powers, to nobly redeem and elevate
                  himself.

               ON the day after the liberation of my wife, Mr. Mackay came home much excited. He
                  said a large crowd had gathered around Mr. Windsor's house, and he feared they
                  were determined to tear it down.
               We immediately rode to the scene of disturbance, where we found some hundreds of
                  men and boys of Dunfield, and the neighboring towns; they had assembled for the
                  purpose of leveling the building to the earth.
               As soon as they learned that I was present, they gathered around me; and I
                  addressed them for a few minutes, thanking them for their sympathy and good will,
                  but earnestly requesting them to go peaceably to their homes. If they destroyed
                  Mr. Windsor's property, it would be against my wishes, and my wife, though she had
                  long been a prisoner within those walls, would be much distressed.
               
               At the mention of my wife, cheers were called for and given with a will; and, when
                  I had finished my remarks, I was likewise honored. The crowd voted unanimously to
                  proceed no further with the contemplated work of destruction; but sent for a band
                  of music, and marched to Mr. Mackay's house, and called for Marion until I led her
                  out upon the balcony, when the wildest shouts went up from the excited multitude.
                  The dear girl was so affected as to be compelled to lean on me for support.
               I was now informed that in our county convention I had been nominated for the
                  State senate; and, as I was sure to be chosen by an overwhelming majority, I must
                  make a political speech. Willing to gratify the wishes of the people, I addressed
                  them on political topics for an hour, when they were served with a hasty
                  collation, and in the best of humor departed. It is only requisite to say that
                  their prophecy about the result of the election was fulfilled to the letter.
               A few days after this, Thomas Windsor returned to Dunfield, where he was
                  immediately arrested for the assault on young Rand, the gambler. He had been sent
                  for, and knew not of the events which had subsequently occurred. Stanton was the
                  cause of his arrest. He had made an agreement with Rand, that, if he lost Marion,
                  her brother should be taken into custody immediately. In order to insure its
                  fulfilment, he withheld a part of the "hush-money." Thomas Windsor was sent to
                  jail, under heavy bonds, where he remained three months, and was then set free by
                  taking a poor debtor's oath. Rather than expose the secrets of their gambling
                  house, the Rands did not prosecute him for assault, but rested their claim solely
                  on a pecuniary basis. On being released, the exemplary young man immediately
                  joined his parents in Canada. In the mean time they had disposed of their property
                  in Dunfield, at a great sacrifice. It was sold at public auction, and I was the
                  purchaser.
               Stanton spent large sums of money during his trial, in vain, for he was convicted
                  and sentenced to the State prison for fourteen years. But the influence of rich,
                  slave-holding relatives was potent upon a doughface Executive, and he served but a
                  moiety of his time.
               Marion rapidly improved after her liberation, and her old aspect of health and
                  beauty returned. When she was thought to be entirely restored, Mr. and Mrs. Mackay
                  invited us to visit the new house before alluded to. We found it, not empty, as we
                  had anticipated, but elegantly furnished. When we had sufficiently admired the
                  dwelling, its arrangement and its fixtures, Mr. Mackay placed a deed of the
                  premises in Marion's hands, stating that it was his free gift to her. This was so
                  unexpected that she could not for some minutes find words to express her gratitude
                  for the munificent present.
               "I always believed," said Mr. Mackay, "that you would be restored to your husband, though the
                  whole affair was so veiled in mystery. With this conviction, I erected this house,
                  and now I have the pleasure, as I anticipated, of presenting it to you. You are
                  pleased with it, and in drafting the plan, my great aim was to suit your taste. I
                  am glad to know that I have succeeded. It is a good house; it stands in a pleasant
                  location; and here may you know many years of happiness."
               "Doubtless I shall, and so all the weary days of my imprisonment will be
                  recompensed. It was hard to stay in that little room so long, and I suffered at
                  times very bitterly. But the night has passed and a glorious morning is ushered
                  in. O! I am so happy now. How good you all are to me! I would manifest my
                  gratitude, if I only knew how. Mr. Mackay, the best thing that I can say to you
                  is, may you be as happy you are generous."
               "I am much obliged, Marion, for the compliment. No trouble for you to manifest
                  gratitude, because you feel it. If you are happy, we shall all attain the end we
                  desire."
               "Then you will not fail. There are shadows long after the morning breaks, and some
                  of the gloom of the past still clings to me; but, for all that, my heart is half
                  wild with joy. When I think of my parents and brother, I am very wretched,—I am
                  ashamed of them, they have acted so basely,—but I am not to blame."
               "Certainly you are not. Don't let the recollection tion of their conduct change
                  the sunshine into shadows."
               "Indeed I will not. But it is a sad thing to feel that one's heart is orphaned: I
                  told my parents I should never acknowledge them as kindred again."
               "And no one should blame you for it," I remarked.
               "True," said Mr. Mackay; "but, after all, it is better to forgive. Their sins
                  against you are black as midnight, manifesting a most culpable lack of parental
                  and fraternal sympathy and interest. They have built up, if I may be allowed to
                  use such a figure, 'a wall between themselves and you,' which it will be
                  impossible for time entirely to remove; but, perchance, the hour will come when it
                  may be overleaped for brief periods. My daughter (I trust you will let me call you
                  so, as I have no children excepting Elwood, and he's my boy, you know), I would
                  have your heart soften towards your parents, and, should they ever see the evil
                  they have done, and repent of their crime, then ought you to receive them as the
                  good father receives the prodigal son."
               "Dear father," said Marion, addressing Mr. Mackay, "you are so kind that your
                  words shall be heeded. Should my relatives ever be brought low by misfortune,
                  suffering, or disease, my heart will open to receive them, will forget and pardon
                  all, while my hand shall seek to smooth their pathway to the grave."
               
               "You are a good child," said Mr. Mackay, "and the spirit which you now manifest is
                  like the Master's."
               "I have felt most bitter toward your family, Marion," I said; "but, if you can
                  forgive them, I will do likewise."

                     ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL.
                  
               
               WE immediately took up our abode in the new house, and the delighted Madge came to
                  live with us. As Marion had shown me the journal which she kept while a prisoner,
                  I requested her to read it to me. We decided to devote two evenings a week to it
                  until finished. It was interesting, and many portions of it very affecting.
               Marion had read but a few pages of the manuscript, when there was a knock at the
                  door. Upon opening it, Madge appeared.
               "Well, Madge," said my wife, "what do you wish for?"
               "Please, mum," said Madge, "may I come in?"
               "Yes, be seated."
               "And did I hear you radin' jist now, mum?"
               "I suppose you did."
               "And is it what ye were writin' yerself, now?"
               "I shall have to confess that I was so immodest as to actually commence reading to
                  my husband a production of my own."
               "Yis, mum, and so I thought; but ye shouldn't be tellin' its immodest, mum, to rade it to the
                  prisident, mum."
               "I see that you have a very exalted opinion of my abilities, Madge."
               "Shure I have, now. And is it what ye was writin' when ye were shut up in that
                  ould blaggard of a chamney?"
               "Yes, Madge."
               "Well, mum, I wanted to axe ye if ye would let poor Madge hear ye rade it?"
               "Certainly, Madge. Elwood and I shall both be pleased to have you here."
               "May the hooly Vargin bless ye both, ye dear crathers. Now, mum, begin again, if
                  ye plaze."
               Marion commenced the journal again, and we had occasion to laugh as well as cry,
                  for Madge was frequently so indignant, or felt so sorrowful, that she would give
                  utterance to her thoughts, and some things which she said during our readings were
                  very comical. Here is a specimen of the way we proceeded.
               "I have been most terribly deceived by my father. He came to Cumberland with a lie
                  upon his lips and fiendish wickedness in his heart. O! I am the victim of a dark
                  conspiracy. Why did I give heed to his smooth words, spoken only to deceive? He
                  promised to take me to my husband——"
               "Did he?" said Madge, "the murtherin' ould villain! He desaved ye? Och! wouldn't I
                  like to desave him?"
               "I reluctantly consented to come with him, but have learned what a fatal mistake I
                  made. I should have waited for my husband——"
               "So ye should, now. And, if ye'd jist asked Madge, she'd a tould ye. Shure, he
                  would have desaved Ave in the garden of Aden, as did that ould wily sarpent!"
               In this way we went on for a number of weeks. When the journal was finished, we
                  told Madge she must not speak disrespectfully of Mr. and Mrs. Windsor any more,
                  and she soon understood the impropriety of it.
               My mother is not willing to leave the "old homestead," and so Lissy and her
                  husband reside there with her. Not unfrequently she spends a week with us, and
                  Madge is never so happy as when she is our guest. Mother has a face all sunshine
                  and a heart all goodness, and so it is always pleasant to be with her. Not long
                  since we had the pleasure of a visit from Charles Edmonds and his wife, Henry
                  Morrison and Lissy, Robert Bruce and his charming May; and, in spite of the
                  peculiar relations which had existed between some of the parties heretofore, the
                  meeting was very pleasant, and the visit highly agreeable to all. It is seldom
                  that we meet a more entertaining couple than Mr. and Mrs. Bruce. Nobly has he
                  redeemed the past; and, since he has come to himself, he most devotedly
                     loved her whom he once so heartlessly forsook.

                           "My conscience has a thousand several tongues,

               ONE day, as I sat in my study,—the place where the reader found me on commencing
                  this book,—Madge knocked at my door, and said that a man was waiting in the
                  kitchen to see me. I ordered her to show him up. He came reluctantly, as though he
                  had no right to enter my pleasant retreat. I bade him be seated; and, as he seemed
                  to hesitate in speaking, I looked curiously into his face, as though inviting him
                  to proceed. It was very pale, the eyes glassy and cheeks sunken.
               "Is your name Elwood Gorden?" asked the man.
               "It is," I answered.
               "Was your father's name James Gorden?"
               "Yes, sir."
               "My name is Beverly, Francis Beverly. Through me, your father was once greatly
                  wronged."
               "How?"
               "I sold him a farm, and received the full value, when I knew that he could not
                  hold it."
               "And were you the man? Ah! sir, that act caused a vast amount of suffering."
               "I do not doubt it, for it stripped him of all his property. But I have also
                  suffered. Look at me, and see what a wreck I am. Consumption has fastened its
                  fangs here," striking his breast. "If I did not know the grave would soon receive
                  this tottering frame, I should not now be making this confession."
               "What was your motive, sir,—gain merely?"
               "Yes, in part; but I was not the only guilty one. In fact, I was instigated to
                  commit the fraud, or I never should have done it. I was tempted, and for a
                  consideration I joined in a scheme which the law would regard as a conspiracy to
                  cheat an honest man out of all his hard-earned property."
               "You say that you were instigated to this; who was the instigator?"
               "Mr. Windsor."
               "Mr. Windsor! Are you certain of that?"
               "I am. I was owing him money; and, meeting him soon after your father came to look
                  at the place, I informed him that I had fully made up my mind to sell, and that
                  your father would probably be the purchaser. He remarked that I ought to make
                  something handsome out of the business, as I was compelled to dispose of a farm
                  upon which I had bestowed so much labor and money. Everybody would take the
                  advantage when they could, and, if I followed the example of all the world, and
                  paid myself in part for my losses, nobody ought to blame me. At first I did not comprehend him, for I had no thought of
                  fraud when I commenced bargaining with your father. Mr. Windsor approached the
                  point at which he was aiming very cautiously, but by-and-by I understood him. I
                  hesitated for some days; but, the whole matter having been arranged by a rascally
                  attorney, the temptation overcame my better nature, and cupidity triumphed. I
                  pocketed my ill-gotten gains, and, having announced that I was about to emigrate
                  to the 'far West,' I immediately went South and settled in Mississippi."
               "Was Mr. Windsor a gainer by the transaction?"
               "I should judge that he was, but the amount could not have been large."
               "Why should he have wished to ruin my parents?"
               "He was moved to it mainly by the desire for revenge."
               "And for what cause?"
               "He loved your mother previous to her engagement to your father, and sought her
                  hand in marriage."
               "So I have been informed. But are you sure that was the cause?"
               "I know of no other. The sum which he received by the transaction ought not to
                  have had much influence, and I don't think it did, though he is close-fisted, and
                  hard upon a poor debtor, and loves money as well as any man I ever saw. When I
                  consented to the deed, I did not know what reason he had for urging me to it,
                  unless it were the few hundred dollars which he would gain thereby; but, meeting
                  him in Baltimore a few years since, I pressed him to tell me why he so much
                  desired the ruin of Mr. Gorden. He finally disclosed his motive, and said that,
                  when your father married the only woman he ever loved, he formed the resolution to
                  be revenged. He watched long for the opportunity; it came at last; and he had the
                  satisfaction of seeing the woman who jilted him beggared."
               "A wretched satisfaction, that. Revenge may be sweet; but, like the book eaten by
                  the author of Revelation, the end thereof is bitterness. Really, sir, I blame you
                  not for telling me this; and yet, for another's sake, I wish the confession had
                  never been made. The blow was a terrible one to my father, but he had the good
                  fortune to win back the lost home, and thither he joyfully returned, and there he
                  died, and now, I trust, he has been received into the better home."
               "I crave your pardon, sir, but I could not die with this burden upon my soul. I
                  knew your father was dead, and so I have come to you. I would have made the
                  disclosure to your mother; but how could I look her in the face? I have wronged
                  you and yours much, Mr. Gorden, but, sir, look upon me,—I am a dying man,—O! pity
                  me, sir! I came a long distance to make this confession, and now I return to die.
                  Will you not pardon me ere I go?"
               
               "Most freely, sir, and I am certain you can also take with you the pardon of my
                  mother."
               "You have my thanks, and that is all I can offer. The fraud which I committed for
                  gain, opened the way for further crime; but, though I often wronged my fellow
                  creatures, it has not brought me wealth, and I shall die a poor man."
               The broken-down creature looked so wretched and careworn that I urged him to
                  remain, and rest himself, and partake of some refreshment; but he positively
                  refused, and said he should return South as soon as possible.
               When he had gone, I queried if it was my duty to relate our conversation to
                  Marion. Not the least thing of importance had I as yet withheld from her; but was
                  it best to tell her this? Should I unnecessarily harrow up her feelings with the
                  information that the early misfortunes of my family were caused by the wickedness
                  of her father? But, should she ask me, I felt that I could not, by deception,
                  evade the subject.
               The stranger had not been gone many minutes when she came into the room.
               "Who was that, Elwood?" she asked.
               "He said his name was Beverly."
               "What a cadaverous face! how utterly woe-begone!"
               "He did look wretched, and his looks did not belie him."
               "The sight of him has thrown a gloom upon my spirits such as I have not known
                  since my deliverance ance from prison. What could be his business with you?"
               "Ought I to tell you?"
               "You know best; but I shall be unhappy if you have secret business with such a
                  man."
               "I have but one object in withholding it,—your happiness."
               "I do not doubt your motives, Elwood, in the least; I have too much confidence in
                  you for that; but, even though the revelation which you make may cause me pain, I
                  had rather not have it withheld."
               "Then I will tell you all, though it is with deep regret." I now related the
                  conversation which had passed between Mr. Beverly and myself, palliating the
                  statement of her father's villany as much as the ugly facts would allow, which was
                  but little.
               As I had anticipated, the disclosure caused Marion much suffering, for a time.
               "O Elwood," said she, "the thought sometimes comes into my mind, that my parents
                  and brother have so sinned against you and yours that I ought never to have become
                  your wife."
               "A wicked thought, that," I replied. "You must never harbor it again."
               "And can you still love me?"
               "O, never doubt it, Marion. Believe me, you never were dearer than at this
                  moment."
               "You have never deceived me, so I believe you. That thought shall not trouble me
                  again, if I can prevent it, for I know
                  that our union is no mockery, but a life-long marriage of the heart."
               "And if the shadows should return, dearest? You know that they may."
               "There is no earthly home so blessed that they do not now and then find an
                  entrance; but, where love is, they tarry not long."
               The reader has probably guessed, ere this, that the elegant dwelling in which he
                  found me, in the outset, was the one which Mr. Mackay presented to my wife, and
                  that he was the friend who desired me to write this autobiography. Since I
                  commenced the task, he has visited my study every few days, and, with the
                  authority which he assumes as a right, commanded me to read what I had written;
                  and I have cheerfully obeyed, for has he not been more than a father to me? The
                  suggestions which he has made from time to time have been valuable to a novice in
                  book-making like myself. I have just finished reading the last chapter to him. The
                  work, he says, has some faults,—and don't critics always say that?—but, as a
                  whole, he likes it very much. Of course he would—but, reader, do you?
