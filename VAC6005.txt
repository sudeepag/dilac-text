            TO Mrs. Lemuel Hawley Sherman,
            OF BROOKFIELD, CONNECTICUT.
            To you, dearest guide of my youth, these pages are most appropriately offered, since
               but for your suggestion they would, probably, never have seen the light. To you, and
               for you, they were written, as you earnestly desired to hear what I saw, and what I
               thought, of "Peon Slavery on our Border." My observations are plainly and simply
               told. Few will heed these hasty and undeveloped sketches; but there is subject for
               serious thought and Christian action in this, as in every other form of human
               servitude, and so I cast my tiny protest-laden shell upon the ocean of public
               opinion. It may never touch haven, but with yourself, and the friends who make my
               world, it is sure of favor and sunshine, and that will more than repay the slight
               labor of,
            
               Your grateful and devoted niece,
               CORA MONTGOMERY.
            
         
         
            
            PREFACE.
            IT was not at "the urgent solicitation of friends" that this volume was given to the
               press, for nobody was consulted in the matter. Beyond the assurance of the only one
               who had the "veto power" that he would not object thereto, and the wish of the
               beloved relative to whom it is dedicated, to see in printed record some shadowings of
               our border life, the writer never heard or cared for an opinion on this small
               subject. Still less was it for the pride or profit of authorship, for she was in no
               wise ignorant that neither could arise to any tempting extent from these crude pages,
               thrown off without system or premeditation, as the events occurred, or the thought
               pressed for utterance. They were written, and are published, because the facts
               existed, and the writer—wishing them known, and seeing no one else disposed to take
               the trouble—found no better way of giving them to the world.
            It may not be true long—and every ray of publicity helps the cure—but it is true now,
               that the interests of humanity and the honor of the country are utterly neglected on
               the Rio Bravo frontier. Whether it be from ignorance or inertia, it is certain that a
               class of the highest officials of the nation closely imitate the Mexican dignitaries
               of a similar rank, in profligacy of expenditure and profound indifference to the
               wants of the people.
            Our Indian policy is a blot on the very name of Christianity, yet what Senator or
               what General proposes any change, except, perhaps, something a little more veiled and
               indirect in our inexorable system of despoilment and extermination?
            We have before us abundant evidence of wrong and outrage to American citizens in
               various parts of Mexico, but we have no evidence that one step of firm, manly and decisive
               protest has been taken. With Mexico diplomatic compliments cost nothing and mean
               nothing, for her politicians are just as rich in words, and about as poor in acts, as
               ours are becoming in these latter days.
            Unoffending and free-born residents on our soil have been torn from it by force, and
               carried with lawless violence into Mexico to be enslaved for debt, and not one
               victim, at the end of two years' supplication, has been officially demanded or
               returned to us. So far from it, indeed, that the official record of
                  impunity is given in these pages—to the eternal shame of the public servant
               who refused to vindicate the outraged majesty of the Union. But it is also true that
               if a persevering demand is made for justice, the appeal must touch, at last, the
               popular heart; and then it is to be hoped we shall have done with apathy and
               evasions, and see these principles engraved in uneffaceable letters on our American
               policy:—
            
               Free-born citizens shall not be enslaved for debt in Mexico. Americans
               and their property shall be protected from spoliation. The sanctity of our soil shall
               be vindicated with firmness.
            We know our derelict public servants have failed to do their duty in these matters,
               and they will continue derelict so long as the people are silent; but they will
               hasten to amend their ways when the searching blaze of popular inquiry is turned upon
               their acts. The corruption and imbecility of our officials will grow upon us, until
               the press is aroused to take up the work and apply the cautery. Before this vague and
               irresponsible administration of our executive trusts is reformed into something more
               respectable and trustworthy, we may have to impeach some cabinet officers, and bring
               legislators under stringent laws of penal accountability; and why not? Why should our
               best-paid and most learned public servants do with impunity those things for which we
               would send a poor, untaught, poverty-tempted domestic servant to the
               penitentiary?

            EAGLE PASS; OR, LIFE ON THE BORDER.
            
               THE FRONTIER.
               THE lone and remote border sentinel of the frontier state of Texas—the patient,
                  unnoticed watcher in the gates, for the coming harvest from the equally
                  unthought-of silver region; that rich ore-land which shoots down its sierras from
                  a thousand miles to the north and west, to her very side, to within two or three
                  hundred miles of the sea,—Eagle Pass, with only its one rude edifice, and its
                  tented encampment, where the future Fort Duncan was to arise,—Eagle Pass, fair and
                  healthy as is its site, and full of promise as are its position and prospects, did
                  not seem on New Year's day of 1850, the place for stirring recollections. Yet it
                  is a true miniature of Americanism; roughly limned and in water-colors, but with
                  the genuine family look. We see it in the colossal beauty and conquering energy of
                  the republican stock, and we can see, too, if we will consent to see them, some
                  past stains not easy to cure, and some present blemishes which we would do well to
                  amend. If we were to trace out in full the parentage of Eagle Pass, it would
                  unveil some awkward passages in our national policy; and if the people would heed
                  the warning, there is much to be said of an evil growth about to take root on our border, and spread the baneful
                  fruits of a new family of injustice, oppression, domestic strife, and foreign war,
                  over the Union. It is here on this border that we must meet and blight, by the
                  scorching fire of public opinion, the threatened iniquity of peon
                     servitude.
               
               The prosperous, well-stocked stores, the intelligent society that have started, as
                  if out of the ground, in one short year, at this frontier point, more than a
                  hundred miles from the nearest American town, are of themselves an expressive
                  illustration of how the bold enterprise of our people knows to acquire territory,
                  and to build up towns, and states. More than this, Eagle Pass is a piece of Texas;
                  and around Texas is entangled the noblest, and the meanest acts, the most
                  brilliant and the most clouded diplomacy, of the men and measures of our times. If
                  the drapery and masking could be rent away, and all exposed in stern and rigid
                  truth, not a thousand of our twenty-three millions could, or would believe the
                  schedule of our last ten years' diplomacy to be a verity; they would say so many
                  instances of weakness and corruption could never force their blots on the pages of
                  our history. Neither could they, if the masses would be just guardians of their
                  own interests, and not allow themselves to be sold and trampled down by that slimy
                  monster Party, whom they have allowed to make his nest in their
                  treasury, and rule from thence, the Union.
               The highest statesmanship, the lowest evasions, the brightest and the vilest of
                  our public acts, encircle Texas as with a mosaic frame. The ground mass is of the
                  white imperishable marble of our institutions, bound with constitutional fillets
                  of purest gold, and set with countless gems of precious ray, yet crossed and
                  spotted with some most unsightly flaws of human infallibility.
               At Eagle Pass we study the busy world at a safe distance; as from a beautiful
                  hermitage on the mountain side, that overlooks the city's turmoil, without being
                  affected by its din or sharing in its strife. The cares and clatter of life come
                  to us so calmed and tempered by distance that we can handle and probe their sickly
                  unimportance at our convenient leisure, without the least danger of infection.
                  Sectional opinions have lost their heat, and party malice its venom, before the
                  papers, freighted with their prejudices, can reach the two hundred miles of
                  Indian-infested country that lies between the coast and our home in the
                  wilderness. Here we review and criticise, condemn or approve, with all the freedom
                  of our American birthright, the wilful inertness, or obstinate blunderings of our
                  public servants.
               The Union—ocean-zoned and star-crowned; with all the treasures of the earth
                  glittering on her bosom, and her imperial robe embroidered in flowing silver with
                  a matchless tracery of lake and river; with climes of every hue cast over her like
                  a gorgeous canopy; with thirty-one illustrious sons, already come to man's estate,
                  to guard her with duteous love, and many a fair territorial daughter to grace her
                  coming years—the Union, peerless mother of this noble family, can well afford in
                  her greatness to confess that some specks dim the sun of her glory. So too may
                  Texas, in the plenitude of her rich gifts, afford to own frankly the short-comings
                  of her children, and keep henceforth to higher aims and more settled purposes.
            
            
               A BIRD'S-EYE GLANCE.
               I LANDED early in March, in Texas, and, as almost everybody is, was led captive by
                  the fresh and verdant beauty of the coast region. The north was still shivering in
                  the frost and sleet of lingering winter, but already green and laughing spring was holding her revels on a carpet
                  of flowers in the bright sunshine. A gay and radiant freedom seemed to pervade
                  this land of fertility and promise, and with every drawback, in the shape of
                  confused land titles, and the beginner's privations, there is no country under the
                  sun in which a sober, sensible and industrious man can more certainly realize a
                  quick independence and a delightful home. Somewhere or other in its vast extent,
                  every one can find the features and productions that interest him most. There are
                  those whose associations are with the interminable plains of the Mississippi, and
                  who love to look out from a little island of trees on a boundless level of
                  verdure, perhaps dimly marked in one direction by the undulating line of darker
                  woodlands that fringe and define the course of some stream, like a shore of the
                  sea, with its windings and promontories. Such must be delighted with the rich,
                  broad prairies of southern Texas. They have there the deep alluvial for sugar,
                  plenty of fish and game, splendid cattle, good horses, and some mosquitoes. Those
                  there are again who demand a rolling, picturesque country, pure and sparkling
                  water sources, and a soil that will return cotton and tobacco, as well as wheat
                  and corn, and who turn their backs on sugar cane and trees veiled in garlands of
                  gray moss. These have but to go back from the coast and find all the heart of man
                  can desire in the way of cheap soil, and healthy, poetic situations in middle
                  Texas. If he have a taste for the sublime and exciting, he has but to leave the
                  coast some two hundred miles behind to hunt buffaloes and wild horses on the head
                  waters of the Brazos and Colorado. If mine-hunting and glances of sparkling gold
                  be more to his appetite, he can play at their own game of warfare with the Indians
                  and explore the are region that belts Texas on the north and west. If, finally, he
                  would live like the patriarchs—and in a country like their own promised
                  land-surrounded by flocks and herds, in simple and bounteous plenty, he may come
                  to the valley of the Rio Bravo and pitch his tent in the pleasant recesses about
                  and above Eagle Pass. All these sections offer sure employment and independent
                  homes on the easiest terms. If a healthy man is poor and homeless in Texas, it is
                  because he is not manly enough to turn his hands to useful labor. It is the
                  scourge of Texas—or rather has been, for these locusts are now less felt—that an
                  army of idlers made of her hospitable homes the refuge of their worthlessness.
                  Hundreds, too genteel to earn honest, independent bread-but not too genteel to
                  accept their daily food in indirect alms from those who do-swarmed into Texas and
                  lived on speculation until the vigorous life of the young country outgrew the
                  canker. The scar of this plague is still visible in the chaos of law suits and
                  land monopolies that overspread the state and so infect her titles that no prudent
                  man will touch them without great precaution. But it is in process of cure.
            
            
               INDIANOLA.
               THE steamer Palmetto cast its swarm of sea-sick passengers ashore at Indianola the
                  fourth day out from Galveston. Both Laraca and Indianola must be chartered cities,
                  for it is the curious and laudable custom of Texan towns, to elect a Mayor and
                  Common Council as soon as they have men enough to fill out the offices; and then,
                  in paper-money days, they instantly issued their notes for circulation. Some of
                  them did not wait for such an exuberance of population. Fair Richmond had, I
                  think, but one building in it when it began to issue its amendments to the specie
                  currency. The storekeeper in that one building was probably the Mayor and population in general, and his clerk
                  enclosed within himself the Recorder and Common Council. Yet Richmond is a lovely
                  place, and will not fail to say of itself, as says every one of the precocious
                  children of the Lone Star, that it is the most promising babe of the whole
                  family.
               Almost every league of land on the coast, or navigable rivers of Texas, has a town
                  surveyed off, and each one of this legion of paper cities is avouched by its
                  proprietors to be the most desirable spot on earth. Yet by a singular inadvertence
                  it has rarely happened that business and capital have pitched upon the positively
                  best locations, that is to say, almost never have they chosen with care and
                  forethought those points of intersection of the foreign and domestic trade, at
                  which the best facilities of communication have opened the widest range of demand
                  for what came from abroad, to meet with the largest means of supply of home
                  products. There was a tall, slow-spoken gentleman on board our steamer, who had
                  become the possessor of "an interest in a town tract," who was more than anxious
                  to make a huge, faultfinding Englishman's fortune by selling him a few lots in his
                  "splendid sea-port." If he succeeds, I can fancy the blank dismay of the purchaser
                  when he finds wild cattle the only inhabitants of the prosperous city.
               These sales and the persevering ill-will which rival places manifest towards each
                  other, have injured incalculably the character and growth of the country, yet, in
                  spite of all that, there must be towns and commercial outlets, and fortunes will
                  be made in creating them, as fortunes have been made elsewhere in the Union, by
                  the judicious selection and outset of new places. But in doing this it must be
                  borne in mind that steam has revolutionized the old rules, and the winds no longer
                  confine commerce to those harbors that are accessible to sailing vessels. Trade is
                  pressing its favorite depots more and more inland, and as steam supersedes sails,
                  thinks less than of old of being exactly on the coast.
               Every body was disappointed in Indianola, it was so different from their ideas,
                  but nobody found serious room for complaint. A belt of white sand separated the
                  ocean of green prairies from the ocean of blue water, and along this belt was
                  arranged a line of wooden buildings, unrelieved by trees or enclosures, like a
                  string of overgrown packing boxes set out on the beach to dry. Lavaca, its
                  neighbor and rival, is much the same thing, yet when these forlorn, undraped
                  villages plant trees and robe themselves in verdure, as Galveston has done, they
                  will be charming places. They were in such a hurry to commence business that they
                  deferred adornments for a season. They are on the verge of a rich and extensive
                  back country, intersected by numerous streams that fall into the Bay, all around
                  them, and one or another of the hundred towns laid off on the smaller bays, that
                  set up and indent the country from Matagorda Bay, must become the
                  centre of a handsome trade. Where the most favorable point exists I might perhaps
                  give a shrewd guess, as I have given the subject some attentive study, but it is
                  not worth while to be ostracised by the ninety-nine towns that are out of the
                  question, so I will bless them all and keep silence.
            
            
               THE EBERLY HOUSE.
               I SAID every body was disappointed, but astonished would be the better word, to
                  find all their pre-conceptions so at fault on their arrival in Texas—not even
                  excepting those who had lived there before. A brace of lounging, good-natured,
                  indifferent boys, as they call their male servants from nine to
                  ninety, had taken charge of the baggage of a dozen or so of the passengers, and
                  marshalled us up to "our house," and in a
                  short time all were disposed of somewhere. The house was brimfull before, but in
                  Texas single gentlemen are the unprivileged order, and a gallant colonel was
                  ejected from his snuggery, and I installed in the very midst of his books, boxes
                  and newspapers, not to mention a whole clan of firearms of every size and degree,
                  as a matter of course. Instead of murmuring at the summary process of our
                  landlady, who, by the way, is not used to rebellion in her household, the
                  gentleman himself was the most active of any body in putting things in order for a
                  lady stranger. In such prompt and cheerful sacrifice of their personal comforts
                  and paid-for rights, the gentlemen of the Southern States shame the boasted
                  chivalry of the knightly ages, as well as the courtliest of the court-bred of our
                  days. It is a beautiful and distinguishing trait that this high-toned deference is
                  paid not merely to the young, beautiful and distinguished, who command politeness
                  any where, but to the poor, lowly and unknown. Every American, and most especially
                  every southerner, holds himself as a man, bound by his manhood to render every
                  protection and courtesy to woman. When I pressed my regret, therefore, at the
                  inconvenience I was imposing on the Colonel in thus abruptly entering upon the
                  possession of his private sanctum, he refused to think of it in any other light
                  than a thing of course.
               Eberly House and its lady proprietor are an epitome of Texas History. She was
                  among the first settlers; had faced with resolute cheerfulness all the dangers and
                  privations of its colonial infancy, and rejoiced as became a mother of the land
                  when Texas boldly set up an independent existence. And never did a young
                  housekeeper in the world of civilized nations, begin life in such utter
                  destitution of the usual household gear of governments. There was not a church, a
                  court-house, a prison, or an alms-house among the Anglo-American American
                  settlements of Texas, when the Lone Star put forth her banner of Independence. She
                  began with school-houses, and they soon grew into churches—with the
                  printing-press, which soon unfolded into a free republic, and a state constitution
                  that was the admiration of the highest statesmen of the country, for its liberal
                  forethought and wise adjustment.
            
            
               THE NORTH AND SOUTH
               A MILD, gentle-mannered Pennsylvanian intimated to me, in a quiet tone, under
                  cover of discussion between the ladies, his pleasure and surprise at the
                  well-dressed and comfortable appearance of the public—"even the colored persons
                  seem to be decent and contented!" The truth was, Mr. Grey had come out with his
                  head full of whips and chains, and his fear of being agonized by the shrieks and
                  sufferings of the slaves, had troubled excessively his inclination to live at the
                  south. The laughing, well-clad blacks, whose merry quips and gibes rung all day in
                  such careless unconstraint in and about every house, turned all these preparations
                  for indignant sympathy upside down. The poor gentleman was ready to be angry with
                  them all for being so happy in servitude, but there was no help for it. The race
                  in its present state of cultivation, cannot be reasoned into taking much heed of
                  any thing that does not strike forcibly on their animal nature. I reminded him of
                  this, but he shook his head doubtfully and sadly. "It is melancholy to see the
                  race set down to slavery, as if it were in the natural order of Providence." "I
                  was struck," continued Mr. Grey, "to observe at New Orleans, that if the
                  population there could be divided into two portions, one including all the thin,
                  anxious, care-worn faces, and the other all the jovial, contented, and well-fed
                     ones, there would be but a small
                  sprinkling of whites among the healthy and happy looking, and a still fainter
                  sprinkling of blacks in the class of troubled faces. Still I could come to no
                  opinion from a three days' visit to a slave city."
               "Did it ever occur to you," said a lady, suddenly turning from the window whence
                  she had been contemplating the bay as it unrolled a sheet of molten silver under
                  the noontide sun,—"Did it ever occur to you to arraign the plan of Divine Wisdom
                  in giving these Africans black skins, thick lips, flat noses, and woolly
                  hair?"
               "Certainly not," said the astonished northerner, "but permit me to inquire the
                  bearing of the question."
               "Only this," replied the lady. "It seems to me exceedingly difficult to separate
                  the facts, and determine how far this state of servitude is the inevitable
                  consequence of the physique and the undeveloped character of the negro, and as
                  such a part of the Divine plan. In short, how far it is the ordinance of heaven,
                  and how far it is the work of human sin, and a stumbling-block to the progress of
                  man."
               Mr. Grey's blue eyes opened wider and rounder, and I gave a closer heed, for here
                  the north and south, the principles of the one, and the practice of the other, had
                  their champions. It grew interesting.
               "Divine plan? Ordinances of Heaven? Surely, madam, you do not believe slavery was
                  created by God?" asked the gentleman, completely afloat at the audacity of such a
                  claim. "Surely you do not claim for it Divine parentage?"
               "Only as it is claimed for the docility of the elephant, the endurance of the
                  camel, the fleetness of the horse, and the fidelity of the dog. Thus far and no
                  farther; they have the qualities for man's service by divine creation, and whether
                  by divine appointment or not, man, sovereign of animals, and, above all, white
                  men—the sovereigns of the inferior human races—are endowed with the gift and power
                  to reduce them to his own uses."
               The clamor of the dinner-bell cut short this thoroughly characteristic argument
                  too soon for my satisfaction, but as we rose to attend the summons, Mr. Grey
                  inquired of the lady on what ground beyond difference of color she founded such an
                  absolute judgment of the inferiority of the blacks.
               "Three reasons," replied she, carelessly, as she descended to the dining-room. "A
                  negro nation has never attained eminence since the birth of history; next, no pure
                  negro ever made an important invention, not even an alphabet, neither has mankind
                  ever found among them a great teacher, whether as prophet, legislator, or
                  poet."
               Mr. Grey's reply was lost in the confusion of taking place, at table, but whatever
                  it was it gave a shade of thought to the countenance of his listener. Our English
                  passenger was so delighted with the fine oysters, and so astonished to meet roast
                  beef so juicy and tender, and turtle so perfectly delicious in this
                  out-of-the-world corner, that his charity bubbled up to the brim, and he observed,
                  in a semi-confidential tone, "There are many awkward things in the way, and many
                  excuses might be urged in palliation of Texas having committed herself to
                  slavery."
            
            
               GEOGRAPHICAL MORALITY.
               WITH Mr. Grey came out Mr. Jobson, an English gentleman, who had purchased in
                  Philadelphia the fourth part of the town of Arista, and was now in anxious quest
                  of his town site. He had asked every body on board the steamer about it, and the
                  more he inquired the more confused became his data and his ideas. He was the
                  personal friend and correspondent of a celebrated anti-slavery leader, and like
                  him was inclined to set down every fault
                  of church and state, as well as every mischance by land and sea, to the sin of
                  slaveholding. He intimated to me semi-confidentially that he imputed to that "the
                  general want of correctness in the land transactions of Texas," and especially the
                  "unfindability of Arista," on which a mischievous young Kentuckian was continually
                  condoling him. Mr. Grey was rather anti-slavery by the accident of his birth than
                  for any other reason. Apples and anti-slavery are the natural growth of his
                  latitude; oranges and negro servitude demand a warmer climate. He was almost
                  certain to change his views with his residence on coming south. He was an
                  American, and our morality on slaveholding topics is curiously geographical. It
                  hardens into ice and marble in New England, and softens like the winters, with
                  amazing rapidity and steadiness of progress as we move southward. With us it is a
                  real wide-spread and deep-rooted social fact, and we deal with it for what it is—a
                  political necessity and a constitutional existence.
               With our sturdy Englishman it is simply and purely an abstract question of right
                  and wrong, and he will never change his opinions, for he will never change his
                  point of view. At all costs and by whatever way, he desires instant emancipation
                  and the most perfect equality for the blacks in marriage relations, social
                  influence and political rights.
               That twenty millions of whites would certainly lose, and perhaps the three
                  millions of blacks not gain by this abrupt amalgamation of the races, is nothing
                  to the purpose; the principle is right in his estimation, and he thinks the right
                  principle should be put in action immediately, if it sows earthquakes.
            
            
               TEXAS LIVING.
               THE sharp, impatient clang of the dinner-bell called some of the party to their
                  first meal on Texas ground, and it was so abundant and excellent as to win the
                  commendation of even our critical Mr. Jobson, with the single reservation that the
                  venison and wild turkey had no justice in the cooking, a universal fault in
                  America, he observed; and I therefore record it, that my countrywomen may amend
                  their ways. In my ignorance I thought them excellently done, and if a fault there
                  was, the biscuits and coffee atoned amply for the deficiency. Fish, oysters and
                  turtle abound along the whole coast of Texas, and may be had for the taking; the
                  prairies swarm with fine cattle, and where cows may be had at seven or eight
                  dollars a head, and can run out and take care of themselves the whole year, it
                  must be a poor manager that cannot ensure milk and butter, beef and veal, and
                  working teams to his utmost desire. The woodlands that fringe every water-course,
                  more or less deeply, shelter droves of swine that, like the herds of cattle, ask
                  nothing better than to purvey their own subsistence. Poultry requires a little
                  better tendance, but they do well here, and so do sheep and goats, except exactly
                  on the coast. Add to this the facility of raising almost every variety of fruit
                  and vegetable, and it may be said, in one sentence, that the established farmers
                  of Texas, and of the western states of the Union generally, have abundant and
                  hospitable tables, and the traveller must be delicate and difficult indeed if he
                  is not suited with the fare. Almost the only really hard dinner that ever came
                  before me in Middle Texas, I encountered at a day's stage from San Antonio, and
                  that was served up in extra style. A handsome tureen, and china soup plates to
                  match, were set forth on irreproachable
                  damask, but the soup was only dirty salt and water, and the after course a very
                  small desolate island of bacon in a prairie of something green and greasy-looking,
                  mournfully flanked by a plate of very dry corn cakes. We did not venture upon the
                  eatables, but we cheerfully paid for the sight of the nice tureen and soup plates,
                  they were so refreshing. As no volume of reasonable capacity could hold an account
                  of the substantial comforts of the table I have shared in sunny, abounding Texas,
                  I take the traveller's right to dwell heavily on the per contra, and therefore
                  must mention, with emphasis, that to my taste, the most unsatisfactory food ever
                  set before me was that dinner of stone china.
               At Indianola, our cheer was of a more varied and digestible character, and our
                  party returned to the sitting parlor with the comfortable assurance that, whatever
                  other privations might be before them, settlers in Texas need not apprehend dying
                  of famine.
               The sea-breeze came up gratefully from the bay as it unrolled its glittering sheet
                  under the declining sun and we gathered in the balcony, in front, to arrange our
                  plans and admire the gorgeous canopy of crimson and gold that overhung his place
                  of departure.
               One day was given to Lavaca, and the next we took up our line of march to San
                  Antonio in a stage chartered for our own private service. Mr. Jobson and his
                  friend engaged a smaller carriage, in which they proposed to make an extensive
                  circle of exploration—Mr. Grey to select a promising situation for trade, and Mr.
                  Jobson to prosecute his voyage for the discovery of the unknown whereabouts of the
                  city of Arista, of which his only landmark was a "certain blaze on a live oak
                  tree." When he effects the discovery he will colonize it with knowing Lincolnshire
                  graziers or sell out to a company; but, at the last advices, it was still
                  unfound.
            
            
               A CONVERT.
               THE plan of travel being settled, the chat fell back on Texas and her most
                  prolific staples, sugar, cotton, paper cities, cattle and slaves. It was amusing
                  to trace back the gradual change in the views of my excellent friend, Mr. Grey. In
                  Philadelphia he was held to be an able, and doubtless was a sincere, advocate of
                  immediate emancipation. He had almost persuaded our gifted and ardent friend,
                  George Lippard—"he with eye of light and soul of fire"—to write one of his burning
                  romances, of which each sentence is a scathing sermon to oppressors, and make its
                  heroine a fugitive colored girl. Gentle George, however, could not engage in the
                  work, as he was already in harness against the Tyranny of Capital, and had full
                  employment for lance and shield. Two months at Washington, and a most exemplary
                  and believing attention to the debates of Congress, did for Mr. Grey what speeches
                  in legislative bodies rarely do, simplified the matter, and modified his opinions.
                  He was disposed to give over school-mastering the south on its home duties, and,
                  with a more believing trust, leave emancipation to the progress of light and God's
                  Providence. These were his words, and as he floated down the Ohio, on one side of
                  which slavery is wicked and illegal, and on the other proper and lawful, he
                  continued to grow in the faith that each State should be left to regulate its own
                  morals. When he was down as far as Memphis, with slave-cultivated cotton fields on
                  either bank, and slaveholding gentlemen on either side of him at table, and lovely
                  slave-tended damsels glancing in beauty opposite him, he threw off an item or two
                  more, with his cumbersome overcoat, now too heavy for the climate, and decided, in
                  his secret mind, that it would be highly
                  absurd to insist on breaking up the Union for the sake of helping such pretty
                  girls to black husbands, and he began to think this would be the prominent results
                  of the wholesale levelling system. At Natchez he concluded that, with an equal
                  population of ignorant blacks and prejudiced whites, some laws of
                  self-preservation might be excusable in the existing social state, and fully
                  excused the whites for so much of their code as was necessary to guard against
                  insurrection and bloodshed. He had gradually discarded the courteous phrase of
                  "colored brethren" for the pithy shortness of "blacks," and finally landed at New
                  Orleans perfectly tranquil, if not slightly indifferent, about the "spread of
                  slavery," against which he had been so actively and sincerely eloquent five months
                  before. His northern anti-slavery morality had unconsciously, and quite honestly,
                  too, softened and expanded in the warm rays of the southern sun. I am ashamed to
                  confess it, but, on that subject, there is an enormous capability of expansion in
                  American consciences; they are like that peculiarly useful article of which we
                  make shoes and life-preservers—they stretch indefinitely when they come among
                  cotton fields, and melt altogether in the ardent heat of sugar and rice
                  plantations. But, then, we are a great people and extend our power—therefore, why
                  not our consciences—over a vast reach of climate, latitude and production.
               Mr. Jobson had hoped, on starting from the north, that his young friend, on
                  witnessing the whole iniquity of slavery, face to face, would be strengthened up
                  to the firm, uncompromising attitude of the British platform—perfect equality and
                  entire amalgamation; and when he saw the hands steadily travelling backward on the
                  dial, he could not conceal his astonishment and dismay. What if the Union does
                  part in fragments in the strong convulsion, let the cure be instantly applied and
                  slavery expelled from the system. Children in medicine talk of patience and time
                  curing the cancer and saving the frame entire, but he said cut off and cast out
                  the cankered limb.
               A lady, northern born, but transplanted to the south by a happy marriage,
                  interposed the observation that in cutting off the Southern States from the family
                  of the north, slavery would not be cured the sooner, and that in no case were the
                  unaffected members of the Union in danger of taking the disease. "Cast them out
                  all the same as leprous sinners, unless they will quit their sins and embrace
                  their colored brethren as equals," insisted Mr. Jobson.
               But, said Mr. Grey, half ashamed of his conversion, and ashamed still more to see
                  the inconsistency of his old position, "Absolute equality, this marrying and
                  giving in marriage, between opposite races, is what not one of the Northern States
                  would desire or consent to, and still less would the Southern States tolerate it,
                  for the number of blacks is so great that half a dozen States would soon be
                  represented in Congress by colored delegations."
               "Surely, your free States would not object to meeting and mingling on equal terms
                  with the representatives of the race for whose elevation they had labored so
                  earnestly?" asked Mr. Jobson, warmly. "I think they would," said Mr. Grey,
                  coloring; "yes, undoubtedly they would. We demand political equality for the
                  Africans among us, but object to inter-marriage as deteriorating and inexpedient
                  for the whites."
               Mr. Jobson thrust his hands in his pockets, and choked off with difficulty a low
                  whistle. "Well, upon my word, Mr. Grey," he broke out at last, "your distinctions
                  are too nice for me. You are excessively anxious to give the colored race their
                  rights, but equally resolute against the natural and inevitable consequences of
                  their possession. Political equality and social amalgamation are twin sisters, and
                  if you insist on one how can you reject the other?"
               
               Mr. Grey murmured something about prejudices of color, inexpediency and late
                  hours, and withdrew to his bedroom, apparently unwilling to continue the argument,
                  and reluctant to avow the fact that he was already a convert to southern
                  opinions.
               I cautioned the stalwart negrophilo,—to borrow a
                  word the Cubans have lately coined,—not to be rash in his arguments, for they
                  might be misunderstood at the south, where it was a stringent necessity of
                  self-preservation to suppress all discussions that could tend to unbridle the
                  tiger that sleeps by their hearths. And so the "good night" passed around, and all
                  went their ways to dream of other scenes and other subjects for the morrow.
            
            
               THE ROAD.
               WE paused but one day at Lavaca, and that was passed in-doors, for it was one of
                  those days of unintermitted sunshine in which a Texas March is as rich as a New
                  York June. The day fled agreeably, for the intelligence and polish of Mrs. S.'s
                  family were equal in tone and interest to the requirements of good society
                  anywhere. And here I may observe that persons from the olden States, and, still
                  more, those from Europe, are astonished to find in a new country such a mass of
                  mental force and acquirement as they encounter in Texas, without considering that
                  the advantages of its fertile, well-placed domain, and the absolutely nominal
                  price of land, are calculated to draw hither the choicest enterprise of the
                  enterprising Union; not to mention that it was also, for a time, the most pleasant
                  and convenient refuge in the world for such gentlemen as, by any chance, came to
                  have a falling out with the laws at home. It is not now, neither has it ever been,
                  the right home for the baser class of criminals nals. Thieves have to turn honest
                  here, or leave the country. Nobody can thrive in any of the leading branches of
                  their ancient and extensive profession, but a few border Mexicans in the horse and
                  cattle line, with here and there a small lawyer who pilfers under license of
                  statute, as in other countries.
               After we left Lavaca, and had leisurely rolled some fifteen or twenty miles over
                  the track to Victoria, we were joined at dinner by Mr. Grey and Mr. Jobson, who
                  had fully kept pace with our four-horse stage in their light carriage. They were
                  both enchanted with everything. The country, the climate, the people, all came in
                  for such a plenteous bounty of praise that I fairly changed sides, and was forced
                  to remind them of the inconveniences they might expect, instead of, as before,
                  dwelling on the advantages that lay within their grasp. They looked around at the
                  tidy comfort of the room we were in turned over some books that filled three or
                  four well-arranged shelves, glanced through the open windows at the boundless
                  vista of green, rolling prairie gemmed at intervals with trees just bursting into
                  foliage, and then sat down before the snow-white cloth to praise the golden
                  butter, delicate batter cakes, and nicely dressed chickens, of our well-mannered
                  hostess. The country between Matagorda Bay and Victoria is almost Belgic in its
                  level and rich repose. Thence on to San Antonio it is park-like in its varied yet
                  tranquil beauty. More green and fertile it cannot be, but more rolling and
                  picturesque it is, though rarely rising to the dignity of precipitous hills. The
                  road is wholly inartificial, and just winds where the chances of travel led the
                  track over the immense expanse, like a huge dust-colored serpent taking his own
                  time and comfort over the carpet of grass and flowers. In the rainy season, of
                  course, this road through a rich alluvial region, becomes heavy in mud, and makes
                  travelling very hard upon the poor horses; yet even in blithe March, when the roads were as hard and smooth as a
                  Macadam street, we only moved on at the rate of thirty or thirty-five miles in a
                  day, and were five of them in getting to San Antonio.
               The first two nights out our acquaintances slept in different hostelries from
                  those we stopped at—for in Victoria and other towns there are more taverns than
                  one—but on the third night we continued in company on from our dining-house.
            
            
               A PIONEER MOTHER.
               THAT was kept by an excellent dame, whose land extended like a small German
                  principality, a mile or two in every direction from her log castle. She was united
                  to her third or fourth husband, I forget which; but I recollect that the first was
                  killed by the Indians while defending his homestead; the second fell in defence of
                  Texas, at the Alamo, when Travis and his band resolved to hold it until no man was
                  left to haul down the Lone Star, and deliver the fort to the Mexican besiegers.
                  She observed quite philosophically, that it was well enough for single men, who
                  had good horses and no families, to run away from the Indians, but when people had
                  stock, and children, and house plunder, and a stout log cabin to cover them, the
                  shortest way was for the mother to sit down by the fire and run bullets for her
                  old man to give to the Indians. "There is a heap less trouble in it, and less
                  scare too, than to be scattering off, and letting the hogs and cattle scatter off,
                  every time the Indians come about." So said, and so acted the old lady, and, sure
                  enough, there she is at last planted safely and comfortably in the midst of her
                  flocks and herds like one of Homer's rural princes.
               Mr. Jobson was much taken with this remnant of the early history of Texas, and
                  somewhat in violation of his implied pledge of truce, he endeavored to requite her
                  information by devoting to her use some of his lights on the subject of slavery,
                  and the equalization of the black and white races. He eulogized the courage and
                  industry which had made her the mistress of such a homestead, and then went on to
                  draw a comparison between the servitude of wages and the servitude of inheritance.
                  It was so profound, so logical, and so philanthropic, that Channing, had he heard
                  it, would have hailed him as a disciple, and Frederick Douglas as a brother; but
                  our stout-hearted, practical border-mother only opened her eyes wider and rounder,
                  as she drifted farther and farther from his meaning. His long words were too heavy
                  for her dictionary range, and generally overshot the mark, but all the same she
                  liked the grand resounding tones, and listened with devout attention until a
                  chance ball made a breach in the wall and let in some light, and then she flew to
                  the defence.
               Mr. Jobson had, at last, sailed back to the shoals under her eye, when her rounded
                  off his essay by a sort of general axiom that, as suffering and ignorance were the
                  only difficulties in the way of real equality, the whites had but to free their
                  slaves and educate them, to make them in every way like brothers of the same
                  family. This was throwing the shell into the very magazine of the prejudices of a
                  woman "born in Tennessee, raised in Alabama, married in Mississippi, and settled
                  in Texas."
               "No, sir," she said, in the resolute tone of one who sees the thing through and
                  through, and cannot be talked out of her mind. "No, sir, there is no sense in
                  that, no sense at all. If a poor white woman like me sends her children to school,
                  and has them learn the same books and ways as the President's children, and if they are as bright and
                  well behaved as the President's children, they are just as good, and all of the
                  same color; for I reckon their father and I are as white as any body; but all the
                  schooling in the world won't grammar that child's wool into straight hair,"
                  pointing to a shining black urchin who had come to the door to take a full and
                  satisfactory survey of the strangers.
               "But, my dear madam," said Mr. Jobson, not a little surprised at the sudden waking
                  up of the storm, "consider that these differences are merely physical."
               "Physic can't cure it," replied the unconvinceable dame. "No medicine can doctor
                  away that black skin or woolly head. No, sir, all the plasters and poultices in
                  the world, nor all the colleges either, wouldn't make them thick lips, and that
                  flat nose, into a likely white boy's face. Physicking indeed!"
               "Not into a white boy's face, but the same teaching and encouragement might make
                  him the equal of a white boy," insisted Mr. Jobson.
               "At that rate it would be just as well for the white folks, if all colors were put
                  into one dish and shook together in one mess, and I don't believe in that
                  doctrine," replied his antagonist, in high disdain; and she set about clearing off
                  the table, and with it the argument, with an air of abated respect for her guest's
                  eloquence.
               "Did you ever hear such narrow and bigoted ideas?" observerd Mr. Jobson, as he
                  parted with us to join Mr. Grey in their own vehicle. His only answer was a gentle
                  admonition for provoking such discussions in a slave country, where the people
                  were almost absurdly sensitive and irritable on those points.
               We waited a few minutes longer to hear the opinions of the other party, and were
                  pleased to find her equanimity fully restored, and the more completely as she
                  remarked, half in the way of question, that the gentleman was likely a minister,
                  or something of that sort, whose head was turned by hard study.
               "Only to think," she said, laughing at the recollection, "that a little physicking
                  will make a white gentleman of a nigger boy. Well, the Lord above knows what is
                  best, and he has fixed it all his own way. He has made the blacks and the whites
                  as he pleased, and gave them their places without asking a crazy doctor where he
                  should put them." With this reference of the whole matter to the will of Heaven,
                  we exchanged farewells, and resumed our way. It was the last argument but one that
                  Mr. Jobson ventured upon, and there he was overwhelmed and silenced by the
                  audacious flight of his antagonist, who boldly averred that the negroes were
                  fitted, and, as it were, ordained, in the creative scale of arrangement, to an
                  inferior existence by their conformation, like camels, horses, and elephants. "I
                  think self-interest and a broiling sun discomposes the brains of southern men,"
                  said the astounded Englishman, and this conviction, far more than personal
                  prudence, tended to wean him from these discussions.
            
            
               SAN ANTONIO.
               WE drew up, on the fifth day from the coast, in front of a spacious and handsome
                  house at San Antonio. The grounds were ample, neatly laid out, and beautifully
                  encompassed by a curve of the river, but it was a new place, and the trees and
                  shrubbery were not large enough for shade. Two or three ladies, whose dress and
                  manners did not belie their rank, and an officer or two in undress, were chatting
                  in the shade of the broad piazza. With a
                  more flowing abundance of vines and flowers it might all have passed—house,
                  grounds and company—for a suburban London villa, occupied by some retired
                  officers, and I mourned that we had parted with Mr. Jobson a day back on the road,
                  for it was a sight to charm his neat and cosey taste.
               Here a stout mule carriage and our servants awaited us, and we but permitted
                  ourselves a few days to see the old missions and the far—famed crystal
                  springs—from which the San Antonio gushes at once a full grown river—before we
                  entered upon our trip across the belt of uninhabited and Indian—haunted country
                  that borders the Rio Bravo. Another lady—Mrs. C. the wife of the senior proprietor
                  of Eagle Pass—was to be of the company. Our train consisted, therefore, of two
                  strong, well appointed mule carriages, protected by our two gentlemen and three
                  armed servants on horseback, one of whom led, with the saddle ready to be adjusted
                  at a moment's warning, an easy-paced pony, to diversify my mode of travel when I
                  tired of a covered carriage.
               We are now leaving behind us the broad, fertile zone of southern Texas, in which
                  negro servitude prevails, and glancing by the edge of that healthful, picturesque
                  middle region that the Germans have come over from fatherland to make free soil,
                  and dispart from Texas, somewhere about 1860. At last we enter upon the grassy
                  solitudes that border the Rio Bravo. Here is met a system of servitude new and
                  alien to the sentiment of the United States, but it may take root, acclimate
                  itself, and flourish on our soil, as is said of certain noxious insects with which
                  the old world has gifted our grain fields. So far we have made no gain out of
                  enslaving the Indians. We have slaughtered the red race, driven them from their
                  groves, buried their history and traditions in the graves of a hundred
                  exterminated tribes, yet we have failed to turn their blood and sweat into
                  dollars. We have conquered their lands wherever we fancied them worth having, but
                  have fallen far short of the Spaniards in success. In taking the soil they seized
                  also the native lords of the soil, and turned them in with whip and chain to till
                  it for the benefit of the conquerors. We Anglo—Americans have not managed so well;
                  our Indian tribes will drink our fire—water and die, but they will not give their
                  limbs to our service, nor bequeath to us their children for slaves—stubborn
                  creatures that they are—so we have to be content with killing them off and taking
                  all their lands. Like good Christians we resign ourselves to do with—out the bones
                  and sinews of the red race—since they are not to be had—and take care of the
                  rest.
               Such thoughts forced me to look history in the eye, when Victor, our confidential
                  servant, and a man of pure Indian descent, stood in silent, motionless respect to
                  receive the order of preparation for the journey. He was slight, rather
                  well-formed, easy and lithe in his movements, but with the serious, self-contained
                  air that characterizes his race. His dark face was seamed with the small pox, but
                  it spoke intelligence and courage, and his eye wore a winning expression of
                  attachment and confidence when it turned on his master. In a few, but remarkably
                  well-chosen words, Victor intimated that he understood his orders, and then
                  disappeared with noiseless step. In the future my sole trust for servants,
                  domestic attendance, and the most part of my human companionship, is in these
                  tamed Indians. Well, I rather like the prospect.
               The early evening was soft, fresh and star-lit, and I remained in my room alone
                  for an hour, musing over a thousand confused fragments of the past and present,
                  when my attention was attracted by two figures in deep chat, a short distance from
                  the open window. One I fancied, and correctly, to be Victor; the other was a larger person, and as
                  I could readily observe in the clear obscure, an Indian of fine and graceful
                  proportions. Victor was waiting to speak to his master as he came out from supper,
                  and as I soon gathered from their conversation, his companion had seen him as he
                  entered the garden for that purpose, and made himself known as an old friend. At
                  first I only noted the flowing elegance of their mutual compliments and the rigid
                  politeness with which each entitled the other Señor, but the stranger's remarks
                  soon absorbed my entire attention. It was a moving tale, and opened to me an
                  unexpected view of border life. I give it now, though in fact it was only
                  completed by after inquiry and information.
            
            
               THE INDIAN SLAVE.
               SEVERO VALDEZ and our Victor had been scholars together in a free school attached
                  to some convent in their distant and fruitful Guadalaxara. They had both learned
                  to read, and Victor even to write, when they were parted, Severo to follow his
                  parents into servitude, for they had fallen in debt, and were sold by debtor's law
                  as peons to the magnificent estate of Santa Merced (Holy Mercy), many leagues this
                  side of his native city. Victor came eastward in the service of a Mexican officer,
                  and after many wanderings, found himself at Matamoras some two years before the
                  Mexican war. Here he met again his old class-mate, Severo. The hacienda of Holy
                  Mercy was one of those vast peon-holding properties peculiar to Mexico, and even
                  in that land it had a bad reputation for giving over-allowance of work and an
                  under-allowance of food. The peck of corn allowed per week to the peons, or slaves, for debt, was of two
                  or three years' old stock and often alive with insects, as the fresh corn of the
                  current year had to be stored. A thousand head of cattle ranged on the outskirts
                  of the estate, and seven thousand sheep and goats divided with them the pastures,
                  but the peons only tasted meat about twice a month, and then each pound served out
                  was charged to them, to swell their debt of servitude. Severo endured his lot
                  while his mother lived, but when she died he broke away. His situation of vaquero, or mounted herdsman, gave him a fine start in
                  advance, and he was fifty miles on the road to freedom before his flight was
                  announced to the overseer of the Holy Mercy. The poor old father was suspected of
                  counselling his escape, and in his rage the mayor domo handled the old peon so
                  cruelly that he laid down on his mat and never left it again. In a week from
                  Severo's departure the other peons dug a hole, rolled up the corpse in his ragged
                  mat for coffin and winding-sheet, and cast it in the earth without further
                  ceremony, for such is the usual peon custom of burial. All this, when he came to
                  hear it, did not increase Severo's desire to return to the sweets of Holy Mercy;
                  and he worked, starved and travelled forward until he reached Saltillo. There he
                  fell sick, and after enduring his situation with Indian fortitude for two weeks,
                  the peon who lent him all he had to share—a corner of his hovel for shade and an
                  ox hide for a bed—induced him to sell himself to a baker of the place for the
                  necessary medicine and sustenance. He served his master, the baker, with fidelity
                  and good will, for he was treated kindly, but the fear of being reclaimed by his
                  first owner haunted him continually, and he was more than glad when it was
                  proposed to transfer his services to a muleteer bound for Laredo. To Laredo he
                  went, still in peon servitude however, for it is a sort of miracle for a bound
                  debtor to regain his freedom, and there he ranged the banks of the Rio Bravo in
                  his original capacity of vaquero quero or
                  herdsman. Here begins the entanglement of his story. An American merchant of
                  Matamoras wished a reliable and competent man to go down to the coast with his
                  mule train; and by a triple arrangement between Severo, his master and the
                  merchant, the active and faithful young peon was to serve six months for his debt
                  of $30, and then become free when the American went to New Orleans in the spring.
                  At Matamoras he chanced to encounter Victor, and renewed with him the friendship
                  of younger days. Victor was about to go up the river to Laredo, and was charged by
                  his friend with many messages to a peon family to which it turned out Severo was
                  united by the strongest bonds. He loved deeply the young niece of a Laredo peon,
                  Josefa, who was free and appeared likely to remain so, as she was active,
                  industrious, and a good seamstress. To earn her hand in legitimate marriage was
                  the great object of his life, and to become free himself was such a helpful and
                  desirable step, that he consented joyfully to six months' servitude, including,
                  also, a season of yellow fever, which he was expected to stay over and above his
                  time, during the absence of his new master in the United States. Victor, while at
                  Laredo, discharged punctually his duty to his friend, and even wrote letters for
                  Josefa, informing Severo from time to time of her steady remembrance. Meantime
                  Severo completed his probation, and returned in less than a year, well dressed for
                  his condition, and much improved by his residence among Americans. He hastened to
                  claim his bride. Unhappily she had fallen into peonage by some misfortune, but
                  Severo did not hesitate to become surety for her debt of $15, and make her his
                  wife. This exposed him to be peonized himself any day, but his work was mainly
                  devoted to the service of the creditor, who kept his own open account with them,
                  advancing, while they were at work for him, the beans and corn for the daily bread
                  of the couple. They settled from the first on the east side of the river, and
                  when, at the close of the war, all the hither bank was recognized as United States
                  territory, they became, by the express terms of the treaty, American citizens.
                  This, which should have been a sure guarantee of liberty and protection, cast the
                  unhappy family into the most incurable misery. I would state the case distinctly,
                  for it presents what most Americans will find it hard to believe, that our country
                  permits on her border an atrocious and peculiar system of.
            
            
               KIDNAPPING
               WHEN hostilities first kindled with Mexico, Severo entered into the employ of a
                  muleteer, who continued near and with the army during that memorable first
                  campaign in which such splendid victories were won to no particular end, and such
                  massive movements were so bravely pressed for no particular object. This service
                  kept Severo far from home most of the war season, but more than once the fond
                  husband mounted his horse and rode all night through a dangerous region to pass
                  one day with Josefa and his child; and then he would repeat the same rough ride
                  the next night, and report himself at sunrise ready for his usual duties. About
                  the conclusion of the war, the knowledge of their citizenship, and the enhanced
                  security and prosperity they hoped to attain under the American laws, began to
                  make a deep impression upon the Indian families on our side of the Rio Bravo, and
                  on none more than the freedom-loving Severo. To educate his first-born, his boy
                  Marcos, to the stature of a free-born American was a dream of delight to his soul.
                  When peace was proclaimed he made an eager, hurried visit to his home at Laredo,
                  and then hastened to the healthy and romantic town of Corpus Christi, to solicit permanent employment from the celebrated
                  Col. Kinney, the proprietor of a domain exactly three times as large, and ten
                  times as fair, as the principality of Queen Victoria's father-in-law. The
                  sorrow-stricken Indian returned to find his home desolate. Although American
                  citizens by law, by service, and by loyalty, the Mexican hawks' had not feared to
                  swoop down upon our soil, and clutch away his helpless ones in his absence. The
                  thrice-paid creditor of Josefa had conveyed her by threats and force to the
                  Mexican side of the river, where there was little trouble in having her assigned
                  to him as a debtor-slave. Her young American-born son was consigned to the same
                  fate to meet the cost of bringing him up, and thus with every form of Mexican law
                  they were sent, mother and child, to wear out their lives in the harshest slavery
                  known on this continent.
               Severo appealed to an officer of the United States army for redress—it was not in
                  his line of duty. He applied to the civil judge—he could not pursue the offence
                  into a foreign country; this provision, so necessary to border tranquillity,
                  having been overlooked in the haste of making the peace treaty. In his despair of
                  other help, and perhaps with a lingering faith in the sanctity of his American
                  citizenship, Severo set forth to have an interview with Josefa and her master, and
                  if he could make no other offer for her freedom, he resolved to give his own body
                  to redeem his wife and child. He had a few dollars in money and a good horse;
                  perhaps he thought he could prevail on Don Matias to accept them—as they were of
                  more value than the original debt—together with a year or two of their united
                  service, and then dismiss them all in freedom. It was an illusive hope. Instead of
                  listening to his proffers of triple payment, Don Matias coolly claimed the horse
                  as the estray of some friend or other, and seized Severo as his own lawful peon.
                  Severo heard the sentence of the alcalde in the stern, unmoved silence of his much
                  enduring race, and whatever he nourished in his heart, no severity of labor or
                  suffering wrested a complaint from his lips. He toiled and watched more than a
                  year before an opening for escape offered for Josefa, and without her he would not
                  leave. At last, when Don Matias returned near the bank of the Rio Bravo, and
                  placed them all on a rancho, or cattle farm, not far from Mier, the time of
                  deliverance seemed at hand. Patience and courage brought a favorable moment for
                  the attempt, and it was made. The river was gained, was crossed; the whole family
                  stood free citizens on the soil of the Union; some miles were travelled in the
                  direction of the town of Brownsville—for Severo had learned to fear the absence of
                  protection at Laredo—and the happy family laid down to rest in the serene
                  freshness of the open sky. They folded themselves in their recovered liberty as in
                  a garment of joy, and slept without fear. Alas, for the weakness or obscurity of
                  our laws! their pursuers had followed keenly on their track, and before the dawn
                  they were overtaken, bound, and re-conveyed to the Mexican bank and a more
                  embittered slavery.
               Four months of suffering, distinguished only by the death of their boy, again
                  terminated in the escape of Severo by a desperate flight, in which Josefa could
                  not share. This time he did not pause until he reached the interior town of San
                  Antonio, whence he proposes to dispatch the money for the purchase of his wife,
                  if, indeed, her broken health holds out until he can earn the amount.
            
            
               
               MISSION OF SAN JOSE.
               MY heart was still echoing to the sad notes of peon bondage, and heavy with the
                  prophecy of wrong, exile and extermination to the Red Race, when I stepped into
                  the carriage to visit the ruins of San José. A ride of five miles over the
                  pastoral plains that environ San Antonio brought us before what was once the
                  beloved school and abundant home of hundreds of reclaimed Indians. Silence now
                  reigns in the desolated mission. We drew up before the broken arcades of the
                  cloisters, and glanced hastily at the plan. The ground floor had been divided and
                  occupied, as is generally seen in religious houses, by a refectory, or dining
                  hall, and the other larger rooms of the community. The second story was devoted to
                  the cells or sleeping apartments of the fathers. They were plain, substantial, and
                  reasonably commodious, all opening in a line on the gallery over the ground
                  arcades. We then went round to the church front, to observe if it could be true,
                  as we had heard, that parties of volunteers for the Mexican war had in mere
                  turbulence of spirit defaced the old sculptures that dated back almost to the
                  first Christian settlements. On one side of the old carved doorway stands the
                  statue of Joseph, "the just man," the husband of Mary. He is the San José to whom
                  the church is dedicated. On the other side in a corresponding niche is Mary and
                  her child Jesus. All these figures have been shot at, disfigured and mutilated by
                  parties of Americans, who thus evinced their dislike to bigotry by a bigotry still
                  more intense. They proved the soundness of their Christian and republican
                  instruction, by a dishonest waste of others' property and a spiteful intolerance
                  of others' creeds.
               The country around lay in green and tranquil repose, scarcely changed in aspect
                  since, two centuries ago, the first fathers of the mission astonished the cannibal
                  idolaters of this region with the tidings of the Christ who died on the cross for
                  the salvation of man. They saw the image of the Redeemer crowned with thorns, and
                  were made to understand how the cross is the symbol of atonement. From his
                  manger-cradle through all his miracles and trials, to his radiant ascension, the
                  divine life and mission of the crucified Saviour was laid before them, in pictures
                  so clear and vivid that, to the untutored children of the forest, these paintings
                  were but little less miraculous than the acts they represented. These lessons were
                  repeated in processions, and enforced continually on heart and soul by the solemn
                  ritual of the church. In this is one of the secrets of their wonderful missionary
                  success. They clothed their teachings in forms of life, and voiced them in melody.
                  Then the community system surrounded their lives on earth with peace and
                  abundance, while it gave them tranquil preparation for the life to come. If this
                  government would shelter and ration the tribes that it is slaughtering in cold
                  blood by paying them annuities in rum; if it would gather their children in Manual
                  Labor Schools instead of leaving them to demoralize and waste away in idle,
                  untaught vagabondism, it would cost the treasury no more, and would certainly
                  accord better with the missionary spirit of our people. We who send two or three
                  hundred thousand dollars a year to enlighten the heathen of Asia should not refuse
                  a tithe of this aid to our heathen at home. The less so, it is to be hoped, as we
                  have deprived them of all things else, and so hemmed them up in little barren
                  corners of what was once their heritage, that they must accept civilization or
                  death—they have no other choice at our hands.
            
            
               
               COMMUNITIES.
               THIS way is open to us, and there is no other in which we can redeem the two
                  unhappy races who are in contact with white domination on this continent. Assign
                  them homes and give them industrial teachers—I am speaking now of the Red Race,
                  for to the African, colonization abroad is the only resource, but on the same
                  principle, of community and patriarchal guidance—assign sufficient and permanent
                  domains to the tribes still in existence, use the money which the Federal
                  Government is expending upon them for their hurt, in establishing comfortable
                  quarters for those too old to learn, where they should receive soldiers' rations,
                  and cloth and blankets to their taste, up to the value of a soldier's clothing,
                  all this to be issued to them at their homes and no where else, and in no other
                  form than that of subsistence and raiment. Let their own chiefs report whether
                  these duties be fully observed, and not made the speculation of Indian agents.
               The youth of the tribe to be collected and taught letters, morals and industry, at
                  permanent and systematic schools. As they advance in years they can till the land
                  and man the workshops for the community, on such terms of reward as shall be just
                  and beneficial to the general weal, but always under the joint supervision of
                  government and their own chiefs, until civilization and the capacity of
                  self-government shall have taken firm root. These tribes would be nurseries for
                  such a powerful, efficient and economical border cavalry as is the especial want
                  of this republic.
               How grievous it is to hear a senator reply to this petition for an effective
                  guardianship of the Red Race, that "it would be so troublesome." We can plunder,
                  but we cannot protect, and at the same cost we find it more acceptable to
                  exterminate than to make reparation.
               It cannot be said that it is uncongenial to the wild nature of the Indians to
                  live, labor, and be instructed in a settled community. So far from this being
                  true, there was near half a million of these wandering tribes collected in the
                  course of a century in the various Missions which dotted, like islands blooming in
                  the desert, the whole expanse of wilderness from one end to the other of our
                  double continent. A line of these Missions stretched from California to the
                  Mississippi a hundred and fifty years back, and diverging in the great valley in
                  two lines of light, one crossed the peninsula of Florida to meet the Atlantic, and
                  the other boldly pressed up the Ohio until its rays illumined the dark forests of
                  the northern lakes. In South America a beautiful and flourishing state arose in
                  the wilderness under the hands of the Jesuits, so beautiful and flourishing indeed
                  that the kings of Europe grew hungry for its spoils. They drove away the
                  missionary fathers, and blackened their fame with a thousand falsehoods in order
                  to seize the more freely their helpless prey. Like this was the fate of San Jose,
                  and other missionary stations in Mexico. Their greedy rulers saw these estates
                  were well-cultivated and profitable domains, the Indian proselytes most convenient
                  slaves, and as such they were too tempting to escape the merciless grasp of a
                  soldier despotism. In that one sentence is told the fate of the chain of desolate
                  habitations that extend from New Mexico to California, and of a hundred thousand
                  peons, whose fathers thus fell into bondage and transmitted to them an inheritance
                  of misery.
               Doubtless these old fathers were in the wrong, since popular opinion says so, and
                  popular opinion ought to be reverenced as infallible, albeit it called vehemently
                  for the crucifixion of the Prince of Peace, and took Barabbas the thief to its arms. Doubtless they were criminal in
                  not teaching the poor Indians a better Christianity than they knew themselves.
                  Doubtless the uninstructed children of the wilderness deserved slavery and death
                  for making processions in honor of Mary, the mother of Jesus, and asking her
                  intercession, when they should have been inspired to address their prayers
                  directly to himself; but it was still something better than their old sacrifices
                  of prisoners of war. Doubtless they sinned deeply in cherishing the relics of
                  Christian martyrs, almost as devoutly as we would a button of Gen. Taylor's
                  battle—garments at Palo Alto, or a cast shoe—string of Bonaparte or Victoria, but
                  even this was better than the usages of their ancient faith—to tear open the
                  breasts of living men and cast the quivering heart, yet warm in blood, in offering
                  to their grim, monster idols.
            
            
               OUR TRIP.
               ON St. Patrick's day our company mustered for the trip across the broad prairies
                  and untrodden hills that unroll between San Antonio and the Bravo. Our two
                  carriages, three mounted servants, led mules, and escort of friends made a gay and
                  joyous cavalcade. The sides of our carriages bristled with fire-arms, like a brace
                  of small travelling arsenals. Our two gentlemen never laid aside their trusty
                  six-shooters, for even in sleep they were under the head within prompt touch. At
                  night, the baggage was taken out and embanked under the carriages, and our beds
                  made upon their comfortable floors, for they were on the ambulance pattern of
                  vehicles, strong, spacious, and fit for all weathers. Victor, who had decided to
                  enter my service for the future—of his own free judgment and without my
                  asking,—had charge of an active, docile black pony, that bore my saddle in case I
                  desired to exchange my seat in the covered carriage for an occasional canter over
                  the tempting flower-embroidered plains. In his anxiety to be generally useful he
                  had piled on my saddle a small tower of kitchen-commodities for the road; but at
                  the first halt we amended that, and Victor and Chino held their after-way a very
                  respectable and satisfied-looking palfrey and squire of dames.
               At the little streamlet Rosita we stopped to lunch on Mrs. C.'s delicate biscuit
                  and cold chicken. There we bade farewell to our escort of friends, who turned
                  their horses' heads towards San Antonio, while we launched forth on the
                  interminable prairie. To me it was a holiday of delight. The country is one
                  wide-rolling, ever-varying ocean of verdure, flashing back in golden smiles the
                  radiant glance of the sun, while the fresh breeze tossed and waved the changeful
                  tresses of bright flowers in frolic gaiety. Through the day we seemed to have all
                  this world of beauty to ourselves as our train wound—the only sign of human
                  existence—over its broad, silent expanse, but nightfall brought hints of darker
                  omen.
            
            
               INDIAN SIGNS
               THE sun was low, and our eyes were wandering admiringly over a small tarn
                  encircled in copse-wood, and gleaming serene and clear as a beryl in its emerald
                  setting, when suddenly parting through the thicket we came upon some broken and
                  abandoned carts. The experienced eyes of our gentlemen instantly detected marks of
                  Indian handiwork. We know now that an unhappy family met there a bloody end, all
                  but a young daughter or two who were led to a more horrible fate. Some years
                  hence, when it would be more wise and merciful to leave them with their Indian lords, our government will make atonement
                  for its present negligence by bringing back these girls—with many a ringing
                  flourish of dollars and trumpets—to kindred who will be ashamed to receive them,
                  and who will condemn them to a life of neglect and abasement.
               Scores of captive women and children are now sinking to this miserable lot because
                  Congress would spend the time in talking economy, and wasting money
                  on useless, and worse than useless, missions of compliment to foreign royalties,
                  when it should have occupied itself in providing for the survey of national
                  communications, and the defence of this Indian-infested border. I say the
                     survey of national highways, for there is no need of opening the
                  sluices and flooding the country with corrupt contracts to construct them; only
                  tell the people where run the best routes from sea to sea, and assure them that
                  the government will protect these national channels of communication, and trade
                  and travel will find the way to work it straight and smooth as soon as it will pay
                  dividends.
               Our course lay nearly in a line with one of the great natural routes to the
                  Pacific, as well as the present barrier of separation and defence between the
                  inhabited and Indian-ranged districts of Texas. This line, drawn from the head of
                  navigation on the Bravo nearly in direct course to the Red River near its outlet
                  into the Mississippi, would intersect the three great rivers of Texas—the
                  Colorado, Brazos and Trinity—at their respective heads of navigation and through
                  their ducts, each tapping the Gulf of Mexico, would bring into action an extent of
                  fertile domain equal in productive powers to all France. It would touch the
                  Mississippi where it would meet the long, grasping, railroad fingers which the
                  Atlantic shoots forth to bring closer in family union the sisters of the west.
                  Here is the great track to the Pacific which the government, with the grave and
                  solemn blindness of an owl, is looking for everywhere else. The eagle symbols well
                  the daring flight of our restless and resistless people, but the owl is the bird
                  of their rulers. It is slow, portly and voracious, with a keen scent and a mighty
                  clutch for the spoils, but not at all gifted with eye and pinion to mark the way
                  and clear the path from sea to sea. No, my poor owl, you will flutter your stupid
                  wings among the treasury-vouchers at Washington, and leave the great national
                  lines of union and defence for the eagle-enterprise of the people to discover, and
                  clear from hovering Indians.
               We were taking our last breakfast of the trip at the Chacon, in a fresh, keen
                  norther, when we heard again of the Indians. Our people found two soldiers who had
                  been killed by them. The bodies were committed to the earth, and in an hour the
                  incident was forgotten. Life sits lightly on a borderer. Neither his own nor his
                  friend's is spared any risk, and as for the Indians, in his eyes they were only
                  made to be killed. The slaughter therefore of a soldier or two was hardly of
                  sufficient interest to supply an hour's chat, and they were never recurred to
                  after their graves were left behind.
               In the afternoon of that day we wound through some romantic hill-slopes, and
                  entered what appeared like an endless succession of orchards. The river flashed
                  out and disappeared at intervals like a chain of lakes on our left, and on the
                  right a range of precipitous hills came down to the road, as if to question the
                  right-of-way. On reaching the shoulder of the hill the foremost carriage wheeled
                  into a green nook embosomed in this rocky wall, and some one called out,
               "This is Eagle Pass."
               I glanced round, and saw a vast tree-sprinkled plain, between the hills and the
                  gleaming river, and at its farthest edge
                  a cloud of sheep, like the snow-capped waves of the sea breaking on the green
                  shore, came surging towards us with extended front. With slower step a herd of
                  handsome cows were pacing towards the milking-pen. A white tent, recessed in the
                  lap of the hill, and the words of welcome issuing from its parted drapery recalled
                  my attention, and I truly answered to eager questions, "I like this sunny wild,
                  and am content to build me a home in Eagle Pass."
            
            
               MY NEW COUNTRY.
               VICTOR had spurred on before us to announce our coming, and the board was spread
                  with hospitable cheer when we arrived; but the fragrant coffee, delicate kid, and
                  fresh honey, with other less considered dainties, had to wait until we had taken a
                  long draught of the pure air, and feasted on the prospect from the summit of the
                  hill. Somehow Eagle Pass is less beautiful to my eye now, though it has all the
                  airs and graces of a two year old village, than it was in its wildness, with its
                  one white tent nestling, like a dove at rest, in the cool and quiet hill-nook. A
                  lady, its mistress, was hoped for rather than actually expected; but an inner
                  apartment had been hastily prepared for her reception. It was lined with printed
                  muslin, of a pale, clear blue running pattern, and its pointed ceiling was freshly
                  wreathed with verdant branches. Some stools and travelling boxes, cushioned and
                  covered to match, served as ottomans, and gave an air of repose, and even
                  elegance, to this temporary abode. The light stole in, tinted and softened,
                  through the floating curtains, and harmonized well with the tranquil hush of the
                  place. Mr. C. had been thought rash in thus planting his home—for this house of
                  canvas was soon to be replaced by one of stone—so far from any other residence,
                  and the more so, as he had in the frail tenement, goods to an amount calculated to
                  tempt Mexican robbers, if not a regular Indian foray; but he was not to be turned
                  from his way. Fort Duncan was two miles farther up the river, but it was a mere
                  infantry encampment, and so stinted by government in men and officers, that they
                  were hardly strong enough to take care of themselves, and was then, as it is now,
                  at the mercy of the Camanches any bright day it might please those respectable red
                  gentlemen to muster for the extermination of that important sentinel post. The
                  reputation of the United States—not there ality of its care—has been the
                  protection of this commercial depot. We have lived and prospered under the shadow
                  of what Fort Duncan ought to be, and so peace and good-will to political shadows
                  evermore.
               Victor, who watches every movement, and seems most anxious to understand and serve
                  aright his new mistress, ventured a timid and respectful query as to my
                  contentment with the place. I answered that it was better than I had hoped, for
                  the current voice was against it as the dryest and least beautiful section in
                  Texas; yet it was evidently capable of becoming as lovely as it was undeniably
                  healthy. Thereupon Victor, who is a very Cicero in his round and swelling periods,
                  began to contrast this wilderness with his own gorgeous and fruit-crowned
                  Guadalaxara, and the magnificent scenery of Tehuantepec, where fruits and flowers
                  chase each other in endless succession through the round year. It is true Heaven
                  has given Mexico everything but stable laws; but that one default cankers and
                  poisons all the rest. We have on this side of the river the anchor of firm
                  freedom, and by that we can outride the roughest weather. It is true that even
                  here the breadth of the Bravo river—about as wide as the Hudson at Troy—separates
                  the Americans from a much finer country
                  than they possess on this side; yet while that paradise of natural beauty remains
                  unpopulated, insecure, and waste, a fair and prosperous settlement will rise in
                  wealth, strength, and security—is rapidly rising, in fact—under the wings of our
                  Eagle. A year has made this hope a realized and permanent existence; but for a
                  time my home was established nearer to, and a little above, the fort, as the
                  destined town of Eagle Pass had not then planted a stake, or laid a stone towards
                  human accommodation. The spacious double tent, pitched by Mr. C., and his
                  temporary corrals for his stock, were all that existed of the prospective town in
                  the spring of 1850. Above the camp, and opposite the military colony of Piedras
                  Negras, on the Mexican shore, a neat cottage had been called into existence for my
                  use, until we could build below. It lacked some finishing touches when I arrived,
                  and a tent near it was my home for a week or two. Under its folds I passed in
                  sound repose the first night of my pleasant sojourn on the border—a calm,
                  contented, indolent period, which I shall always remember as a sweet, half-waking
                  dream of fairy-land.
               Yet my first mornings were as full of keen inquiry as if I was in search of
                  diamond fields or gold mines. Wherever I am, I like to know the features,
                  character, and capabilities of the region; what it has done, and what it can do,
                  though I am too idle and indifferent to turn anything to my own profitable
                  account.
            
            
               CAPABILITIES.
               UNLESS a fair division of my private means may enable me (as I sometimes fondly
                  dream) to establish a missionary manual labor school to be in part supported by
                  it, I shall never be personally interested in sugar culture, yet I was not the
                  less curious to verify the capabilities of our vicinity for the growth of the
                  cane. In the watered glens, and on the vast plains susceptible of cheap
                  irrigation—an admirable aid to agriculture, yet almost unpractised in the United
                  States—the sugar cane succeeds perfectly. But these sugar lands are almost
                  entirely on the Mexican side of the river; though, on this side, we can have
                  profitable crops of melon sugar—at least, I have a hopeful faith in this new
                  feature of American production. The soil and climate is adapted to the vine
                  family. The Texan flora shows a great variety of climbing plants, and the success
                  of the grape has been conspicuous wherever attempted. Above us, at El Paso, and
                  below us again, in the Parras district, the juice of the grapes of the country is
                  absolutely unequalled by any known in the world, although as yet wine and raisins
                  are not made at either in a regular and proper method. Our situation ensures that
                  at no distant day these uninhabited wastes will echo the merry vintage songs of
                  the distant Rhine. There is no harvest more productive than the purple grape in
                  any favorable climate, and this is eminently propitious to wine culture. To the
                  grape and melon sugar, we may add the castor bean as another production suited to
                  this region in a peculiar degree; only that whoever enters into it must bring out
                  the needful apparatus, for machinery and machinists are crying wants throughout
                  the upper valley of the Bravo. In all the finest wheat regions, there is not a
                  single mill that turns out bolted flour. The bran and the white heart of the grain
                  is all given back together to the customer, duly and inseparably mixed in a way
                  that would be balm to the heart of the health-apostle Graham.
               The mining region enfolds us on almost every side. The Indians are slowly retiring
                  from the silver and copper region that
                  comes down from the Gila, and hems between its lofty mountain walls hundreds of
                  miles of the Bravo, even to the Painted Rocks (Piedras Pintas), scarcely a day's
                  ride from Eagle Pass. Just beyond these the Indian traditions tell of valleys
                  seamed with rich veins of gold, and of the outlines of ruined cities once occupied
                  by an unknown and vanished race. Indeed, all geological analogies indicate the
                  presence of rich ores near us. Coal we know exists at our door. A fine bed crops
                  out on the bank of the river opposite the upper line of Eagle Pass; and the
                  settlement near Fort Duncan takes its name, Piedras Negras (Black Stones), from
                  the masses of the coal detached and cast along the margin of the river in high
                  freshets. These "black diamonds" may be worth more to us here, at the probable
                  head of navigation, for the steamers which must wend down a thousand miles of
                  crooked channel, than the silver, lead, zinc, tin, fire-proof mica, or even the
                  gold mines, which are now springing to light. Without any of them, we would still
                  have a pure atmosphere, corn and milk, wine and fruits, wool and honey, and with
                  these one should not fail of content and independence, if the elements of either
                  are in his heart.
            
            
               MY NEW FAMILY.
               I FOUND a numerous and well-disposed family had been assembled with affectionate
                  care to welcome me to Eagle Pass, and make me feel that I could still enjoy most
                  of my old habitudes in this remote border. I lost no time in establishing myself
                  on cordial terms with them all, and most particularly with my handmaiden Francesca
                  and her husband, Fabiano, who is an excellent factotum general. It is the best
                  answer that can be male to the maligners of poor, weak, abused human nature, to
                  take an average character—one that evil circumstances has not utterly perverted,
                  and is, moreover, endowed with average sense and kindliness-and try fairly the
                  effects of equitable treatment. By equitable treatment I neither mean capricious
                  petting, nor what some very excellent people call a "regular system of dealing
                  with them," if this regularity is to be as cold and hard as a block of granite.
                  The golden rule of our divine example is good enough for me—if I could but live up
                  to it—and that is my plain and simple law, although nearly everybody has a better
                  law for servants, and laughs at my oddity in thinking He of Nazareth laid it down
                  in earnest as a rule for genteel people to walk by in real life.
               The morning after my arrival at Piedras Negras the drapery of my tent was lifted,
                  and almost without my knowing how, a Mexican woman stood before me in respectful
                  silence. Her large, patient black eye was bent on me as if in mute request to be
                  noticed, but her whole attitude was as fixed and motionless as a statue, and
                  looked as if it might remain so for all time if it did not please me to speak and
                  set the machine in motion. I scanned her face steadily for a moment, and then gave
                  it a degree of confidence which has been abundantly justified by her after
                  conduct. It wore the sad, submissive, much-enduring expression of her race, yet
                  withal there was something so trusting in those melan holy eyes that they won
                  trust in return; and a grain or two of mutual confidence is a pleasant capital to
                  begin with in a new family.
               "Your name?" I inquired, for I knew not even that much about my new domestics.
                  "Francesca, with your permission, and always at your service, my lady." In common
                  with the Arabs, their cousins, and the wild Indians, their brothers, the Mexicans,
                  even of the lowest rank, are wonderfully rich in courtly and poetical phrases.
               
               "Well, Francesca, can you take charge of the chamber work for me?" Francesca made
                  a timid, glancing survey of the tent. The plain outsides of several trunks and the
                  pile of blankets that composed our travelling bed did not look very formidable or
                  complicated, yet, in a slightly hesitating tone, like one slow to assume a weighty
                  responsibility, she replied:
               "If it is your command, señora." The poor girl had once in her life
                  slept on a mattrass and seen somewhat of household gear, as I learned in time to
                  my great comfort, but I was prepared to find her ignorant of the uses of any bed
                  or bed furniture beyond a blanket, for that is the case with nine-tenths of the
                  poorer Mexicans.
               "Can you sew?" "Si, señora."
               This was asserted with cheerful promptitude, as if she now touched known and firm
                  ground. But, poor Francesca, your first needle-work was indeed extraordinary.
                  Encouraged by this, I ventured on another of my habitual requirements, and here I
                  must remark that the most thoroughly valuable personal attendant I ever had, or,
                  indeed, ever knew in any lady's service, was a Spanish-American girl.
               "Can you dress hair?"
               This was an overwhelming question. Francesca put her hand to her own head, and
                  then looked at mine, with a comical, half-frightened bewilderment, as if to
                  inquire which head she was expected to cultivate. At last she stammered out that
                  universal phrase of refuge with the Mexicans, "Quien sabe?" Who knows? I saw that
                  was a hopeless quest, and passed abruptly to the consideration of the well-being
                  of another portion of my family.
               "Are you accustomed to the care of fowls and pigeons?"
               If Francesca was alarmed at the idea of assisting at my toilette, she was yet more
                  puzzled to understand my interest in the feathered tribe, and there peeped out of
                  her widening eyes a sort of vague fear that my inquiries about her capacity for
                  needle-work and taking care of the feathered tribe had some connection with each
                  other, and possibly had reference to a charitable design on my part of making
                  clothes for them. If, in fact, such a fancy had entered my head, it would never
                  come into hers to manifest any other feeling than a patient desire to obey my
                  wishes; so, of course, I only received the invariably peon response to all
                  questions and commands, possible and impossible of fulfilment
               "If you command it, señora."
               To relieve her perplexity I stayed, for the time, all farther questions on her
                  capacity for general usefulness, and directed her to put the tent in better order,
                  by way of practical trial. She went out and gathered a handful of shrubs, tied
                  them into a broom, and swept the floor, while I wandered out to look at the river,
                  whose high, gravelly, treeless banks and scant fringe of herbage—for this is its
                  character just there—was new to me and close at hand. It did not detain me
                  long—this half barren, yet not unpicturesque, scenery—and when I returned I found
                  my raw recruit waiting for my approval with a quiet air of "I have done well"
                  consciousness that was really comfortable to look upon.
            
            
               A BORDER CHAMBERMAID.
               A ROUGH box, in which effects had been transported, had served, with a white cloth
                  thrown over it, for an impromptu dressing-table. This cloth Francesca has
                  carefully removed and piled up on the box, with all the carpet-bags and blankets
                  that had to do duty for us in the place of chairs. Among these she had snugly
                  folded in the wash-hand basin, out of
                  harm's way, and laid in it as daintily as a cradled babe, my bonnet, only that its
                  fair proportions were somewhat marred by laying on it again a heavy,
                  bright-colored horse blanket, which, like the genuine Indian she is, the woman
                  thought the choicest article in that crowd, and treated accordingly to the most
                  honored place. My dressing-case chanced to be standing open on the ground, and
                  open on the ground she was most particular to leave it, only in addition to its
                  usual trimmings she had contrived to put in my watch, my husband's spurs and
                  bullet-pouch, and as much other small gear as she found in circulation in those
                  quarters. We made some slight changes in our household arrangements, and parted
                  for the day, pretty well satisfied with each other; and now, after some months of
                  mutual instruction, we come on together admirably.
               This is a specimen, and those who have not succeeded so well will tell you a
                  favorable specimen, of the Mexican border servants. But I still insist that this
                  obedient, passive race have in them the elements of good service for whoever will
                  have the forbearance to be good masters. They are wayward as children, and have
                  much of the singular unteachableness of the unconquered tribes of their race, but
                  they are willing to learn where they like the teacher, and they can learn if
                  properly taught.
               In the afternoon I walked down to the little ravine in which Fabiano and his wife
                  had their tent, and found it, like most of the Mexican homes, as bare of every
                  comfort as an Indian hut. They are much the same thing, in fact. Some rude cover
                  of reeds and grass, or hides and branches, to fend off the extremities of the
                  climate; a hide and a blanket for bed, table, chair, and all other household
                  furniture; a coarse bag, made of woven grass or the all-useful pita of the country, and sometimes a box as well as a
                  bag, to hold their brief inventory of clothes and valuables; a gourd or two, and a
                  kettle to cook in, out of which they also eat; this is what you will find in a
                  Camanche camp, and you will rarely find more than this in the possession of a peon
                  family.
               Francesca was sitting just within the entrance of the tent—calmly and meditatively
                  smoking in the midst of a very sociable and contented family—when we caught the
                  first glimpse of it, and we paused to take, unobserved, a more deliberate survey.
                  A large, fawn-colored turkey was strutting in and out in search of his mate, or
                  something to eat, and saying a great deal I could not understand, as I am not
                  learned in turkish, to a demure duck that was couched down close at her side, and
                  apparently as much occupied with his own reflections as Francesca. This duck is a
                  forlorn bachelor, and has attached himself most Platonically to his human
                  mistress, whom he follows about like a pet dog, and never goes to sleep until she
                  retires, when he squats down at her feet, to be ready to attend her the moment she
                  wakes. He gave himself no more trouble about the discontent of Sir Turkey than
                  Brother Jonathan does for the authority of the Mosquito king, or the irregular
                  murder of our people in Cuba. A beautiful spotted hen was gathering up her chicks
                  on the other side of the tent, in which they were all as much at home as Francesca
                  herself, while a pair of white pigeons were running to and fro, building a nest in
                  some invisible corner, and, like all the rest of my feathered friends, evidently
                  on terms of the closest intimacy with my docile, if not accomplished, chambermaid.
                  This scene settled her position securely as a member of my establishment, for
                  these were my pets, and valued above all my Eagle Pass possessions. The pigs were
                  useful in their way, but they were pert and forever putting themselves
                  disagreeably forward, as the vulgar will do everywhere, and besides that, pigs can
                  take care of themselves all the year, and
                  ask no favors; the cows, though respectable and inoffensive—as such well-to-do
                  personages ought to be—were dull; but the graceful, bustling, capricious plumed
                  aristocracy of idlers are always charming. They have as much variety of character,
                  and are as full of small broils and petty emulations, as the majority of
                  human-kind. Their tricks and rivalries, their friendships and their quarrels, are,
                  if you watch them as closely, fully as sensible and quite as entertaining as those
                  of common neighborhood gossip. They are of the same real value at last, and as
                  their miffs and scandals are not near so mischievous to each other, or so tiresome
                  to me, as those of the unplumed human bipeds, I would always rather give my
                  attention to their ways than hear Mrs. Snooks' criticism on Mrs. Smith's last
                  lace, last party, or last flirtation.
               A pair of fawns shared my attentions with a pair of enormous white geese, who are
                  a perfect pattern of conjugality, by the way, and absolutely worth setting up as
                  an example of loving kindness to all others in the yoke of matrimony. An array of
                  parti-colored goats and swarms of gentle lambs and kids came to replace the loss
                  when my last fawn died—as too many children do—of over-feeding; but I have turned
                  them all in charge of our shepherd, as I look forward to the luxury of fruits and
                  flowers in this favorable clime, and they are things not likely to flourish in the
                  range of the four-footed class of favorites. For this reason I limit my special
                  household intimacy to my feathered pets, but they are quite sufficient to make me
                  forget that we have here a small population and limited social circle.
            
            
               OUR PEON SERVANTS.
               I HAD wished to examine impartially the workings of the peon system of servitude
                  here on its rugged border edge, where we can track it freely in its incomings and
                  outgoings; and truly fate has gone beyond my wishes, for I find that nearly all
                  our servants are runaways from debt-slavery. Victor, our spoiled man of all work,
                  is a freeman born, and, moreover, a full-fledged citizen of the United States; but
                  that does not prevent a Mexican, who has a claim against him, from coming about
                  the place and threatening him with servitude. The old, petulant, gray-beard of a
                  creditor talks as fluently of selling a citizen of the United States and a voter
                  of our new-born county of Kinney as if a citizen and a voter of this glorious
                  Union were of less account than his ragged skeleton of a pony. In fact, it is for
                  a part of the purchase money of another such a ten dollar affair as he rides, that
                  the gray-beard intends to sell Victor into peon slavery. There are plenty of men,
                  whom it would be a scandal to well-behaved ponies to compare in value to a horse,
                  but our Victor has such a mint of useless accomplishments, and some useful ones,
                  withal—if they were ever at hand when wanted—it would be a shame to rate him at
                  the fourth part of this starved and ill-gaited thing. If that is the way voting
                  citizens stand in this market, it is not worth while for Women's Rights
                  Conventions any farther to reduce their market rates by bringing in the softer
                  sex. If they can induce the American cabinet to define positions with Mexico, and
                  secure American womankind from being sold for debt into life-long servitude, it
                  would be a surer and clearer gain. If they fancy this is a visionary dread they
                  are mistaken. American citizens can be, American citizens have
                     been enslaved for debt in
                  Mexico. So have French and English subjects been enslaved. One of the born
                  subjects of Victoria, who was the bound peon of Señor Rafael Aldapa, of Santa
                  Rosa, our neighbor—the Santa Rosa of the silver mines—ran away from his master
                  this season, because the luxurious fellow thought a peck and a half of corn a
                  week, without meat or salt, poor living. Some people are never pleased, and he was
                  one of them; he objected to the allowance of pure and healthy diet provided by
                  law, and he objected also to the bracing exercise of the whipping-post, and left
                  them both behind him. Equally unreasonable, Victor is not at all in a hurry to
                  succeed him in these luxuries; and if he is prudent, he will not trust to his
                  citizenship or his government, but make haste to settle his accounts with his
                  importunate creditor, and keep the while near home. One of our shepherds is here
                  by license of his master, and is laying aside half of his wages, month by month,
                  to pay up the debt. He has left in pledge the most sacred security an Indian can
                  give—the persons of his aged father and mother. Filial love is a deep-enduring
                  trait in the Mexican character, and a beautiful, redeeming light, it throws on
                  some of its darker shades. I have seen a strong man in the prime of life stand, in
                  mute submission under a perfect hail-storm of invectives, aye, and hard blows as
                  well, from his angry mother, without even offering to move out of her reach, and
                  only attempting to avert the storm of her wrath by tender and respectful signs of
                  deprecation and obedience. A rude and unkind child is a sort of monster in Mexican
                  eyes, and with all the faults inevitable to an oppressed and untaught people, they
                  are faithful through life to their parents. On this Domingo's master built his
                  trust, and as he had no use for his services, and the peon market was dull, he
                  took the old people in pledge, and suffered his serf to come over among the
                  Americans and earn wherewith to buy his liberty. Faithfully is one half of his
                  wages remitted to the master, and something taken from the remaining half to send
                  in loving tokens to his parents; and then he is so grateful and happy when some
                  little gift is added to his own well-earned offerings, that it is a delight to
                  contribute a trifle.
            
            
               FABIANO.
               OF all our people I am most puzzled to understand our quiet, attentive, sensible
                  Fabian, who comprehends at a glance all that concerns his duty, and meets every
                  requirement with such intelligent promptitude, yet flutters like a wounded bird if
                  you question him touching his former life. He is small, yet well knit, and as
                  quick, active and observant as a cat. When in attendance, his eye is alert to
                  catch the slightest movement, and you hardly look at what you want before it is
                  already at hand. He is a devoted husband withal, and as anxious to help his wife,
                  and as eager to cover the defects in her service by his own extra toil, as if his
                  cherished one was an angel of beauty. Poor Francesca is no such thing. She is a
                  clumsy, heavy, full-blooded Indian woman, and much older, as well as much larger,
                  than Fabian, so that in everything she has the weight on her side. Yet she is not
                  wanting in wit, and is, with all her slow ways, the terror of the whole
                  establishment for her keen, unsparing sarcasms. Our herdsman Francisco, who is
                  also a character in his way, is the only one of the dozen or twenty men about us
                  who does not stand in awe of her tongue, and what a rushing, rolling cataract of
                  resounding words they do pour forth when they enter into one of their discussions
                  over the long-drawn-out Sunday breakfasts. The echo floats up to my chamber with
                  the murmur of the river rapids, and for an hour or two they will flow on unceasingly and undistinguishably
                  together. Fabiano listens in tranquil silence, perfectly convinced that his better
                  half will triumph in the end over even the voluble herdsman. Still, by no chance
                  does she let fall any clue to the latter years—the years of her married life.
                  Fabian was from Monterey, but that was a long time ago, and it is amusing to
                  observe how adroitly the pair veil their after residence; yet with all their
                  precautions, chance—that sleepless mischief-maker—has told their story:—They
                     are runaway peons; fugitives from slavery for debt. Fabiano was a
                  free-born Indian—with a dash of white blood I think—of Monterey, and drifted this
                  way in the service of one master and another as far as San Juan—the town dedicated
                  to that San Juan who has in charge the best peaches, figs and grapes within a
                  radius of thirty leagues around us. Here it was his destiny to meet a lost wife,
                  or to lose his heart anew to Francesca, who had been sold while a child by her
                  parents to a citizen of Moneterey, and had moved to San Juan with her master's
                  family. Her master forbade his precincts to the pertinacious lover, but Fabian was
                  not to be forbidden. He continued to roam about the house by day and night, to
                  snatch brief interviews with his loved Francesca. The laws of the republic, which
                  a wise and illustrious senator quoted in Congress as a "bright model of pure
                  liberty worthy of our imitation," permits whipping, imprisonment, and the like
                  gentle persuasives to industry, to the masters of peons, and the master of
                  Francesca made large use of his legal rights. By the way, would it not be well for
                  those members of Congress who believe in this example, to propose the enactment in
                  their respective states of the Mexican debtor law, and to allow employers to whip,
                  starve, and send to jail, those whose labors are unsatisfactory? Will not the
                  factory-girls of New England petition for the introduction duction of the laws of
                  that purely free Mexico, to whose "soil undefiled by slavery," such profuse
                  libations are poured out by their profound and patriotic members of Congress?
               Well, Francesca, who boasts the best Indian blood of the state, felt the
                  inexorable lash, and every blow cut to the loving heart of Fabian. He plead for
                  instant flight across the Rio Grande. Under the stars of the Union there is no
                  slavery for debt, and whatever else happened, the Red Race went free from bondage
                  on that portion of their native in-heritance.
               It was so arranged, and Fabian was hovering about the house watching for the
                  favorable moment of flight, when he was discovered and arrested by Francesca's
                  master. To throw him in prison, make formal complaint to the Alcalde, and prepare
                  a list of costs on which he could legally be made a debtor and peon, was a thing
                  of course. This peril Fabian had looked in the face, and prepared for before-hand.
                  He had his friends without, and within accomplices are easily gained in prisons. A
                  few days of bitter agony about his companion, for he could guess, but not know,
                  the measure of punishment that awaited Francesca, and then all around him fell
                  back into careless, unwatched neglect. While the master was listlessly smoking his
                  cigar, and perhaps mistily coming to a decision how and when he would turn his new
                  peon into ready money, Fabian and his prison mates forced the unguarded door, and
                  sped across the uninhabited fields to the Bravo. But not for himself alone had
                  Fabian dared the risk; his fleet and hardy mustang bore away Francesca too, and
                  when, hungry and exhausted, their worn-out horse sunk under them on the banks of
                  the wished-for river, each was the other's only earthly possession. There Victor,
                  who was in quest of a cook and chambermaid to meet my arrival, stumbled upon them, and inducted them in due form in my
                  service.
            
            
               MY NEW HOUSE.
               TEN days after my arrival on the Bravo, my house—the first, and then only,
                  habitation with glass windows and panelled doors in this young island of
                  civilization—was in a state to receive us, and with no small importance we went
                  into possession. The large symmetrical sashed doors gave our cottage in the
                  wilderness a cheerful, lightsome appearance, and it seemed to look out upon the
                  desert hills, and lonely, untravelled river, with a wide-awake, astonished air of
                  inquiry into the wherefore of its position. We had a house then, but no furniture;
                  some was exploring its way to Eagle Pass at our order, and in the course of time
                  was likely to find its destination; but—meanwhile? In these improved times
                  furniture is difficult of attainment at Eagle Pass, for we are still destitute of
                  skilled mechanical labor, though the caricature there-of by Mexican hands does
                  exist, but in the ancient days of this settlement, that is to say, fifteen months
                  ago, a suite of decent movables was but a flattering dream. It might come to pass
                  at some dim far-away period of the future, but the chances were not in its favor.
                  There was, however, a resource open to us, and, thanks to some border experience,
                  we soon made it available. A wide, shallow box was raised on some very strong, if
                  not elegantly carved, feet, and there was a table. With a white cloth, our
                  breakfast-tray did not make a bad figure on it, and covered with a bright blanket,
                  it did duty as a centre-table. A side-board, out of a large, square box, with a
                  shelf in it, and curtained with a high-colored French print, and a lounge to
                  match, was soon created, together with a stand and dressing-table en suite, as people are particular to say of their
                  carved rosewood Louis Quatorze ameublements.
                  Ours flashed out with a dashing air of pretension that would be quite unbearable
                  in mere rosewood and mahogany, and I felt in my heart all the pride and
                  self-satisfaction the creations of our handiwork carried in their faces. I had
                  never before given much thought to the adornment of person or house, beyond the
                  essentials of comfort and propriety, but now that I had found how much could be
                  done with calico and old boxes, the tape, tacks, and tack-hammer were never out of
                  my hands for the first two or three weeks. I am not sure whether, in the
                  exuberance of my vanity and delight, I did not take them to sleep with me, and, at
                  any rate, I am certain that when my New York made furniture did arrive, it was
                  received in the family with as much contemptuous indifference as an expletive,
                  third cousin from the country. What was it in comparison to the dear offspring of
                  our love?
            
            
               GARDENING
               THE next engrossing object of ambition was a garden, but in that all my efforts
                  were foiled, all my aspirations doomed to disappointment. I tried vines, they only
                  sprung from the ground to wilt and die; I tried flowers, they would not spring at
                  all; I tried vegetables, they only raised their heads in green promise to grow
                  sick and die, or be eaten off by the rats. The soil about Fort Duncan, and the
                  little settlement above in which our pioneer tent was pitched, is a high bank of
                  sand and gravel, and seems but lately upheaved in some Plutonic throe. Gardens can
                  be made almost any where under this sky, if the soil is patiently fertilized and
                  watered; even on the sterile spot that encircles Fort Duncan. This is stated
                  advisedly, for I noted carefully the progress of the only crop raised there as yet—a single bean, an
                  enormous red giant of the family of running beans. It was brought out and
                  presented by me to our neighbor, and was regularly watered on the alternate days,
                  or thereabouts, and carefully tended always. This crop of one bean had a
                  prodigious growth, and produced fifty fold, but then a man and team were necessary
                  to cultivate it properly, and it certainly occupied more time and industry than
                  will be given to these leaves, so that it becomes a fair question in productive
                  economy whether this book is worth a bean, and also whether that bean was worth
                  the cost of cultivation.
               My horticultural failures were the more dispiriting from the perfect success of
                  the family at Eagle Pass—there was then but one family at the county seat, three
                  miles below Fort Duncan, and that one lived in a tent, not
                     having been there long enough to put up a house, though they
                  had made haste and fenced in a garden.
               Mr. Campbell was one of those open-handed Christians, whose principal joy is to
                  share out whatever good things of this life fall to his lot, and his garden at
                  Eagle Pass gladdened all the tables of the settlement as fully and liberally as
                  his own. The towns on the Mexican side sent in their contribution of green corn,
                  sweet potatoes, monster onions, yellow plums, peaches, quinces,
                  apples and figs, but with such provoking irregularity, that we
                  were more than ready to listen to Mr. Campbell's advice, and
                  choose our homestead where we could plant orchards for ourselves. Others went down
                  to Eagle Pass to settle opposite the Escondida for commercial reasons; because it
                  was on the right side of the fords and paths precious to contrabandists, and
                  because it lay in better vicinity to the semicircle of Mexican towns that spread
                  their are in front of it, and radiate trade into the mining districts beyond them;
                  but the reasons that moved me thereto were of less solid nature. I pined for
                  shade, and fruit trees whose overarching arms should enfold me in a temple of
                  tranquil repose. It is only under the shadow of living foliage that I can entirely
                  possess myself and live—untrammelled by the tedious weight of society—with my
                  thoughts, my books, and my birds. Gardening is with me an occupation and a
                  delight, and I could not wait the slow outcomings of the ungrateful soil above
                  Fort Duncan, neither was my good lord and master disposed to forego the fine
                  fishing and bathing proffered by the Escondida, or any of us unmindful how far its
                  clear waters were preferable for taste and health, to the turbid and often
                  brackish current of the Rio Bravo. The pecuniary interests we had planted on the
                  dry gravel bank above the military post, were thrown overboard under the pressure
                  of these considerations, and at an early day we rode down to select a site for our
                  homestead and garden—and perhaps decide as well the exact location of the town of
                  Eagle Pass.
            
            
               CHINO.
               BEFORE this was absolutely fixed upon, or rather as an important preliminary to
                  any study of the country, I made it my particular business, after establishing
                  friendly and well-defined relations with my servants, my pigeons and my poultry,
                  to come to a perfect understanding with my black pony. Chino was a full-blooded,
                  native-born citizen of Mexico, endowed, like his human peon brothers, with the
                  Mexican virtues of patience, endurance, and abstemiousness, besides several other
                  somewhat less creditable habitudes. He was sly, terribly inclined to petty
                  larcenies, and at first rather addicted to shying off his burden, if the rider was
                  not on the guard; but he always maintained a most demure and respectable
                  countenance, and had such soft, well-bred ways that he never suffered in his character. It is
                  astonishing how many quiet, well-mannered sins that sage moralist, the world, will
                  forgive to smooth-paced men and horses. Unfortunate circumstances educate too many
                  of the youth of both classes into evil ways, and I imputed Chino's sly
                  immoralities to cruel treatment in his colthood, and the use of that barbarous
                  implement of horse torture, the Mexican bridle, which fills the poor animal's
                  mouth with a load of jagged iron, to such an extent that he cannot drink with it,
                  though the flowing river may lave the saddle skirts. The stoic Mexican, true to
                  his Indian nature, endures suffering himself, in silent, passive fortitude, and he
                  has no tenderness or sympathy for the sufferings of any thing else. The worst
                  trait I have observed in them is this almost universal want of feeling for
                  animals. I know society and Mrs. Grundy keep their keenest ridicule for the
                  weakness of caring for the agonies of helpless and dependent beings. They were
                  made to be abused and trampled upon, doubtless, and it is childish to pause in the
                  important pursuits of life,—the set of a hat or the length of a skirt, for
                  example,—to think of such trifles; but still I could wish the enslaved Red Man on
                  our borders to share more largely in the genialities of life, if it were only that
                  it might soften his heart to more kindliness toward those things that feel and
                  suffer below him on the ladder of existence.
               When I ordered a light American bridle to replace the heavy, uncouth Mexican bit,
                  Chino shook his head with a short, disdainful toss that spoke his mind as plain as
                  a dictionary: "That smooth and slender bit of wire can't check me. I see I shall
                  have my own way on the road."
               Victor, who is now a fixture in the family, hinted a fear that Chino would have no
                  respect to this new and gentle system of government, yet he seemed gratified, for
                  he and Chino are intimate personal friends. When I assured him that I had no fear
                  about it, and should adopt it invariably, for I could not ride with pleasure while
                  I knew my horse was in misery, Fabian, who was adjusting the girths, raised his
                  great, sad Indian eyes in surprise that any person of sound mind could take so
                  seriously the comfort of a horse, and to this day I suspect he and the rest of our
                  Mexican family set down my determined aversion to Mexican bridles as a touch of
                  harmless insanity. As for Chino, after satisfying himself on one or two occasions,
                  that arguments of force really did lay in the American substitute, he yielded the
                  point with an excellent grace, and thenceforth stepped off as I like my horse to
                  step, lightly and cheerily, as if he was out for his own private pleasure, and
                  carried me where I desired to go, out of pure good will, and a general disposition
                  to oblige. This being amicably settled, as such things almost always may be, if
                  the rider is not more perverse than the average of horses, Chino and I rambled
                  about at will, and without much troubling ourselves about Indians or anything
                  else; we explored together, with great mutual content, the grassy dells and
                  tangled thickets around our home. In most cases it was, probably, the first time
                  their silent shades had been disturbed by the visit of a white person, but we
                  found many lovely nooks that well repaid my hermit tastes for the trouble of
                  exploration.
            
            
               THE MULBERRY GROVE.
               IT has been already explained that Eagle Pass is a two-headed child, with one face
                  looking above and the other below Fort Duncan. Our new cottage and our first rest
                  was in the upper place; but one delicious morning, about the middle of April, when
                  the northern world is yet fretting at the chilly, frosty, changing weather, we
                  rode down the green tree-sprinkled
                  terrace, between hill and river, to examine more closely the advantages of the
                  elder Eagle Pass; that old, official Eagle Pass, whose name already boasted the
                  venerable rust of three years' antiquity, while its young counterpart was but a
                  new christened three months babe. As we cantered along, now glancing at the silver
                  face of the Bravo, here about the width, depth and outline of the Hudson at
                  Albany; now admiring the leafy arcade that veils the bridal of the coy Escondida
                  with the sullen and capricious Bravo, and again pausing to measure with a second
                  look, the long fantastic arms of some far-reaching mesquete, we came all at once
                  on a charming little grove of mulberry trees, laden with fruit and foliage, and
                  drawn up in close company at the foot of the last terrace towards the river. We
                  wheeled into it, and discovered, hid away like birds' nests under the cool,
                  interlacing shade, a brace of Mexican tents, with a whole family of men, women and
                  children humming and swarming around them, like bees stirred up at our unexpected
                  advent. A wonderfully ragged and stately gentleman came promptly to my bridle
                  rein, and proffered his services with the mien and language of an emperor. Indeed
                  I doubt whether his crowned namesake of Brazil carries his honors with such a
                  princely air as our adobe-maker Pedro does his tatters. I often marvel how such
                  brevity of original material could be manufactured into this extensive showing of
                  fluttering shreds. I am confident Pedro of Brazil could not get up such a display
                  on the narrow limits of four or five yards of cotton; yet Pedro of Eagle Pass did
                  it with the easy self-possession of a finished aristocrat. Does this oriental
                  grace of speech and bearing come to the Indian race by Asiatic descent? It is not
                  the gift of the white race. The peasantry of Europe have their poetry and their
                  noble aspirations, but they have it not in the form or in the wild plenitude which
                  is common to the red race, whether bond or free. It is a part of their
                  inheritance, with that wearisome metate before
                  which this poor girl kneels and grinds her corn for bread, exactly as the
                  handmaidens of Abraham's household ground theirs some thousand years ago. These
                  are the "nether millstone" which scripture law made a household exemption from
                  debt, and it is, I think, one of the first precedents on record; but, like the
                  Puritans, who resolved to be governed by the laws of God "until they had time to
                  make better," we have spent many centuries in amendments before we came round
                  again to the simple justice of heaven. Just such round blocks, like a granite
                  cheese set up on three little feet, are painted in the oldest tombs of Egypt, and
                  by this time Layard has, doubtless, disentombed the like in the ruins of ancient
                  Nineveh, but he may not know their uses if he has never seen America, and fancy
                  they are the altars of the domestic Lares of the buried nations. Not exactly a
                  wrong conclusion after all. Whether or not the Lost Ten Tribes, or the colonists
                  of Sesostris, brought the metate to America with the art of building with the huge
                  sun-dried adobe, the same things have been common to them all; only the daughters
                  of Judea ground barley, and our native American girls, Indian-corn, to make the
                  unleavened cakes called—I know not what in Asia—but here, tortillas.
               
            
            
               DELICATE FARE.
               PATIENT Barbara had just ground off one batch of dough, when our visit fell upon
                  her, and electrified her spirit with hospitable visions. The lye-soaked corn was
                  ready at her side, and she set about preparing another mess with more scrupulous
                  nicety. The process attracted me, it was performed formed with such quick and peculiar dexterity of
                  hand. To bite out one by one the dark spot of every kernel of corn, just where it
                  was set in the cob, would be slow work for the uninitiated, but our hostess of the
                  mulberry grove kept her hands and teeth in action with the quickness and sleight
                  of a practised biter. "Why take all this trouble, Barbara?" I inquired, after
                  watching her a while.
               "To make the tortillas clean and white, if you, my lady and mistress,
                  (mi ama y dueña) will honor me by eating them," said Barbara, dropping the last
                  kernel from her white teeth.
               "To make the tortillas clean and white," I repeated. "Ah, yes, I understand now,
                  but I cannot stay to eat, to-day; we absolutely must return home in time for
                  dinner;" and I retreated to the overhanging branches of the mulberries, now in
                  full fruit, and raining their purple wealth on the ground whenever the breeze
                  swept their thick and rustling foliage. There, too, had been over much care for my
                  entertainment. Eager to serve and to please, the children had made a rapid foray
                  on the largest fruit, which they knew best of anybody where to find, and as I
                  turned from the choicest of tortillas, I confronted a boy of some ten years,
                  anxiously holding up to my acceptance a lap-full of the choicest mulberries. But
                  that lap! At some foregone period it had been white cotton, at least there was
                  something in its mixed complexion that hinted at such an origin, but time and the
                  experiences of boyhood had invested it with a strength of tint rivalling in depth
                  of color the berries which the polite owner was offering to my use. I was taken
                  with a sudden disinclination to eat more berries before dinner, but not to wound
                  the feelings of the little fellow who had taken this pains to please me, the
                  berries were carried home with us,—a part of the way—and his exertions duly
                  acknowledged with a piece of silver.
               From that day, the mulberry-grove became the home of my heart, and when I leave it
                  for another, whether it be on this side, or the other, of that gate which opens
                  not to the returning traveller, I trust it may become the seat, or in some degree
                  the helpful appanage, of a free mission or manual labor school, for the
                  dispossessed but natural inheritors of this soil—the homeless and neglected
                  children of the Red Race.
            
            
               THE SEMINOLE CHIEF.
               WE were sipping our chocolate, with every door thrown wide to welcome the breeze,
                  which rarely denies us its rustling presence, when we were astonished to see
                  Francesca coming up at a rapid pace. "What can this unexampled haste in our
                  easy-paced handmaiden possibly mean? It has a portentous augury," thought we. In
                  she came, so much excited as almost to let go her tenacious hold on the
                  ever-present reboso, and pointed, too far gone for speech, towards the hills. We
                  looked out in surprise, for there, emerging from the broken ground in a direction
                  that we knew was untraversed by any but the wild and hostile Indians, came forth a
                  long procession of horsemen. The sun flashed back from a mixed array of arms and
                  barbaric gear, but as this unexpected army, which seemed to have dropped upon us
                  from the skies, drew nearer it grew less formidable in apparent numbers, and
                  opened upon us a more pacific aspect. Some reasonably well-mounted Indians circled
                  round a dark nucleus of female riders, who seemed objects of special care. But the
                  long straggling rear-guard was worth seeing. It threw Falstaff's ragged regiment
                  altogether in the shade. Such an array of all manners and sizes of animals,
                  mounted by all ages, sexes and sizes of negroes, piled up to a most bewildering
                  height, on and among such a promiscuous assemblage of blankets, babies, cooking utensils, and savage
                  traps, in general, never were or could be held together on horseback by any beings
                  on earth but themselves and their red brothers. The party began to break away and
                  vanish into the little ravines that dip down to the river edge, and we understood
                  by these signs they were encamping among us.
               The word soon circulated that it was Wild Cat, the famous Seminole chief, who
                  played fast and loose so long with our army in Florida, baffling adroitly the
                  efforts of our best soldiers, and showing us many acute lessons in savage tactics,
                  though we never had the wit to turn them to profit. His tribe had lands assigned
                  them in Nebrasca, the territory allowed, for the time, to the Indians who were
                  driven or inveigled to come west of the Mississippi, by the relentless policy of
                  the whites, but he has left them in discontent. He has won too much savage glory
                  in his wars with the whites, and has in him too much of the restlessness of his
                  race, to stay cooped up among government forts and agents, with no higher hope or
                  employment than taking once a year a long brutal debauch, when the annual bounty
                  for their lost inheritance is paid to his tribe. Wild Cat has turned his back on
                  all this and come out to the Mexican border, with his immediate servants,
                  followers and kinsmen, to find a home and a field more congenial to the heart of a
                  Red warrior.
               He came in state to make his call on us, attended by his cousin and lieutenant,
                  the Crazy Bear, and some other braves, and marshalled with all ceremony by his
                  interpreter, Gopher John, a full-blooded negro. John does not look as dishonest as
                  his character runs, but might very well have earned his pre-name of "Gopher" in
                  the way it is told of him. He was employed, so runs the story, by one of our
                  gallant officers serving in Florida to supply and guard a reservoir of the kind of
                  turtle called gophers, in the "Orange State." Every day John
                  presented himself with a fresh supply of the luxury, and receiving his stipulated
                  silver therefor, consigned it to the reservoir. After some time it occurred to the
                  officer as singular that his stock did not increase, as it ought with all these
                  daily reinforcements. A watch was set, and then it came out that John stole back
                  at night the gophers he sold the General in the morning. He took his detection
                  very calmly, and has rather prided himself on the title of "Gopher" John, which
                  was fixed upon him by that affair for life.
               Wild Cat was dressed in fanciful Indian costume, but his whole attire had the
                  rather un-Indian merit of neatness. A row of crescent-shaped silver medals,
                  arranged in something like a breast-plate, glittered on his breast, and he had
                  good arms. Perhaps he reads Byron, for not only he 
                     "Shawl of red lightly round his temples wore,"
                   but the whole air and costume closely resembled one of the poet's
                  favorites.
               He saluted the ladies with a sedate and graceful bow, and accepted a chair with a
                  grave dignity of attitude becoming a chief. He then directed his interpreter to
                  say, he thanked the Great Spirit for placing him, face to face, and in peace, with
                  the whites, whom he now regarded as friends and brothers, in this distant country.
                  The conversation was continued on both sides in the same strain, and in every
                  sentence and attitude there shone out the same impassive habit of self-command,
                  and the same proud, inflexible spirit of self-reliance. On taking a glass with the
                  gentlemen he gave a pledge indicative of a desire for mutual good-will, and added,
                  afterwards, that once when he met white men, blood flowed, but now he had no
                  thought in his heart but friendship and a desire for peace.
               One of the ladies, not dreaming that his ignorance of our language was but the politic feigning of the wily
                  chieftain, remarked on the beauty and force of his language, the dignity of his
                  bearing, and the probable insincerity of heart that kept it all company. Not a
                  shade of look or manner betrayed that he comprehended a word of it, but we are now
                  satisfied that Wild Cat can talk English fluently enough when it pleases him to
                  find use for his tongue in that way.
               His present role is that of a pacific and mediating leader, and if, as we suspect,
                  all this is but acting a part, it must be confessed he plays it superbly, and
                  while he chooses to sustain it nothing could surprise him out of this
                  pre-determined calmness, and cold assumption of ignorance.
               For six months he has been passing from tribe to tribe, along this extended
                  frontier, as he says, to urge them to abstain from hostilities, and enter into
                  peace-treaties with the whites. He has, with his band, suffered immense fatigue
                  and privations, but no one can estimate the extent of the knowledge he has
                  acquired of the border country, its passes, its capacity for forage, water, and
                  all the items of savage attack and defence. A seven years' Indian war would not
                  teach our white officers so much of what it is necessary to know, as this
                  ambitious, far-reaching chief has laid up in this painful but effective six
                  months' study. So, too, of the powers and dispositions of the long list of jarring
                  Indian tribes in whose councils he mingled with the self-reliance of a renowned
                  chief of their own lineage; what white man could learn as much, could he even
                  speak their tongue, and think and reason in the habitudes of Indian life and
                  sentiment?
               Crazy Bear has more of the crude, imperfect savage in his logic and his aims than
                  his chief, but he seems to believe in him, and follow him as the model, according
                  to his Indian ideas, of all that is wise, heroic, and illustrious. Left to himself
                  the Bear would kill any white man he met alone in the forest with ferocious
                  delight, because he hates the race, and feels that, whether in peace or war, the
                  Red Race is alike dying under his heel. Yet on the morrow he would beg rum at the
                  white man's door, and profess deceitful friendship; for his brutal appetites are
                  strong, and he thinks all arts, even falsehood and treachery, are well used in
                  spoiling and circumventing the enemy. Beyond the success of the moment he cannot
                  stretch his eye, but Wild Cat is of loftier mould; he feels and bows to the
                  triumph of the white man as to the inevitable decree of fate, and next to
                  conquering the conqueror, his extended vision shows him that it would be wise to
                  make terms and become the ally instead of the victim of this irresistible
                  greatness.
               With a grain of wise and liberal forecast, this aspiring savage could be made the
                  soldier of the Union, and the surest and most invaluable defender of this
                  frontier.
            
            
               THE CANE COTTAGE.
               IN a few weeks after my first visit to the mulberry grove, I was delightfully
                  established in a reed cottage under the thick-set canopy of foliage, exactly where
                  we found Pedro's tent. The metate had given
                  place to an extempore table for writing, embroidery, and a variety of other
                  feminine helps to idleness, disguised in the form of work. This change was not an
                  inapt expression of the difference of female life in patriarchal and city periods.
                  Cities do not imply the highest possible civilization, though they are schools,
                  and aids to it on its upward path, any more than patriarchal customs imply the
                  highest moral good. The bread-making, blanket-weaving period, in which woman walks
                  out her tread-mill round of life in mental torpor and laborious usefulness, reads
                  well in Arcadian poetry, but it is not the purest nor the happiest. Sacred history, in depicting a life not far removed
                  in its main outlines from this we are witnessing on the border, gives us strong
                  details of domestic strife, fraternal wars, neighborly deceit, and mutual
                  injustice. Man was not high where woman was so low, and he cannot rise without
                  taking woman with him.
               But neither is the busy trifling of that we call refinement very much better;
                  though it is more pleasant to the sight, as the gay tulip is fairer-looking than
                  the rough-favored, but useful potato. It is only when society has shaped itself so
                  as to expect service from all its members, when the fruit shall follow the flower,
                  and graceful adornment keep time with solid utility, that woman and civilization
                  can be admitted to have found a position of value. Hard-working Barbara, who cooks
                  and washes for her hard-working mate; bustling Martha, who makes pickles and
                  preserves to help out the fussy hospitality of hers, who, in turn, lives perhaps
                  by thrusting himself between producer and consumer, and leeches from their
                  industry what supports his non-producing existence; exquisite Madalina, who
                  touches the harp, out-paints nature, and out-perfumes the rose, the tulip ornament
                  of the ball and promenade, are neither of them more than the third part of the
                  complete woman of complete civilization.
               Francesca seated on the ground, pretending to sew, beside Barbara, while her
                  companion is crushing the lye-softened corn under that ceaseless roller, inspired
                  me with all these philosophical ideas—that is, if I have not borrowed them of
                  somebody and forgotten where to return them—for surely the three women who now
                  live under the shade of this grove do not altogether perform what one should do,
                  and could do, under better arrangements in the duty assigned to human kind as the
                  inheritor of the world's dominion. The condition of the gift is to "subdue the
                  earth."
               A comprehensive phrase, and with its corresponding condition, that labor is man's
                  lot, clearly implies that all the descendants of Adam are bound to aid in bringing
                  forth the beauty and the riches of their earthly estates and stewardship.
               All this has very remote application to the building of our house of reeds, yet
                  that is worth some notice for its simplicity. This class of shelters—house is
                  rather an assuming word, and a mere hovel it is not—is common in all the rich
                  sequestered valleys of Mexico, and has the merit of demanding no heavier machinery
                  in the construction than an Indian's knife. In the magnificent and enchanting
                  vales of Tehuantepec, two or three of the natives will build one in a day, without
                  a nail or the sound of a hammer. Here the material is not so excellent or
                  abundant, and it required about three days to bring the wherewithal from the river
                  side, and construct a weather-proof apartment of something like twelve by twenty
                  feet. Some upright forks are cut and set in the ground to receive light
                  cross-poles for the roof. To the uprights are lashed long reeds with threads of
                     pita, both growing spontaneously and ready
                  for use all about us: the cane in the low borders of the river, and the pita on the dryest ridges. The pita bears in March and
                  April a splendid cone of creamy flowers in the centre of its cluster of evergreen
                  leaves. These leaves, slightly scorched by a slow fire, break into strong and
                  durable threads a yard long, and with the tall golden reeds, make excellent
                  building materials for summer houses and a vast variety of garden architecture. My
                  cottage resembled an enormous bird-cage; the light and air streaming through its
                  lattice-work, at will; or shut out, when desired, by curtains lining the inside.
                  This roof, however, was rather too open to the rain, even with the help of the
                  flexile mulberry boughs that interlaced above and around it; so a light thatching of a kind of long, broad-leaved
                  grass, was laid upon it, and held in its place by another course of reeds tied
                  across and to the inner basket-work. A cooler, fresher, and more picturesque abode
                  I never expect to inhabit, and all was nature's unbought gift.
               Pedro and his wife Barbara, whom we displaced, receded to the verge of the grove
                  on one side, and Fabian and his wife were disposed in a temporary kitchen and
                  dining-room, under another clump of trees opposite, and thus within call on either
                  hand, the triple family sit down, each portion under its own shade trees, in
                  contented sociability.
            
            
               OUR FLAG INSULTED.
               OUR little ark in the ocean of solitude has been stained with crime. The blackness
                  of the peon iniquity is overflowing upon us, and we are too weak and inert to dash
                  back or dyke out the hateful tide.
               It comes, too, in the form of a daring insult to our flag; an open high-handed
                  violation of our laws'; a noonday invasion of our soil; and all this in the sight
                  and hearing of one of our military posts, in the presence of one of its officers,
                  and yet no man had the manhood to hinder the perpetrators. A quiet and peaceful
                  resident, on the American side of the river, is passing his day of rest in the
                  settlement above Fort Duncan, and, while he is on the highway passing about his
                  own affairs, he is pounced upon by the birds of prey. He is not accused of any
                  crime, he is guiltless of every form of offence against the laws of the United
                  States, but he is accused of owing somebody in Mexico, and their agents—bold in
                  the sufferance of our government, and the countenance and aid of a few miscreants
                  who deal in kidnapping—have not scrupled to set our flag at defiance, and come on
                  our soil to seize their victims, and bear them off to peon bondage. There is a
                  foreigner, who partly makes a public brokerage of it—a sort of general dealer in
                  cards, calico, cheap rum and kidnapping—who drives his trade in men, without
                  scruple or disguise, under the very eye of Fort Duncan; for felonies do not spoil
                  his reception there, nor prevent other men who make resounding professions of
                  superlative honesty, from helping him, in this brave sport of hunting down debtors
                  for the slave market. They course down, like bloodhounds, the poor helpless peons,
                  that have fled to our soil for refuge. These gallant souls would not face a real
                  danger so freely, but it is gay sport to intercept a frightened fugitive, keep him
                  from defence while they hold—miracles of valor that they are—pistols to the breast
                  of the stricken peon, and tie his hands, and take him to the ferry to cross him
                  over into Mexico, to the debt-penalty of a prison, stripes, and slavery. This was
                  done while the drums of Fort Duncan were beating their martial assurance of
                  safety, in notes fraught, as our children are taught to believe, with amplest
                  protection for our citizens, our soil, our laws, and our national honor!
               One Sunday was marked by three such deeds, equally cowardly, cruel, and defiant of
                  our laws against kidnapping. On that day three peons were caught, bound, and
                  carried by lawless force from our soil. One was a woman, a slave for no debt of
                  her own, but seized and peonized for the expenses of her father's death and
                  funeral. She had served years, scantily fed and worse clothed, until, wearied of
                  her miserable condition and hopeless of any change there, she escaped from Mexico,
                  and hived out on our side of the Bravo. She was soon tracked, and, as our laws
                  stand for naught, hurried back to bondage without ceremony. And, if either
                     of these re-claimed peon slaves had been American citizens, their fate would
                     have been the same. This will startle the slavery hating ing citizens of the Union, and they will deny the
                  fact; yet I shall presently show them, by official warrant, that it is true, and
                  what will surprise them more—that their most zealous free-soil leaders have,
                  unwittingly perhaps, clenched a thousand fetters by a misdirected effort to make
                  one of them a shade lighter.
            
            
               THE FALSE WIFE.
               ONE of the victims of these chartered man-hunters was in our employ, and the
                  atrocious impunity with which he was kidnapped gave me a deep, indelible distrust
                  of our border habits, which nothing else I have ever known here would justify. It
                  shook asunder at once and forever the bonds of neighborly good-will with all the
                  sharers in the assassin work, and made me feel that Wild Cat and his band were
                  safer, nobler, and to me more acceptable company.
               We were a month perhaps under the shelter of our beloved reed cottage, when a
                  tall, slender, and not ungraceful man, of nearly, if not altogether, pure Indian
                  blood, came to seek employment in our bee-hive, at Eagle Pass, as a carpenter,
                  general servant—anything. He plead for instant work and bread for himself and his
                  wife, Saloma. She came with him—a pert, lively, fluent creature—a very Delilah in
                  her officious, caressing ways, and a Delilah, indeed, she proved to her fond
                  husband. He lived in her, and hardly could keep his eye from her even while he was
                  taking orders for the business of the day. There was something restless,
                  perturbed, and wandering in his looks and ways; something so different from the
                  stern, self-control of the Indian habits, that it attracted our notice, and,
                  before many days, we learned that he was a peon fleeing from the stripes of a
                  rigorous master at San Juan, some thirty miles in the interior.
               His blindly loved Saloma shared his flight, and her un-wifelike boast that she was
                  free and could go back to San Juan, and be happy whether her husband was peon or
                  not, as well as the exaggerated value which she placed upon the simple act of
                  following her husband's fortunes, gave me very early an unpleasant insight into
                  her flippant and selfish nature. Poor Manuel Rios held no such opinions of his
                  angel. In his eyes she was the perfection of grace, goodness, and devotion. In the
                  still softness of the summer nights I was often an amused listener, when their
                  social circle gathered round the prolonged supper, and all the gossip and
                  witticism of their class were in circulation, and never failed to observe how like
                  the needle to the pole, his thoughts always trembled back to the slight, talkative
                  thing at his side. While her workmate, our gentle, patient, industrious Barbara,
                  had no eyes, ears, heart or happiness, that did not cling to and enfold her
                  ragged, stately, kind, but—ah, me! for poor, weak, wicked human nature—most
                  inconstant Pedro: the loving, confiding Manuel fixed his steadfast worship in the
                  same way, on a false and wandering object. Even in their lowly orbit the serpent,
                  Deceit, made his entrance.
               This traffic in debt and bondage is an eternal premium to falsehood and treachery;
                  it rusts and corrodes every bond of love and confidence, as a pestilential vapor
                  eats away and blackens precious steel-work. It is the social demon of Mexico.
               One Saturday evening, after the work of the day was over, and all the people were
                  clustered round their supper in the open air, enjoying the transparent freshness
                  of the sunset breeze, for which this climate is remarkable, I observed a stranger
                  in the circle. I was told it was the father of Saloma; and therefore did not think
                  it remarkable that, while her husband Manuel went to the river with the horses,
                     they drew apart, and engaged in
                  confidential and whispered conversation. They stood close to the reed basket-work
                  of my cottage, and I retired from that side, not to play the listener to family
                  secrets. In the morning, Manuel asked for some money in advance; and, although it
                  is not wise to indulge these untaught and unreflecting children in embarrassing
                  themselves, there was such pressing need of apparel, that in part he obtained his
                  wish. Saloma was full of glee, and eager to set out for the camp above, to obtain,
                  as we thought, muslim from the suttler's store, for a new dress. I little dreamed
                  that her impatience was to obtain the price of her husband's blood. Some of our
                  people, suspicious, by bitter experience, of the temptations and facilities to
                  this kind of domestic treason, had watched and overheard enough to believe that
                  the errand of Saloma's father was to inveigle Manuel back to bondage, Saloma
                  engaged to lure him from the precincts of our place—for there a kidnapper dared
                  not come—and deliver him into the hands of his master some-where about Fort
                  Duncan. I could not credit the astounding tale, or be made to believe that
                  enslavement for debt would be upheld by force on our soil. The afternoon brought
                  us the whole story, but it was too late for help or redress.
               Manuel went with some misgivings, but they were lulled to sleep by the endearments
                  of his Delilah. After they had made their purchases, she contrived to separate
                  from him while he continued up the highway towards the warehouse of his employer.
                  Nearly in front of it he was beset by the kidnapper in wait for him, but, for a
                  moment, he shook himself clear, and took refuge in a house near by in which he had
                  a right to expect safety. He was driven forth to meet the presented pistol of the
                  pursuer, who was now reinforced by an American gentleman. Defence was
                  now impossible; his hands were bound, and he was led to the ferry and speedily
                  crossed over to the Mexican side, and then lodged in prison. What became of his
                  false-hearted Saloma I know not, but the next day Manuel was bound on a horse and
                  conveyed to the chains and whipping-post of San Juan.
               All the most respectable inhabitants of Eagle Pass united in laying this case in
                  particular before the Secretary of State, because it was so open and public, and
                  because it embodied facts and precedents on which it was imperative for the
                  well-being of all the inhabitants of the border to have some definite
                  understanding with the Mexican Government. It was hardly possible that any
                  American Secretary of State would fail to demand back the victims thus wrenched by
                  force from the shelter of our flag, much less that he would allow such a practice
                  to stand unrebuked—and even sustained—in its insulting violations of our national
                  soil and sovereignty. The meanest power in Christendom would not endure such an
                  outrage without protest; and he who could write such an elaborate letter to
                  Hulsemann for his own honor, could hardly do less than bestow an hour on a
                  question that touched to the core the honor of the republic. Spain had invaded our
                  soil at New Orleans, and bore off Rey, and the outrage was hushed up and
                  overlooked in a most ignominious manner. She had seized the letter-bags of our
                  ships in the ports of Cuba, and we resolutely shut our eyes, we even recalled the
                  able and patriotic consul, General Campbell, in the fear that he would be more
                  strenuous than civil in defending our flag and citizens from outrage. Austria had
                  offered us a deep insult at Constantinople, but as it made no text for eloquent
                  declamation—it was borne in silence, and buried forever in the Dead Sea of the
                  State Department. Yet, with all these omissions of duty before our eyes, we,
                  credulous borderers, were actually sanguine enough to believe that our Cabinet
                  would have the courage to protect the inhabitants of the frontier from actual invasion by these lawless Mexicans. Thus
                  far we had seen no example of this hoped-for border protection, and some said even
                  then that the Government which permitted our citizens to be plundered and
                  maltreated, as they had been at Tehuantepec and other parts of Mexico, would take
                  it very lightly if the Mexicans came a step farther, and carried us off of our own
                  soil to deal out their pleasure on us in Mexico. However, the memorial went on to
                  Washington, and after a time there came this very luminous and logical reply from
                  the Department of State. If it emanated from a less renowned head than that of the
                  "foremost lawyer of the age," one might venture to say that it is as weak in its
                  legal positions as it is imbecile in its patriotism and false in its
                  statesmanship. I have put in italics the closing sentence; but aside from this,
                  here is an exact copy of this extraordinary.
            
            
               CABINET LETTER.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "DEPARTMENT OF STATE, WASHINGTON, 17th December,
                                 1850.
                           
                           "SIR—I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th
                              ultimo, with the accompanying papers relative to the abduction of
                              Manuel Rios, from Eagle Pass, in Texas, in September last, by Dennis
                              Meade, of Piedras Negras, in Mexico, who claimed the services of Rios,
                              as a Peon, under the law of the Mexican Republic.
                           "As it does not appear that any officer of that Republic was concerned
                              in the abduction, the case is not one which would warrant an
                              application to the Mexican Government. If, however, Mr. Meade should
                              have violated any law of the State of Texas, the authorities of that
                              State can cause him to be prosecuted therefor whenever he may be found
                              within their jurisdiction. If also Rios should assert
                              that he is wrongfullyfully held in bondage in Mexico, he
                              must make good his claims to freedom, before the judicial tribunals of
                              Mexico.
                           
                              "Your obedient servant,
                              "DANIEL WEBSTER."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               It would be a salutary hint to some of our public servants to hear how their
                  short-comings in law and patriotism are discussed by our straightforward,
                  plain-spoken men of the frontier. They care not a pin for high names; if they do
                  not see common sense and manly truth in it, they will let nothing pass without
                  trying the ring of the metal. They yield to Caesar, frankly and generously, what
                  is due to Caesar, but they must believe it is due before they grant their
                  tribute.
               Mr. Webster's letter was read to a little knot of these sturdy reasoners, and each
                  characteristic comment had a voter's weight:
               "To say that it does not warrant an application to Mexico, when a resident on our
                  soil is kidnapped," exclaimed one; "Mr. Webster never said that; he can't take
                  such a position, it would leave every man and woman on the border at the mercy of
                  the Mexicans."
               "It is so set down," said the recipient of the letter, showing the signature and
                  official seal of the Secretary of State.
               "Nothing but my own eyes could have convinced me that such a paper could come from
                  this administration," was the slow response.
               "We need not send to Washington to learn that the State authorities can punish an
                  infraction of their State laws," observed one of the memorialists.—"What we asked
                  of the wisdom of the Cabinet, was the redress of a wrong done to the nation, and
                  in the case when the offence and the victim had passed beyond State
                  jurisdiction."
               
               "You have the answer, here: the crime against our flag and laws goes for nothing,
                  and if kidnapped people don't like slavery they must 'make good their claims to
                  freedom before the tribunals of Mexico.'"
               "But, Sir, suppose the kidnapped man were an American citizen—one of us here
                  present?" persisted the profane doubter of Washington infallibility.
               "The principle here set forth is the same," was the reply. "There is no hint of
                  security or redress in any case where the kidnapper is not an officer of the
                  Mexican government."
               "Then you mean to say that any body else can come here and seize people to make
                  peons of them in Mexico whenever they please," repeated the unsatisfied
                  querist.
               "I repeat that such is the tenor of this official document," replied the
                  proprietor thereof.
               "If there is no help against Mexicans coming here to steal men, there can be no
                  way to prevent our following up and shooting the stealers on the Mexican side,"
                  put in an old borderer, who, upon the whole, liked this independent, self-relying
                  view of the case.
               "Well," said the first speaker, after a long pause, "Well, I thought this
                  administration more patriotic,"—another pause—"and this Cabinet more
                  politic,"—another pause—"and Mr. Webster a sounder lawyer,"—and then a longer and
                  sadder pause—for he had always been an enthusiastic "Webster man."
               "As to administrations, they are pretty much alike in these omissions," said his
                  friend; "and as to the legal soundness and patriotism of the thing, they never
                  expected to hear of it again from this remote border, and that makes an immense
                  difference; but, honestly, now, would this affair change your vote in any degree,
                  if the man you now condemn were nominated for the Presidency by your party?"
               "Candidly, then, I should all the same feel bound to support the nominees, of my
                  party," was the frank reply.
               So faded and effete has become the preserving salt of republican virtue, that
                  sensible men, of good repute, make no scruple to avow that party over-rides
                  principle and country." I must support the candidate of my party.
               "What an abyss of mire and corruption; what a sinking depth of moral decadence;
                  what a departure from the lofty spirit of '76 there is in that perverse cry! It
                  loads the air, it taints the moral health of the nation, and makes every returning
                  election day more vilely opposite to what it should be, a jubilee of sacred
                  duties.
               "We will support our party, even in its wrong-doings."
               "We will elect our men, by whatever means we may."
               "We will divide the spoils, though the Union dies under the knife."
               These are the reigning laws of party in these latter days; and if on these rocks
                  we are not wrecked, our national greatness may outlive the stars, for if not in
                  them, there exists no danger for our republic.
               In dismissing this subject—for the time at least—I will only add that on the
                  receipt of this singular, and, to most, unexpected, refusal to guard our soil from
                  invasion and our residents from enslavement in Mexico, an appeal was had to the
                  United States Senate. On the call of that body for information, February 26th,
                  1851, the Secretary of State suppressed the above letter, and
                  presented such an incomplete account of the affair as laid the matter asleep. If
                  Mr. Webster were by any chance to be so extravagant as to get into debt—which,
                  however, is scarcely supposable—how painful it would be to his legion of admirers
                  to have his rules applied to himself; how
                  afflicting to see the most illustrious son of New England rated on the serf-roll
                  at five dollars a month, and condemned to live on a peck and a half of corn a
                  week!
            
            
               BAPTISTE THE BORDERER.
               THE first family that raised a roof-tree and gathered round a hearth-stone in
                  Eagle Pass, after the proprietors, was such as one as can only be found in our
                  American frontier settlements. Our invaluable Baptiste and his family are born
                  children of the border. They could not find contentment and house-room if a clear,
                  untroubled space of forty or fifty miles of wilderness did not lay behind them,
                  for air and exercise. There is only this difference of taste between husband and
                  wife, and that is almost universal in genuine frontiersmen. The man looks back
                  with an ever-longing eye to the wild freedom of the receding forest; the woman,
                  and mother, turns hers eagerly forward to meet the coming civilization, and thinks
                  hopefully of the day in which she shall be able to dress and school her children,
                  "as they do in the settlements." Baptiste carries with him my heartiest
                  sympathies, when I see how kindly and bravely he rules down his strong natural
                  impulses, and strives and toils, and builds and plants, with affectionate
                  docility, to gratify his wife with a regular home, and to gather around her the
                  household wealth of a thrifty farmer. His honest, weather-beaten race beams all
                  over with proud satisfaction when his wife and children are dressed to their taste
                  in fine and fashionable apparel, although, for himself, he would not give his
                  fox-skin hunting-pouch for all the contents of all the tailors' shops in the
                  Union. So, too, of churches and schools; he is ready to admit they are excellent
                  things for the children, since his wife says so, but can't conceive how such
                  things could be of any use to him. Yet, Baptiste is not without a rough-hewed idea
                  of religion, or rather of superstition, which is a kind of left-handed religion,
                  since it rests upon a reverential sense of some Great Cause, above and independent
                  of human self-sufficiency. He offers, in his own crude way, his incense of prayer
                  and thanksgiving to the Eternal Father, and could not be persuaded that any other
                  mortal could teach him better than he knows himself, how his helmsman conscience
                  must steer his way to the narrow gate that opens into the other world.
               He reminds us incessantly of Cooper's inimitable Leather Stocking, if we could
                  imagine that simple and sincere woodsman falling in love and winning the heart of
                  a sprightly, industrious girl of mixed blood, whose greatest ambition it is to
                  live in the settled and comfortable independence of the white women.
               Parthena—for that, in true border taste for original and high-sounding words—is
                  the classic name of Baptiste's wife, had lived awhile in the precincts of a
                  Mexican frontier camp, and her impatient desire for a respectable and secure home
                  was increased by the absence of everything like it, in that sink of lawless
                  misrule. She wished us to assign them a homestead within our limits, where her
                  pigs and poultry, her bee-hives and dove-house, her cows and her children, could
                  live and flourish under American laws. I liked her honest ambition and
                  straightforward plans, and cordially promised her all the aid and good will I
                  could command. Baptiste, who thinks no labor painful that contributes to his
                  wife's happiness, chose forthwith the site for his habitation, and took
                  possession. He threw a blanket over a long outstretching arm of a mesquete, leaned
                  his gun against the trunk, hung his shot-pouch by its side—a sure sign that hard
                  work was in question—and began,
                  single-handed, to construct his house. His canoe and hatchet, with a spade and
                  pick-axe, borrowed for the emergency, was all he wanted, and almost before we had
                  thought twice about it, he came to borrow a team to "bring home his old woman and
                  his plunder." Our kind-hearted neighbor, Mr. Campbell, turned out his enormous
                  wagon, a second Noah's ark, on wheels, with a faithful hand and a perfect
                  procession of the magnificent oxen for which Texas is famous. Our contribution was
                  less imposing, but it was sufficient, and in due time Parthena was installed in
                  her own house by her exulting husband.
               His house, the work of his own hands, is worth describing, both as a model for
                  self-helping architects, and because it is like Baptiste himself, a curious graft
                  of civilization on the natural stock.
            
            
               A FRONTIER DWELLING.
               OUR embryo town lies on a sloping prairie, sprinkled with mesquete trees like a
                  vast and venerable orchard, and falling in successive platforms or terraces down
                  to the river's edge. The bank nearest to the water—and only divided from it by a
                  narrow strip of rich interval, scantily dotted with young mulberry trees—is a
                  steep bluff of ten or twelve feet in height; and in the face of this bluff our man
                  of nature has concealed his temporary dwelling. I say concealed, for there is
                  nowhere around it a sign of human habitation to break the smooth expanse of the
                  platform, until you wend down its face and actually penetrate the little hidden
                  ravine that opens into his door. Then, all at once stands revealed a spacious,
                  lightsome chamber, scooped out of the hill-side. The front, looking towards the
                  river, and on the intervening garden-ground, is latticed with reeds, and cunningly
                  veiled by the earth and herbage of the bank, but is still pleasantly previous to
                  the cheering breeze and fresh light of this genial climate. The other three sides
                  are cut square and even from the solid earth, which is here a favorable admixture
                  of sand and clay, and requires no other walls or support. On these rests the roof.
                  Willow and sycamore poles of sufficient size and strength stretch from side to
                  side; and closely laid on these supporters is a cross carpet of reeds, which is
                  again covered with a thick layer of grass and earth. A carriage might drive over
                  this sod-roof, so slily spread, even with the general surface, without suspecting
                  the existence of a dwelling beneath, or endangering in the least the safety of its
                  inmates. A plaster of mud, slightly tempered with lime—which any man may make for
                  himself in this limestone region—gives whiteness and finish to these earth walls,
                  and the quarries of beautifully stratified sandstone from the hills that back the
                  town supplies a firm and durable floor for the trouble of bringing home and laying
                  down the natural flags.
               All this is Baptiste's own handiwork, and a proud, little woman is his busy,
                  saving wife, as she surveys it, while she bestirs herself among her milk-pans and
                  her poultry. For love of her, this wandering hunter gave up the life of his
                  choice; for her sake his hands resigned the gun and dug this grot for her comfort;
                  he explored the islands for his reeds and rafters; for her sake he forgot the
                  tempting fish in the limpid Escondida, to handle the axe and raft over, with only
                  the help of his light canoe, the timber for his simple frame-work.
               The millionaire, who gives the partner of his wealth the overflowings of his
                  golden cup, wherewith to make ostentation of their luxury, cannot make such a
                  heart-offering as does this love-tamed rover of the wilds when he thus "gives his
                  body to painful toil" to create for his wife comforts, which to him, personally, are absolutely superfluous and
                  of no value whatever.
               Yet, with wifely tact, Parthena is careful not to interfere with her husband's
                  ways, or undervalue his favorite pursuits. He hunts, and fishes, and traces up the
                  wild bee at discretion, and his table rarely lacks a plentiful supply of the best
                  that the field and river can furnish, though now and then, perhaps, a little to
                  the detriment of his more regular pursuits. We come in largely for the benefits of
                  these excursions, in consequence of the little acts of kindness we were enabled to
                  show his "old woman," who by the way must be decidedly on the bright side of
                  twenty-eight. Scarcely a day passes in which the tall form of Baptiste does not
                  loom along, and, without more ado, deposit in the cook's hands a choice wild
                  turkey, a brace of ducks, a handful of pigeons, partridges, or some other offering
                  of the chase, and then he disappears, as abruptly as he came.
               Setting aside these bribes to good-will, this obliging, off-handed, independence
                  sets so well upon them, and is brightened withal by such a willing, self-helping
                  industry, that I am never tired of watching the busy, cheerful ways of the family,
                  and never see them without a wish that the millions of working men who have, as he
                  had at first, no capital but their own strong-hands, were able, like him, to build
                  themselves free homes, and collect around them the elements of independence, and
                  so rear their children to the stature of free-men.
            
            
               SOCIAL DISTINCTIONS.
               YET I ramble from the main subject. Our town was began. It held a commodious
                  double tent, with the first settler and proprietor, Mr. C., and his lady, that was
                  the aristocratic party. Then our reed shelter and its twain. We were the
                  democratic middle class, and close upon us was the thatched shed of Don Guillermo
                  the mason, in blood, bone and sinew, pure Indian; he constituted the radical
                  native American party. Finally there was a score of men quarrying out stone and
                  making adobes; some of these were free-born toilers, the working-class, about
                  which all men talk brotherhood and philanthropy, but to whom few give the warm
                  right hand in cordial fellowship with a hearty "Let us work together, my brother."
                  Below this is still another rank, enduring all the ills and blight of slavery, but
                  with none to sorrow, none to pray with them, for there is no political capital, no
                  religious fame to be made out of the Mexican peon.
               If he lived in the almost impenetrable heart of Asia, and the trumpet of
                  benevolence could come sounding over the ocean billows, bless me, how busy would
                  be our missionary love! If he spoke an impracticable tongue, how we would send him
                  tracts! but who ever did, how can any one get up a high-steam-pressure of
                  enthusiasm for the misery and darkness that lies down and dies at our door-step?
                  The thing is preposterous. When we live among it, even African servitude excites
                  no sympathy, that is, none of that generous over-boiling sympathy that unlocks our
                  purses and disposes us to burn the houses over the heads of cold-blooded,
                  unfeeling owners. Distance lends enthusiasm as well as enchantment to the view,
                  and against the crowds who devote their lives to the Malays and Hottentots, we
                  have hardly a Fry or a Howard to do as much for our domestic heathen.
               In our Mexican family, now that they were in such close vicinity, I could trace
                  the destructive course of peonage, and was forced, against many prejudices, to see
                  that it was more deadly and blighting than African slavery. Laying aside
                  specialities and special pleading, peonage has dragged down ten or twelve millions
                  of Indians on this continent to half their number and to a most abased and hopeless condition. African slavery snatched
                  some hundred thousand slaves from a land of gross and cruel slavery, and raised
                  them and their descendants to a Christian and moral elevation incomparably
                  superior to any condition we know of the race in their native land. I do not say
                  we should continue a wrong that good may come of it. I do not say we should, and I
                  know in this age we cannot, keep alive the slave-trade, or unduly retard the
                  liberation of the bondman; but whoever will look at it calmly, will say that the
                  broadest and deepest of American sins is the enslavement, degradation and
                  slaughter of the Red Race.
            
            
               SLAVERY EXTENSION.
               HERE, then, was the first blow struck towards the creation of the
                     town of Eagle Pass. The name existed before, a simple
                  translation of the term "Paso de Aguila," the "Eagle Ford," or Pass, by which this
                  crossing was known to the Mexican traders and soldiers. Here a part of those who
                  came to re-conquer Texas from the Texans swept across the Bravo. Here, when Mexico
                  was in turn invaded by the Americans, Captain Veach had his encampment, and
                  recorded its name in his dispatches to Washington. It shows how very willing this
                  section of Mexico was to be conquered; in that Captain Veach kept a population of
                  more thousands than he had tens, of armed men in quiet order during the fiercest
                  portion of the war. The first clamor of discontent broke out in the towns of this
                  district of Mexico, when it was understood they were to have back their own
                  soldier despots. The peon holders were the least willing to be Americanized,
                  because they also own all the land, are not taxed either for land or slaves, and
                  are themselves co-partners in the government with the soldier chieftains. The
                  actual tillers of the soil, the tenders of the herds, those whose labor extracts
                  from the earth what wealth Mexico produces, would have gained freedom, hope,
                  education and religious light under our laws, and so far as they knew, or cared
                  anything about it, desired the change. With what glossy rhetoric, but most absurd
                  statesmanship did members of Congress declaim, day after day, until the very
                  columns of the legislative halls must have ached with their stupidity, on the
                  danger of "extending slavery," by taking in Mexican territory! Every
                  town so received was an orphan caught up from the desert of sin and servitude, and
                  folded to the cherishing bosom of light and liberty. Where the African slaves were
                  to come from to extend slavery I never could learn, for none are brought to us
                  from other countries, and those who merely change their residence from one section
                  to the other leave room behind them for free labor to step in and reign. Slavery
                  may roll away more and more to the South and prepare the way for white industry,
                  as it has been doing from the first days of the republic, but this "extension" cry
                  is a chimera, a fiction of party pleading, and in twenty years men will wonder at
                  those who believed in it, as we of to-day wonder at witchcraft, epidemics, and
                  religious wars. As African slavery recedes southward and breaks into new fields,
                  waiting to be subdued to civilization, it leaves at the North, State after State,
                  emancipated ground, and always on it an offering of freedmen. Slavery has had its
                  mission, and when the work is done, and the lesson taught, it will expire by its
                  inherent terms of limitation.
            
            
               
               A CHARACTER.
               THEvery day I came to take possession of my cane cottage I unearthed a new and
                  valuable inhabitant of our city—of the future. I mined out an excellent carpenter
                  and a useful neighbor from the heart of a small mountain of lumber, in which he
                  had interred himself with his box of tools, work-bench and kitchen assortment. I
                  have pondered long and thoughtfully upon it, but to this day I cannot make out
                  whether he contrived his own path to the centre, or whether those huge piles of
                  boards and beams closed up spontaneously around him. He was an eccentric genius,
                  from North Carolina I think, not at all afraid of hard work or rough fare, and
                  well skilled to improve his wild and independent house-keeping by fishing and
                  hunting, but stoutly resolved not to know anything, or approve anything, about the
                  Mexicans. It was his daily comfort to lecture them upon their careless, unskilful
                  ways, and it did not seem to abate a particle of the unction that none of them
                  understood a word he said. They would stand still and listen with an air of grave
                  and respectful attention to the end, and when he clinched his rebuke with his
                  regular closing question:—
               "Now, don't you think you are the most trifling, good-for-nothing beings that were
                  ever seen upon the earth since it was created?"
               They would as regularly reply to what they could observe was an emphatic
                  interrogatory, and but polite to answer in the affirmative, with a cordial—
               "Si, Señor."
               After this refreshment Harris would return to his saw and plane, a relieved man
                  for the day. It was not his fault if the Mexicans did not know their
                  deficiencies.
               By way of parenthesis in his contract for a warehouse and ferry scow, he built a
                  light skiff for Don Juan Fernandez, who lived in an island of live oaks on the
                  rolling prairie, almost as solitary and self-sufficing as his famous namesake did
                  on his island of the ocean. A fertile, well-watered, and eminently beautiful and
                  healthy stretch of country, equal in extent to the State of Delaware, and no whit
                  behind it in the value of its natural resources, is owned by the Fernandez kith
                  and kin, but all this immense sweep of splendid land is unoccupied by its
                  proprietors. With the exception of Don Juan, who now has come over to Eagle Pass
                  with about three hundred of his cattle, there are none of the owners who bring
                  their families even temporarily to live on their ranchos. Nothing but peons and
                  cattle, with a slight occasional sprinkle of Indian visitors, have homes in this
                  tempting range. No Mexican I ever met has even an idea of what English and
                  Americans mean by a country life.
               We found our boats delightful auxiliaries, for we followed Don Juan's example, and
                  supplied ourselves with the means of enjoying the water, and we visited in them
                  many a cosey little nook for a gypsey dinner, that we never would have found by a
                  land path.
               The first trip was to the Bathing Rapids on the Escondida. For half a mile the
                  stream shoots along between its walls of verdure in a clear and steady volume, but
                  at that distance we came upon the dancing, singing, rejoicing rapids, that rush
                  laughingly over the rocky bed, water-hollowed into innumerable natural baths. In
                  these cradles the idle or timid bather may recline at careless length, and the
                  caressing tide will lift him in its cool embrace, and enfold and lave his indolent
                  limbs in its watery delights without the cost of an effort. There is not such
                  another limpid, refreshing consolation and cure for indolence within a hundred
                  miles. The two miles that Fort Duncan
                  is above the pure current of the Escondida, places it just that distance above its
                  proper location, not less on account of the health and comfort of its garrison
                  than in the military view of its also being that far removed from the point
                  commanding the best fords and inlets to the Mexican trade and settlements.
               It is a singular dispensation of nature that for scores of miles the Mexican bank
                  of the Bravo is enriched with a continual succession of ever-living
                     springs—"ojos de agua," or, "water eyes," as
                  the Mexicans call them, while on the American side opposite, no one has been
                  found. The want of frequent and permanent water-courses is felt on our side of the
                  Bravo, from Santa Fé to the Gulf, as a great drawback to rapid and extended
                  settlements.
            
            
               WELLS.
               SPEAKING of water supply, I would remind those who are opening farms that in this
                  climate, where, with water, crops are so varied, so certain, and so abundant, and
                  land withal so cheap, wells and means of irrigation should be counted as a part of
                  their capital investment, for no part of it would so securely return them a high
                  interest. A farm of a mile square, with more or less water front, can be
                  purchased, together with a pair of working oxen and half a dozen milk cows, for a
                  thousand dollars. Another two hundred dollars—to take sure margin, say five
                  hundred—will, by the various improvements lately made in water-raising machinery,
                  insure irrigation to gardens and orchards that will give back annually and
                  certainly thirty or forty per cent. on this whole investment. There is no space
                  here for long sums in arithmetic, but the whole history of agriculture where
                  irrigation is practised, establishes the fact. The same outlay in land, the same
                  labor in cultivating it, will, under this sky of almost ceaseless sunshine, ensure
                  double crops to the farmer. If, therefore, his works for the supply of water do
                  perchance cost half as much as his land, they will still remain that portion of
                  his invested capital which returns to him the largest and surest interest.
               Wind-mill wells can certainly be erected to good account any where in the
                  long-extended valley of the Rio Bravo. The breeze is strong and constant from the
                  sea most part of the year, and the nature of the country argues extensive
                  substrata of water. It is found at about thirty feet below the surface at Fort
                  Duncan, but how far the amount would supply irrigation has never been tried.
                  Americans are hardly aware that the richest and most productive countries of
                  ancient civilization depended almost wholly upon artificial power for water, but
                  that with it their two or three crops a year made them marvels of wealth and
                  fertility.
               Embankments, and machinery for making the rapids and even the high annual freshets
                  available for irrigation, can be applied with great economy and effect at Eagle
                  Pass and a hundred other points on the Bravo, and some day the right man will come
                  to confer on us this one thing needful, and ensure himself the while a splendid
                  fortune.
            
            
               MELON SUGAR.
               THERE are certain valuable productions for which this valley is peculiarly
                  adapted, and which are in all times unfailing staples of national wealth. Among
                  them will be sugar, and wines of generous quality. At the World's Fair will be
                  seen the first feeble offerings of the experimental vintages of the Union, but it
                  is not probable the Lone Star will be there.
               So, too, I look in vain for a display of sugars, and our infant fant sugar interest is no contemptible feature in
                  our domestic trade and home consumption. There are several varieties of sugar
                  besides that extracted from the cane, which can be profitably manufactured in the
                  United States, if from war or any cause it is desirable to be independent of other
                  nations for that article of daily, abundant and universal use among the
                  Americans.
               Of these ranks first, the delicious sugar of the maple, whose healthy and delicate
                  sweets are almost unknown in Europe.
               Then comes pumpkin sugar, as simple and economical, or rather more so, than the
                  beet sugar, which France is finding so available in her domestic industry. Then we
                  have beet sugar, and corn-stalk sugar, like the last, only to be made profitable
                  on a large scale and with adequate machinery. There are localities in the Northern
                  States in which the soil, amplitude of intelligence and corps of fit laborers
                  would make the culture of the pumpkin sugar desirable. The North American
                  Phalanx—to whom all prosperity—have the soil and the men to make it a profitable
                  branch of their system. I trust when the next World's Fair is mustered under
                  United States auspices, (and to do it well, the American Institute has but to take
                  it in hand and make Mr. Barnum one of their managers,) that we shall have a fine
                  collection of specimen sugars. Three kinds I have named, besides the luscious
                  maple and the well-known cane sugars, but there is a sixth kind sleeping in
                  darkness, that only waits a kindly introduction to become of great importance to
                  us on this border river, and to the Union, and that is melon sugar. There is no
                  limit to the quantities the Rio Grande country is capable of producing, and an
                  acre of melons will yield as many gallons of syrup, and of course we may presume
                  sugar also, as the average yield of the cane fields of Louisiana. The apparatus
                  for crushing melons is simpler and cheaper than for the cane mills, as a common
                  cider press, propelled by mule or horse power, will make five hundred barrels of
                  the melon juice, which will yield five thousand pounds of sugar, in a month. The
                  sugar is sweet, finer in flavor and color than the Mexican cane sugar, and will
                  command here ten cents a pound to the producer. I do not know (it remains to be
                  tried) how many hands would be necessary to boil and finish off the sugar with the
                  necessary apparatus, but it may be observed that Mexican laborers can be hired and
                  rationed at less cost than plantation slaves can be maintained, if to the interest
                  on the purchase price of the slaves we add the cost of their regular food and
                  clothing. On the Mexican side of the river five dollars a month, and an allowance
                  of a peck and a half of corn a week for food, is a fair rate. We have always paid
                  more than twice that for our permanent servants, but of late we have repeated
                  proffers of good shepherds and field hands for six and seven dollars a month, with
                  the addition of meat and coffee rations, which the Americans have made the custom,
                  and therefore a social law at Eagle Pass.
               Our whole-hearted border man Baptiste has made the trial of the watermelon syrup
                  in comparison with the cane juice, and the result satisfies me that melon sugar
                  can be made a regular and profitable item of American agriculture. In all that
                  wide belt of Southern States in which cane sugar is of doubtful or impossible
                  culture, the more hardy melon can take its place. There are immense districts in
                  Virginia and North Carolina in which no other crop can be raised to equal
                  advantage. The watermelon is a proved experiment, as far as its saccharine
                  qualities and productiveness are the question, but I am waiting in most anxious
                  faith for the trial of the muskmelon, for I have an idea that it will be the best
                  sugar producer after cane, with the advantage of living in a colder climate and on land too light for the cane.
                  If I am right in this opinion, it will introduce a new and profitable culture in
                  other sections than the valley of the Rio Grande.
            
            
               THE BLUE WATER.
               ABOUT three miles from us on the Mexican side is a lovely tree-embowered lakelet,
                  so deep, clear, and transparent, that it looks like a little piece of the sky
                  dropped down under those cool shades, and for this it is called Aguita Azul, or, the Blue Water. Few about us have
                  taken the interest to explore the beauties of this sylvan waste, and are therefore
                  ignorant of the fine fishing and bathing that may be found within an hour's easy
                  ride from our ferry. The scenery, the primitive inhabitants, and the wild,
                  out-door repast are sufficient for me, and the like thereof no city can proffer to
                  my taste. Yet so many other charming places tempted me, that I was long in
                  reaching the crowning enchantment of the Blue Water, but the while it grew to my
                  memory by some indelible wayside incidents that chanced to join themselves to its
                  name.
               One day we were loitering under the twisted vines that wove together the branches
                  of a brace of sturdy elms, turning over some curious petrified mosses that
                  bordered our chosen spring, and discussing with our biscuits the comparative
                  merits of the Blue Pool and a sister lakelet somewhat on this side of it, when a
                  handsome boy of fourteen or fifteen glided into the circle, with the usual soft,
                  noiseless step of an Indian. Unseen by us, he had observed us busy with the
                  petrified grasses, and brought, by way of introduction, some specimens still
                  whiter and more curious, from another spring. We accepted and admired them, and
                  gave him of our refreshments, but he still lingered near, though modestly silent
                  and apart from our conversation. This is the Mexican and Indian way of hinting
                  they have a favor to ask or something to communicate, and the very children will
                  wait in calm patience for hours to be questioned, before they will obtrude their
                  errand. Our winning lad was soon brought to confession. He wanted a remedio, that is, a cure for a sprained wrist. He
                  never changed a muscle while they examined whether the bone was displaced. Happily
                  it was not, and the cold-water remedy was ordered—as it proved—with eminent
                  success. After directing our impromptu friend where to find us at home, to get
                  bandages and some other little matters which we thought proper to prescribe in our
                  medical capacity, we exchanged ceremonious adios, and he returned to the house of his friend Placida, who
                  lived, as he said, not far from the Blue Water. "Not far," means in Mexican any
                  where between two rods and two leagues.
               A Mexican circa (near by) is a dangerous trust for a tired traveller, but our boy
                  was not more than a mile or so at random that time.
               The next week he came, by permission of his master, to thank me for his now
                  perfected cure, and to bring me a pretty pair of chickens, probably the whole sum
                  of his earthly wealth. It would not be kind to refuse a gift which he had walked
                  some miles and consumed his holiday to bring me, and besides, as I glanced at his
                  scant garments, I saw a mode of honorable restitution, but I did not know his
                  name, and I inquired it.
               "Jesus de Dios (Jesus of God,) at your service, Madama."
               "Where is your father?"
               "I have none; he is dead, but mi tio Dios (my
                  uncle God) is a peon on the poor little rancho of the Holy Ghost (Espiritu Santo),
                  near Monclova."
               "Then you do not like the rancho your uncle lives upon?"
               "No; the Holy Ghost is very mean; it is too dry to pro— duce corn or beans, and the peons are badly
                  treated, so I ran away from it, and was accommodated by my
                  master."
               
                  To be accommodated is the phrase for being sold, or selling one's
                  self. The soft, smooth way in which law and custom words the whole system of
                  peonage, is in strange contrast to the levity with which sacred names are lavished
                  on every hand. We have a farm laborer named Jesus, and two or three female Jesusas
                  about us. A low drinking-shop in the Mexican capital was called La Madre de Dios (the Mother of God), and the like
                  blasphemous uses are made of all the names of the Trinity without the slightest
                  sense of impropriety, throughout Spain and Spanish America.
            
            
               PLACIDA.
               THE boy Jesus spoke of Placida as the friend who stood closest to him in the
                  absence of parents, home and kindred, and I afterwards learned that his esteem was
                  not misplaced, for even in her rude and stinted lot, she found scope to show
                  kindness and practice virtues. But what a commentary is her story on the social
                  abasement fostered and forced by the adulterous union of church and state! The law
                  bribes the Mexican priesthood to lend its influence to the proprietors of the
                  soil, by exacting enormous fees for every religious service. The legal rates for
                  marriage, baptism and sepulture, are beyond credibility. The poorer classes must
                  sell themselves to the rich to buy them, or they must dispense with them
                  altogether, yet the poor toiler, whom no one cares to instruct in anything else,
                  is most carefully instructed that the due observance of these rites is the only
                  gate to heaven. The legal marriage fee ranges from twenty to twenty-seven dollars,
                  a sum the ill-paid laborers of Mexico rarely can command. Of course immense
                  numbers have the alternative of not marrying at all, or of selling themselves into
                  bondage to satisfy the church. Many mate without its sanction, and if the priests
                  were not very much better than the law desires them to be, thousands more would
                  live and die unwedded. The demoralization is frightful where the primary bond of
                  society sits so lightly. The perfidy, ill—treatment, desertions, and depraved
                  family obligations, that grow out of it, are undermining the whole social fabric,
                  for the higher orders do not escape the reaction of the poisonous harvest sown by
                  their cankered laws.
               By the fountain side, as she sat alone at the close of a week of sorrowful toil, I
                  found Placida, and drew from her heavy-laden heart her history and her griefs. Her
                  mother, a peon, and the wife of a peon—though both claimed more white than Indian
                  blood—had lived in poverty and hardship an unwedded wife, until death struck her
                  down. Her tardy conscience woke in the delirious agonies of dissolution, and then
                  she gave two of her children to servitude to purchase the marriage rite and secure
                  for her body Christian burial. Thus she ended a life of sin against herself by a
                  not less sin against her little children.
               The young Placida was one of these motherless ones, but she fell into gentle hands
                  and was reared by a kindly mistress more like a daughter than a servant. She was
                  taught all the elaborate handiwork for which Mexican females are celebrated; and
                  in the capacity of camerara or chamber companion
                  of her mistress acquired as much of grace and intelligence, with more wit and
                  beauty, than fell to the lot of any of the old lady's numerous band of nieces and
                  kinswomen.
               A young man of pure white blood and excellent family, though poor and an orphan
                  himself, saw Placida and fell in love like an Indian. That is to say, with the
                  deep inflexible determination to win her at any cost, through any danger and with no care for the future. He
                  offered his own body to servitude for her freedom and her love in marriage band.
                  He was accepted, or rather the Mexican law, which is very good—when a man is rich
                  enough to buy it—enabled him to gain his wishes in this way. A peon can demand his
                     cuenta, or account with his master, if he
                  finds another master who is willing to take him and pay it, and for this reason
                  every master is strenuous to increase the cuenta
                  by setting down the soap the peon uses to wash his clothes, every ounce of meat,
                  or lard, or sugar, with which he is tempted to improve his miserable ration of a
                  peck of corn a week; every day lost in sickness and every particle of medicine he
                  is forced to swallow, every thread of raiment for himself and family, if in his
                  loneliness he is mad enough to seek the solace of a companion, all goes to swell
                  his account and make a change of masters hopeless, and often mortgages his
                  children also to slavery.
               A capable, active man like Marco, light and lithe of limb, and skilful alike in
                  the charge of herds and the labors of the field, is worth ready money, wherever
                  bone and sinew is current coin (and I know not the corner of the world where the
                  sweat and life-blood of the laborer is not bought and sold for the benefit of the
                  rich man), and so Marco found his master in a cousin more favored than himself by
                  fortune. The cuenta of his betrothed was
                  demanded and paid, the benediction of the church bought with the same blood-money,
                  and he came with his bride to a solitary but pleasant rancho, a few miles from
                  Eagle Pass, to commence with her the hard and narrow life of a farm peon. In time
                  their lowly abode was brightened by the sunshine of childish mirth. How
                  unspeakably dear is this gift from heaven to parents like them! In their
                  loneliness and poverty, that baby-boy was the sole light of life. The sun darkened
                  in the sky when the angel of death snatched him from their arms. In the frenzy of
                  their love and bereavement, they gave all they had left to sacrifice—the freedom
                  of Placida—to lay the cross of baptism on its expiring brow, and buy a place for
                  the too dear clay in consecrated ground.
               The unhappy parents must not die slaves in that gloomy and desolated hovel; but
                  when I strove to make the afflicted mother share in such hopes, she only replied
                  by words of her lost child. She mourned less that she is no longer free than that
                  she is no longer a mother.
            
            
               VICTOR IN PERIL.
               AN evil genius seems to pursue our heedless, poetical, tender-hearted,
                  light-headed favorite, Victor. He is always pitching headlong into some
                  difficulty, and at whatever cost he extricates himself from one to-day, he is
                  always ready to plunge into another to-morrow. Yet he never bears malice, never
                  casts reproach or blame on another, but forgives everything, and goes about
                  singing as merrily as a lark the moment the pressure of the hour is lifted from
                  his heart. To speak of a Mexican singing merrily, however, is a
                  stupid inconsistency. The key-note of all their national melody would suit a
                  funeral hymn. The wail of death, the melancholy anthem of a hopeless and expiring
                  race mingles in every strain. Did ever any one hear a child of the Red Race carol
                  a lay of joyous, brave-hearted promise? I think not, and this listless despondency
                  half-writes the epitaph of that peculiar and mysterious family, who, four
                  centuries ago, were the sole inheritors of this vast double continent, and the
                  lords of the rich and splendid empires of Mexico and Peru. They are prophetic in
                  their sad melodies, and Victor is only a little less sad than most of his race,
                  not really merry and heart-free like a confident child of promise. But he is
                  naturally void of thought, or fear for
                  the future, and almost forgot he owed money that might cost him his liberty. With
                  promises and part-payment he put off his Mexican creditor for many months,
                  reckless of Mexican laws, and the danger of being shipped into peonage, if caught
                  on the wrong side of the river. He had high ideas, too, of the dignity of American
                  citizenship, and the omnipotent protection of the American Stars. With the case of
                  Rios and the letter of our Secretary of State before us, we knew better than he
                  did how frail such a reliance would be, in an emergency that demanded manly and
                  prompt action from Washington, and we warned him to keep on our own soil, and
                  hasten to a settlement with his creditor. This was difficult, as the old
                  horse-dealer wanted ten dollars, the whole original debt, while in justice there
                  were but three due; but he insisted on considering the payments made on account as
                  presents, and not to be included in the settlement. This Victor resisted, and he
                  only went on singing his eternal ditties when told of his insecure position.
               On the festival of San Diego, which the Mexicans religiously celebrate by an extra
                  intensity of dancing, gambling, and horse-racing, there was to be a grand fandango
                  at Piedras Negras, and Jesusa, Victor's coquettish flame, was resolved to display
                  at it the unsunned glories of her new muslin dress and lace reboso. I have said he
                  was careless of consequences at all times, and a thousand dangers would not
                  frighten him, enamored and jealous as he was, from following in the footsteps of
                  his charmer, and watching in person over his own interests. His creditor, the wily
                  old Sousa, knew the parties, and guessed as much. Scarcely had Victor touched the
                  opposite shore, when he was pounced upon by those who lay in wait for him, and
                  promptly conveyed to prison, there to find the means to pay the full charge
                  against him, or reconcile himself as he might to a long career of bondage. He was
                  told by the Mexican officers, and he felt, too, at last, that his American
                  citizenship was but a broken reed against the Mexican slave laws, and he turned to
                  his employer as his sole refuge. He can read and write like a padre, and a brief
                  statement of his situation was soon penned and on its way to us, though on rather
                  hard terms. The price of this favor was the admission of the whole face of the
                  original debt before the alcalde, and thus secured either of his money or the body
                  of a peon, the son of old Sousa, a fair-spoken, well-favored youth, rode over with
                  Victor's appeal for aid.
            
            
               A VEXED QUESTION.
               THE young man received a brief and cold response, for it had been determined on
                  this side to press home to the authorities at Washington whether they would permit
                  the citizens of this Union to be enslaved for debt in Mexico. Some have said—and
                  woe to the faltering, faint-hearted politicians who set open this door to bloody
                  mischief!—that as our government had failed to chastise foreign wrong-doers, who
                  came on our soil with deeds of violence, that they would, under that same charter,
                  enter at will the soil of Mexico and deal out with armed hand their own code of
                  justice. Others, and most of our immediate circle were of this opinion, were
                  disposed to proceed with every formality, so long as law could be found, and when
                  and just where the thread snapped off, to finish the matter according to the light
                  of their own conscience, but always in a way to compel the attention of the
                  Cabinet and force Congress to turn its sleepy eyes towards this troubled border.
                  In keeping with this resolve, the messenger had his answer.
               "This debt was contracted on this side of the river, and must be settled by our laws, and we are besides
                  more than ready to come to an issue, and bring both governments to the necessity
                  of stating whether American citizens can be sold for peons in Mexico."
               "But the great jurist who is now Secretary of State, has decided that they must
                  submit to the tribunals of that country," I ventured to observe. "Oh, that was
                  applied to persons kidnapped from our soil," was the reply; "and as even Mr.
                  Webster cannot nullify all our powers as men and citizens, I think I shall bring
                  home Victor this day."
               "I must be of this party," said a friend: "I have a curiosity, a decided curiosity
                  to hear the opinion of a Mexican commandante on the propriety of making slaves of
                  our citizens," and while he spoke he buckled on his trusty six-shooter, and looked
                  inquiringly into the state of the neat flask and pouch that usually kept company
                  with the revolver.
               "And I, too, must be of this agreeable company," added our careless, good-natured
                  friend McG. "I like to take my share in these entertaining conversations when they
                  are going forward," and with the word, another six-shooter was buckled on, and
                  another saddled horse led to the door.
               "Victor himself might choose to put in a word if the discussion grows warm, and
                  here is an argument for his use," observed one of the party, throwing, as he
                  spoke, an extra pistol over the saddle-bow.
               And so in as brief time, and as lightly as I have written it, were they armed, in
                  saddle, and under spur, to carry their bold errand on to the soil of Mexico, into
                  the precincts of one of her military stations.
               Away they dash, fearless and light-hearted borderers that they are, as to a
                  festival, with smiles and words of courtesy on their lips, but stern determination
                  in their hearts. These resolute and well-armed men will not fail to be sufficient
                  unto themselves: they are of the manly mould and free hearts of the people, used
                  to be their own church and state in the scorching hour of trial, and not like that
                  dead, spongy excrescence of the popular will—no, of party intrigue—a partisan
                  cabinet.
               They go in determined earnest to claim back their fellow-citizen from the clutch
                  of iniquitous bondage, and while they clothe the demand in respectful phrase, they
                  are altogether likely to bring back their man. If they do not, they will so place
                  the affair that our derelict public servants must answer at the bar of Congress,
                  and to the people of the Union, why they have sanctioned so long this system of
                  enslaving American voters.
               If blood flows in such a quarrel, as flow it must if our officials continue their
                  passive connivance, on whose head rests the guilt of treason and the shame of
                  cowardice? Let the blind and gorging owl of party that has supplanted our bold
                  bird of liberty at Washington, prepare to look the people in the face, and in
                  their indignant glance read their verdict of condemnation.
            
            
               VICTOR RELEASED.
               AFTER all, the main question was not brought to the test. We must wait a little
                  longer to know whether, and when, the Government at Washington will deign a glance
                  of inquiry and a word of protection to citizens of the Union, who are sold into
                  slavery in Mexico. The principle still remains in abeyance, and my prayers that
                  the Mexican officials would retain Victor, and our friends compel, by his resolute
                  rescue, the timid time-servers of the day to show themselves at the bar of
                  judgment, fell dead to the ground. Victor's friends went first to the commander at
                  Fort Duncan, and requested him to
                  demand, officially, in the absence of all civil authority here, the restoration of
                  an American citizen held in prison, and in danger of perpetual bondage, for a debt
                  contracted on this side of the river, and therefore by no fair construction of law
                  amenable to the Mexican penalty of servitude. The Colonel felt the case as a man
                  should, but he was uncertain of the range of his powers and duty, and still more
                  uncertain how far our Cabinet would justify him in too much zeal in defence of our
                  own soil, flag and citizens; so he excused himself from taking an active part, at
                  least until everything else was tried. This was exactly what suited the spirit so
                  fast growing up on this frontier. The people have been so long and so shamefully
                  neglected, that hundreds are as willing to put our own officials in open and
                  blazoned default, as they are the Mexicans. Acute eyes and ready wits lie in wait
                  to seize upon every clearly provable and inexcusable lapse, that can be carried
                  home to the conviction of the people. There are some who only wish so to use the
                  facts as to bring the owls of party to a clear vision, and a better performance of
                  their duty. This is the sentiment of my family, and it is my own aim and wish, but
                  it ought to be known in the United States that this is not the feeling of the
                  "rest of mankind" out here. There are hundreds, on both sides of this border line,
                  who want a war, and who will make a war, before this Administration
                  goes out. The criminal neglect of our public servants is accumulating for them a
                  beautiful entrenchment of justifications; and Millard Fillmore won't find his
                  place a bed of roses, if he does not look to it himself. His sound, patriotic
                  sense will soon set this all right, if he but takes it and his subordinates firmly
                  in hand when he comes home from his travels.
               Well, our party having duly acquitted their consciences by laying their plaint
                  before Colonel Wilson, now at Fort Duncan, and having received the invariable
                  border answer, "We have no means to protect any body, and no powers to do
                  anything," they went on very contentedly to settle things in their own way with
                  the Mexicans. They found the Commandant asleep, and the Alcalde out of the way;
                  but they courteously ordered the officer to be forthwith awakened, and laid before
                  him their errand without delay. He talked Webster to them for the first ten
                  minutes, and the Secretary of State himself could not have dwelt with more unction
                  and logical force on the nullity of American rights, the nothingness of the
                  American flag, and the sweet and sacred duty of respecting above all things, and
                  before all things, the supremacy of foreign laws, whatever befalls Americans. We
                  are lazy here—distressingly lazy. It comes, I suppose naturally, of a soft
                  southern climate, and an idle border life. We cannot put ourselves to the trouble
                  to bend the knee and kiss the garment-hem of beings no better than ourselves,
                  whether they wield the lash in Cuba or Mexico. Our party made him comprehend that
                  no time would be lost in idle petitions to a distant and apathetic authority, but
                  that, nevertheless, they were not disposed to leave an American citizen to be
                  enslaved for debt. The Mexican Commandante had a shrewd guess, also, that they
                  were likely to go on with their purpose in a fashion to create work for both
                  governments, with very little regard as to how far either the one or the other
                  would be pleased in the matter. So he met the emergency with good grace, and
                  offered them Victor as an evidence of his own personal good-will. He could not
                  gainsay the fact that Mr. Webster, in his zeal to side with the Mexicans, had left
                  the door wide open for American retaliation. If Mexicans could not be punished for
                  invading our soil and carrying off our citizens, neither could our citizens be
                  punished for passing into the Mexican territory and rescuing the wrongfully
                  captured with armed hand. Like other dilemmas, this of Mr. Webster has two horns, and he cannot eschew
                  both. The liberation of Victor was yielded under show of a special concession of
                  friendship, and with a distinct insistance on the principle laid down by our own
                  Secretary of State, that no matter how he got there, whether by dark deceit or
                  open kidnapping, an American once on the other side loses all his rights, and must
                  submit to slavery or whatever the Mexican law—or the want of it—may inflict. We
                  must wait yet awhile to test to the core this principle and the intentions of our
                  government. In the case of Victor—and I confess I regret it—it was not brought to
                  trial. The prison doors, though closed by Mexican laws, and guarded by the written
                  decision of our Cabinet, flew open at the significant request of a few earnest
                  men, and the illegal captive walked forth free. Before the sun set Victor was at
                  home chanting his interminable ballads, but some of us were but half content that
                  his liberty was granted under protest and as a favor, when it should be his by
                  admitted right as an American citizen.
            
            
               MR. WEBSTER'S MANAGEMENT.
               CLOSE upon the deliverance of Victor by the resolute will of the citizens, who, in
                  the absence of government-protection, decided on protecting themselves, came up
                  tidings of similar disorders, similar omissions, and similar necessity of acting
                  in self-preservation at other points on the border. It was too evident that this
                  unhappy charter of impunity for all manner of crimes would provoke retaliation,
                  and if Mr. Webster's unheard-of doctrines were fully acted upon, deluge the
                  frontier in blood. Congress and the country seemed entirely oblivious to the fact
                  that the border was virtually abandoned to the Camanches, without one earnest
                  effort for its defence, and its inhabitants officially given over to be carried
                  off and enslaved for debt, at the pleasure of the Mexicans. The Senate was
                  appealed to, and received statement of the exact situation of the frontier with
                  incredulous surprise, but on the 26th of Feb., 1851, it called on the Secretary of
                  State for information "concerning the forcible abduction of any citizen of the
                  United States, or of any person living under their protection, and of his
                  conveyance, to be reduced into Peon servitude in the Republic of Mexico." On the
                  3d of March, the day before Congress adjourned, and when it was too late to
                  prosecute the inquiry very closely, Mr. Webster sent in all the correspondence
                  respecting the abduction of poor Manuel Rios, with but one exception. This
                  exception is so peculiar and unprecedented that it would never command belief if
                  it was not of undeniable record. It is this: the Secretary of State
                     suppressed, withheld utterly, from the Senate, his own letter of
                  legal judgment and Cabinet fiat, which is given a few pages back, and which was
                  the principal object of the call of the Senate. In the stead of the letter of
                  scornful discouragement which he positively did send to the remote, uncared-for
                  borderers, but which he dared not lay before the searching eye of the Senate, he
                  says, "the Legation at the city of Mexico have been instructed to inquire into the
                  case to which these documents relate; but as there is no treaty of extradition
                  with the Mexican Republic, it will probably be difficult to reach the
                  offenders."
               No one will have the rudeness to doubt Mr. Webster's veracity, and of course he
                  had "instructed the Legation at Mexico" to do something or other, though in what
                  form, or to what end, is not visible, since in more than a year there has been no
                  sign of any result. Even the rebuke of the Senate did not provoke the slightest
                  attention to the deplorable state of the border. His license to marauders still
                  remained an unrepealed and effective decree of outlawry for the border, and not the slightest movement—at least
                  there is no evidence of any—has been made to obtain the "treaty of extradition,"
                  which he declared an all-essential preliminary to any act of self-defence. Band
                  after band of Mexican robbers crossed the river and committed the most atrocious
                  outrages, until at last, after about thirty Americans had been plundered and
                  slaughtered at their own camps and firesides, the terrible state of the frontier
                  was brought before Mr. Fillmore himself. His upright spirit was moved to active
                  measures, and something may possibly be done before it is altogether too late.
                  Still it must not be concealed from the people of the United States, that up to
                  the month of July, 1852, after nearly two years of strenuous complaint, this is
                  still the shameful position of our border population.
               The country is abandoned to the Indians, who press their depredations up to the
                  very precincts of our posts, leading their trains of stolen horses and captive
                  women, and slaughtering the herds of our citizens within hearing of the drums of
                  our posts, and those posts being but feeble infantry stations, are carelessly left
                  without the means of repressing the savages. The citizens themselves are liable to
                  be carried by violence from their homes and sold for debt in Mexico; unoffending
                  residents on our soil have been, and are, torn almost weekly from their homes in
                  the midst of our settlements, and still, even to the call of our
                     magistrates, the Secretary of State ventures to reply that this Republic cannot
                     prevent, or chastise, the abduction and enslavement of an American citizen for
                     debt.
               
            
            
               INDIAN RANGERS.
               MEANTIME our settlement thrives apace. Workingmen and mechanics come over to us
                  from Mexico with their families, and women and children begin to flit about the
                  prairies. If the government forgets to take care of us, we will try to take care
                  of ourselves. Yet something like a national system of border protection begins to
                  dawn forth in a few imperfect rays, it is true, but still they foretell the coming
                  day. The utter absence of connected, judicious lines of communication along this
                  whole frontier is absolutely incredible, and it is rather to the neglect of
                  Congress and the inertia of three or four of the highest officers in the army than
                  to the Cabinet, that this glaring default is to be imputed. Fort Duncan was
                  intended, if anybody had a clear intention in the matter, to check the Indians and
                  protect the great line of travel which crosses into Mexico and there branches on
                  the route to California, and to the right and left of it on the paths of trade to
                  the mining districts. The site chosen is not the very best, but if there was a
                  sufficient force, which Congress refused, it would still be of infinite value in
                  cutting off Indian forays on the lower country. There are several famous old
                  Indian crossing-places above, and still others not far below, the fort, which, if
                  a little more frequently visited by reconnoitering parties, would have to be
                  abandoned by these enterprising red gentlemen. But unhappily there is seldom
                  enough men at the post to do garrison duty, and of course the Indians come and go
                  at their leisure. Wild Cat has chastised them occasionally, and might be converted
                  into a permanent and powerful safeguard if the government would assign his band a
                  home and rations. Bread, powder, and shot would be the main part of the tax, and
                  it would be at once most humane, most politic, and most economical, to create a
                  kind of border militia of the friendly tribes. It could so be arranged as to
                  gather their families in settled homes where they would be systematically fed,
                  clothed and instructed, at once a present hostage for the fidelity of their
                  warriors, and a pledge of the future
                  good conduct of their tribe. We owe something very different to the Indians on our
                  borders from the mockery of gifts and treaties, which we have dealt them—gifts of
                  rum to destroy, treaties that covered their sure destruction with specious
                  promises of peace and protection. Yet we call ourselves excellent Christians, and
                  thank God we are not wicked, like other nations.
               Feebly as Fort Duncan is manned, its mere presence gives security to the
                  settlement, although the most formidable thing about it is the name of a United
                  States military fort. That has an imposing sound, and the Indians will not attack
                  it, or the dwellers under its shadow, although if they chose, they could muster
                  strong enough to take it almost any day. Three or four skeleton companies—and very
                  thin skeletons they are—are all the government can allow for four or five hundred
                  miles of this river frontier. If these infantry companies cannot be supplied by
                  contract with the seven-league boots of the fairy tale, there is no use in the
                  world in sending them after the Indians. Yet, to say the very truth, we have no
                  fears of the Indians at Eagle Pass. Their tracks and camp-fires are seen almost
                  weekly by our shepherds, and they are known to pass near us with trains of captive
                  Mexican women and children, but an armed neutrality is the order of the times
                  between them and the Americans. They steal our horses and cattle now and then, and
                  far afield a dead body is sometimes found bearing their death mark, but they give
                  a wide berth to the dwellings. I ride out in my rambling way two or three miles,
                  and never think of the danger of an Indian surprise.
            
            
               PABLITO.
               WE have an intelligent, brave little fellow with our shepherds who escaped from
                  the Indians with the intrepid forethought thought of a veteran. Pablo, or Pablito,
                  as we call him to distinguish him from the old shepherd of the same name, was
                  living with his mother on a rancho near Monterey. The Camanches swept down on them
                  one black night, and with many a dead body and bloody sign left behind on their
                  desolating track, they returned homeward with a plentiful booty in horses, women
                  and children. The Camanches have adopted a course towards captives of this class,
                  which seems the result of a fixed policy. The young females are given as
                  slave-wives to their warriors, and the children are enrolled among their own
                  native-born youth. Among the Indians this has always been done in partial
                  instances, to supply a loss by death, or to gratify the fancy of a favorite brave,
                  but these Camanches seem to make it a subject of premeditated effort to obtain as
                  large an infusion of white and civilized members as they can obtain for their
                  tribe; yet they have no appearance of wishing to learn any of the habits of
                  civilized life. Some think there is under this a superstitious hope to convey to
                  their tribe some of the resistless powers of the whites. However this is, Pablito,
                  a clear-eyed and ready-witted boy, was destined by them to share, with many a
                  weeping girl in their train of captives, the capricious adoption of the Camanche
                  lodges. With a quiet resolution, wonderful in a boy of ten, he determined to
                  escape even from their distant hunting grounds, if Providence did not favor him
                  with an earlier day. On this resolution he acted, and his first step was to calm
                  suspicion and conciliate good-will by assuming an air of content, and evincing on
                  every occasion a prompt desire to obey and oblige his captors. The young
                  philosopher had even the wisdom to recommend to the female companions of this
                  harsh journey to suppress their tears, and follow his example of a tranquil and
                  resigned demeanor. "But," said he, with the slightest possible smile curving his
                  handsome lip, "I did not think it
                  discreet to trust them with my whole plan of escape."
               The savages had crossed the Bravo and were far beyond pursuit on the American
                  side, before they relaxed in their haste or watchfulness, but when the nearest
                  settlement was a hundred miles in their rear they abated their pace and allowed
                  some rest to their worn-out captives. Pablito had noticed among their stolen
                  horses a hardy black mustang that never stumbled or flagged in their desperate
                  flight—and this he marked for his own. There were, he said, more beautiful horses
                  among them and some that were fleeter for a race of a few miles, but not one that
                  could carry him so far without rest or food, as he intended to go towards his
                  mother and his country before he stopped. He had made up his mind, with the stoic
                  endurance of Indian blood, that he could have nothing to eat for the first three
                  days, but in no wise daunted by this he launched out on his dimly-known course. In
                  the night, when the tired and unsuspecting savages had at last abandoned
                  themselves to untroubled sleep, he stole softly round to the desert-steed of his
                  choice, detached him noiselessly from his picket, led him gently over the grass to
                  a safe distance, and then alone, with no equipment but the Indian halter on his
                  horse, unarmed and unprovisioned, he turned his face towards home and his mother.
                  His general direction was correct, and at the end of three days he was met on the
                  prairie by a friend of ours, and conducted to Eagle Pass. I claim the bold boy for
                  my own particular service. It would be a sin to crush the spirit of this forest
                  Bayard, into the narrow, down-trodden space of a peon's life; but we must bring
                  his mother to him before we can arrange his future, and, meantime, by his own
                  choice, he ranges the hills and riverdells on his bonny black in company with the
                  shepherds and mounted herdsmen.
            
            
               SHEPHERD LIFE.
               OUR shepherds have their autumn camp in a sweet, secluded falda or lap of the hills, that slopes down to the water's edge in a
                  thick carpet of mezquit grass, about six miles below Eagle Pass. It is hedged up
                  and veiled around by a luxuriant frondage of wild growth, and so backed and walled
                  in by a steep range of barren hills, that the traveller might pass it at a short
                  distance twenty times before he discovered it, or noted the deep path that winds
                  into it between the river and the almost perpendicular mountain-side. It is
                  amusing to see Pablito sorting out and keeping order among a hundred or two of
                  young lambs and kids as they frolic about the shady pen, impatient for their
                  mothers, who have been led out to pasture in a separate flock. He has made some
                  changes in the family distribution, and the mothers who have twins are to be
                  robbed of one of their young to supply some bereaved ones with substitutes for
                  their lost offspring. The older shepherds are not half as tender and adroit as my
                  active, attentive Pablito in making these substitutions, and he is evidently
                  gratified with my visits and the warm interest I take in his extensive young
                  family. He will announce to me with the gravest solicitude, that the real mother
                  of that painted kid has a daily quarrel with its adopted mother to regain it, and
                  tell me how "that black lamb with the white mark on its head, like a royal crown,"
                  was lost by its dam and searched up by itself another one in that fine blooded
                  ewe. In fine, we have an infinity of important consultations together, and neither
                  of us ever tires of watching the ways of the animals. In these visits I have
                  learned to comprehend the charm of a pastoral life, so hard to be understood, like
                  the freedom of the sea, by those to whom it is not congenial. This out-door life
                  and the easy movement from place to place, has sufficient occupation to give relish to his
                  simple diet and airy couch, with so much care and aim as to keep astir his
                  faculties, but not enough of either to load him with anxiety. The shepherd wakes
                  in the morning with something to do before him; he throws himself down to sleep at
                  night with the consciousness of something done. The daily task and daily bread are
                  finished together, and he passes into slumber on the wings of duty done, and the
                  lulling certainty that to-morrow's work is within the easy compass of to-morrow's
                  strength.
               This calm monotony would not suit the eagle soul who feels a higher but more
                  troublous mission beating at his heart for outlet, but to those who are of lowlier
                  ambition there is a sweet independence and an unspeakable repose in a pastoral
                  life. The sun disappears behind his golden curtain, the stars glance kindly from
                  the cloudless sky, a light blaze flickers cheerfully under the over-hanging
                  branches, lighting up with changeful smiles, the white tent picturesquely gleaming
                  among the foliage, and cheerful voices rise and fall around it, like the music of
                  the distant sea. Our shepherds are enjoying their supper of atole, or meal boiled
                  in milk, roasted ears of corn, and broiled kid, and Pablito, with wide-open and
                  astonished eyes, is hearing, for the first time, what everybody on the border
                  hears doubtingly at first, but at last comes to accept as truth, that the
                  Americans bring regular rains and seasons, such as they desire, with them.
                  Pablito, with much polite deference, ventures upon some incredulity, but Domingo
                  assures him upon the faith of a baptized Christian, it is true, for
                     he knows that in Texas they had, in old times, the same serene,
                  unweeping skies that now overhang the Bravo and despoil its harvests, year after
                  year, but as soon as the Americans came and tore up the soil far and wide with
                  their great steel ploughs, the rains began to fall wherever they made settlements,
                  and kept step with them as they advanced westward; from the Trinity to the Brazos;
                  from the Brazos to the Colorado; from the Colorado to the Nueces, and now the
                  harvest-giving rains were following their March to the Bravo. This is a singular
                  truth, and a more complete philosophy may explain the rationale in
                  the planting of trees, and household fires, and the upturning of the earth, but
                  young Pablito was rather slow of faith in such phenomena.
               "It is a curious thing," said Pablito senior, who is the deacon of the Peon
                  circle, as Victor is its scholar, "a marvellous thing in truth, how those
                  Americans persuade the rains to follow them wherever they go, while Christians
                  have to dig acequias (canals for irrigation,) it
                  is really wonderful."
               "Do the bees also go before the Americans?" asked Pablito with interest.
               "You may believe not," interposed Domingo with energy. "The bees belong to St.
                  John the Baptist, and they always appear before Christians come to a country, in
                  order to warn the Pagans to make way for them, but the Americans have no religion,
                  and San Juan will not send his bees to drive out anybody for them. Yet it is true
                  rain is given to them, though they have no saints or any religion."
               None of the company could explain this mystery, and it may still be agitated in
                  their star-lit councils, unless, indeed, they have finally accepted a suggestion
                  of Pablito's. He remembered, at Monterey, the celebration of some national day by
                  a party of Americans, in which they fired salutes, drank aguadiente, and made as great an uproar generally as twice as many
                  Mexicans could do, with all their facilities of noise-making excited to the
                  highest, and all this squared so exactly with an Indian's ideas of a grand
                  religious festival that the boy thought, very naturally, it must be in honor of
                  their patron saint. The name of Washington had some association with this
                  tempestuous jubilee, and he modestly intimated his belief that San Washington was the patron of the
                  Americans, and that it was his intercession that brought them these refreshing and
                  crop-producing showers. For some mischievous reason of his own our man Victor, who
                  was saddling the horses for our homeward ride, thought proper to encourage this
                  opinion, and almost clinched their belief that after all it was possible the
                  Yankees had a religion and a saint of their own, by reminding them how parched and
                  rainless northern Mexico has been since the American army had withdrawn from the
                  country.
            
            
               THE INDIAN ALPHABET.
               WE were riding one day among the broken range of hills, that press down close to
                  the river, some seven or eight miles below Eagle Pass, when Pablito quite calmly
                  observed that eleven mounted Indians had passed along there the day before, with a
                  train of horses and captives.
               "Who gives this information, Pablito?" I naturally inquired.
               "I see it with my eyes; here are the tracks," said the boy confidently, and almost
                  surprised that any eyes could fail to see them. I dismounted, and with careful
                  observation could discern through the short grass a confused multitude of tracks,
                  but they seemed too faint and too much overlaid, one upon the other, to be worth
                  much as guides, but I desired to know how my brave and intelligent little shepherd
                  came to such definite conclusions.
               "There were three large American horses, as you can see by the size of their
                  foot-prints, and two mules, and the rest, as you may see by their little unshod
                  feet, were mustangs, (native ponies,) and they were afraid and went fast, for here
                  the hoofs all come down in a gallop, and close to the leader, for the track is
                  narrow and equal."
               "But how do you know that these eleven animals were all that bore riders out of so
                  large a cavallarda?"
               "The horses that are free scatter out in a broad and unequal line, and those that
                  carry the weight of a master leave deeper prints." He pointed out to me the
                  difference, but I could discover none. It would be invisible to any sight but that
                  of an Indian, or a keen and practised borderer.
               "And why are you so sure that they passed yesterday, and late in the day?"
               "Ah! it is very clear. It was not before the norther that blew so freshly in the
                  forenoon, for that would have covered the tracks with more dust, and yet there are
                  signs on them of the sprinkle we had before sunset."
               "Are you willing to take your pony and follow up the trail, for more
                  information?"
               "If you command it," was the prompt reply. I had no thought of sending him out on
                  this dangerous quest, but I am sure he would, if so ordered, have taken the trail
                  at once. They have no other books, but they read letter by letter these signs and
                  marks in the wilderness, and spell out their meaning as certainly as if they read
                  it from a printed page; and these Mexicans are as far from cowards, and as willing
                  to face any danger, of which they can comprehend the nature and the way of
                  contending with it, as any people in the world.
            
            
               THREE FORMS OF SLAVERY.
               HERE, then, we have side by side, as if laid out for dissection and verdict, the
                  three forms of slavery into which Christendom divides its profitable custom of
                  trading in the bones and blood of human
                  labor. We have African servitude on our side of the river, and they have white and
                  Indian servitude on the other. It is comfortable to have this difference in our
                  ways, for by it we can be as much shocked as we please at our neighbor's
                  iniquities and read him glowing lessons on the awfulness of his doings, and he can
                  do the same by us; and so nobody have time to look at their own sins. What a
                  miserable, moping set we would be all around, if we had no faults but our own to
                  cure! Then the superfine free-soil Christian that kills nothing but white factory
                  girls and hired bond-servants with neglect, contempt, unwholesome
                  fare, overwork and the like, has such a delicious charter to be severe on the
                  owners of bought black slaves and red ones. It would be a pity—and a
                  new thing in human nature—if we did not enjoy the banquet of
                  self-glorification.
               The third form of servitude—the hireling servitude of want, ignorance and vice—is
                  not, on this side of the Atlantic, an hereditary destiny, at least, not quite so
                  absolutely as it is in the Old World, but still there are thousands born in our
                  large cities with the taint of sin and neglect so strong upon and around them,
                  that the honest, full grown life of freedom is as nearly impossible to their
                  fettered souls as emancipation, and the light that must keep step with it, is to
                  the born the all of a southern plantation. The man who must sell his
                  sweat and sinews to hard repulsive toil, or starve, is not free. The child who is
                  nurtured in misery and vice, who is never taught how to live a useful life, and
                  who from the cradle is goaded into a war of self-preservation against the
                  interests of his fellow-man, is not likely to win a true and honorable freedom.
                  The place of beginning is to so frame the laws and customs of society, that
                  instruction and employment shall be the sure and well-understood right of all the
                  children of the State. The next step will follow more easily and naturally, which
                  is to make labor honorable. Not to talk of its honor and utility in
                  general abstractions, and then descend from the pulpit or forum, to wither with
                  courtly scorn, or trample down in the mire with aristocratic heel, your hired
                  servant who has been provided with no honest way of getting bread but by selling
                  you all the good years of his life.
               My test of a sincere and consistent anti-slavery man is very simple, yet in some
                  scores of intelligent professors of that faith, I have found but two who came up
                  to it. It is this: Will the disciple of equal rights give a place at his
                     table to his hired domestics? Will he welcome to his parlor the mechanic who
                     has created its elegance?
               
               One of these two men was a preacher, and an ornament of the Methodist church, and
                  if his whole household were gathered at one table, and shared in all the amenities
                  of a simple yet refined family circle, he was careful that none were admitted to
                  it who would endanger its purity by the shadow of vicious coarseness. The other
                  was simply a fanatic, and goes for nothing, since fanaticism, like other
                  insanities, teaches nothing except by its warnings. The good Shepherd, for that
                  was his name as well as his vocation, practised the equality he preached, but even
                  this high-minded exception to the general army of theorists did not, in his actual
                  practice, put the rough, unhewn block in the place of the polishnd cornerstone. He
                  did what all pretend a desire to do, yet few of us even attempt to perform in
                  fact; he gave, in every respect, due honor and fellowship to the honorable and
                  worthy laborer. By this course of justice, respect and fellowship,
                  the toiler is polished and elevated, and without asking any one to endure the
                  companionship of vulgar, narrow-mindedness (though such often comes to our doors
                  in carriages), it is in the power of every member of good society to help largely
                  in this mission. Most of all, women may do much for our domestic heathen by reserving and using for the
                  bloated intemperance of the rich man, the careless scorn that now rains down
                  discouragement and abasement upon the head of the man of toil. I only supplicate
                  that worth and intelligence shall be honored wherever it is met; that it shall
                  have a welcome and courtesy wherever you are; that it shall be held as ill-bred,
                  as it certainly is unchristian, to affect a shallow contempt for the
                  representative of any trade or calling, while the man is your equal in the gifts
                  of heaven and in their proper cultivation. Let every just man and woman in the
                  nation resolve to treat all the working people in their sphere of influence with
                  the social distinction that his or her own conscience declares to be merited, and
                  at once the whole national character will be ennobled, for man will outrank money.
                  There are many who will meanly and timidly shrink from receiving in their
                  drawingrooms an able mechanic or a practical inventor perhaps, while they make
                  haste to kiss the shoe-tie of any weak, idle, dissipated young lord,
                  who has no merit on earth more than that some ancestor was a fortunate robber, or
                  adroit court perjurer. But these are as unworthy of the imperial birth-right of an
                  American citizen as they are in faith and practice unfit to sit at the table of
                  Jesus of Nazareth. They are as deficient in the courage and dignity of republicans
                  as they are in the loving-kindness of Christ.
            
            
               PEONIZING A MOTHER.
               A TALL, fine-looking woman, with every mark of gentle nurture that can be seen in
                  any Mexican lady, came to ask a confidential interview. We conversed at length,
                  and her grace, gentleness, and well-turned expressions left a deep impression on
                  my feelings. This lady was the bond-servant of her son's widow, assigned to her
                  with other portions of the deceased husband's chattels as the widow's share of his
                  property. This is the bitter feature of peon servitude; the most delicate white
                  lady, the fairest child of promise may be dragged down to it on the first cloud of
                  misfortune, and those of their own blood are often tempted by the facilities of
                  the law to traffic in the bondage of their kinsmen.
               Anita was the daughter of an old Spanish officer who died, sword in hand, in
                  defending the cause of the crown against revolted Mexico. The orphan was
                  protected, as were hundreds more of portionless girls, in a nunnery of San Luis,
                  or Monterey, until a home was found for her, and she finally married a merchant of
                  the place. When at his death his eldest son succeeded him in the business, it was
                  discovered to be in a bad state, or at least so averred her son Don Blas, and on
                  his proposal the family removed to one of the towns nearer the Bravo in order to
                  be on the line of contraband trade. Here Doña Anita gave away her daughter in
                  marriage, but only to see the fair young bride begin to wither and sink into the
                  grave under the rule of a harsh, miserly, unloving husband. The unhappy mother
                  received in her arms a helpless infant, the dying gift of her daughter, when she
                  closed her eyes. Before this blow fell upon her, Don Blas, her now prosperous son,
                  had also wedded the heiress of a wealthy ranchero, and on bringing home his wife
                  he thought proper to come to a settlement with his mother.
               It is among the curious inconsistencies of the Mexicans that while it is most
                  uncommon for a child to treat a parent with unkindness or disrespect, it is not so
                  uncommon to reduce them to bondage. Custom—in all lands, the law of laws—permits
                  the one, but will not tolerate the other, and perhaps resting on this certainty of
                  filial treatment, Anita made no opposition to being "accommodated" with her son.
                  That is, she confessed before the Judge, that for her own and her daughter's needful clothing—and the like
                  matters—she was indebted to her son Blas, and consented to serve him in legal
                  peonage for the debt. Don Blas permitted his peonized mother to bring home and
                  nurse his sister's orphan, and when a year or two rolled on, and its brutal father
                  took another wife of his own mould, there seemed no other refuge left open to the
                  little Margarita. But when Don Blas died suddenly two years ago, the sky was again
                  overcast. In the division of the estate the peonized Anita became the personal
                  property of her daughter-in-law, and, in addition to a severe change in her own
                  labors, she was told, first softly and indirectly, but at last with stern
                  distinctness, that Margarita, now approaching her seventh year, must find a new
                  home or be "accommodated" with a peon's bonds. The widowed, childless,
                  heart-broken Anita resolved to come to me for aid. The unfeeling father of
                  Margarita is now a ruined, dissipated wanderer—and rumor says a pitiless
                  robber—about Mier, Comargo, and the towns on the lower Bravo. I was encumbered
                  already with engagements beyond my strength, but it was hard to resist the modest
                  yet urgent petition of this sorrowful woman. She only prayed to enter as a servant
                  in mine, or if that could not be, any American family that would shelter her
                  Margarita also, and bring her up in the enlightened customs of the free American.
                  "Let me become your peon," she said, "and I will devote to your service my body
                  and blood, but open your heart to this poor child." Oh, how eloquently did she
                  plead for that helpless one!
               I explained, what she partly knew, that she could not enslave herself to me, as it
                  is a form of servitude not recognized by our laws; but that if she chose to remain
                  on this side of the river, so that we could enforce her mistress to accept a just
                  settlement of her debt, instead of the long-drawn-out out iniquity of two hundred
                  dollars, my house was open to her, and we would see what could be done.
               "But I have promised to return to my duties, (mis deberes,) if I cannot pay the
                  whole cuenta."
               "Then you have promised away every chance of liberty, for on neither side of the
                  river can a person be found to advance this sum, even if they trusted, as I would
                  like to do, to your remaining faithful to your new service," I was constrained to
                  reply. I felt the necessity of this plain speaking, for it is a false charity to
                  pay to any grasping master these exaggerated demands, and waste on one object that
                  which, if properly applied, would open the prison doors of a dozen peon families.
                  If they can get a just balance struck, and will keep this side of the river while
                  they are paying it, half of the peons I know could, with reasonable help and
                  countenance, work out their debt in a year.
               "But tell me how you came to owe your son so large a sum," I continued.
               "It was not a large sum, only twenty-seven dollars when my son 'accommodated'
                  me."
               "How then did it swell to two hundred, when you were working all the time?" I knew
                  pretty well how it was done, but I wished to hear it from her own lips.
               "By putting in my cuenta the sugar allowed for Margarita's atole, (meal porridge,)
                  and the soap for our clothes, and a wool mattress to sleep on, and for meat, and
                  medicine sometimes, and for all we wore, and for two blankets and some cotton for
                  sheets," (sheets and a mattress are, by the way, most unpeon luxuries,) "and all
                  this in nine years made a large cuenta."
               "Then no clothing was given to you or the orphan without putting it in the
                  cuenta?"
               "Nothing, Señora; but then, on Sundays, and days of permission, I embroidered for others, and earned a
                  little money to buy things for Margarita. Embroidery and fine needle-work was my
                     destino, (allotted occupation,) until lately.
                  Since I have suffered much pain in my side, and feel an occasional cough, I have
                  been taken from the needle and put to the metate, which is worse."
               There was a gleam of explanation in this: her mistress' daughter saw the
                  consumption was stealing upon the overworked needle woman, and she was sent to the
                  metate, or corn-grinder, to be tormented into finding another buyer before she
                  grew altogether useless.
               "I think such a daughter does not deserve that you should go back at all; but
                  since you have given your faith, I see no other way," I was forced, most
                  unwillingly, to reply.
               The enslaved lady—for lady she was in every graceful word and gesture—left me with
                  a slow, reluctant heart, to return to the house of bondage, and before a way could
                  be devised to snatch her, and the child of her yearning love, from their chains,
                  death, the pitying angel, unloosed her bonds. The young Margarita is now enslaved
                  for the debt charged against her grandmother, and thus all that is left of a
                  gallant Spanish name is brought within the inexorable abasement of peonage.
               Theorize as you will, your own heart will rebel against your conclusions, if you
                  affirm that slavery is not most grievous to a mind and spirit born and trained in
                  the hopes and expansion of a better life. I turn back always in the comparison to
                  these facts, and think that wiser pens should take up the text:—
               Twelve millions of the Red Race have been degraded, and are dying off, by the slow
                  poison of peonage, and no one consoles, no one instructs the feeble half that
                  remains of the Native American stock. Less than half a million of stupid and
                  ferocious blacks, brought from Africa, have become three millions in number, and a
                  vastly improved race, even in the worst of our slave States. Letters and the arts
                  have been conferred on them, they have been aided to create a new and flourishing
                  realm in their benighted fatherland, and emancipation hovers over them like a
                  banner of promise. Colonization opens to them wealth, country, and distinction,
                  and all Americans—except those who have some fanatical uses for them—cheer them
                  helpfully on their way. Yet, this growing, thriving, hopeful black race, for whom
                  reparation is shining out in every quarter; who have their rich ancestral
                  continent for a home and heritage, finds a pitying orator on every political
                  stump, while the half-slaughtered Red Race, to whom remains not home, refuge or
                  country, meets no glance of sympathy or kindness.
               Oh that a Presidential election could turn on some show of justice to the hunted
                  Red man, what a plenitude of generous missions would put forth their blossoms!
                  What a chant of tender sympathy would chorus through the land! What patterns of
                  brotherly love we would all be—if it would elect a candidate—until after
                  election!
            
            
               DONA REFUGIA.
               ANITA, the well-born and pure-blooded white lady, was not alone in this intense
                  desire to rescue her child from the thraldom of ignorant peonage. Doña Refugia,
                  the lovely widow of an officer in the Mexican army, requested me to receive
                  herself and two children, a bright boy of fifteen, and a sprightly girl of twelve,
                  in my family to do the work of the domestic servants. She stipulated that the work
                  should be done, and well done, but for the honor of her husband's name she would
                  expect the children and herself should be treated as of the family. This, too, I
                  had to decline, for I could not, in any
                  case, displace those who were tried and faithful in their duties; yet, when I
                  heard, six months after, that evil tongues were busy with the fame of this still
                  young and beautiful woman, I was fearful that I had fallen short of what might
                  have been done to shield and sustain a lonely, unprotected woman.
               Both these cases were of white women cradled in prosperity and nurtured in
                  elegance, but among the Indians, backward and reserved as they are, we discover
                  rich veins of ambition, whenever they are encouraged to unfold, or rather to form,
                  hopes of a manlier destiny than peonage. This is what people deny of the Red Race;
                  but have these loud-voiced skeptics ever made the trial? My own experience is not
                  extensive, it only amounts to the study of those who have come in contact with me
                  as our own servants, those of our friends, and the Mexicans we encounter in
                  travel. Yet it is sufficient for my conviction that the Indian is more susceptible
                  to mental effort than the African. I have had failures, and I have had success,
                  with both in my limited range, but the most cheering success has certainly been
                  with the Red Race. Two young girls, one a mulatto, the other a pure Indian,
                  applied to me to teach them to read. They had an idea that a book was a mystery
                  they could soon unlock, if one who had the key would show them the way. It was a
                  sad interruption to my idle ways, but they were so anxious to learn, that I
                  received them into my house, to the great discomposure of my new handmaiden
                  Jesusa. There was a pretence of assisting her with the needle, but she declared
                  they only plagued her to death. In about two months they began to read, and
                  understand something of what they read, when my patience gave way, and they both
                  were sent home, prepared to forget—or improve as might chance—all they had
                  learned. A friend said, the mulatto would soon dismiss all thought of the matter,
                  while the Indian would retain, if no more, all she had acquired, with the usual
                  tenacity of her race, and so indeed it proved. I have sometimes seen this exactly
                  reversed, yet in ranging back over my field of observation, the balance is largely
                  in favor of the Indian capacity.
            
            
               AFRICANS AND INDIANS.
               So while we are ranging the world to find something as bad as our Southern
                  slavery, we utterly forget that Mexico, with one third of the population of the
                  United States, has more millions of bondsmen than we possess. Of the two classes,
                  the Africans are infinitely the best cared for in the matter of physical comforts,
                  and are the least crushed by the deep and hopeless sense of unjust degradation.
                  While the Indian pines away in sadness and discontent, the Black laughs cheerily
                  through his existence. His light heart is free from those biting traditions of a
                  nobler state which haunt the fallen white and the enslaved Red man. How many white
                  men there are in the bonds of vice, who sleep every night in the mire of
                  abasement, and wake every morning under the goad of that hard task-master Want—a
                  task-master who spares his serfs as little, and who drives them, as the statistics
                  of civilization show, to miserable graves, much faster than the slave and peon
                  owners do theirs—we will not compute, but when money and emancipationists are busy
                  in "freedom's cause," they should not be forgotten. There is much hereditary
                  bondage in this class of bondsmen. Tens of thousands of children are cast upon
                  earth by this army of intemperate and vicious parents, to be trampled upon and
                  crushed into early graves by the hurrying feet of their Christian brethren. No one
                  expects those who are rushing on in the monomania of some one-idead benevolence to
                  turn from their path to Africa, Ceylon, or China, to raise up the dying little
                  heathen in their own streets, but
                  surely there should be a juster distribution of alms when sane
                  Christians convene in the temple of truth.
               When I venture thus to petition that the infant heirs of white degradation, and
                  the helpless children of Indian bondage, should share in the magnificent
                  outpourings of emancipating love, let it not be perverted into a wish to deprive
                  the exiled African of his portion of sympathy. We owe him—and in the march of the
                  age it will come to him—instruction, freedom, and a home in the land of his
                  fathers. This, too, we owe to the plundered, exiled, and half-slaughtered Indian.
                  Out of the imperial realms and countless treasures we have robbed from him, give
                  him back a little corner for home and shelter, a small mite to feed and comfort
                  the feeble remnant that remains to him. Let the annuities which he is now
                  encouraged to squander in spirituous poisons be used to reconvert him to a man.
                  So, too, of the African. The sums that are lavished upon two or three doubtful
                  individuals would, if used with a broader wisdom, build up a town of free and
                  pleasant homes, and convey to them the parents of a new life and freedom-giving
                  colony. It is well to liberate one African slave; it is better to raise a hundred
                  to the elevation of self-government, and make of them a beacon-light before the
                  race.
               Here on the Mexican frontier we can see in its broadest lights and shadows, the
                  course of these unprepared, undisciplined races, when left to themselves. Here,
                  the hundreds of runaway slaves, who are tempted to escape from Texas into Mexico,
                  have all the social rights and honors of the most esteemed citizens. His joyous
                  hilarity is a welcome relief to the serious Mexicans, he is at once accepted as a
                  favorite, an equal, and there is no impediment to his popularity or success, and
                  yet by far the greater number soon get "accommodated" with peon bonds. Many,
                  however, of the young men of mixed blood, who have been well-trained perhaps, in
                  the household of their masters, settle themselves advantageously, marry in the
                  best families, and carry their honors with high dignity. They are a most jocund,
                  generous, forgiving race, and many amusing stories are told of their ways.
            
            
               THE COLORED DON.
               AN American of my acquaintance was travelling in Mexico, and as he was walking one
                  fine evening, in the city of Monterey, his eye was attracted by the comfortable,
                  self-satisfied air of a gentleman, slowly walking down the street towards him,
                  swinging as he went an enormous key. A second look convinced him that this portly
                  key-holder was the runaway cook of a friend in southern Texas, so he accosted him
                  with, "Ah, Dan, is that you?"
               "Don Dionisio de Echavaria, if you please, sir," said the cidevant Dan, with a
                  courtly bow, recognizing at the same time the stranger.
               "Well, Don Dionisio be it then," said the accommodating traveller. "But how did
                  you come by such a fine name, Señor Don?"
               "Oh, I did my father-in-law, the judge, the honor to adopt his, as mine did not
                  suit me. It was only fit for a plantation nigger," said Don Dionisio, with an air
                  of ineffable disgust.
               "But what in the name of wonder are you doing with that ponderous key, Don
                  Dionisio? You are not the keeper of the city prison, are you?"
               "No, it is the key of my warehouse," said the Don, with dignity,—his warehouse was
                  garnished with about ten dollars' worth of soap, candles, sugar, and cigaritos, be
                  it observed.—"I cannot find a confidential clerk among these lazy Mexicans," continued the magistrate's son-in-law,
                  "and I am obliged to take in my own charge the key."
               "You want a clerk, Dan—I beg pardon, Don Dionisio?" inquired the traveller, with a
                  serious face. "Well, suppose you take me? But, first, what about the treatment and
                  salary?"
               "As to the salary," said Don Dionisio, a little disconcerted, "we must talk of
                  that afterwards, when we see how you answer, but as for the treatment, upon the
                  honor of a gentleman, you shall fare like myself, with a place at my own table. My
                  lady will receive you as if you were my own brother."
               "Excellent, I will see you to—morrow, Dan—ten thousand pardons—Don Dionisio, but
                  if I should not conclude to stay here, have you no message to send to your old
                  home?"
               "Give my respects to the old gentleman, my uncle," (so it pleased the Don to
                  designate his former master,) "and tell them all that if they come this way my
                  house is open to them. But how is my old friend, Gen. H.?"
               "Very well, indeed, and he has become as steady as a church."
               "I am very glad to hear it. I used to be ashamed of his company, sometimes, but if
                  he is so much improved, I would like to take him by the hand."
               "I thank you in his name. Goodbye." And so they parted, not to meet again; but
                  this colored man, with all his little harmless pomposity, has more than once
                  rendered kind and efficient service to Americans.
               There are not many colored persons, however, who prosper in this stricken and
                  paralyzed country; it only yields its latent treasures to the energetic and
                  intelligent grasp of the white man. Yet this equality of caste and color is a
                  great allurement to the Africans on her border, and it is also the absolute
                  guarantee against a hasty consummation of that dreaded annexation—and the still
                  more awful chimera of Slavery Extension—which, like the black shadow on the Hartz
                  mountains, overshadows and terrifies so many believing spirits.
            
            
               INDIAN FORAYS.
               SOME idea of the make and character of the country must be borne in mind, in order
                  to understand the entire absence of system and forecast in the arrangements for
                  border defence. The Indians have no longer homes or families in the wide band of
                  unsettled country that borders the whole length of the navigable current of the
                  Rio Bravo down to its mouth—for Laredo and the few towns that at far intervals dot
                  the lower part of its course have no settlements back of them—and all this range
                  of a thousand miles in length, from the coast back, is a field for their sudden
                  forays. They pour down from their distant fastnesses, far beyond Eagle Pass, in
                  parties of from a dozen up to some hundred warriors, mounted on the fleetest of
                  their desert steeds, and free from every incumbrance but their light trappings for
                  war or the chase. They had been driven by the Texans beyond this region, as a
                  place of encampment with their women and children, before the annexation, and only
                  revisit it at intervals to plunder and destroy the Texan settlers. The old Texan
                  style of border defence was exceedingly simple and effectual. They gathered at the
                  first note of danger—for every colonist had something dear to protect, and no
                  means of protection except what lay in his own stout arm and sure rifle—and they
                  all went on the trail of the savage with the single and direct intent to
                  exterminate him wherever found. As the outer edge of settlements pressed deeper
                  and deeper into the wilderness, and their herds and flocks—the chief wealth of
                  these frontier farms— multiplied around
                  them, they became a perpetual fountain of supply to these roving Indians. They
                  rush down so suddenly upon their prey, and disappear with it so rapidly, that it
                  requires an alert, light-armed, experienced woodsman, like themselves, to pursue
                  them with any hope of success. Judge, then, of the sagacity of the Solomons at
                  Washington in sending infantry to suppress these wild horsemen of the wilderness!
                  On one occasion they made such havoc of life and property all around the towns and
                  posts low down the river, that the commanding officer sent forth detachments in
                  wagons in the hope of cutting off some of their scattering parties, and rescuing
                  the women and children the savages had captured. It was a forlorn hope; but what
                  brave and feeling man could omit to do whatever he could, however faint the
                  probability in its favor, to save a score of helpless beings from such a fate? If
                  his efforts were insufficient, let the blame rest with those who were so reckless
                  of border wants as to provide no better means for its defence. Unless the Indians
                  were polite enough to come up to the soldiers' muskets and ask to be shot, I do
                  not see how infantry were to hurt them. With a suitable mounted force to range
                  along the line and interpose an ever vigilant barrier to
                  incursive parties, an adequate infantry force to maintain the fixed posts that
                  flanked their operations would be of effective service. Rangers are best for
                  out-service, for scout and pursuit, for courier and escort necessities, and for
                  whatever offers in which quick action in the wilderness is the thing most
                  specially desirable, but in posts of concentration and supply, the order and
                  discipline of the regular army becomes of great value. The more so, as on a
                  frontier line delicate cases of international right and courtesy will occur, in
                  which the authority and responsibility of the officer commanding on our side
                  should be of the best recognized character.
               In whom, then, lies this default of fit and adequate protection for this
                  blood-stained frontier? Is it in Congress, in not providing the means; or in the
                  Cabinet, in not using them with sounder wisdom? The useless, and forever useless,
                  ship-of-war Pennsylvania, has cost more money than is needed to open and defend a
                  mail route from the Gulf to California, and such a route would soon dot its whole
                  course with a line of settlements competent for their own protection.
            
            
               WILD CAT'S POLICY.
               THE Mexican authorities found no impediments in the way of making a firm treaty of
                  alliance with the Seminoles. A beautiful location about thirty miles above Eagle
                  Pass was assigned to his people, after converting them one and all into full and
                  entire citizens of the "golden republic," by a quick, simple, and satisfactory
                  process of naturalization rather peculiar to Mexico. Even the black slaves among
                  them—and Wild Cat himself owns several—were "accommodated" to the Mexican system
                  of servitude under all the necessary legal forms, though a very old woman among
                  them told me the only difference she ever found between being a slave and a peon,
                  was in the harder way they had of grinding corn in Mexico, and that meat seemed
                  scarcer. The Chief, and his cousin, the Bear, were made Judge and Sheriff of the
                  new municipality. Wild Cat also took rank and pay—or the promise thereof—as an
                  officer of the Mexican army; so, as the colonel and magistrate of a partido of the Mexican republic, he had a double stake
                  in its glory. Nevertheless, whether by force of habit or sound judgment, his
                  predilections were evidently with the Americans. He kept his hunting camp as near
                  our settlement as he could, ranged in amity the passes that covered it, and in
                  many ways was a willing and useful guard against the too near approaches of the common foe, the savage Camanches.
               One fine morning Wild Cat drew up unexpectedly at our door, with only his two
                  interpreters and an inferior servant in attendance—a small and confidential train
                  for a chief who delights to ride forth with a strong display of armed warriors and
                  captive servants. It was a quiet business call, but bore as plainly and distinctly
                  on the great plan of his life, as these dark untrusting Indians ever show forth
                  their thoughts. He wishes to become the accepted soldier and agent of the United
                  States, and win renown and influence by taming down the hostile and troublesome
                  border Indians to keep peace with the whites. To do this, and become in our eyes
                  and theirs the foremost man of the Red Race, it is as necessary to chastise and
                  subdue the refractory as it is to win over and harmonize the willing tribes. He
                  had but lately returned from one of those long and inexplicable trips, which
                  unquestionably have reference to the grand object of his ambition, and he looks
                  wearied and care-worn. His dress was unusually plain and travel-soiled, and
                  altogether there was something exceedingly stern and unsatisfied in his air; but
                  it might be only that he was not well content with the summons from his military
                  superior which he met on his arrival home. His orders were peremptory, to muster
                  all his followers and allies, and move with all his force down the river to attack
                  the insurgent—Carvajal.
               At the first glance, Wild Cat might have passed for a white borderer arrayed for a
                  long hunting expedition, but a second look revealed many little Indian
                  peculiarities. He wore a shirt of blue printed cotton, and overalls of deerskin,
                  dressed to a dark color, and fringed neatly down the seams—probably the work of
                  that favorite wife, whose name he suffers no one to pronounce but himself, and who
                  is only spoken of in the tribe as the Chief's Companion. A crescent-shaped silver
                  medal decorated his breast, and a collar of gay bead-work encircled his neck. All
                  the party wore turbans of bright-colored kerchiefs wreathed around their brows, in
                  a style that would sit with legitimate grace on the brow of an Arab. And strange
                  to say, one of his interpreters was an Arab. He was a tall, stately,
                  self-possessed being, with the aquiline features and round glittering eye of the
                  desert-born. They called him a Moor, but he was really an Arab, from the Asiatic
                  side of the Red Sea. He had been decoyed on board a Spanish trader, and borne away
                  to slavery in Cuba. He was in Cuba long enough to acquire so much Spanish as
                  served to make him a fair interpreter for the Seminole chiefs, when he escaped
                  across the dividing straits and sought a refuge among the Florida Indians. The
                  other interpreter was our famous Gopher John, a full-blooded negro, whose
                  immediate parents were from Africa. John, or as the Lipans call him, "Laughing
                  Dog," is, in all his ways, true to the records of three thousand years of
                  dependent servitude. He is pliant, docile, heedless of race or nationality, and
                  only intent to serve his chief in the way he is most pleased to be served, yet no
                  coward withal, and as generous and light-hearted as he is thoughtless of the
                  future. The Arab, on the contrary, bore himself as if he felt the pride of his
                  ancient nobility of thirty-five centuries of warlike self-sovereignty could not be
                  torn from him by any mortal robber. As they placed themselves by the side of the
                  Indian chief it was impossible not to be struck with the remarkable coincidence.
                  Here, on this remote frontier line, the types of the three races of men so hardly
                  pressed by the relentless, all-grasping whites, were confronted by one of the
                  conquering race, and on a mission, too, that had its rise in, and avouched for,
                  his supremacy. In that small room plundered Asia, enslaved Africa, and martyred tyred America, were each represented in
                  blood, in character, and in suffering by a lineal son; and to make the meeting as
                  complete as it was extraordinary, the fourth man of this singular convocation was
                  of that haughty Norman stock which for a thousand years has filled or shaken the
                  thrones of Europe, and which erases, with the point of the sword, the laws of
                  every nation it enters, to write its own in their stead.
               Yet these four men never thought of it at all, or only thought of it as an
                  inevitable and irresistible destiny, as they calmly discussed how best to subdue
                  the restless Indian tribes who still roam at will in what we have left them of
                  their ancient heritage; how to quell the fierce insubordinates, who are so slow to
                  learn that the whites have a stronger title than themselves to the
                  huntings-grounds of their fathers; how to save from utter destruction those who
                  had been subdued, and were willing to live in peaceful submission if the United
                  States would but secure to them a City of Refuge. It is to be regretted for the
                  Red man's sake, as well as our own, that we cannot give permanent homes, present
                  support, and eventual civilization, to the suffering and friendly tribes on the
                  frontier, and particularly to Wild Cat and his band. It is entirely in the power
                  of our Government to make this able chief an instrument for good or evil service,
                  for his restless ambition and versatile talents must be employed, and
                  in his fate and plans there is now a pause for breath and decision which a bold,
                  prompt policy, would not fail to seize and turn to the right account. Shall this
                  untamed tiger of the desert make his spring on us, or on the savage tribes? They
                  are his enemies as they are ours, and if we but give him easy scope and fair
                  encouragement, he will bound on them teeth and claws. His pride of rule and his
                  savage fame are the breath of his nostrils, he lives but to win command, and would
                  freely die to have it said in his death chant, that he was the highest chief of a
                  hundred tribes. If the whites will open to him a pathway to renown by sending him
                  against the hostile tribes, he will do their work better than half a dozen
                  regiments. If they shut the door upon him, then he will continue his plans of
                  combination, and strive to pour out upon this border a fiery torrent of
                  desolation. Eagle Pass nestles safely in its nook, and has less to fear than the
                  richer settlements that spur out and fringe the edge of the cultivated country,
                  but nowhere are flocks and herds secure in an open district of one hundred and
                  fifty miles wide by fifteen hundred long on this frontier. Yet Wild Cat, with a
                  regiment of dragoons and a company or two of mounted Texan riflemen, would sweep
                  this region clean in a year, and leave it as dainty and secure as the Capitol
                  grounds.
            
            
               SLAUGHTERED HERDS.
               AT the call of his commanding officer the Seminole chief withdrew from our range
                  and went down the country to take the part that became a Mexican dignitary of his
                  rank, in the war against Carvajal. Some of the Americans call it "Carvajal's
                  calico war," the question in issue being, as they averred, whether he should pay,
                  or escape paying, the duties on sundry bales of cotton goods. It may be so, for it
                  too often happens with Mexican revolutions and American elections, that the spoils
                  is the only principle at stake, and in proportion to their value is
                  the vehemence of the contest. The Camanches conduct their wars on the same plan,
                  only that they are too ignorant to dress up their motives with such fine words and
                  plausible excuses as we do, and in sheer poverty of speech they are forced to tell
                  out the story and say their object is plunder, their excuse hunger and necessity.
                  We have driven them back, and farther back, from the rich pastures and wooded vales of their old inheritance, and
                  when the grass fails in the stony defiles and parched mountain sides of their
                  barren land of refuge, they must pour down upon us who have possessed ourselves of
                  their ancient camp fires, and filled their hunting grounds with our herds, 
                     "And from the robber rend the prey."
                   We who represent the victorious and usurping race, must, as heirs and sharers
                  in the common deed, take with it our portion of the consequences. We must have the
                  justice to feed and civilize these famishing outlaws, or we must have the
                  hardihood to exterminate them. In recording some little of the blood-thirsty work
                  they perpetrated all around us, I must also record my painful conviction that,
                  according to their light and the measure of their provocations, their sin of blood
                  is not so heavy as ours. Out of the millions upon millions of revenue derived from
                  the domain we rifled from them under the plea—which would be valid enough if we
                  urged it more honestly—that we give it to humanity and civilization, how many
                  Indians have we rescued from barbarism? how many dollars have we expended to fit
                  them for or place them in Christian homes? We have professed to make treaties and
                  pay the Red man with Pharisee exactitude, the full price and value of his
                  destroyed independence—but in what wholesome coin? Powder and rum—murder and
                  suicide—this is what enlightened Christianity gives him back for the matchless
                  empire bequeathed to him by a long line of the free lords of the forest.
               We all need Christian instruction, whether in the city or wilderness, but most out
                  here. We have had but one visit from a clergyman in two years, and the devoted
                  Odin, bishop of Texas, made a long and trying journey to see us, and if possible,
                  open a way for a church and school at Eagle Pass. He dwelt much on this rule, "Do
                  unto others even as ye would have others do unto you." This was a part of his
                  teachings, but it is strange doctrine, and would be a curiously perplexing
                  practice for American Christians. It may be a line stolen from some old pagan
                  after all, for Bishop Odin is a Catholic, and Catholics are said to be idolaters;
                  and taking unfair advantage of our great distance from proper instruction, they
                  have passed it off on our innocence as a Christian precept. If it is in the sacred
                  writings, it is to be feared that our Cabinet never read the Bible.
               After Wild Cat and his rangers departed the hostile Indians pressed closer down to
                  our homesteads, and I was forced to narrow down to closer limits my free and
                  delightful rides over the wild and boundless prairie. It spoiled their zest, when
                  the order to saddle my pony inevitably brought with it the rattle of preparation
                  for armed attendance and a close scrutiny into the health of six-shooters.
               Yet all this taught me to confide in my household. There was not a coward in it,
                  not even my coquettish young maid Jesusa, who had set our combustible-hearted
                  Victor distracted, and made a bashful lamb of our sedate and dignified mayordomo,
                  Reyna. One day, in the temporary absence of my husband, we were all collected on
                  the highest part of the house, to watch the antics of a party of Indians, on the
                  opposite bank of the river. They had rained down suddenly, from no one knew where,
                  on the rancho of Don Felipe Garcia, and appeared to enjoy amazingly the pastime of
                  lancing some of his finest cows, that, unluckily for themselves and their master,
                  happened to be in the corral. There would be no
                  end to the confusion such a scene would create in a New England family, fresh from
                  the calm shadow of the village church; there was not a troubled eye or quivering
                  lip in the whole of that attentive circle. Mexicans, of the peon class, are
                     neglected children, and often behave
                  badly in a strait from want of self-confidence or good leaders, but cowards they
                  are not. I have always found them collected and resolute, and in this case, being
                  willing to try—for on the frontier it imports one to know—the mettle of our
                  servants, I asked Guillermo, the mason, and the oldest of them, if he did not
                  think it would be well to arm our men and go to the aid of Don Felipe's
                  rancheros.
               "If you command it we are ready, señora," was the cool and prompt reply. I
                  remained a little longer, and when I went down they were all getting their guns
                  loaded; for, with thoroughly Indian improvidence, these Mexicans, who are rarely
                  without a gun about them, almost never have it ready for use. In this is the vast
                  superiority of the American over the Mexican frontiersman: his horse and his arms
                  are the best he can get, and he attends to their condition with vigilant care. He
                  feels that he is ready to fight or flee to the best advantage; and is conscious
                  that the wild Indian knows him for a strong and watchful adversary—and this alone
                  makes odds in his favor. Thus the small American population of Eagle Pass, and the
                  reputation of a United States post at Fort Duncan, commanded a distance and
                  respect from the hostile Indians, which its actual strength by no means entitled
                  it to, and which the same force of Mexicans would not inspire. Whether the Indians
                  on the opposite bank were moved by any consideration of the presence of the two or
                  three houses on our side, or whether they refrained in pure good nature from
                  further mischief, they confined, on that occasion, their slaughter to the cattle,
                  and retired before we had decided that it was necessary or advisable to interfere,
                  and for some time we heard no more of Indian depredations. The inquiry naturally
                  and necessarily occurs to every one who knows we devote twenty millions a-year to
                  the military and naval service, "Why is not the force at Fort Duncan called out to
                  drive back to their hills these marauding Indians?" But, if it has not been said
                  before, we will say now—or if it has been said, it is still worth repeating—that
                  there is no effective force at Fort Duncan, not even enough for escort duty. There
                  is something like thirty infantry soldiers, on an average, for garrison duty, and
                  if four or five of them were detailed—which is the most that could be spared,
                  unless the ladies of Eagle Pass were to charge themselves with the care of the
                  post in the absence of its regular defenders—to go in pursuit of the Indians, they
                  would have to go on foot. The unpolished savages never take the trouble to wait
                  long for such visitors; and unless they did wait for them with exemplary patience,
                  how is a squad of infantry to overtake well-mounted Indians?
               In the month of December, 1851, not less than six or seven hundred head of horses,
                  stolen from Mexico, were passed over the Bravo, within a dozen miles of Fort
                  Duncan. The Mexican losers will say there were as many thousands, and demand
                  indemnity for them from our government; and some member of the Cabinet will
                  consider the law, the percentage, and the Galphin precedent, and arrange a draft
                  on the treasury. Don Juan Fernandez, who brought over a herd of three hundred head
                  of fine cattle to place them under the protection of our flag and the military
                  post of Fort Duncan, was informed, early in December, that a band of Indians, with
                  a large train of horses, were crossing the Bravo in the direction of his herd.
                  Information was sent to the fort, but there were no horses to make pursuit.
                  Don-Juan then took the trail, with one American gentleman, and traced their
                  crossing place and line of march before he slept. After ascertaining that our
                  shepherd's corral had escaped their notice, the two gentlemen camped there for the
                  night, and resumed sumed the trail with
                  the dawning. A few miles on they came upon the night-fires—not yet cold—of the
                  Indians; and there, in every direction, Don Juan found his cattle lying about,
                  perforated with lances and arrows. While he was counting them, and noting how
                  many, or if all, bore his brand, he heard the drums of Fort Duncan beat their
                  morning call. A day or two after, we rode down to look at this field of wanton
                  slaughter. In every direction there were dark path-like streaks of dried blood,
                  where the poor animals, maddened with the pain of the arrows that were sent
                  tearing and quivering through them in ferocious pastime, had rushed hither and
                  thither through the chapparal, until they fell down in the death agony. I picked
                  up some arrows, feathered in three colors, and fashioned so as to indicate the
                  tribe, and kept them—a lasting memento of the wise distribution of our means of
                  border defence. A Camanche warrior will send one of those arrows through a horse,
                  and with little less precision and force than a rifle ball. They had taken their
                  own time and way with Don Juan's herds; and, as he rightly thought, and' all of us
                  well knew, this destruction of his property was owing to the unpardonable
                  ignorance or neglect of our officials somewhere: he laid his case before the
                  Senate, and demanded some notice of the state of this suffering border. There is
                  no excuse for this; there is the will and the means on the part of the people of
                  the United States to protect efficiently this whole line, but their servants will
                  not be vigilant in their duty. They do not inform themselves sufficiently at
                  Washington of the nature and resources of the country, and are generally ignorant,
                  to an incredible extent, of the data on which to found any system of border
                  defence, and consequently none exists. This seems an incredible summing up of all
                  the expenditure and parade of our frontier establishment; but it is unhappily
                  strictly, undeniably niably, and disgracefully true, that on the Rio Bravo
                  frontier there is no systematic plan of defence—none whatever. Supplies "wander
                  about indefinitely," as the Texans used to say of General Houston's
                  administration. Posts are scattered in aimless confusion, where chance or the
                  caprice of an officer placed them, without suitable connection of mutual support,
                  without communication with the sea, generally strongest where there is nothing to
                  defend, and always weakest where the most is in peril.
            
            
               LYNCH LAW.
               THERE is one feature of border life which never fails to strike with horror those
                  who live calmly and securely under the genial protection of a well-established
                  community. I mean that state of things in which, in the absence or nullity of the
                  legal machinery of justice, society—feeble, crude and suspicious—returns to the
                  first elements, and makes itself law-giver, judge, and whatever else it deems
                  essential to its safety. It is the stern primary law of self-preservation—this
                  border custom of bringing criminals before the whole body of citizens for
                  judgment—from which men sitting beside law-guarded hearths recoil in dismay, and
                  hearing only its cruel side, stigmatize as the utterly unpardonable Lynch Law.
                  Most true it is, that nothing but urgent and deplorable necessity will drive a
                  just and merciful man to participate in its tribunals, but it is not less true
                  that in frontier settlements, if the fear of its quick vengeance did not overawe
                  the wicked, the innocent and peaceful would be in hourly danger of wrong and
                  outrage. We have escaped—partly through the near presence of Fort Duncan, but more
                  through the orderly character of our settlers—the terrible example of a court of
                  lynchers, yet I trembled not long since at the ominous shadow dow of such a proceeding. Happily, the accused man
                  proved to be innocent, and the guilty one fled these precincts. Since then formal
                  writs of election have been issued, and in the regular course we are supplied with
                  a magistrate.
               We had already witnessed (or rather suspected) a strong case of individual
                  retribution, the irregular personal vindication, by the sufferer, of that wild
                  justice of redress that every human bosom believes in, and nourishes, until it is
                  taught to forgive by religion, or to wait for revenge by the law. This individual
                  action of revenge is a step—a long and dangerous step—worse than Lynch law, just
                  as lynching judgments are a step worse than the guarded measures of strictly legal
                  vengeance. The one-man court, the settlers' court, and the sacred, decorous,
                  law-attended court of the well-regulated community, have each a certain currency
                  and respect in border opinion, as the inevitable, incurable, and not altogether
                  dissimilar flaws in the cement of society.
               But before I give the examples which kept step together, of illegal individual
                  retribution and of legal justice, I will take time to relate how near
                  circumstantial evidence came to bring a Lynch verdict on the head of an innocent
                  stranger.
            
            
               THE FOOT-PRINTS.
               WE had working at the quarry a tall, stupid, heavy-eyed peon, who had been whipped
                  and starved by his master until the whole powers of his mind and body had
                  concentrated down into one idea—that of saying "yes" to every requirement,
                  possible or impossible, that was propounded to him—and one capacity—eating the
                  whole day long. "Carlos would eat up the Carcel, locks, masonry and roof," his
                  companions said, and that was the reason he was never imprisoned in it by his
                  master, who exhausted his ingenuity to torment ment the wretched slave into
                  searching up a new home. Poor Carlos had not the wit to do that; but he made out
                  to run away at the instigation of a cunning, unprincipled fellow-peon, who
                  delighted in the not very apposite name of Santo de
                     Dios (Holy of God). How Santo stirred such a lump of apathy into this
                  decided action, is really a marvel, and the instigator was not so far from the
                  mark, perhaps, when he slyly said, "It was the smell of the American kitchens that
                  drew him along." Carlos was a slow and inefficient worker, and his friend Santo
                  was the mirror of laziness, so the heaviest end of the duty fell upon a strong,
                  hardy German who worked with them, and amused himself all day with abusing his
                  co-workers, and wound off at night by recapitulating all their shortcomings to
                  their employer. Santo de Dios had a flippant fluency of argument, and while they
                  were occupied with these wrangles, silent Carlos would devour the best part of
                  their supper, and then as silently digest it under the stormy wrath of the German.
                  Some way this came about so often that a feeling against Carlos, as an unfair
                  dealer, was general, and between the attacks of the German and the almost
                  desertion of Santo, he became the incessant target of the whole corps; and
                  although he never replied, except by a meek assent, to all they chose to make him
                  endure, at last he found his situation intolerable. His old master, on learning
                  that his escaped serf was making good wages on the safe side of the Bravo, had
                  addressed himself in such a way to the fears or conscience of Carlos, as to obtain
                  from him a promise to give him one half of his earnings. When Carlos applied for
                  an advance for this purpose, his account was carefully, read to him, and he saw it
                  was already overdrawn; for he came so miserably destitute that every needful
                  article, from his shoes to a blanket for his sleep, had to be supplied as soon as
                  he was taken into employment. One of the most discouraging obstacles stacles to those who would fain raise
                  the standard of peon existence, is in their childish distrusts and their uncertain
                  faith. Their whole practical knowledge is of wrong, deceit and oppression, and
                  anything else is to these heirs of suffering an unknown tongue, a doubtful land.
                  Carlos had not the head to decipher either. He was alarmed to find himself in debt
                  to his new master, while his old one was yet full of terrors. At the break of day
                  he had attempted to recross the river and fly into his own country, but the Bravo
                  had risen in the night, and the Eagle's Ford was impassable. With not a little
                  surprise we heard that he had been watched, pursued, and brought back by Baptiste,
                  on a charge of stealing, before we suspected his departure.
               Wet, frightened and confused, he appeared, in the stalwart grasp of the inflexible
                  borderer, the very picture of forlorn guilt. Baptiste, now occupied in building
                  him a neat dwelling-house in the place of his first grotto-like quarters, had,
                  from time to time, lost flour and other matters—in the line of food
                  principally—which his limited house-room compelled him to leave in the gallery or
                  shed outside. His suspicions fell on Carlos, who was always cooking and eating at
                  night, and on the preceding evening he almost caught him in the act. He saw a
                  figure stealing down into our camp of laborers, just at moon-set, and from the
                  broken glimpse among the mesquetes and mulberries, he thought the stature above
                  that of any other of the Mexicans. He "would not come down and disturb the lady by
                  a night-row," he said, "but he took his marks and kept watch." The track from the
                  flour-barrel was of large heavy boots, "rights and lefts," and on one the heel was
                  missing. This mark he had noted before, but only the day before had found that it
                  was Carlos alone whose large-sized boots would correspond with the track, and that
                  one of them, also, lacked a heel. The secret and unaccountable attempt tempt of
                  Carlos to leave the place, which Baptiste had intercepted, was another feature
                  against him, and the blundering confusion of his statements made it darker every
                  moment. With regretful yet resolute faces the employers and head masons drew
                  together, to consult upon what example should be made in the absence of legal
                  means of the first convicted criminal of Eagle Pass. But, first, it is the custom
                  for the judges in such case to review carefully the circumstances, and examine for
                  themselves, and in a body, all the minutiæ of evidence. The tracks were first
                  examined, and the keen eye of a frontiersman caught the fact, that although of the
                  same size, the lost heel of Carlos did not correspond with the track left by the
                  thief. One was on the left, the other on the right foot, and then Baptiste himself
                  frankly observed the impressions were deeper than Carlos usually made.
               "Where is the Dutchman?" exclaimed some one, suspicion now turning, for the first
                  time, in the correct channel. He had been a cool spectator until the
                  self-constituted judges started to make what may be called a judicial survey of
                  the foot-prints, and then he all at once became invisible. How he managed to get
                  away from the settlement without being observed by any one was a puzzle to all of
                  us, for it must be borne in mind that he had no horse, and our nearest American
                  neighbor was seventy miles off, at the post on the Leona, and between us—and for
                  hundreds of miles up and down the Bravo—there was nothing but uninhabited prairies
                  roamed by hostile Indians. It was never known what became of him, but with the
                  best that could happen the miserable man paid a heavy atonement for his fault.
                  Yet, the question may well be asked, what other line of self-protection is open to
                  these isolated frontier settlements?
               Carlos was so used to cruelty and injustice, that he could scarcely believe in his
                  entire acquittal under such a close chain of suspicious circumstances; and there is no doubt that men have been brought
                  to the gallows by more incomplete circumstantial evidence. He was sent to get a
                  warm breakfast, and dry clothes, and then questioned about his sudden and stealthy
                  attempt to run away. With long and patient cross-examination, we came at last to
                  the reasons, and at the same time to a new argument, in favor of his honesty.
                  Stolid and unfeeling as he appeared, the gibes of his companions had goaded him
                  past endurance, yet he did not "desire to bring them under castigation," as he
                  expressed it, by complaining to their common employer, and therefore he resolved
                  to return and throw himself on the mercy of his old master; but knowing himself in
                  arrears, he gave his new fresada, or blanket,
                  which was all he had for coator bedding, to the faithless Santo de Dios, who
                  promised him to settle up his account. But for his summary arrest and acquittal,
                  no one concerned would ever have heard of this arrangement, for he trusted to a
                  brittle reed in Santo; however, all was made right now, and he carried home with
                  him—for go he must and would—his fresada. The rush of events among the Americans
                  was perfectly overwhelming to his stunned faculties, and it was doubtless a relief
                  to get back to the regular whippings and stated rations of his former home.
            
            
               MEXICAN PEONS.
               WITH Carlos we dismissed his chief tormentors, Victoriano and Pedro Chico, and his
                  untrustworthy friend Santo de Dios. They heard in silence the serious decree of
                  banishment—for to them it was serious—but it is a rare and stern misfortune indeed
                  that wrings a Mexican from his impassible self-control. Yet, on the least
                  occasion, they will pour out a mellifluous tide of five-syllabled words that would
                  overwhelm, drown, and bury fathoms deep in its insignificance, an average
                  Congressional speech. It is the universal characteristic of the Indian race, and
                  the natural eloquence of the Red Man is wonderfully aided and enhanced by the
                  noble grace of the matchless Spanish language. Here were a band of common untaught
                  laborers brought up in every respect, but hard work, like their wild Indian
                  brothers, unseen and unseeing of more than half a ray of civilization, yet when
                  they make their Adios every sonorous word and
                  sentence rings with courtly pretension. Queen Victoria's retiring cabinet cannot
                  profess their loyal devotion in finer phrase—nor perhaps with more insincerity—for
                  these docile and over-respectful peons are too hardly treated to be reliably
                  honest. They are crushed and plundered until they are driven to rob their robbers
                  in self-defence; but they do cheat you with such infinite courtesy; they explain
                  away their little depredations in such graceful; and resounding Johnsonians, that
                  one feels it is almost impertinent to name such trifles amid so much fine talk.
                  Our curt, plain-spoken Americans find their deeds so much inferior to their
                  words—for it would not be easy to keep up with such magnificent holdings
                  forth—that there is a disposition to judge the Mexicans with severity and to deal
                  with them beyond the law. This is not Christian charity. They have the faults
                  inevitable to their position. For them there is no standing ground left for public
                  virtue or private independence. The soil has been torn from them by the great
                  landholders who monopolize what should support a thousand prosperous and
                  instructed families, for the pasture of as many head of cattle and horses, and the
                  homeless peon must starve or tend the rich man's herds at his own price. Schools
                  are beyond his reach, and the law doles out to him the solaces of religion at
                  exorbitant prices. Homeless, untaught, and oppressed, he sinks into sullen despair
                  or desperately rushes into crime; and
                  when the most daring deeds of robbery and murder have rendered his own country
                  unsafe for him, he crosses the Bravo, and probably pursues his career at the
                  expense of our herds and horses, until he is caught in the fact and handed over to
                  the verdict of Lynch law.
            
            
               THE ONE MAN COURT.
               THE tendency of individual man to enforce for himself the retribution when the law
                  is too negligent or too feeble to exact it from the wrong-doer, has been fearfully
                  illustrated of late at Fort Duncan.
               Two Germans enlisted and served together in the United States forces at that post.
                  Whether they were united by near ties of kindred or only attached and faithful
                  friends, they were noticed by their fellow soldiers for that deep, silent,
                  unchanging constancy of brotherhood of which we see so many remarkable instances
                  among the children of the Rhine. Alone in a new country, and in the midst of
                  strangers and an unfamiliar tongue, they kept apart from others without offence,
                  and lived by themselves in the language and memories of the beloved fatherland. It
                  happened, for their misfortune, that there was in the same service a riotous and
                  ill-tempered man, noted for his quarrelsome, abusive habits, and boastful of his
                  former deeds of bloodshed. He was one of those beasts of prey, whose wild tusks
                  and dangerous claws a well-organized society would cut off while they were tender,
                  or enclose in strong walls, until he learned better uses for their energies. One
                  day, while roaming about the camp in an irritable mood, he encountered one of
                  these unoffending Germans, and in his frenzy cut him down with a mortal wound. His
                  horror-struck companion never left his side during his lingering death agony, and
                  when all was over attended the last rites with such silent composure of sorrow as
                  surprised the company. Some said this speechless grief was the more bitter, and
                  argued all the worse for the murderer, Fay.
               The brutal assassin was kept chained in the guard-house two or three months,
                  awaiting the action of the civil authorities. They were a hundred and fifty miles
                  off at San Antonio, and as their country jail was already overburdened with
                  criminals, they were in no hurry to claim the gift in store for them at Fort
                  Duncan. The officers there grew tired at last of keeping guard over a ward that
                  seemed to belong to no one, and between hands Fay found himself on the outside of
                  his prison. He was seen hovering about the limits of the camp during the next day,
                  and then he totally disappeared.
               Two months or more had passed when Juan, the techedor, or chief thatcher at Eagle Pass, was out in search of
                  grass proper for roofing, and he encountered in a thicket, scarcely a league from
                  the fort, the body of a man. The limbs were composed, and a cloth thrown over the
                  face, not for concealment, for there was no show of such a thought, but as if in a
                  sort of respect to the helpless remains of mortality. Yet the hand that paid this
                  reverence to the dead had, beyond doubt, sent a ball through the brain of the
                  living man. The dead man was buried as he lay, without farther care or question,
                  by throwing a few shovels of earth over him. Those who went to see the corse on
                  Juan's report, thought they recognized in the dry, discolored object before them,
                  the victim of a just atonement in the person of the murderer. Fay, and suspected,
                  without blaming him, the murdered man's friend. He had exacted for himself that
                  retribution which society had omitted, though it usually assumes the right of
                  vengeance as a collective duty and benefit. No one chose to press inquiry, and the
                  secret sleeps undisturbed in the shallow grave of him who has thus met the law of
                  "blood for blood."
            
            
               
               THE COURT-MARTIAL.
               THE other was a case of collective retribution, of regular legal vengeance,
                  although the crime and the punishment were of a milder hue. It is true the culprit
                  would have been hanged in the navy—the poor seaman Jackson was hanged in the bay
                  of Vera Cruz for such an offence—but in this instance the accused had the
                  advantage of judges more disposed to show lenity than to exact the fulness of the
                  law.
               A non-commissioned officer, of generally prudent habits and fair repute, who has
                  served the United States some ten or fifteen years to the satisfaction of his
                  superiors, went over to that den of wickedness, the military colony on the Mexican
                  side of the river, to buy some little comforts for his family. While there, he
                  drank some of the abdominable brandy of the country, and whether it was drugged or
                  only the natural poison of the liquid, it completely unsettled the reason of the
                  unfortunate man. His companion was surprised at his wild conduct, and tried to
                  quiet him, but he only became more turbulent, and finally made an onslaught on a
                  Mexican woman who came in his way. Just at this moment the surgeon of the post
                  came by, and, surprised at the violent and unusual conduct of Brown, he interfered
                  to save the woman and bring the maniac to his senses. In doing this, the officer
                  received a blow, but as he settled the account fully on the spot, and saw as well
                  that Brown was under evil influences, he was not anxious to make the matter worse
                  for the offender than it already stood. This forbearing wish, however, was
                  destined to have no effect: Brown's infraction of discipline became known, and the
                  army code made it indispensable to call him before a court-martial. The man of
                  many murders went forth free, but he who in blind madness raised his hand against
                  an officer could not escape punishment. The least that could be done was to
                  convene a court-martial; the least a court-martial could do, with proper regard to
                  the preservation of order and obedience, was to destroy his prospects, and the
                  hopes of his family. There was no disposition to exaggerate his offence or its
                  punishment. As kindly and merciful men as we have in the army sat in judgment upon
                  him, with the sincere wish to soften the rigors of military law as much as they
                  could, consistently with military, discipline, but the necessities of discipline
                  set narrow and well-guarded limitations to mercy. They laid upon him the lightest
                  penalties of martial law. They only confiscated his arrears of pay, the savings of
                  many weary months, and his bounty land. This was the end of the devotion to his
                  country, of one-third of his years of manhood—to be driven from the camp with
                  ignominy, and forfeit the homestead land promised by the country to her faithful
                  soldiers. This was the gentlest fine that could be taken for an hour's madness,
                  and a blow that hurt nobody. The officer that received it would have been well
                  pleased if the exigencies of the service had permitted this act of insobordination
                  to pass by in silence, for in restraining the man's insane folly, he had been
                  forced then and there to inflict upon him some decisive chastisement. This poor,
                  dismissed, ruined man would call his sentence severe, perhaps unjustly severe, for
                  his fault, yet he was spared the lash, he was spared a degrading confinement in
                  chains, for his term of service had nearly expired; and let it be said clearly,
                  and at once, that the whole tenor of the military command at Fort Duncan has been
                  eminently kind, equitable, and considerate towards the soldiers, and the fault
                  lies in the sordid manner in which the United States pays its defenders. It is not
                  to be expected that a high grade of men can be hired for peon's pay
                  and treatment, and the law is shaped for the government of such as it expects to get at such wages. I only
                  cite this case to show that men in all circumstances must and will find—or
                  make—such rules of retributive justice as they believe necessary to the
                  occasion.
            
            
               THE COMMUNITY COURT.
               THE wild verdicts borderers sometimes enact, in the faith that they are just and
                  needful, sound uncouthly to those fenced round with regular courts, and must seem
                  dreadful to Christian men accustomed to the solemn decorum with which constituted
                  courts deal out their legal awards of chains, lashes, and hangings; yet, seen
                  close at hand, with a knowledge of the situation of the community, and of the
                  life—and deeds of the evil-doer, many of Judge Lynch's verdicts will appear more
                  just and necessary than half of the sentences of the regular courts. Let some
                  Samaritan, thrice armed with patience, and imbued to the uttermost with an
                  innocent faith in the wisdom and necessity of our existing laws, search out the
                  data, and he will find that we have not one ship of war afloat that is not stained
                  with more blood, "on slight pretences shed," than he can verify in the entire
                  annals of American lynching. There are a dozen ships in our navy, aye, a round
                  score of them, without counting the Somers infamy, that have witnessed in almost
                  any one of their long cruises, more undeserved tortures, and more lives let out
                  through them, than has ever been perpetrated in all the Lynch courts of the
                  wildest of our frontier States. I am no apologist for Lynch law, and trust it has
                  run its race; yet even its brutal blood-thirstiness is as often "a social
                  necessity"—as the gallows party term their altar of civilization—as the legalized
                  cord. Until universal instruction and universal employment work out their mission,
                  crime will follow temptation tion, and punishment pursue crime. They are the
                  inseparable furies of classic fable.
               A lawless Ishmaelite, that some older society has neglected, trampled upon and
                  cast from its bosom, rushes into a remote settlement burning with a feeling of war
                  with all his race. This community, planted by itself at a long distance from legal
                  succor, becomes from the necessities of its position its own Church and State. If
                  it finds in its midst a murderer or a thief, it deals with the outlaw as seems to
                  it best for its own peace and security. Statute law is but the formal expression
                  of what the larger community deems wisest and most just for the general welfare;
                  the small, crude, remote settlement does the same for itself, only without writing
                  down its enactments, and in the more summary way enforced by its peculiar
                  situation. It has no prison houses in which to detain a criminal, no courts in
                  which to try him, no funds wherewith to support him in long duress. If a crime is
                  committed the accused has the whole community for judges and jury, and if he is
                  found guilty by common suffrage they proceed to execute the verdict. Instead of
                  sending him for ten years to a penitentiary, where he will receive uncounted
                  lashes, when and how it may please a warden as brutal as himself perhaps, they tie
                  him to the most convenient tree and have out the whole cup of vengeance at once.
                  They are not prepared to sip it sweetly under law-sanction for years onward, and
                  must have it in one draught or remit it altogether.
               A man in north-eastern Texas had an amiable habit of biting and pinching his
                  wife—just for his own independent amusement-whenever he came home drunk, and that
                  happened about weekly. The helpless wife, the sickly mother of a young family, had
                  no choice but to endure these cruelties, for he had brought her a long fourteen
                  hundred miles from her friends on the Schuylkill, and there was no asylum open to her little ones. For their sake
                  she bore these wrongs; for their sake she swallowed her tears and dragged her
                  bruised limbs through her incessant daily toil, while the master of her person
                  varied the delights of his cards and cup with the music of her agony. The wife
                  dared not, could not, repel the ill-treatment of her tyrant, but the community
                  resolved to protect its abused member, and in full assemblage it fixed upon the
                  chastisement proper to the offender. One hundred lashes was the fine imposed by
                  this impromptu common law, and his own cart happened to come best to hand for its
                  execution. He was bound to it by twenty volunteer sheriffs, while his wife in vain
                  implored for him the mercy he had never extended to her, and the fine was promptly
                  and duly exacted. It was not a tithe of the physical suffering he had imposed on
                  the feeble frame of the woman who had left behind all other life to share his lot,
                  but nothing was said of his crime when the press caught up and bruited the
                  punishment as an evidence of the "horrid license of the Lynch Code." In the State
                  they came from it was cited as an example of the barbarous manners of Texas, yet
                  in that same pattern State the law had permitted this John Smith to squander his
                  wife's little inheritance of three thousand dollars, against her will and
                  entreaties, and leave her and her babes without a shelter. It permitted the
                  rum-seller to seize the household goods she had acquired by her industry, and
                  sanctioned her husband sending to auction the trifling gear the law exempts for
                  the pressing needs of a family. The law and custom made him so inexorably her
                  master, that, on his promise of better temperance, she was fain to forgive him all
                  this and follow him to Ohio, where her brother had bequeathed her an interest in
                  the proceeds of some land. This money enabled him to drag her, sorely against her
                  health and her wishes, to Arkansas—where he began his habit of personal abuse—and
                  thence to Texas. Here the free grant of land to settlers gave her a home at last,
                  and the law of homestead exemption made it safe to her children. Lynch law
                  effectually frightened him into better behavior—for the brutal coward who can
                  raise his hand against a woman is exactly of the mould to yield to fear and brute
                  force—and fenced around by loving children in a secure home, she is to-day a
                  prosperous woman.
            
            
               THE BORDER NEED.
               HAPPILY, Eagle Pass has now outgrown the danger of Lynch tribunals. We have, with
                  most other appliances of civilization, a precinct organization and a competent
                  local magistrate to deal with offenders—if offences come—and to marry if any are
                  anxious to be bound. The Padres of the nearest Mexican towns can be called to the
                  aid of the sinful and suffering—if the fees are ready—and happily, the general
                  health of the country renders less important the absence of a physician. With half
                  a dozen stores above and below Fort Duncan, and a fair tale of laborers, (I wish I
                  could say artisans, but we have them not,) there is not a doctor of law, of
                  medicine, or of divinity, among our citizens. Law-suits and sectarian
                  controversies have not taken root as yet, and nobody seems to suffer in mind,
                  body, or estate, in our happy and quiet corner. The tone of society is quite and
                  kindly, because its members are principally of the best grade of morals and
                  intelligence, and because there are not so many ladies here, that they can afford
                  to break up into little rival coteries. We have, all told, about a dozen, and we
                  can't well subdivide them into many classes. There is, in means, manners,
                  education, and social rank, a most happy equality. Not one is in anything
                  particularly favored above her peers, and not one is below the standard average of
                  an American lady. Neither are there
                  salient advantages in the position of any one husband to elevate his wife to the
                  rank of lady patroness, unless we were to concede it to the commanding Colonel's
                  amiable lady, and she would never accept the honor. We have no bickerings for
                  precedence therefore, and would have to make an occasion, since none exists, if we
                  were bent on finding any one to put to slight. As this harmonious state seems in
                  flat contradiction to the inexorable laws of village existence, and must, of
                  necessity, be a transient phenomenon, I hasten to put it on record, while the
                  unique fact is still a living truth. It ought to embalm the name of Eagle Pass in
                  the history of womankind forever.
               Yet, we have here a wide untrodden field for high effort. Science and mechanical
                  skill have vast mines of wealth to explore, for, to a known certainty, rich
                  mineral stores exist untouched, within an easy and profit-ensuring distance of the
                  navigable current of the Bravo. But capital and combined industry is the key to
                  the noble resources sleeping in this vast valley. Association, the association of
                  capital, science and labor, in honorable fraternity, is to be the "open sesame" of
                  this central heart of our continent. No immense sums of money, no large bodies of
                  laborers are needed, but in sufficient and compact force they must come, if they
                  would disinter these treasures. Still a greater need, still a higher duty calls
                  the Christian pastor to this vineyard.
               Canting, sectarian bigots, who would shut the gates of heaven to every soul who
                  did not go there upon their special endorsement, are not the men for this duty.
                  The self-righteous Pharisees, whom our Divine Teacher rebuked daily for their
                  strictness in dogmas, and uncharitableness in deeds, still hold the chief seats in
                  many of our polished synagogues, and there let them stay; but give us, and still
                  more give to the neglected, untaught, despoiled Red Race, the gentle, guileless,
                  and forbearing disciple of Him who placed the kind and practical Samaritan above
                  the formal and self-righteous Levite. There is an oppressed remnant to be saved,
                  there is a wandering and benighted people to be redeemed, and surely the will must
                  exist where the power is so ample for this work of salvation. Ask not in what
                  mode, or by what sectarian name, the forlorn and friendless exile is conducted to
                  the altar of the living God, so that his understanding is raised, and his heart
                  opened to know and feel the redeeming truths of Christianity. Give the outcast a
                  home, and in the genial glow of its calm sympathies teach him to labor, for this
                  is the saving probation allotted to man: to love his kind, and to reverence God by
                  obeying his commandments, for this is the teaching of the Prince of Peace, of him
                  who condemned forms and phylacteries when charity did not reign therein. To do
                  this, the Indians must be gathered into communities and made to realize the tender
                  relations of peaceful family life. The school-book and the Bible must keep step
                  together, the plough and the reaping-hook must work for them until
                  their young children have learned to value and live by them. The
                  Church must be planted amid the fields and orchards of a settled and permanent
                  civilization, to perform its whole mission. The government can give a home, build
                  quarters, assign rations, and gather into regular communities, many of the tribes,
                  directly under its jurisdiction, with half the money squandered upon them in
                  rum-paid annuities. Surely, if it can afford to expend so much in making this
                  unhappy race like the beasts that perish, it could find the way, if it had the
                  will, to instruct and civilize them into men.
               In these communities, while the old and stubborn were held in peaceful submission,
                  the young could be trained to habits of civilized industry, and their children
                  again would rise still higher, and be good citizens and Christian examples.
               
               The noblest possible missionary effort would be the establishment of an industrial
                  school, for the instruction of the bright and well-endowed Mexican youth, who,
                  under a benign and steady guidance, could be modelled into teachers for their
                  savage kindred. Ten thousand dollars would found on this border such a
                  self-supporting, agricultural, and mechanical missionary school. The suitable land
                  waits the acceptance of the fathers in Israel, who will undertake the arduous yet
                  delightful task of laying the first corner-stone for the social and moral
                  redemption of the Red Race.
            
            
               PLEASANT DISCOVERIES
               IN the mouth of babes and women we often find the wisdom which we have sought in
                  vain from the elaborate reports of high-titled officials. There are millions of
                  acres of United States domain that no one cares to buy, because it is only grazing
                  land, and even so, but thin pasture, which want nothing but a free application of
                  that fertilizing absorbent, ground gypsum, to bring to immediate profit. A wide
                  region on the Bravo is in the same position. I was convinced by certain
                  indications that we were not far from a plenteous supply of this redeeming gift,
                  and I inquired for it diligently from those whose duty it was to know, but the
                  nearest answer I could ever get was from Harry Love, who brought me some fine
                  specimens of alabaster from the extreme navigable head of the river.
               One day I was admiring the pure and pearly whiteness of the walls in the house of
                  an industrious and enterprising woman on the Mexican side—so active and resolute,
                  indeed, as to inspire a sort of dislike among her slow-going countrymen, for with
                  her own hands she helped to build and plaster her house—and I added, they had the
                  marble finish of plaster ter of Paris. "And they are of that material," was the
                  prompt reply.
               "My little son and I gathered and broke the rock at the river side, and my
                  daughters ground it into meal on the metate and
                  boiled it. A Frenchman who was sick at my house explained to me the way to utilize
                  this abundant white rock, and here it is, as you see, the work of my own
                  hands."
               This is the contagious influence of American enterprise, which Guadelupe caught up
                  at San Antonio, where she lived awhile, and engrafted on the stubborn stock of her
                  native Indian patience. This border could be made to bear much of this hardy fruit
                  with a small outlay of kind and unselfish justice.
               Her son, and as it chanced, my ever active young henchman, Pablito, were by,
                  listening with grave wonder to my minute queries as to the whereabouts and
                  probable extent of the gypsum bed, and although they could not see why any one
                  should take so much interest in such dry matters, it inspired them with a project
                  to give me pleasure.
               A few days after, some clear and handsome blocks of gypsum were presented to me in
                  modest triumph, with a very exact account of how and where they were to be found
                  in profusion. With some hesitation, and with a sly look to catch whether he had
                  not done a foolish thing, a clear, smooth piece of fine potter's clay was also
                  drawn out of its hiding-place.
               "Where did this come from?" I asked in pleased surprise.
               "Oh, there is a hill of this two or three miles from the Escondida."
               "But how came you to think of going to find it?" I inquired.
               "My lady wanted something better than lime to plaster her new stone house," said Pablito modestly, "and I
                  thought of this, for I heard Don Fernando say that the stone buildings at La
                  Fiesta, which have been abandoned twenty years on account of the Indians, were
                  plastered with it, and the coating is perfectly sound and beautiful to-day."
               "So boys and women bring us the treasures which men—wise in their own
                  conceit—pretend do not exist. Well, my boy, I think we must teach you what there
                  is in books, and send you out to look for mines."
               "If my lady will give me permission," and here Pablito stopped in some confusion,
                  as if he feared he was transgressing all bounds.
               "What permission do you desire? Speak frankly, you know me to be still more your
                  friend than your mistress. Be assured that I am disposed to gratify you in all
                  that is for your own good, Pablito."
               "If such a thing would please you; if you would permit your horses to go,"
                  stammered out the boy, "there is another of your faithful servants who would go
                  with your poor Pablito and bring you some silver from a mine in the
                  mountains."
               "Silver from a mine in the mountains, my lad! how do you know of such a mine?" I
                  inquired with interest.
               "We have both seen it. I noticed it when the Indians carried me there a captive,
                  and your herdsman saw it, also, once, when he was ranging for some strayed
                  horses," replied the boy, gathering confidence from my interested manner.
               "Then it is not far from here?"
               "It is, we both think, ten or twelve leagues (thirty miles perhaps) from the
                  river, at the nearest point."
               "But why do you think this mine is silver? We know there is lead at about that
                  distance, and in the direction you indicate, but we are not certain of
                  silver."
               "Because it is so bright and hard to melt," said he, promptly. "The Indians
                  stopped to eat and drink at a spring near it, and they made bullets of it, but
                  bits of it did not melt at all."
               "Since at least two of our people knew of this mine, why have you kept silence on
                  it so many months?"
               The child hesitated a moment, but his attachment prevailed over his Indian
                  instinct of caution, and he gave, as I have no doubt, the true answer. The
                  locality was dangerous to visit, and they were not disposed to be sent to it, for
                  the benefit of any stranger, the less as in no event—so say the elders of their
                  race, and so says history—had a mine ever proved a blessing to an Indian.
               "Yet you are willing, and so you say is the herdsman, to tell me of this, and even
                  to risk going for some of the metal."
               "Señora," said the boy almost solemnly, "you are teaching us both to read, which
                  will make us American citizens, you know, and mines are a blessing to Americans
                  and to every nation but Indians. Therefore, when my namesake was sick, and he was
                  kept in your house to be cured and you gave him a book, we said we would lay
                  before you this secret."
               "So you have told no one else your ideas, and only me now because you are to be
                  Indian peons no more, but Americans?"
               "That is it precisely, and if it pleases you and the Holy Virgin, we are ready to
                  go when you command and bring you plenty of this lead-silver from the mine."
               "Is there much of it?" I asked among fifty other questions.
               "There is bands and snakes of it" (these are his literal words rendered in
                  English), "looking out and creeping along the slopes of a long steep valley. These
                  must be more than would load a thousand mules."
               
               Thus in one week I had from the hands of ignorant children, what has led us to
                  sure evidence of the existence of two valuable minerals within an easy reach of
                  our village, and of a third—a fine coal bed—I knew before.
               In taking the necessary steps to secure the property of Pablito's silver mine, we
                  became thoroughly convinced that it is a rich deposit of argentiferous galena, and
                  without any obligation to the hollow display of government explorations, which
                  thus far have produced nothing but doubt and discouragement; the women and
                  children offered to Eagle Pass at least, two important aids to its prosperity, in
                  gypsum and porcelain clay, and without counting the coal we may find another not
                  less—it cannot be more—important, in the silver mines in the Lunita hills.
            
            
               OUR MINERAL EMPIRE.
               FROM the borders of the great Lakes to the shores of the Pacific, from the copper
                  cliffs of Superior to the sparkling sands of California, stretches a broad mineral
                  zone, across the entire breadth of the continent at its widest point. Even under
                  the developments of its crude infancy, the extent, value and variety of its
                  productions, baffle the boldest calculators, and none may presume to compute the
                  highest capabilities of this vast mineral empire. Coal, Iron, Copper, Lead, or
                  Gold, in the abundance with which various States are crowned, would either of them
                  have been esteemed a kingdom's boast and wealth in the Old World, and taken
                  together, even in this great Republic, they must immediately rank as an extensive
                  and distinct National interest. Like the Commercial, the Manufacturing, the
                  Southern and the Northern Agricultural interests, Mining will make its own
                  separate and magnificent contribution to the National wealth, and, like each of
                  them, demand the guardian and impartial care of the National Legislation. Asking
                  no favoritism and needing no exclusive fosterage, it will demand that the
                  settlements it creates, and the roads to them, shall be duly protected, and that
                  mail and other intercommunication shall not be omitted; in brief, that its
                  Territorial minority and the independent rights of its majority shall receive the
                  care and respect corresponding to its weight and importance in the Union.
               As if to chain with links of eternal strength all the members of the Union in one
                  unbreakable circle, this mineral zone bands the continent at the head and
                  confluence of all the great arteries. The Lakes carry its various tributes to the
                  Atlantic, or circulate them as required among the Grain States. The
                  Missouri—though that section is hardly in its dawn—the Upper Mississippi and the
                  Ohio each bring rich tidings of ore-abounding regions. The Rio Bravo del Norte
                  indents the land of Silver, and, with the rivers last named, offers an open
                  highway from the Mining regions to the Mexican Gulf. The Gila carries its golden
                  sands to the Gulf of California, and the Sacramento pours her shining freights
                  into the Pacific Ocean. Thus this magic belt of ore land, sweeping from the far
                  North-East to the extreme West, finds its outlets in every sea that bounds the
                  continent, and gathering up and interlocking in her bosom the sources of our
                  mightiest watercourses, she will allow no mad fanaticism to rend them asunder, and
                  divorce the river's outlet from the parent fountain. The Mining Country buys of
                  all and sells to all, and therefore it has a direct and pressing interest in
                  keeping the peace among the confederated sisters of the Union. And when she is
                  older, she will enforce more sensible ways.
               Among the last known, and least heard of in the list of mining
                  sections, is that on and west of the Upper Rio Grande. There is no more doubt of
                  the overflowing riches of the Silver
                  regions in this direction than of the placers of California, but
                  hitherto it has been a sealed book to the white race. There was no highway to it
                  known except by a difficult land route, swarming with Indian enemies, and the task
                  of shortening it by better surveys and more efficient defences, has gone on but
                  tardily until now. The Treaty with Mexico opened to us the peaceful exploration of
                  the Rio Grande, and it is now ascertained that steamers can ascend to the gates of
                  the mining country. When steamers come Indians disappear, and the frontier is safe
                  for settlement.
               Harry Love reports but one obstacle—the Island Rapida near Presidio de Rio
                  Grande—and that obstacle is easy of remedy, and then there is a thousand miles of
                  navigation. This covers that long range of frontier with the cheap and effective
                  defence of a few economical steamers, and unlocks to us the Silver mines on its
                  higher sources. Sante Fé and California are brought a thousand miles nearer to the
                  navigation this side of their sierras by these late explorations, and only two
                  broken links—Nebrasca and Centralia—are to be made whole to unite this Mineral
                  Region in a connetced chain from the Pacific to the Atlantic and the Northern
                  Lakes. The unexplored Centralia between the Gila and Colorado of the West, will
                  yet unite California and Northern Texas—the Pacific and the Gulf—in close embrace.
                  If Nebrasca is also endowed with like Mineral gifts, as there are indications,
                  they are linked to Missouri, Iowa, Wisconsin and the Lakes in a continuous line,
                  which again descends the Lakes and radiates to the Atlantic through the Coal and
                  Iron States.
               This line discloses almost every mineral known to Commerce and the Arts, and as
                  the Mining interest will help to employ and make more productive all our other
                  National interests, they are all interested in clearing the path and protecting
                  the operations of the profitable buyer and seller.
            
            
               NAVIGATING THE BRAVO.
               SOME wiseacres of our day are as positively certain that the Rio Grande is not
                  navigable, as their learned prototypes of Salamanca were in their day, that there
                  was no land for Columbus to find on the unknown side of the Atlantic. When it is
                  navigated, as it can and must be, many hundred miles above their
                  "utmost limits of possible navigation," they will be as much puzzled to understand
                  the feat as the persecutors of Galileo were to comprehend the "impossible"
                  possibility of the earth moving round the sun. These positive gentlemen have not
                  yet even learned the name of the river on whose capabilities they pronounce, for
                  the most part, on hearsay. They use the old Spanish term of description of "Rio
                  Grande del Norte,"—the Great River of the North,—or simply the Rio Grande, the
                  Great River, applied to it by the inhabitants on or near it, to distinguish it
                  from the smaller streams—its tributaries. In the earlier reports on this river,
                  some of these scholarly writers talked of the River "Rio" Grande and the River Rio
                  del Norte, taking in their untaught innocence the Spanish for river, "rio," as a part of its proper name. BRAVO is the
                  proper name of this stream, and the English prefix of "river" would be more
                  suitable than the Spanish word "rio," in a national document of record in our own
                  tongue.
               It is rather much to say that the river is not navigable, when, of the only three
                  efforts to test this, every one was successful. These three efforts were made in
                  common boats, at diverse seasons, without any preliminary knowledge of the current
                  or its various difficulties, and without the force or means to remove the
                  slightest impediments in the bed of the river. The first boat, the Harry Love,
                  came up to Eagle Pass and Fort Duncan,
                  and reported the Rapids of The Isleta (or Kingsbury's Falls) as the only important
                  obstruction. The boat's crew, however, took her through these rapids, and where
                  that can be done, a strong, suitably constructed, iron steamer could force its way
                  when a channel is cleared. To place on unanswerable ground the facility of
                  conquering this "impassable barrier to navigation," the official report of a
                  competent engineer, which has been on record in the War Department already nearly
                  two years without action, states unequivocally that a channel can be made for a
                  small steamer for fifty thousand dollars. Contractors could probably be found who
                  would give bonds to the United States to execute the work for one hundred thousand
                  dollars, and if so, it would open to steam navigation one thousand miles of this
                  boundary river. The boats would be small, but they could carry each a gun or two,
                  and transport troops with activity from point to point, to meet, drive back, and
                  effectually overawe, the wandering tribes of savages who now baffle and set at
                  derision our slow, and always after-time, pursuits.
               The second boat was the "Maj. Babbett," a keel boat fifty feet long, sixteen wide,
                  and drawing eighteen inches water. In this Capt. Love ascended the river one
                  thousand miles, and to within two hundred of El Paso, finding as before the
                  principal, if not the only important obstruction, at the rapids at Kingsbury's
                  Falls, through which the boat was warped by her crew. The last exploration was
                  made by Lieutenants Smith and Mechler, who went up from the mouth of the river to
                  about one hundred miles above the mouth of the Pecos, and this at the very lowest
                  stage of water. Their report I have not seen, but their trip confirms the
                  feasibility of the Bravo to light draught steamers, since they actually navigated
                  it at the worst season up to the very gates of the silver ver region, and through
                  the range of Indian infested country, in which even the smallest steamers would be
                  the most efficient of all defences.
               Before the government or any of its servants ventures to abandon the protection of
                  the frontier, let one hundred thousand dollars be placed at the disposal of the
                  Secretary of War (provided he is not infected with Galphinism), for the purpose of
                  opening the channel of the river, and, if it can be done, we have trebled the
                  hopes and security, and cleared away the worst impediments, of the frontier
                  settlements. How any practical man dare, or can, set his private interests and
                  opinions against such a national necessity as the navigation of the Bravo to its
                  utmost capacity, would be a marvel, if we had not so many official shortcomings to
                  take the edge off our astonishment.
            
            
               THE TRUE SOUTHERN SYSTEM.
               LET the South look to her interest and her laurels, for there is that ripening on
                  this border which concerns them nearly. A new republic is rising on this side of
                  the Sierra Madre, and she will bring no mean baptismal offering to the altar of
                  freedom. I do not speak of that phantom giant, "Slavery Extension," which troubles
                  so keenly all the unbalanced wits in that extensive and interesting region
                  designated in our political charts, as the State of Buncombe. Wherever our bird of
                  power flies, wherever our stars shine, there is increase of light and liberty. The
                  States of Northern Mexico will do much for human amelioration, in the change in
                  the peon system, inevitable to a state of closer relationship with us; but the
                  return she will make is apart from all slave questions. Through this region, west
                  of the Bravo, now in the act of secession, lies one of the great continental
                  highways that should span the Union. It
                  is second only to the supremely important route of Tehuantepec, and of both the
                  South would hold the outward gate, the genial and honored warder of the general
                  interests of this arm of our entire commercial greatness. From about the outlet of
                  the Red River, on to the Father of Waters, draw a line to the head of navigation
                  of the Bravo, and thence continue this line to the confluence of the Gila and the
                  Colorado of the West, and you have the shortest, most feasible, and, both
                  practically and commercially, the most desirable land route to California. With
                  all the materials, if it were necessary to construct them there, even to the
                  copper for the boilers, and the iron for the rails, as well as the coal to work
                  them on the line, this is the most inviting path for the national railway to the
                  Pacific States. It will pay dividends,—and, after all, the certainty of this is
                  the soundest and discreetest guarantee for enterprise,—sooner than any other of
                  the much discussed routes. It cuts through the rich heart of a paying country.
               The line from the mouth, or thereabouts, of the Red River to the Bravo will
                  intersect, in succession, very nearly the head of navigation of the Trinity,
                  Brazos and Colorado—not to speak of some valuable minor streams—and crosses the
                  whole breadth of Texas just where the general-lay of the country is most favorable
                  to such constructions, and where the amount, wealth, and enterprise of the
                  population, would come forward most powerfully in its aid. Each of the principal
                  rivers of Texas would be an auxiliary duct of trade, and all they drew away from
                  the main trunk, to their respective gulf ports, would be made up by the more
                  impetuous circulation of the whole round of business. The State of Texas might
                  invest a permanent fund for the support of her domestic Government, in this
                  section of a highway, that must make her the thoroughfare of this immense national
                  communication for, besides at once enhancing the value of Texas property to the
                  full amount of her outlay, it would bring in a secure annual percentage to relieve
                  her tax-payers. Louisiana could scarcely fail to bring up her section to the
                  Sabine, for the same reasons; it would pay dividends to her capitalists, increase
                  vastly her taxable property, and draw to her emporium a direct emigration from
                  Europe, Emigration and direct trade are two mighty levers of prosperity. This
                  direct trade and emigration from Europe is one of those needs of the South, to
                  which she has been hitherto over careless, and it is now all the more seriously
                  her duty to open and defend those great avenues that lie within her guard. Three
                  of these arteries of national life now solicit her attention, and the meanest of
                  the three enfolds wherewith to make even a poor State powerful and respected by
                  her confederated sisters.
               The Arkansas route, from the head of navigation, through Utah, to California and
                  Oregon, should find its sea mart at New Orleans, and its early and thorough survey
                  should be pressed by every patriotic statesman, regardless of sectional
                  prejudices.
               The Red River and Texas route belts a more southern, populous and accessible
                  region, and would interlace with the Arkansas route, by means of the higher waters
                  of the Red River.
               The Tehuantepec, or sea route, need not now be dwelt upon, but it closely twines
                  its important bearings with the other two, and, together, they make what may well
                  be termed THE GREAT SOUTHERN SYSTEM OF UNION.
               To pursue this with efficiency, brings us back to a missing, though attainable
                  link. From the Mississippi and Red River to the Bravo, is an open, known,
                  practicable and alluring section of this circle of national highway; but between
                  the Bravo and the California line, intervenes a confused space of foreign obstructions. Precisely here begins, then,
                  one of the high duties which the South owes to herself and the Union. The right of
                  way should be pressed, insisted upon, and obtained. Ask it
                     now, of this Government, that professes to rule Mexico, and take
                  no rest or pause until this path is safely our own. Our cabinet should not
                  permit—it should not be permitted a nay—either for Tehuantepec, or the Northern
                  land line. They are national necessities, and at any price, they must be made
                  secure, and if the President is true to his duty, they will be made secure.
               In this northern route, in ample and generous concessions of way, lies the first
                  love-offering of the seceding Mexican States. That which we should make haste to
                  demand of Mexico, the embryo northern Republic will soon make haste to proffer, as
                  the seal of a sincere amity—together with such other advantages of intercourse as
                  will gladden Northern manufacturers, and make, as it should, all the Union
                  partners in the gain.
               This triple band of national highways lies the second time in the grasp of the
                  South. Will she arise in her wisdom, and make the whole family of her Northern
                  sisters her contented debtors, by adopting, cherishing, and maturing, in generous
                  rivalry, a Southern system—a system which, without arrogance or selfishness, may
                  be nobly national?
               Let Louisiana lead heartily in this, as becomes the elder and more experienced
                  sister, and be certain that astute, keen-eyed Texas and golden California, will
                  answer with ready voice. Let every Senator, whose heart's truth keeps time with
                  his tongue's loud profession of devotion to the Union—and the whole Union—give his
                  hand to this work, at Washington, and in another year Europe will bow her weary
                  head and retire from the contest. With twenty States on her old Atlantic realm, it
                  was more than difficult; but with another ten, belting, in mighty array, their own
                  steam-defended inland sea, and stretching to the Pacific, in one continuous and
                  invincible line, she could but retire, and leave the matchless Union victor of
                  undisputed sway—mistress of this continent—guardian of the Atlantic—arbitress of
                  the Pacific—protectress of the Gulf and its cluster of inland gems! The seal of
                  all this is the vigorous circulation of the blood of the Union, from ocean to
                  ocean,—and this is now the pressing and particular—though I fear much
                  neglected—care and the duty of Southern statesmen.
            
            
               GALPHINISM.
               SPEAKING of the corruption of Mexican officials, it may be well enough to give
                  here a slight idea of an affair, in which high members of our own Cabinet are by
                  no means exempt from suspicions of partnership. For myself, I do not hesitate to
                  say that enough has fallen under my own observation, to leave an indelible
                  conviction that there are high accomplices at Washington, in a fraudulent, but
                  plausible scheme, to plunder the United States Treasury of several millions of
                  dollars. It will be led off by one of the ablest and largest of the landholders of
                  Northern Mexico, who expects the lion's share of the prey. Señor Sanchez owns
                  tract after tract, and all the laborers thereon, in such long succession, that one
                  may travel three hundred miles on the route from San Juan de Sabinas to Saltillo,
                  and in all that way find no commodity for man or beast except on his ranchos. In
                  that long line of untaxed land monopoly and unrelenting peonage, there is no
                  family that does not live in daily terror of Indians and no less brutal Mexican
                  robbers, and scarcely one family—no, not one—that enjoys the comforts
                  of bed, board, and shelter, as amply as they are habitually provided for the
                     inmates of the New York alms-houses.
                  Where the impoverished and trembling inhabitants are not gathered in their
                  comfortless Pueblos, there is nothing but desert fields, and here and there a few
                  half-starved peons to look after the enormous, uncounted herds of wild cattle that
                  swarm on these wastes. Over this immense wilderness Don Jacobo Sanchez is the
                  supreme lord. He is church and state, and his decrees, issued from his luxurious
                  abode in Mexico, come undisputed and undisputable as fate. Only in this is he
                  paying the penalty with the rest of his class, in leaving this fair region a
                  wilderness for the abode of cattle and peons, instead of making it the home of
                     men; the soil has no defenders, and the Indians are more the
                  masters of these vast estates than Don Jacobo himself. The tithes which he will
                  not give to humanity and civilization, for the creation of a free and
                  soil-defending population of homestead owners, the savages have taken from him
                  sevenfold. How many ages will it take us to learn that nothing is so unprofitable
                  as avarice—nothing so uncomfortable as selfishness? Of course, Don Jacobo's
                  servants cannot know with certainty how many horses, cows and sheep are destroyed
                  in these forays during the year; but their lord is an acute reckoner, and he takes
                  care not to let his accounts suffer by under estimates, as he expects to be paid
                  all his losses at his own enumeration and at his own prices, by our credulous
                  people. He has also had several peons killed by the Indians, and many more have
                  fled from their ration of a peck of corn a week, and whipping at discretion, to
                  our side of the Bravo. These will likely figure on the list as "mules, or beasts
                  of burden" and that without making any ungenerous subtractions from their money
                  value. Even these peons, and other live stock which he has sold from time to time
                  off his property, will not fail to appear, so runs the voice, in his catalogue of
                  the lost; and not a hoof or horn of them will lack full and complete
                  authentication, under the sign-manual of his true and faithful servants. Oaths are
                  not much dearer in Mexico than in certain courts of the Empire City.
               By the treaty with Mexico, the United States were bound to protect the frontier,
                  but if that is stretched to defend all the interior towns of Mexico, which their
                  own government abandons to Indian ravages, we must double our standing army, and
                  increase our military expenditures five or six millions a year. It would be
                  cheaper to take or to buy the country at once.
               If speculators are to cipher up such claims, and Galphinize them out of the
                  treasury, a round ten millions will not end these "indemnities for Indian
                  depredations."
               Señor Sanchez, enlightened by certain late proceedings, will give a pair of
                  influential senators an interest in his claim; and, I think, with the aid of a
                  clairvoyant or a spiritual medium, we could indicate the precise gentlemen. This
                  by way of beginning; next he must give a counsel fee of five or ten thousand
                  dollars to an experienced lawyer who has enlarged and purified his legal wisdom by
                  a seat in the Cabinet, and then the end will be in sight. We are a little curious
                  to know who in the Cabinet has been, or will be, the recipient of the great
                  Sanchez fee; or whether it will be tendered instead to a son, brother, or partner
                  of a Cabinet member. It will require brilliant legal talent, and most able
                  management, to get up a plausible showing for such an interpretation of the
                  treaty, (for most assuredly a fair construction will never justify these claims;)
                  and Señor Sanchez can well afford to pay a tenth—say a hundred thousand dollars—to
                  the genius who is able to convince the Cabinet of the justness, and Congress of
                  the expediency, of such a payment.
               Mr. Fillmore has been urged by a—doubtless disinterested—member of his Cabinet, to
                  propose giving six millions of dollars
                  for a discharge from this class of claims. No man would have dared propose such an
                  unjust levy on the public funds to one of our earlier Presidents, and Mr. Fillmore
                  rejected the idea as they would have done, but one who ought to know, says, that
                  he will be "argued into opening the question with Mexico, and when the wedge is
                  entered, the work will soon be done." Yet to our border citizens, not one mounted
                  regiment can be afforded for a thousand miles of river frontier. We do not ask
                  indemnity for our slaughtered herds, but those whose fault it is shall not escape
                  their proper share of the responsibility.
            
            
               THE CRISIS.
               YET, if we are approximating to the "Reign of Spoils," under which Mexico lies
                  prostrate and bleeding, Northern Mexico is slowly, but certainly taking the
                  inoculation of practical self-government from us; and, as it gains upon her, the
                  worst features of her social system will be reformed with their constitution. The
                  first great convulsion at the capital will rend asunder the ill-adjusted
                  confederacy, and erect the northern states of Mexico into an independent
                  republic.
               The whole country this side of the Sierra Madre is inexorable in its contempt and
                  detestation of the Central Government. A few of the richest and most corrupt of
                  the priesthood, a few more of the great landholders, maintain from interested
                  motives their attachment to the soldier-despotism of Mexico; the priests because
                  their exorbitant fees are secured to them by the laws, natural to this unholy
                  union of Church and State, and because they are upheld in their luxurious and
                  riotous debaucheries by their equally corrupt military compeers; the landholders
                  because it is the stay of their grinding peon system, the most debasing servitude
                  on this continent, and more cruelly enforced on the four or five millions of
                  Indians than our hereditary system of bondage can be made to bear on the Africans;
                  the enormous untaxed land-monopoly, which enables the owner of two or three
                  hundred square miles to dictate the terms on which the homeless, starving poor man
                  may toil out his life, and which reduces the laborer to sell out his blood and
                  sinews, his mortal life and his immortal hopes, for the meanest shelter and the
                  scantiest pittance which will hold their existence together. Noble Brotherhood of
                  the Union! well did a gifted member of your glorious order say of corrupt
                  governments: "As Freedom, Home, and Instruction make the sublime
                  trinity of political good, so is Servitude, Destitution and Ignorance the evil
                  trinity of political debasement."
               Each order of the Mexican state, as it now exists, is eager to sustain the
                  dominion of the evil trinity. They are the pillars of this temple of wrong, now
                  tottering to its foundation. The military power quells liberty and helps the
                  profligate priest to stifle expansion, while the merciless and all-powerful
                  landlord starves and beats the very desire for better things out of his dispirited
                  serf. We need not go to Asia to find suffering heathen; we have five millions at
                  our very door, and what is written in black letters against us—loudvoiced,
                  self-praisers that we are—is that we have just taken, eighteen millions from the
                  industry of our own honest toilers to supply their tyrants with more scourges and
                  stronger chains. We knew when we were paying all these millions to the Mexican
                  generals that every dollar would be expended to the hurt of the oppressed
                  workingmen of Mexico, yet we had the audacity to demand that all the world should
                  sing pæans to our magnanimity. In this our hypocrisy was yet more superlative than
                  our absurdity.
               But the time has come at last in which the evil is becoming ing its own cautery. The rich are alarmed at the
                  anarchy and insecurity of property; the better class of priests are startled at
                  the frightful indifference of the masses to the rites of the church, caused by
                  their being sold at prices above the common reach; the soldiers find
                  themselves hated and illpaid, and there is no remedy but in a war where they will
                  become necessary; the suffering people want something different from their present
                  oppressions, and all demand change. With all this there needs but a
                  leader; a man of name and ability who will put himself in the field, and promise
                  them security, trade, and no soldiers. They are narrow and incomplete
                  in their wishes, but so far as they can see there is a unanimous will for
                  revolution. A rumor, a faith, an expectation that, Arista will be driven from the
                  capital, by his and their old enemies, pervades the air. No one can tell why he is
                  so thoroughly confident that President Arista will come across the mountains in
                  deadly feud with the plundering faction that has its nest in the city of Mexico,
                  and take the captainship of the new Republic this side of the Sierra Madre, yet
                  everybody seems to wait for that event as if it were the appointed signal for
                  decisive measures. When you hear of a revolution in Mexico, you may prepare to
                  celebrate the birth of another nation.
