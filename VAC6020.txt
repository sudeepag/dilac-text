            PREFACE.
            DOLDRUMS is the name given by seamen to those parts of the ocean directly under the
               Equator, where they have neither North East nor South East trades, but baffling winds
               and calms. In the navigation of life all men fall into the Doldrum state some time or
               another. Too many persons, indeed, keep there a good part of their days, their sails
               seldom filled with the gales of the Spirit, and rarely, if ever, finding the
               trade-winds of success.
            Now it may be well for all such, or for any others, whether on a tedious or quick
               navigation, to turn hither and try to make out how this reel got into the bottle, and
               how they can get it out, or wind off its lessons of wisdom. They will be sure to meet
               in these pages something to please, employ and profit them. They will find Peter and
               John genial companions, in whose society they can while away an hour, and be all the
               better for it.
            
            This unique manuscript of an Old Salt, practically experienced in the navigation
               described, we have made into a book for all that get into the Doldrums, land-lubbers
               as well as sailors, and whether at sea or on the land, for everywhere life has its
               Doldrums, on ship or shore. It is for all, indeed, upon the voyage of life, whether
               they meet with driving gales, or with baffling winds and calms. It has been put into
               the present Editor's hands to revise and correct for the press, and introduce to
               public notice, because while intended for readers at large, it was thought to be
               especially suitable for a contemplated series of volumes, constituting a Library for
               the Sea. Hence the pertinence of its name.
            The Editor takes the liberty to say, whether it pleases the Author or not, that the
               Old Salt is no mere crabbed fellow that has lived on salt junk all his days, till his
               juices are all dried out of him. But his humor is rich and generous, and he seems to
               be well skilled in the Nautical Almanac used in the navigation here taught, while the
               language and imagery of the Sailor's EPITOME, spiritually at least, seem as familiar
               to him as the images of things that lay about the home of our childhood. He has also
               kept the eye of his Christian voyagers on all passing events to windward, while
               themselves steering steadily by Compass and Chart, and looking at all things from
               their own standpoint in their Heavenly EPITOME, the Living Word their only rule.
               Hence the value of their comments upon the various crafts found launched upon these
               tides, and the practical wisdom of their own maxims of navigation.
            All the meaning couched under the various names and allusions may not be apprehended
               by every reader at a single perusal, but a second reading through the glass of the
               Word will make it clear. To all the King's Sailors, on the Land or Lea, of the Old
               World and the New, with earnest wishes for their good, the book is now DEDICATED by
               the Editor.

            A reel in a bottle, for Jack in the doldrums; being the adventures of two of the
               King's seamen in a voyage to the celestial country
            
            A REEL IN A BOTTLE.
            
               CHAPTER I.
               BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION.
               IT happened on a time that the King of the Celestial Country, moved with
                  compassion for the people of this earth, resolved to establish a connection
                  between the Celestial Empire and our world, whereby any that chose might lay up
                  their treasures in that heavenly region, and at an appointed time go thither to
                  enjoy them. To this end a grand ship was prepared to take passengers across the
                  great sea that lies between us and the Celestial Country.
               While the vessel was a building, the people far and near had warning of it, and
                  many looked on curiously, and some inquired into it with deep interest, for there
                  were many communications from the King
                  continually in regard to it, and holy men of old spake about it as they were moved
                  by the Holy Spirit.1 The multitude were very indifferent and unconcerned, but some would
                  now and then talk with the workmen, and though it took many generations to finish
                  the ship, yet from the time when the first orders were given in regard to it, and
                  the first beam laid for it, all who chose might have an interest in it, might have
                  their names set down as passengers, and might be just as sure of all the benefits
                  of it, as any of those who should be alive upon the earth when the ship was
                  launched and sailing.
               
                  1 2 Peter i. 21.
               
               The Master Builder had all his plans perfect, and gave them for execution into the
                  hands of persons in whom he could confide, and the vessel was a noble craft, as
                  beautiful and grand to see as ever swam the waters. When the time drew near for
                  the completion of the ship, the king said to some of his faithful seamen then
                  living, "I tell you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see the
                  things which ye see, and have not seen them, and to hear the things which ye hear,
                  and have not heard them."2 And after the ship was under sailing orders, a record was drawn up of
                  a great cloud of witnesses that had before obtained an interest in her by faith,
                  whose hearts were fixed upon the Celestial Country, and it was said that they were
                  even as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the
                  sea-shore innumerable. It was added that these all died in faith, not having
                  received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them,
                  and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the
                  earth. For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country;
                  wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, yea, they desire a better,
                  that is a heavenly country; FOR HE HATH PREPARED FOR THEM A CITY.3
               
               
                  2 Matt. xiii. 17.
               
               
                  3 Heb. xi. 12, 13, 14, 16.
               
               Now the example of these believing and happy persons was not followed by as many
                  as might have been supposed would take passage, when the glory of the ship and the
                  full blessedness of the voyage were seen no longer as through a glass darkly, but
                  as it were face to face.4 For the hardness of men's hearts was exceeding great, and most of them
                  were feasting and revelling just as when Noah entered into the ark, eating and
                  drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, and neither believing nor caring
                  concerning the Celestial Country.5 And the god of this world was everywhere at work in
                  great power, blinding the minds of them who believed not, lest at any time the
                  light of the glorious gospel of Christ should come to their notice, and the offers
                  of salvation should per- 
                     4 1 Cor. xiii. 12.
                  
                  
                     5 2 Cor. iv. 4.
                   suade them to embark. And as when
                  the deluge came upon the Old World the people mocked Noah and his Ark, which was a
                  type beforehand of this great ship of salvation, so now many persons, when they
                  heard, mocked, and even said that the King's recruiting officers were full of new
                  wine, because, by the power of Divine Inspiration they spoke in all languages, and
                  invited men everywhere in their own tongue, to take passage for the Celestial
                  Country. Nevertheless, a great many did take passage, so that on one occasion
                  three thousand6 put
                  down their names at one and the same time. And so it went on, till it seemed as if
                  the whole world were going to turn sailors; but that happy time was yet a great
                  way off.
               
                  6 Acts ii. 41
               
               Whenever the ship sailed, all that chose to go were invited. They were to ship
                  once for all, being never to return to their native land, but to put into the
                  King's harbor in the Celestial Country, far away, where mansions were prepared for
                  them, and thrones, and crowns, and a great inheritance. It was said that their own
                  country was to be visited and burnt up with fire, which would involve the
                  perdition of ungodly men, and none could tell when that ruin might come; but it
                  was certain; and the King's messengers were always telling the people to secure
                  their passage in season, so that none need have failed, though oftentimes very few
                  paid any attention to the warnings.
               The vessel might return, and it might not, in season to give the people another
                  opportunity for the voyage; but it was entirely unsafe to rely upon that, and the
                  King's messengers were continually repeating what the Holy Spirit had said, To-day
                  if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.7 And the King himself had said
                  concerning some who had made the experiment of waiting for another opportunity,
                  and had lost the voyage and their own souls for ever, Be ye also ready, for at
                  such a day as ye think not, the Son of man cometh.8 Much was also said from one of
                  the King's own parables, concerning those who came knocking after the door was
                  shut, and could not get in; and this word also would be often sounding in their
                  ears, And while they went to buy, the Bridegroom came.9 But all this made
                  very little impression, and things went on much as before; one to his farm,
                  another to his merchandise.
               
                  7 Heb. iii. 15.
               
               
                  8 Matt. xxiv. 44.
               
               
                  9 Matt. xxv. 10.
               
               Again and again the same things took place, although every effort was made to
                  convince the people of their guilt and danger, and there was no want of
                  allurements, and powerful motives working, to induce them to enlist under the
                  King's flag. Indeed, the offers held out
                  were ravishing beyond description, and every one knew that they were true, and it
                  was often said that eye had not seen, nor ear heard, neither had any heart
                  conceived the glory of the things which God had prepared for those who love
                     him.10
               
               
                  10 1 Cor. ii. 9.
               
               And though none that ever set out on the voyage returned from the Celestial
                  Country, to to bring back any news, yet it was said and well known, that they were
                  in a region where there was no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, nor any
                  more pain,11 and
                  that there they were arrayed in white robes, with crowns upon their heads, and
                  palms in their hands, and that they were before the throne of God, serving him day
                  and night in his temple, and that He that sitteth upon the throne was dwelling
                  among them, and that they should hunger no more, neither thirst any more, neither
                  should the sun light on them, nor any heat, for the Lamb which is in the midst of
                  the throne should feed them, and should lead them to living fountains of waters,
                  and God should wipe away all tears from their eyes.12 It was said and well known that
                  there they saw the King's face, and that the King's name was in their
                     foreheads.13
                  Also the freedom of the Holy City of theirs, with its streets
                  of gold and its tree of  its pure river of the waters of life,14 and there they
                  went in and out continually, with an innumerable company of angels, and the happy
                  fellowship of the spirits of the just made perfect.15 The King's messengers used to
                  talk much of these things, and moreover the Earnest of the Spirit was given to
                  those who would obey the King, to bring all these things glowing to their hearts,
                  and to make them anxious for the voyage, and willing to leave all and depart. On
                  one occasion, Moses and Elias had even been seen in glory with the King,16 but no sailor ever
                  came back from the Celestial Country to tell about it.

                  16 Matt. xvii. 3.
               
               All the conditions of the voyage were very well known, and all who went had to
                  come, themselves, to the King, commit everything to him, and take the oath of
                  obedience and love as his seamen, for all had to work their own passage. One of
                  the King's names was Immanuel, GOD WITH US,17 and one of the rules for all his sailor-pilgrims
                  was this, Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for
                  it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do, of his good pleasure.18 The King was also
                  called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS,19 and one of the descriptions of himself was in
                  these words, I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.20 It was well known that no man could come to the Father, but by him,
                  and that all heavenly seamanship was to be learned from him, and that he had his
                  Father's promise to give the Holy Spirit to all who asked him. He also gave
                  assurance that whatsoever things they asked of the Father in his name, he would
                  give it to them.21
                  He had said likewise, If a man will love me, he will keep my words, and my Father
                  will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.22 And many other
                  precious promises he gave, and everything had been made sure in his own most
                  precious blood, which he shed upon the cross for the forgiveness and eternal life
                  of as many as would put their trust in him. And he used to add to all his
                  promises, HIM THAT COMETH UNTO ME, I WILL IN NO WISE CAST OUT.23

               Now it happened on an occasion when I was on a visit to those parts from which the
                  King's ship was then just about to sail, that two of the inhabitants were much
                  wrought upon by all these things, and were resolved to make the voyage together. I
                  have also since then learned some history of the things they met with, which for
                  the good of others I am determined to relate. They did not come to this good
                  resolution both at the same time, for one was considerably in advance of the
                  other, and was a good while in persuading the other to take the same stand. And
                  doubtless he never could have prevailed upon him to do so against the ridicule of
                  his ungodly friends and acquaintance, if it had not been for God's good Providence
                  in bringing the man upon a bed of sickness, so that he was chastened with pain,
                  and brought near to the gates of death, and greatly terrified in his conscience at
                  the thoughts of the judgment to come.
               Then his friend put in train upon him all the arguments he could think of to reach
                  his heart, that he might be induced to enter his name as a King's seaman. He
                  prayed with him again and again, and read to him the thirty-third chapter of the
                  King's Book of Job, to show him God's meaning in such providences as had befallen
                  him, that he might pray unto God, and that God might be favorable unto him. He
                  told him of the time when once the long suffering of God waited in the days of
                     Noah,24
                   and of the destruction of the ungodly then, and how certain it was that a
                  much worse destruction would overtake them, who refused to take passage in the
                  King's ship, according to his invitation and commandment. He told him that if he
                  would but begin seeking the Lord in earnest, he would find that as soon as he had
                  come to a decision to embark on
                  
                     
                     24 1 Pet. iii. 20.
                   board the
                  King's ship, the whole way would seem easy to him.
               The men's names were Peter and John, and Peter was the oldest, though indeed there
                  was not much difference in their ages. One day Peter says to John, What now? Don't
                  you know that some time or another, if ever you get on board that ship as an
                  accepted sailor, it must be in this way? You must leave all, and come to
                  Christ.
               Nay, said John, I begin to think I must bring all to
                  Christ, for I find no heart to leave all, and yet, come to him I
                  must. Now the question is, Will it be of any use to come so? Will he have me as I
                  am? May I come to him for a heart to leave all and come, or must I stay away till
                  I am willing to leave ALL?
               Why, said Peter, I hope the Spirit of God himself has put it into your heart to
                  ask these questions, for here you have touched the very evil; and I can tell you
                  if you stay away from Christ till you are willing to leave all for him, you never
                  will come at all. Yes, yes! You must come for a heart, and that will
                  be bringing your heart. You must come for a new heart, bringing the
                  old one, for as long as you stay away from Christ, you will never have any but the
                  old one to bring him. It is only in Christ that we can be made new creatures, and
                  not out of him. Old things and done away, and all things become new in Christ,25
                     but never away from Christ. So come; come any way, only come.
               
                  
                  25 2 Cor. v. 17.
               
               Well, said John, I'll try. And after he had been trying some time, a verse came to
                  him in an Old Almanac, where he was looking for the weather, 
                     
                        Just as I am, without one plea,
                        But that thy blood was shed for me,
                        And that thou bid'st me come to thee
                        O Lamb of God, I come!
                     
                  
               
               And that helped him very much, for it seemed to be exactly the language which the
                  weather in his soul required. And after awhile he met with other verses belonging
                  to the same, in the Old Almanac, and was glad to find them. 
                     
                        Just as I am, and waiting not
                        To rid my soul of one dark blot,
                        To thee, whose blood can cleanse each spot,
                        O Lamb of God, I come!
                     
                     
                        Just as I am, though tossed about
                        With many a conflict, many a doubt,
                        Fightings within and fears without,
                        O Lamb of God, I come!
                     
                     
                        Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind!
                        Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
                        Yea, all I need, in thee to find,
                        O Lamb of God, I come!
                     
                     
                     
                        Just as I am, thou wilt receive,
                        Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
                        Because thy promise I believe,
                        O Lamb of God, I come!
                     
                  
               
               And so he kept praying for many days, often saying, Lord, I believe,
                  help thou mine unbelief;26
                   until at length these expressions seemed to him to have some meaning; for
                  at first, though he had tried to use them, it did not seem to him that he
                  understood them, or felt them as he ought, but now they were like hidden things
                  that seemed to be coming out into the light, and his words meant
                  something, and he began to come to Christ; not merely for the sake of coming to
                  him, but to get something. So things went on, till at length these
                  exercises of the Divine Spirit so wrought in his heart, and the word of God got
                  such power over him, that he was as much bent upon the voyage to the Celestial
                  City as Peter himself ever had been; and so they concluded to set out
                  together.
               
                  
                  26 Mark ix. 24.
               
               They two were the only ones at that time, for the place where they were was then
                  very low in respect to knowledge and interest in the King's commerce; and though
                  the people were willing to hear the King's messengers, yet they were so full of
                  business, clearing and discharging vessels of their own, and having great
                  warehouses full of merchandise, which they were busy selling, and a great many
                  manufacturing establishments going on, and in fine, a great press of business of
                  all kinds, that there was no heart to attend to anything else, and it was never
                  convenient for them to put their own effects by, or to settle them up, so as to
                  start upon the voyage. These two, therefore, were the only ones at that time, and
                  so the vessel was put under their care, just as if they had chartered her for
                  themselves alone.
               They had all the provisions and instruments of navigation, a perfect and
                  infallible chart, a chronometer that only needed care in winding, and a barometer
                  that foretold all changes of the weather. They had instruments to take their
                  reckoning by the sun, and also for lunar observations, and they had their
                  log-books, and the best of spy-glasses, and besides all this, they had means by
                  the faithful use of which, though it needed no little skill and attention, they
                  might detect the direction and strength of unseen tides and undercurrents. They
                  were indeed provided with everything that could help to make their voyage
                  prosperous, sure, and successful. Besides this, there were some private stores
                  with which they were cautioned to supply themselves, though for these also they
                  must draw upon the King's storehouses by personal drafts from him; and also some things for private adventure, which
                  they were to make the most of, and to increase as far as possible during the
                  voyage.
               A note was put into their hands in regard to these matters, that they might be
                  neither idle nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ,27
                   running after this manner: Besides this, giving all diligence add to your
                  faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to
                  temperance patience, and to patience godliness, and to godliness brotherly
                  kindness, and to brotherly kindness charity; for so an entrance shall be
                  ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and
                  Saviour Jesus Christ.28
                  
               
               
                  
                  27 2 Pet. i. 8.
               
               
                  
                  28 2 Pet. i. 5, 6, 7 11.
               
               There was no quarantine for the Celestial City, because, if these things were on
                  board, it proves that the vessel was one of the King's ships; and as to any
                  plague, or danger of it, in the Celestial Country, there was no such possibility,
                  for one of the laws of that country was this, The inhabitant shall no more say I
                  am sick,29
                   and nothing that defileth was ever permitted to enter into it.30
                   Moreover, in the King's ship, and upon every sailor, there was the King's
                  own seal, with a private mark read by himself in heaven, indicated by this
                  inscription, The Lord knoweth them that are his; and also a more visible and
                  common mark, read upon earth, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart
                  from iniquity.31
                   It was well known that every one having this earthly inscription visible
                  as in fulfilment, had his name in God's book with the other seal in heaven. Yet
                  many persons hoped for the last in heaven, without having the first on earth,
                  without any anxious effort after the first; and such persons were very sure to be
                  disappointed, since God's seal never left one side of the impression without the
                  other, and either of them being entirely alone, was proved to be a forgery.

                  31 2 Tim. ii. 19.
               
               Now it so happened, in the good providence of God, that when the time came for
                  them to set sail, everything was favorable, and the weather delightful. It was
                  Friday, aud according to the superstitions of many of the coasting vessels and
                  seacraft of their native land, they ought not to have set sail on that day; for
                  there were many who did not scruple at all to work in their own ships, and sail
                  them out of port on the Lord's day, that would not have sailed on Friday on any
                  consideration. However there were orders from the King of the Celestial country to
                  disregard all such foolish superstitions, but to keep the Sabbath holy; so it
                  being Friday was no reason to them for not sailing, but it being a fine day, they
                  put out to sea with a strong breeze, which carried them speedily some hundreds of miles away from the coast
                  of their native land.
               At this they were much elated, for it was a good thing at the beginning to get
                  such an impulse, and they thought they should make the voyage, perhaps, without
                  encountering any of the dangers and difficulties they had heard described, as
                  almost always met with. Added to this, by a mistake in their reckoning, before
                  they had got accustomed to practical navigation, they several days put down in
                  their log-book a much greater advance than they had made in reality, and as all
                  their calculations were based accordingly, this mistake might have been attended
                  with very serious consequences, for it made them remarkably confident and secure.
                  They carried all sail, put on the top-gallant royals and skysails, and even got
                  out their studding-sails, for indeed it was most inviting weather, and a most
                  delightful breeze, and they felt animated to make the most of it, and a beautiful
                  sight it was to see the rig of the vessel, and how grandly she ploughed the
                  deep.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               LAND-LUBBERING IN THE COUNTRY OF SELF-CONCEIT.
               THEY were to sail past the country of Self-Conceit, and were permitted on no
                  account to enter any of its harbors, or to land anywhere on the coast, or to have
                  any intercourse with the inhabitants, unless some of them should put off in boats,
                  desiring a passage to the Celestial Country. And that country of Self-Conceit was
                  put down in their chart, with a warning against the coast as very dangerous, and
                  there were marks on the chart to signify some dreadful shipwrecks that had there
                  taken place. But owing to that mistake in their reckoning of which I have spoken,
                  they thought themselves much past that region of country, and so, taking no
                  special pains to keep off, although the wind blew towards the shore, they coasted
                  nearer to the shore than would have been prudent, even could they have counted on
                  continued fine weather.
               
               But this they could by no means do in that region, as they soon found to their
                  cost. For it happened that opposite the mouth of one of the rivers, which from
                  that country run into the sea, they were overtaken by a terrible storm, and the
                  wind driving that way, with so little sea room that they were in imminent danger
                  of striking, and dared not attempt weathering the point, within which the storm
                  had caught them, they made shift to run up into the river, deeming themselves
                  happy so soon to have got into quiet, smooth, and safe waters. But they knew not
                  where they were, and they had better have kept out at sea and endured the storm,
                  as the event proved. They thought at first they would only anchor there for the
                  night, and when the sea became calm and the sky clear, they would resume their
                  course in the ocean.
               The next day it cleared off indeed, and the sea was inviting, but notwithstanding
                  that the weather had changed, the wind still blew strong up river, so how could
                  they get out of the harbor, not knowing the channel, and being unable to tack, for
                  want of sea room?
               Besides, the banks of the river looked so charming, and the whole country, as far
                  up as they could see, promised so much to their curiosity, that they concluded to
                  sail further up, intending to take advantage of the first change of wind, and to
                  put out to sea again. So they weighed anchor, and soon lost sight of the coast and
                  the ocean. And now, as there seemed but little need of studying their chart, since
                  there was no river navigation laid down there, they delivered themselves to their
                  own speculations and imaginings about the new things which they were beginning to
                  behold. They even thought it possible that Divine Providence had turned them into
                  this river, so as to enlarge their sphere of observation and experience, and
                  perhaps open through them a new mine of theological learning, almost a new
                  revelation. For the air of the country began to take effect upon them, and they
                  looked back upon what seemed to them their low views, confined so closely to the
                  lines traced for them in the King's charts, with something like contempt. They
                  thought it became them to hold their minds open to conviction and improvement, let
                  it come in what shape, or from whatever quarter it might.
               They went a good way up the country, and what seemed very strange was that the
                  river was broader and deeper high up in the interior; also it grew very winding in
                  its course, and as the compass did not here traverse as they were used to see it,
                  they could now hardly tell, to any certainty, which was East, West, North, or
                  South. And as to the wind, that seemed
                  always to blow up river, let the windings of the river be what they might; and the
                  further they went, the more delighted they were, for the country in every
                  direction was enchanting; and though as yet they had conversed with none of the
                  inhabitants, yet they could see the villages and beautiful houses and farms on the
                  shores on either side, so that at length the desire awoke within them to go ashore
                  for a while, and make some little explorations.
               Accordingly they left the ship under guard, with orders to await their return, and
                  took their departure. As they preferred to go by the green lanes and across the
                  fields, because it was so much pleasanter travelling, they did not at first meet
                  many people. The first person that spoke to them was a man engaged in tying down a
                  balloon to a stake in the field, and he gazed at them with some curiosity, as they
                  wore the King's naval uniform, which, though very simple, was peculiar. He told
                  them there was to be a great ascension here, and that the method of travelling by
                  balloons was much occupying men's minds. He said, moreover, that a new geological
                  survey of the world had just been ordered by the Royal Academy of that country,
                  and that the Mosaic account of the creation must either be renounced or
                  spiritualized, and that, to save the credit of the Bible, they were pretty
                  generally transcendentalizing the whole thing, or regarding it but as the
                  beginning of a higher revelation, which was to be interior and more illuminating,
                  after which the first would be laid aside, the Old and New Testament being merely
                  a revelation of the letter, while the new revelation would be a universal
                  inspiration of the spirit.
               These things were so far beyond the depth of Peter and John, that they would have
                  thought the man was crazy, if he had not told them that the Word was only as the
                  shrouds, by which one could get to the mast-head. Then they answered him that
                  though the mast-head was an excellent place occasionally for a look-out, yet
                  nobody could live there, and if the shrouds were taken away after getting there,
                  it would be pretty difficult and dangerous to get back, nor could they sail the
                  ship by the masthead, but preferred the King's chart and compass.
               The man then plied them with so much more of his jargon that their ears were
                  almost stunned, and they were quite startled back into the mood of humble
                  reverence and dependence on the Lord's Word and Spirit. And the King's word came
                  into Peter's mind like fire, Believe not every spirit, but try the
                  spirits whether they be of God.1
                   Then, as some of the expressions which the man had dropped led them to
                  suspect the wanton nature of the liberty, to gain
                  
                     
                     1 1 John iv. 1.
                  
                   which he was for cutting loose from the Word, with
                  his pretences to a higher inspiration and perfection, Peter asked him if he had
                  not himself once served on board one of the King's ships. And he answered yes, and
                  that not a few in his present country had done the same, but had now learned a
                  freer way.
               Then said Peter, These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a
                  tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever. For when they speak
                  great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh,
                  through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in
                  error. While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of
                  corruption. For if, after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through
                  the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled
                  therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning. For
                  it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than after
                  they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them. But it
                  is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own
                  vomit again, and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.2
                  
               
               
                  
                  2 2 Pet. ii. 17-22.
               
               After this they went on their way with many misgivings. But they had not travelled
                  far, when they came to a region where there were beautiful churches, or buildings
                  which they took to be churches, and many other external signs of a religious
                  people. Accordingly they did find there a people quite religious in their own way,
                  but as Peter and John soon perceived, not according to the faith to be learned
                  from God's word and the gospel. To their astonishment they found some who denied
                  that the King of the Celestial Country was that Divine Being who was in the
                  beginning with God, and who is God, and who became flesh for us, taking upon
                  himself our nature, that he might bear our sins upon the cross, and die for our
                  salvation.
               And whereas the system of religion in the cross and in the love of Christ begins
                  with self-abasement, the scheme of this people seemed to begin with
                  self-exaltation. And whereas they knew the religion of the cross in its power to
                  be a death to self and sin, they found that with this people it was turned into
                  the cultivation of natural life merely, the example of Christ being consulted as
                  an admirable guide, indeed, and a very wise, merciful, heavenly and comforting
                  thing, but of the necessity of his death for them, or of their new birth and life
                  in him by the Holy Spirit, they either had no idea, or no belief in it. Many of
                  them carefully culti- vated all the
                  social qualities, and were people of much refinement in literature, and
                  exceedingly genteel in their morality. The high cultivation of their native
                  qualities they presented in proof that they needed nothing but that for an
                  entrance to heaven. They thought it impossible that a community of such sweet
                  farms, gardens, and pretty cottages, could ever be sent to any worse place in the
                  spiritual world than heaven, and, indeed, most of them did never believe that
                  there was any other place for souls but heaven.
               Now when Peter and John told them what things they had heard from the King's
                  messengers, and from the King himself, and how they were certainly true, and that
                  the world and all that is therein will be burned up to the perdition of ungodly
                     men,3
                   they smiled and pitied their simplicity, and seemed no way disturbed in
                   mind for anything that was to come.
               
                  
                  3 2 Pet. iii. 7.
               
               As to the voyage or pilgrimage to the heavenly country, they said that such ideas
                  were quite antiquated; and as to the burning of the world, they said that it only
                  meant a transfiguration into a purer state, into which they themselves were
                  already passing, so that every pound of guano which they put upon their fields and
                  gardens to quicken vegetation, and every moral virtue which they cultivated, was a
                  part of the flame of that threatened conflagration, and thus earth was to be
                  transformed into heaven. They said, moreover, that a railroad was in process of
                  construction, and had been carried already as far as the Delectable Mountains, and
                  from there to the Celestial City a joint-stock company had prepared a line of
                  aerial steamers and balloons.
               They gave them to understand likewise that a Mutual Insurance Company had been
                  established, guaranteeing all travellers a perfect security from every danger by
                  the way, and engaging a certainty of passage even at the latest hour, when, if the
                  regular trains were all full, extra trains would always be sent on for the
                  convenience of passengers. They informed them likewise of their system of through
                  tickets, by which any traveller might spend a year or more at any intermediate
                  station, as at the great town of Vanity Fair, or at the Gold Mines, where also was
                  a great city, or anywhere else, as they might choose, and afterwards proceed,
                  without loss, by the same ticket, which would be as good as ever, and just as
                  available for entrance to the Celestial City.
               Now Peter and John were for the moment taken all aback, as well they might be, by
                  all these things, for the speech and preaching of them was as smooth as oil; and
                  if they had not set out as common sailors
                  to work their passage, they might have been completely confounded. But though at
                  this time, so far from the sea, yet their hearts clung to their ship, and from
                  their own experience they knew there was an ocean to cross, and that it was not
                  possible to get to the Celestial City without crossing it. Besides, they preferred
                  a good sailing vessel to any steamer. So they said one to another, This is all
                  very well for those that are righteous, but the books of science and the farms,
                  and the Mutual Admiration Societies, will never keep the world from burning. It
                  will never do for sinners like ourselves to stop here.
               Then said John to his brother, Do you remember that Psalm where it says, My steps
                  had well nigh slipped, my feet were almost gone.4
                   Now it comes into my mind like a flame. If these things that the people
                  here tell us were true, then verily we have cleansed our heart in vain, and washed
                  our hands in innocency;5
                   if we could say that we have done this, even as the Psalmist did. What
                  need of a wearisome painful pilgrimage to heaven, if there is no hell?
               
                  
                  4 Psa. lxxiii. 2.
               
               
                  
                  5 Psa. lxxiii. 13.
               
               Ah my brother, said Peter, that is a good Psalm to think upon, when so tempted.
                     Surely thou didst set them in slippery places.6
                   O, there is no truth in those vain hopes. When the end comes, then what
                  will become of their tickets, and their insurance companies? How are they brought
                  into desolation as in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors. As a dream
                  when one awaketh, so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their
                     image.7
                  
               
               
                  
                  6 Psa. lxxiii. 18.
               
               
                  
                  7 Psa. lxxiii. 18-20.
               
               Well, said John, I feel as though we had been dreaming, and the conversation of
                  these men about their railroads and joint-stock companies, before the end, makes
                  me think of the talk of the rich man in hell with Abraham in heaven, after the
                     end.8
                   Oh, that poor rich man thought he was one of these stockholders, but he
                  found it was a great mistake. For alas, what shall it profit a man if he gain the
                  whole world, and lose his own soul.9
                  
               
               
                  
                  8 Luke xvi. 23.
               
               
                  
                  9 Mark viii.36.
               
               Yes, answered Peter, and now I hear a voice saying to us, Arise ye and depart
                  hence, for this is not your rest, because it is polluted, it shall destroy you,
                  even with a sore destruction.10
                   Oh, my brother, we have been here too long; we have no business here; we
                   ought never to have come here. Let us be going.
               
                  
                  10 Mic. ii. 10.
               
               So they thought. But there were temptations and trials in wait for them, of which
                  they never dreamed when on board ship. One day, being tired with their journey,
                  they were persuaded to taste a cordial of the country, universally used there, and
                  it had a quality that made them
                  light-headed, and for a season took away their sober judgment; and under this
                  delusion they fell into the hands of some landsharks, that had had notice of their
                  being in those parts, and had followed them up from the sea, who stripped them of
                  their means of subsistence, and almost of their clothing, and then turned them out
                  of doors. They told them they were a couple of self-conceited fools for refusing
                  to stop in that country.
               And now for the first time Peter and John bethought themselves to ask the name of
                  the country; a thing, the which, if they had done at the outset, and then examined
                  their chart and instructions, they never would have left the ship, nor got into
                  this difficulty. And, indeed, the moment they were told that this itself was the
                  high and mighty country of Self-Conceit, they seemed like men amazed, but brought
                  to their senses. They remembered now with shame their foolish feelings of elation
                  on coming up the river, and they sat down by the wayside, and wept for very
                  anguish at the manner in which they had neglected the precious heavenly
                  instructions of their King, and even had began almost to despise their own humble
                  and lowly views, when with contrite hearts they had waited on him, and trembled at
                  his Word.
               And now they were reduced to great straits, and wished they had never left their
                  vessel, and began to despair of ever getting back, especially as a change of
                  weather set in, and the rains fell in torrents, and the roads became almost
                  impassable. For though the ways of that region were well enough in dry and
                  pleasant weather, yet in the rainy season they were nothing but a great bog. So
                  the pilgrims again and again were plunged almost to destruction in pits and
                  quagmires, and once or twice they were nearly lost in fording streams. They lost
                  the way entirely, and could find no person in all that region who so much as knew
                  the river where their ship lay. So they wept and mourned, and besought God to have
                  mercy upon them.
               They thought now, that any storm at sea was better to be endured than such misery.
                  They thought, if they could once get back to the vessel, they never would leave it
                  again, no, not for a day, on any consideration. They sometimes thought it would
                  even have been better for them, if they were back to their native land, so as to
                  take a new start, for they felt that so far from making progress towards the
                  Celestial City, they had gone a great way backward. Their pride was most
                  effectually humbled and broken, and with contrite hearts they struggled towards
                  the quarter where they believed the ship lay.
               
               Ah Peter, said John to his brother, as they were painfully working on in that
                  direction, this will be sad stuff to put in our log-book. Who would have thought
                  that a few steps could have led us so far out of the way?
               A few steps indeed, said Peter, I think we have taken a great many, and the very
                  first was wrong. What business had we, sailors, to leave the ship at all, and go
                  cruising up a strange country, no where laid down in any of the King's charts as
                  lying in our way, and no commission given us to visit it?
               Alas, returned John, there is no excuse for us, and for my part, I am heartily
                  sickened at the remembrance of such amazing folly, and self-delusion, and
                  self-conceit, when I thought I was going on to great attainments. O how rightly is
                  this land named! A man becomes a fool the moment he breathes the climate. Just in
                  proportion to my lofty imaginings, I was going astray. Now, I hate the very
                  thoughts of it. Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul; I would
                  despise my life.11
                  
               
               
                  
                  11 Job ix. 21
               
               Well, said Peter, hold on there. I think this experience will not rot, if ever we
                  get back to the ship. If you ever see me getting proud again, remind me of it. But
                  I am afraid of all my sorrows, and I know that God will not hold me innocent. If I
                  wash myself with snow-water, and make my hands never so clean, yet shalt thou
                  plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.12
                  
               
               
                  
                  12 Job ix. 28, 30, 31.
               
               And yet, only just think of it, answered John. How easy to go astray, without
                  great watching! Lord, have mercy on us! I believe at the very first, it was only
                  the indulgence of an idle curiosity; but it makes me think of the saying, Behold
                  how great a matter a little fire kindleth!13
                   Alas! shall we ever get back? O how justly might the Lord leave us to
                  wander here for ever, in a land of darkness, as darkness itself, and of the shadow
                  of death without any order, and where the light is as darkness.14

                  14 Job x. 22.
               
               Most justly he might, my dear brother, added Peter, and it is only because he is a
                  forgiving God and Saviour, that he does not. But I hope we are on the right track
                  now, though the night is coming, and it must be another day before we see the way
                  back, if we ever do see it. But is there not a passage that says, Seek the Lord
                  and ye shall live?15
                     I am sure if we seek him, we shall find him.
               
                  
                  15Amos v. 6.
               
               Yes, said John, but the passage says also, Seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal,
                  and pass not to Beersheba.16
                   Now I think we have just neglected what we ought to have done, and done
                  what we ought not. These places where we
                  have been wandering are as Bethel and Gilgal to us, full of transgressions. But
                  the passage says also, Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth
                  the shadow of death into the morning.17
                   I see the seven stars even now, in the fall of the evening; and God, who
                  made them, will not forsake us, though we have sinned against him. So let us not
                  despair.
               
                  
                  16 Amos v. 5.
               
               
                  
                  17 Amos v. 8.
               
               No, said Peter, not even if we die here. But the words come into my mind, Come and
                  let us return unto the Lord; for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath
                  smitten, and he will bind us up. He will revive us, and we shall live in his
                     sight.18
                  
               
               
                  
                  18 Hos. vi. 12.
               
               Well, said John, that is encouraging, and so is what follows; Then shall we know,
                  if we follow on to know the Lord, His going forth is prepared as the morning, and
                  he shall come unto us as the rain.19
                  
               
               
                  
                  19 Hos. vi. 3.
               
               And is there not also such a passage as this? answered Peter, I will heal their
                     backslidings.20
                   And even if there were not, has not the Lord Jesus said, Him that cometh
                  unto me I will in no wise cast out.21
                   Now returning is coming, and if we return, we shall be revived; and I am
                  sure we have got a lesson that will last us many a day.

                  21 John vi. 37.
               
               Thus they went on talking; but the greater part of that night was spent in prayer,
                  and they got but little rest, and with the earliest dawn they were on their way
                  again.
               And oh how their hearts were rejoiced, when, about sunset that same day, they
                  caught a sight of the ship and of the river from a rising ground to which they had
                  clambered. They fell on their knees and gave thanks to God, and then hastened on
                  board.
               There they found that during their absence a great trade had been going on between
                  ship and shore, so that some of the most valuable of the goods that had been laid
                  in for their sea-voyage were gone, and the hold was almost filled with strange
                  productions. Some of their gold, silver, and precious stones, had been paid away
                  for quantities of wood, hay, and stubble; for the crew were under a singular
                  delusion, and thought these latter things of more value; and indeed if they had
                  gone on much longer, every precious thing on board would have been thrown away,
                  and its place supplied with whimwhams and vanities from the country of
                  Self-Conceit.
               And now they had great perplexity how to get back to the sea. For the wind
                  continued all the while without any change, blowing up river, so that it was quite
                  impossible, by any use of sails or rudder to move down stream. They were compelled
                  to get out the boats, for there was no
                  time to be spent in waiting for a wind, and indeed they might have been waiting
                  there to this day, had they done it; for the wind in the country of Self-Conceit
                  always blows on shore, and at the season they were then in, the weather keeps the
                  people shut up to themselves; and though sails are often seen passing up the
                  river, they are seldom seen returning. So they made haste to man the boats; and
                  all the long way that they had come up under a fair swift breeze, with all sail
                  set, they had to tow back the ship, with great toil and pains, by rowing. It was
                  slow and fatiguing work, to such a degree, that sometimes they were ready to give
                  up in despair. Moreover, once or twice the inhabitants of the country tried to
                  interfere with them, to stop their progress, and even fired on them; but they took
                  no notice in return, and made all the haste possible towards the sea.
               And at length they arrived at the mouth of the river, and were rejoicing to think
                  how soon they would be again upon the King's highway, when all of a sudden the
                  ship grounded heavily on a bar of sand that was not visible even at low water, and
                  with all their efforts, they could not get her off. The winds and storms, together
                  with the strong currents, are continually in that place shifting the sands, so
                  that great shoals had been formed, which were not there when they entered the
                  river, and of which of course they were wholly unconscious, till the ship struck
                  upon them. All these things, as they found to their cost, made it very easy
                  getting into the country of Self-Conceit, but very difficult escaping from it. All
                  the cargo that had been taken in up river, such as hampers of the various
                  productions of the country, they had to throw overboard, and even the water-casks
                  had to be stove, and only the remnant of water retained, which was in the ship
                  before they entered the river.
               And even then, the ship was not lightened enough, to float; and there they must
                  have remained, getting deeper and deeper imbedded in the sand, had it not been
                  that so near the sea the tide flowed high, and most happily for them was going low
                  when they struck the bar, so that, if it rose high enough, the next tide, after
                  all that they had done in the lighting of the ship, might float her.
               And so it came about. The tide rose high, and accomplished for them what no human
                  force could have done without it. They passed over the bar in safety; and now, as
                  the wind began already to veer a little in their favor, they took in the boats,
                  trimmed their sails, and casting themselves on the care of the Great King, whose
                  highway they had gained, in a few hours they were joyfully tossing on the open
                  sea.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER III.
               EXPERIENCE OF STORMS, AND THE HARBOR OF GOOD HOPE.
               FOR some days they enjoyed the most serene and lovely weather, and were able to
                  lay their course South, towards the trade-winds, where an old inspired navigator
                  had said that the righteous shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands
                  shall be stronger and stronger.1
                   Also another navigator in describing the same passage had said, The path
                  of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect
                     day.2
                   They had now an interval of comparative rest and leisure, which they
                  employed in putting things to rights, for the ship had been sadly neglected while
                  she lay in that river, which they found, on examination, to have been laid, down
                  as the River of Vain Confidence. They had some hard work in overhauling their log,
                  and correcting the mistakes that had been made in their reckoning. Both Peter and
                  John kept a separate journal for the sake of mutual comparison and benefit, and it
                  was while they were at work upon these and other matters, that one day on deck,
                  while the vessel was gliding steadily onward under a fine breeze, they had the
                  following conversation:â€”
               
                  
                  1 Job xvii. 9.
               
               
                  
                  2 Prov. iv. 18.
               
               I think, said Peter, it is a great wonder and miracle of mercy that we got safe
                  out from that country of Self-Conceit, and still more, that we were not buried for
                  ever among the quicksands of the River of Vain Confidence. O what a narrow escape
                  from destruction! And the sin and the danger were all our own fault, for we might
                  have known better. I'm thinking what we can do to avoid such errors for the
                  future; since we ought to have known by the log and chart together, when we were
                  in the neighborhood of the coast of that country; and if we had
                  known, I hope God would not have left us to such madness as that of running
                  deliberately into danger.
               Well, I don't know as to that, answered John; but I do know that a man will go
                  anywhere, into any folly, if left to himself, so that he needs to have God search
                  him continually, and show him what manner of spirit he is of. It is pretty clear
                  that a more faithful self-examination is needed. My log-book is a sad sight, and
                  it teaches me some very mournful lessons,
                  especially of late days; but I would not be without it for a great deal, for it
                  helps me to survey the dealings of the Lord with me, and is encouraging as well as
                  humbling.
               I have heard of a fine young sailor, said Peter, who having read some things
                  written by a grave old Salt in a tract concerning the log-book, conceived the idea
                  that it could never be made a simple record of the work of grace, but the devil
                  would have much to do with it. It distressed him exceedingly, and made him so
                  scrupulous that he one day put into the fire a whole log of experiences very
                  precious and sweet to him, because he was afraid of sin in keeping it. And the
                  consequence was that afterwards, the devil, who as a roaring lion goeth about,
                  seeking whom he may devour,3
                   attacked the poor lad in a storm, and for want of that log almost
                  succeeded in making him believe that he had never been in those seas, nor ever
                  even set sail from his native country.
               
                  
                  31 Pet. v. 8.
               
               Well, said John, it is good, and Satan knows it, to record the Lord's goodness,
                  and have it in remembrance. I know how Jacob used to do, for want of better
                  materials. He set up an altar at Bethel, where the Lord appeared to him, and when
                  he had wrestled with the angel and prevailed, he called the name of that place
                  Peniel, because he had seen the Lord face to face, and his life was preserved.4
                   And David also used to set up such way-marks, and when he was very much
                  cast down and discouraged by present difficulties, he used to go back and consider
                     them.5
                   He made a record of the battle with the lion and the bear, and when Saul
                  tried to prevent him from fighting with Goliah, what does he but just turn over to
                  that page in his log-book, and reads the account to Saul, and tells him that the
                  same God who delivered him out of the mouth of the lion and the bear, would give
                  him the victory over that uncircumcised Philistine.6
                   Why! I wouldn't burn such a history on any account, if I had it. But
                  indeed I pity the poor dear fellow you speak of, if Satan had the handling of him
                  in a storm. It is bad enough in clear weather.
               
                  
                  4 Gen. xxxii. 30.

                  6 1 Sam. xvii. 37.
               
               Why, said Peter, it is the storm that Satan takes for some, and the calm for
                  others, according to what he knows of things aboard ship. If the crew are much at
                  their ease, he will come any time. But to my thinking, we must take better care of
                  our reckoning, keep a better look-out, and have the log over-hauled daily. It wont
                  do to give Satan the advantage, seeing we know so well how he works.
               Just then, though it had been such fine weather before, a bank of clouds began to
                  be visible in the horizon, and there was
                  a sound like the muttering of distant thunder. Also the breeze fell, and the air
                  round about seemed to stand stock still, as if it were waiting for something like
                  an earthquake. This put Peter and John on the alert, and running to the barometer,
                  they found the mercury falling, so that at once they ordered all sail taken in,
                  and everything on board ship made as tight as possible. The hatches were battened
                  down, and all was prepared, as well as could be, for a storm, since they knew not
                  how heavy it might come, nor how long it might last. And come it did with great
                  violence, so that there was no time to lose; for the gale swept like a whirlwind,
                  and had there been anything left exposed for the wind to get hold of, it seemed as
                  though the masts would have been taken out of the ship bodily.
               The conflict of the elements was terrible. Sometimes the rain poured down as if
                  the whole heavens had burst, and the thunder roared, and the lightning flashed
                  incessantly. Then again it seemed as if the wind itself would beat both thunder
                  and lightning. Not a word could be heard on board ship, and such a sea was raised,
                  that the like of it they had never seen, nor even imagined possible.
               Nevertheless, they would perhaps have gone through it unharmed, if it had not been
                  for a little negligence at the helm, which just then needed the greatest strength
                  and watchfulness. For a slight sheer in the steering brought the broadside of a
                  wave upon them with such tremendous violence, that almost everything went by the
                  board. The bulwarks were wrenched down, and the whole companion way was carried
                  off, so that the water rushed into the cabin and nearly filled it. The next moment
                  the foremast was carried short off near the deck, notwithstanding that not a rag
                  of canvas had been left exposed to the tempest.
               Then said Peter, and he could not help groaning it aloud, so that John heard him,
                  All thy waves and thy billows are gone over me!7
                   But John held his peace, for he was afraid of discouraging the crew, if
                  they gave way themselves as in terror; but he thought at one time the end had
                  come. Then he said within himself, Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the
                  great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.8
                   And the words came to him, When I said my foot slippeth, thy mercy, O
                  Lord, held me up. In the multitude of my thoughts within me, thy comforts delight
                  my soul.9
                   So they both looked to God with strong crying and tears, for they were in
                  very great danger.

                  9 Psa. xciv. 18, 19.
               
               The storm did not abate, the night came down in pitch darkness, and everything was
                  gloomy. To add to their distress, the
                  ship, which had seemed to have suffered no injury in her timbers, began evidently
                  to leak, for on sounding, they found several feet of water in the hold. And now
                  for the first time it occurred to Peter and John that she must have been weakened
                  in some way, while grounded on the bar in the River of Vain Confidence; but all
                  they could now do was to work at the pumps.
               And here again they were terribly disheartened, and all hope seemed about to be
                  taken from them; for though one of the pumps worked well, yet the other was nearly
                  useless, and on trying to discover the cause, they found that a parcel of grain,
                  which had been taken on board in the country of Self-Conceit, having been
                  deposited near the bottom of the pump, and not at all cleared away, had swollen
                  and choked the spaces, so that the water would not draw.
               Now among the crew there were two named Contrition and Sincere, and they at once
                  confessed that they remembered the putting in of that grain, and had themselves
                  had a hand in it, and if any soul on board could get at it, it was they. So they
                  volunteered, at great hazard and difficulty, because working in the hold was
                  almost impossible at such a time, to get the evil out of the way. And indeed they
                  labored with such despairing energy, that after a while they did succeed in
                  reaching the source of the trouble, and were so far enabled to remove it, that the
                  pumps worked freely, and the ship was eased.
               But the leaks were not to be got at, for it was no large leak, but a general
                  injury, the effect of which would inevitably continue, while the ship labored so
                  heavily, in such a tremendous sea. All they could do, therefore, was to keep the
                  pumps going, day and night, which cost them incessant fatigue, so that they were
                  almost dead from exhaustion. Then, too, there was not a dry place in the ship,
                  where they could rest for an hour's sleep, but sleeping or waking they were wet
                  and uncomfortable. And what between the storm and their own labors, the pressure
                  was so great, that they had hardly time so much as to eat, and nothing could be
                  cooked for them, so that their knees grew weak through fasting, and they thought
                  if things continued in this state much longer, they should be reduced to utter
                  despair. But they hoped they had seen the worst, though still the storm seemed
                  unabated in its fury.
               But all this while they had been driving before the tempest, not knowing where
                  they were, nor how far they had gone, nor whether they were near any land or not;
                  and as to steering a direct course, it was almost impossible, though they did what
                  they could to keep the ship's head to the wind, in the direction of the Celestial Country, for they were manifestly
                  driving swiftly, somewhere or other, and well they knew that there was no help for
                  them but in him who brought his people through the sea and through the
                     wilderness.10
                  
               
               
                  
                  10 Psa. cxxxvi. 16.
               
               So they cried unto the Lord, Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; hear
                  me speedily, O Lord, my spirit faileth; hide not thy face from me, lest I be like
                  them that go down into the pit.11
                   They resolved, if the ship must founder, they would go down heading
                  towards the Celestial City. Then they thought they heard a voice, When thou
                  passest through the waters, I will be with thee;12
                   and they remembered the promise, Who is among you that feareth the Lord,
                  that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness and hath no light?
                  Let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God.13
                   They thought also, if the case was thus provided for, of those who were
                  walking in darkness without light, that neither the absence of light, nor the
                  presence of darkness, nor any of their perplexities or difficulties, were in
                  themselves any proof that the Lord had deserted them, but rather a proof that he
                  was only trying them, to see if they would stay themselves on him.
               
                  
                  11 Psa. cxliii. 7, 8.

                  13 Isa. l. 10.
               
               So they held on, hoping, though it seemed to be against hope, and they knew not
                  what was before them. But about midnight, some of the shipmen were convinced that
                  they drew near to some land, and some of them even thought they could see the
                  breakers on the coast. So they sounded, and found it about twenty fathoms, and
                  when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it about
                  fifteen fathoms; and then, fearing lest they should strike, they cast out their
                  best bower anchor, and wished for the day.14
                  
               
               
                  
                  14 Acts xxvii. 28, 29.
               
               For a time it was doubtful whether the anchor itself would hold, and if not, or if
                  the cable parted, then all was lost; so they were in great anxiety and trembling.
                  Besides, the day was long coming, and the ship rose and fell with such tremendous
                  violence, laboring heavily, that some of the shipmen, who had held out to this
                  hour, began to be seized with terror, and lost their wits to such a degree as to
                  imagine that by deserting the ship and taking to the boats, they might stand some
                  chance of salvation, for it seemed as if they must perish, and the great adversary
                  put very black thoughts into the minds of some of them, so that they were even
                  tempted to cast themselves overboard headlong.
               But Peter and John with their own hands cut the boats loose, and let them fall
                  off, and convinced the crew that come
                  what might, except they abode by the ship they could not be saved.15
                   Then they called the whole ship's company together, and earnestly
                  commended them all to God, and after a season spent in weeping and praying
                  together, they felt that if it pleased the Lord that they should perish in the
                  midst of their voyage, they would leave themselves with him, and to their last
                  breath would try to be faithful to him. Then they took some meat, and Peter took
                  bread, and gave thanks to God, in the presence of them all, and said, Into thy
                  hands I commend my spirit; thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth.16
                   Also he repeated the words of Habakkuk, Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I
                  will joy in the God of my salvation.17

                  17 Hab. iii. 18.
               
               Now by this time the day began to break, and to their great encouragement a streak
                  of the sky was to be seen in the horizon, just in that quarter where the hurricane
                  with which the storm began had arisen, and as the light grew brighter it became
                  very evident that the tempest was broken. Then said John, as he pointed to the
                  morning star through a rift in the clouds that were hurrying away, Weeping may
                  endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.18
                   Nevertheless, they were still sorely afflicted, and they felt that God had
                  taken them out of the very jaws of destruction, and how it would end even yet they
                  knew not.
               
                  
                  18 Psa. xxx. 5.
               
               However, as the gale abated, the sea went down, and as soon as it became clear,
                  they found they had been driven a great way during the tempest, but not so much
                  out of the way as they had feared, for they were not far from an admirable and
                  safe harbor called Good Hope Harbor, situated at the bottom of a bay called the
                  Bay of Good Hope, where was one of the King's own dockyards, and a dry dock, built
                  by order of the King himself, after a pattern sent from the Celestial Country.
               This Harbor and Bay lay in the middle of a coast of great reach called Experience,
                  past a part of which they had been driven; and as the wind was now fair for
                  rounding the point, within which they had been carried to their present anchorage,
                  they shook out their sails, weighed anchor, and trimmed their course to gain the
                  favorable shelter. They were not long in reaching it, notwithstanding the leaky
                  condition of their vessel; and here in the harbor of Good Hope they found a
                  friendly people, and everything necessary for examining their injuries, and
                  refitting. The people of the town were under the King's laws, and had orders from
                  him to use hospitality without
                     grudging,19
                     a thing which they were also forward to do.
               
                  
                  191 Pet. iv. 9.
               
               But here the first thing they did, before coming to anchor, and while sailing into
                  the Harbor, with the town rising in its beauty before themâ€”a sight which made the
                  tears run down their cheeks for gratitude and joyâ€”the first thing they did was to
                  offer up a heartfelt and solemn thanksgiving to God for the great deliverance he
                  had granted them out of so many dangers. They sang a hymn, and the sweet melody
                  had their hearts in it, and went up with so divine a harmony on the quiet air, in
                  the bright day, as they glided over the still waters, that the people on the shore
                  left off their work and listened, and others came down to see what new arrival was
                  thus heralded; for they thought some messenger-ship might have come to them from
                  the Islands of the Angels. The hymn they sang was one that had been written by a
                  shipwrecked mariner, whom God had rescued from the deep, and never were sweeter
                  strains heard upon the ocean. 
                     
                        God moves in a mysterious way
                        His wonders to perform;
                        He plants his footsteps in the sea,
                        And rides upon the storm.
                     
                     
                        Deep in unfathomable mines
                        Of never-failing skill,
                        He treasures up his bright designs,
                        And works his sovereign will.
                     
                     
                        Ye fearful saints fresh courage take;
                        The clouds ye so much dread
                        Are big with mercy, and shall break
                        In blessings on your head.
                     
                     
                        Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
                        But trust him for his grace;
                        Behind a frowning providence
                        He hides a smiling face.
                     
                     
                        His purposes will ripen fast,
                        Unfolding every hour;
                        The bud may have a bitter taste,
                        But sweet will be the flower.
                     
                     
                        Blind unbelief is sure to err,
                        And scan his work in vain;
                        God is his own Interpreter,
                        And he will make it plain.
                     
                  
               
               After the singing of this hymn, there was read a part of the 107th Psalm, which is
                  an exact description of the perils through which God had brought them. O that men
                  would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the
                  children of men! And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and
                  declare his works with rejoicing. They that go down to the sea in ships, that do
                     busi- ness in great waters; these see
                  the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep. For he commandeth, and raiseth
                  the stormy wind, and lifteth up the waves thereof. They mount up to the heavens,
                  they go down again to the depths; their soul is melted because of trouble. They
                  reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end. Then
                  they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their
                  distress. He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. Then
                  are they glad, because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired
                  haven. Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful
                  works to the children of men!
               At this the heart of every one of them responded, and they said within themselves,
                  When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? And when he hideth his face,
                  who then can behold him?20
                   If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under
                     him.21
                   They also sang another sweet hymn of praise, which they called the Star of
                  Bethlehem. 
                     
                        When marshalled on the nightly plain
                        The glittering host bestud the sky,
                        One star alone, of all the train,
                        Can fix the sinner's wandering eye.
                     
                     
                        Hark! hark! to God the chorus breaks,
                        From every host, from every gem;
                        But one alone the Saviour speaks,
                        It is the Star of Bethlehem!
                     
                     
                        Once on the raging seas I rode,
                        The storm was loud, the night was dark,
                        The ocean yawned, and rudely blowed
                        The wind that tossed my foundering bark.
                     
                     
                        Deep horror, then, my vitals froze,
                        Death-struck. I ceased the tide to stem,
                        When suddenly a star arose,
                        It was the Star of Bethlehem!
                     
                     
                        It was my guide, my light, my all;
                        It bade my dark forebodings cease;
                        And through the storm, and danger's thrall,
                        It led me to the port of peace.
                     
                     
                        Now safely moored, my perils o'er,
                        I'll sing, first in night's diadem,
                        For ever and for ever more,
                        The Star! the Star of Bethlehem!
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  20 Job xxxiv. 29.
               
               
                  
                  21 Job ix. 13.
               
               Now while they were singing, the ship drew near the land, and the land-breeze came
                  off upon the water from the King's gardens, laden with such a delicious fragrance,
                  that it seemed as if it must have come to them directly from the trees of life in
                  the Celestial Country. And indeed the change was so great from what they had
                  passed through to such mercy, that it was as if the dark night had been suc- ceeded by one of the Days of Heaven, and
                  all the scenery of the Celestial World seemed to rise up before them. Oh, when the
                  Redeemer unveils his lovely face, and shines upon the soul in forgiving mercy,
                  what joy on earth is to be compared with the assurance of his pardoning love! Thou
                  shalt forget thy misery, exclaimed Peter, and remember it as waters that pass
                  away; and thine age shall be clearer than the noon-day; thou shalt shine forth,
                  thou shalt be as the morning, and thou shalt be secure, because there is Hope.22
                  
               
               
                  
                  22 Job xi. 16, 17, 18.
               
               Well, the region they had come to was a region of hope, and the inhabitants of
                  that place were all hopeful and happy, and they had good right to be so, because
                  there was a very close communion between their town and the Celestial Country in
                  many ways. And their laws were laws of liberty and not of bondage; for one of the
                  greatest of them ran as follows: The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus
                  hath made me free from the law of sin and death.23
                   It was also a land where there were a great many fugitives from slavery;
                  and the Adversary was forbidden to reclaim the slave that had escaped from him,
                  but the moment he got into that land he was free; and there was a grand law that
                  ran as follows:â€”Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is
                  escaped from his master unto thee; he shall dwell with thee, even among you, in
                  that place which he shall choose, in one of thy gates, where it liketh him best;
                  thou shalt not oppress him.24
                  
               
               
                  
                  23 Rom. vii. 2.
               
               
                  
                  24 Deut. xxiii. 15, 16.
               
               The people of the land loved this law, and rejoiced in it; and whenever the Great
                  Slaveholder appeared among them, as sometimes he did in cunning disguises, to get
                  back his victims, or whenever any of his commissioners or catchers were detected
                  laying their snares, the inhabitants of the town had the bells rung for alarm, and
                  all turned out in one body; and if any of the villains were caught, they were
                  forthwith branded, and whipped out of all that region. So it was a place of great
                  joy, loving-kindness, and security, where every law that opposed any of the King's
                  laws was put down at once.
               Moreover, the geography of their place indicated its security, for the formations
                  of the coast ran into one another from a great way North, in the following order,
                  namely, Tribulation, Patience, Experience, Hope.25
                   Then there was a wide reach of beautiful open country, and beyond that a
                  region of riches and glory that since the creation of the world had never been
                  fully explored, and indeed was said to lose itself in an unfathomable,
                  incomprehensible sea, from which none of the explorers ever returned, but
                     passed
                  
                     
                     25 Rom. v. 4.
                   into the Celestial Country for
                  ever. All that region, so far as any knew anything about it was named, THE LOVE OF
                  GOD IS SHED ABROAD IN OUR HEARTS BY THE HOLY GHOST WHICH IS GIVEN UNTO US.26
                   There were many that had been great travellers there, but the more they
                  found out, the more they always found there was to be known, so that they came
                  back very much humbled as well as overjoyed by their experience. In the same
                  direction on the Chart of the Ship, was found this description; Eye hath not seen,
                  nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God
                  hath prepared for them that love him; but God hath revealed them unto us by his
                     Spirit.27
                  
               
               
                  
                  26 Rom. v. 5.
               
               
                  
                  27 1 Cor. ii. 9.
               
               Here, then, the Pilgrims felt themselves at liberty, because there was no mistake
                  about the country; and its fruits would have proved where they were, even the
                  things of the Spirit, if their instructions had not been so plain that there was
                  no danger of erring. Yet the trials they had passed through had made them sober
                  and watchful, so that they received with a chastened mind the affectionate and
                  friendly greetings of the inhabitants. The utmost kindness was shown to them, and
                  they were carried up to the King's gardens, and regaled with fresh fruits, and
                  they had much sweet and loving conversation with those who accompanied them.
               Here also the ship's crew could trade with the town's people without danger; and
                  besides this, a great many articles were brought down to them as gifts, with a
                  readiness and good will that it would have done one's heart good to see. Here a
                  very precious thing called the Earnest of the Spirit was given to them, and they
                  were instructed to prove all things, and try everything by the truth, and to hold
                  the beginning of their confidence and the rejoicing of their hope firm unto the
                     end.28
                   And that they might do this the more surely, they were reminded of a
                  well-known rule of the King, that he that hath this hope in him purifieth himself
                  even as He is pure.29
                  
               
               
                  
                  28 Heb. iii. 6.
               
               
                  
                  29 1 John iii. 3.
               
               Here also they had the Spirit helping their infirmities, and they found their
                  hearts drawn out in great prayer, and in such yearnings after the Celestial
                  Country as could not be uttered; so that, although in this place they experienced
                  a joy unspeakable and full of glory, yet they had no mind to stay any longer than
                  was requisite for the refreshment of the ship's crew, and the refitting of their
                  vessel; and besides these inward yearnings of the Spirit, they had the example of
                  a great navigator who had been in this Harbor, to forget the things that are
                     behind, and reach forth to those that
                  are before.30
                   Wherefore they desired to be upon their way, and under the King's laws
                  they laid in a new supply of fresh water, and a quantity of provisions, concerning
                  which they had orders to give diligence, and to have them on board wherever they
                  could find them, adding to their faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to
                  knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godliness, and
                  to godliness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness charity;31
                   because the success of their voyage, for the honor of the King, and the
                  manner of their entrance in the Celestial kingdom, was said to depend upon the
                  abundant supply of these things.

                  31 2 Pet. i. 5, 6, 7.
               
               To supply the place of the mast that had been carried away by the storm, they put
                  in a new mast from the King's forests, out of a timber called the Saint's
                  Perseverance. They also put into the hold a quantity of ballast fetched from a
                  quarry in the neighborhood, which was under the charge of two men greatly honored
                  by the King, whose names were Humility and Self-Distrust, for they had found
                  before-time a defect in the ship's sailing, and a consequent danger, in case of
                  any sudden squalls, by reason of her great lightness; a thing of much importance
                  to be guarded against; besides, that they could not, without proper ballast of
                  this kind, turn the vessel advantageously to the wind.
               Furthermore, by advice of the authorities of the place under charge from the King,
                  because a part of the seas they would have to pass through were infested with
                  pirates, they put on board out of the King's Armory five great guns, called by
                  five inscriptions engraven upon them, as follows:â€”RESIST THE DEVIL AND HE WILL
                  FLEE FROM YOU.32
                  â€”WHO SHALL LAY ANYTHING TO THE CHARGE OF GOD'S ELECT?33
                  â€”WHO SHALL SEPARATE US FROM THE LOVE OF CHRIST?34
                  â€”WHO IS HE THAT CONDEMNETH?35
                  â€”And, IF GOD BE FOR US, WHO SHALL BE AGAINST US?36
                  â€”They had also a great mortar, called Promise, with bombs and ammunition,
                  and a fire engine called GRACE TO HELP IN TIME OF NEED.37
                   Two of the best boats ever builded in the Harbor were also presented to
                  them, with oars for sweeps made out of a strong elastic wood called Prevailing
                  Prayer, which grew in great abundance in the King's forests, and was the best
                  stuff that ever could be used for such purposes.

               THE SHIP BECALMED, AND A TALK ABOUT THE CRUCIBLE.
               NOW the people of the place would gladly have had them prolong their stay in the
                  Harbor, but seeing they were determined to sail, they bade them God speed. Then
                  the grave elders of the place gave them some parting instructions as to divers
                  uncertain winds of doctrine, that they might know how to meet them, and not be
                  tossed to and fro by them.1
                   They warned them also concerning faith and a good conscience, aud told
                  them of some who, having put away the good conscience, concerning faith had made
                     shipwreck.2
                   And they said to them, The good things committed to you keep by the Holy
                  Ghost which dwelleth in us.3
                   So the wind being fair, they set sail, and the last thing said to them was
                  this, namely, In everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your
                  requests be made known unto God; and the peace of God which passeth all
                  understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.4
                   It was a sweet benediction, and the sound of it seemed to whisper in the
                  wind long after the Harbor and the Bay were lost sight of.

                  4 Phil. iv. 6, 7.
               
               And in truth the experience of this blessing came upon them; for heaven and the
                  sea seemed one harmonious scene of loveliness and peace, and for many days they
                  sailed with sweet content before the breeze that God sent them. The air was clear
                  and invigorating by day, and by night the new moon and the stars shone brightly,
                  till it seemed as if the weather had got such a habit of serenity and beauty that
                  it could not change. So they began to relax a little in their diligence, and the
                  discipline on board ship grew somewhat careless. But they were soon made to see
                  that even with every other thing just as favorable as ever, they might perish, if
                  the Lord should but a little while withhold his Spirit. For the wind, that had
                  been so favorable, died gradually away, till at length it was a perfect dead
                  calm.
               And now the sails flapped idly against the masts, and the helm swayed from side to
                  side with the roll of the ship, without any onward motion, and now and then the
                  whole canvas would come thrashing and
                  thundering with a lazy thwack against the yards and spars, as if it had no other
                  object or use, but just to wear itself out by flapping. The crew hung idly about,
                  endeavoring at intervals to make work where nothing seemed necessary to be done,
                  picking the shreds of old rope into oakum, burnishing the guns, leaning over the
                  sides of the ship, and gazing down into the silent waters. Once or twice they got
                  a sail overboard to bathe, but the sharks' fins appeared so clearly in the
                  neighborhood, that they did not dare enjoy themselves, even with that
                  expedient.
               Their souls at length melted for heaviness, and such a weight and stupor seemed to
                  pervade the air, that a lassitude of body and spirit came over them, which made it
                  a weariness to move. And still the calm continued so long, that it seemed as if
                  they were fastened there for ever. The sun looked down at noon, exceeding hot, for
                  they were now in warm latitudes, and the sea was a great mirror, reflecting the
                  heat and light, and yet they could not stir. Peter and John walked the deck and
                  whistled, and now and then gazed long and steadfastly at the horizon, but it would
                  not do. The boats were got out, and manned with sweeps, but it was useless. All
                  they could do was to cast themselves on God, and groan over their condition.
               Now and then a puff of wind started them a little, and it seemed as if the breeze
                  would come, and in one of those catspaws they encountered a very fearful sight,
                  for the wreck of a ship came floating by, turned up upon her beam ends, her masts
                  gone, or under water, covered with barnacles and seaweed. The long undulating
                  swell broke upon her with a melancholy wash, and it was a sad sight to look upon;
                  a picture of utter ruin and desolation. But what they speedily saw made it more
                  solemn still; for as the wreck, like some dead carcass of a whale floated by, and
                  the roll of the sea lifted her stem out of water, Peter, looking narrowly, thought
                  he could plainly read her name, and could make out the words SINLESS PERFECTION,
                  with something further that could scarce be distinguished.
               Then said Peter to John, after they had both gazed for some time in silence at the
                  sight, I think, verily, I know that vessel, and by whom she was built and
                  chartered; for if I am not greatly mistaken, it was one Highminded, of the Country
                  of Self-Delusion. The timber of the ship was good, for the builder had a great
                  deal of knowledge of the King's forests; but being himself three quarters owner,
                  he gave her in command of one Captain Heady, with a mate for his chief officer,
                  whose name was Self-Esteem. Then a crew was shipped, among whom were Ignorance,
                  Presumption, Fitful, Censorious, and
                  False Zeal. They also had on board, as part of their cargo, a quantity of spirits
                  called Self-exaltation, which was given out by the Captain in daily rations; and
                  it is my firm belief, if the truth could be told that the vessel having fallen
                  into danger, the crew gave themselves up to drinking, and every one of them
                  perished in their own corruption.5
                  
               
               
                  
                  5 2 Pet. ii. 12.
               
               Well, said John, it is a gloomy, mournful spectacle. He that exalteth himself
                  shall be abased, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.6
                   It is a terrible sight in these seas; let him that thinketh he standeth
                  take heed lest he fall.7
                   Who knows but that this vessel may have sailed just where we are sailing
                  now, with a prospect every whit as fair, to all seeming, for reaching the
                  Celestial Country?

                  7 1 Cor. x. 12.
               
               Then answered Peter, The word of God declares that if we say we have no sin, we
                  deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.8
                   And I knew a most experienced weather-beaten old navigator, who used to
                  exclaim, If I say I am perfect, that also shall prove me perverse.9
                   But this pretence to a sinless perfection hath various kinds and causes;
                  some taking it up as a cloak of licentiousness, and sporting them selves with
                  their own deceiving,10
                   others dreaming to have gone into an interior life so deep as to have got
                  beyond sin, others again rising so high as to have come to an atmosphere where the
                  elements of sin can be handled without any defilement, just as you can bathe your
                  body in the sea, and yet not have the salt-water enter the pores of the skin. But
                  these last are clouds carried about with a tempest, as the others are wells
                  without water.11
                   But they all of them, if they be not turned from their error, after a
                  while fall to speaking great swelling words of vanity, like those we met in the
                  country of Self-Conceit, and deceive and captivate many unstable souls by
                  promising them liberty.12
                   Now of a truth the Christian is called unto liberty, but only where the
                  Spirit of the Lord is,13
                   and not for an occasion to the flesh.14

                  14 Gal. v. 13.
               
               Ah, my brother, said John, some men's ideas of liberty are all contrary to the
                  gospel, as well as of perfection. But we know for certain that the work of
                  overcoming sin, and destroying the Old Man, is going on all through life; and
                  God's discipline is needed, even with his best children, to keep down their
                  indwelling corruptions; and if they think they have none, it is nearly all the
                  same as giving up the whole ship to their control.
               Some men's sins, returned Peter, walk the deck, and are very bold and shameless;
                  others slink away in by-places, and keep out of sight in corners, till opportunity comes. Some men's sins get
                  passage with the cargo by deceit, just as poor emigrants, or fugitives from debt
                  and justice, will hide in holes till the vessel is out at sea, that they may
                  escape the bailiff, and not have to pay their fare, nor be thrown overboard.
               Yes, added John, and some Captains have been known to put their vicious hands
                  under the hatches, thinking that because they were out of sight they could do no
                  mischief, when they were such villains and murderers, that by the King's law they
                  ought to have been hanged, or put ashore on some desert island. There was one
                  fellow, Pride, aboard as fine a ship, to all appearance, as ever was launched, who
                  got up a mutiny, and corrupted several of the crew, but as he was a near kinsman
                  of the Captain, he was too tender of him to execute the law, and only put him in
                  the hold with bread and water. But the villain, some how or other, got hold of an
                  auger and axe, and bored a hole in the ship's bottom so big, that she foundered;
                  and yet, before she went down, the hatches having been taken off to try and get at
                  the leak, Pride and his fellows got out, and escaped by swimming. They got ashore
                  unhurt, on a shallow soft marsh, and found themselves in the Country of Flattery,
                  where they set up for gentlemen, and are living still.
               Well, said Peter, a man's pride shall bring him low, but honor shall uphold the
                  humble in spirit.15
                   Such villains have been playing their tricks ever since the time of
                  Joshua, when they came to that great Captain-General with crusts of mouldy bread
                  and old shoes, as if they had travelled a great way, and entered into a league
                  with him.16
                   And then they were very well content to live with the people as hewers of
                  wood and drawers of water, if only they might live.17
                   But all the Canaanites and Jebusites that were spared proved to be as
                  thorns in the side, and were always making mischief. Now if the children of God
                  think to spare their sins, and make hewers of wood and drawers of water of them,
                  they will have mischief and misery. Some of such servants will be petted and
                  cosseted, and he that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child, shall have
                  him become his son at the length.15
                  
               
               
                  
                  15 Prov. xxix. 23.
               
               
                  
                  16 Josh. ix. 5.
               
               
                  
                  17 Josh. ix. 21.
               
               
                  
                  15 Prov. xxix. 21.
               
               
               Now while they were thus talking, it seemed as if the signs of the sky had become
                  more encouraging, and there were some clouds in the horizon that gave promise of
                  the possibility of wind. Then said they one to another, Who knows but that the
                  Lord will be gracious unto us this day, and grant us his blessing?19
                   So they besought God in prayer, with greater faith
                  
                     
                     19 Joel ii. 14.
                   and earnestness than they had for a long time put
                  to this work; and about sunset they saw at a distance as it were a dark shade
                  rippling the surface of the sea, though it had been so long time far and wide as
                  smooth as glass; and then they knew that the breeze was coming. But O with what
                  eagerness they stood and watched its progress, till the ship began to feel it, and
                  as soon as she caught it what a change! The very ocean seemed glad of it, and the
                  foam kissed the sides of the ship as she danced along, and the sails that before
                  were almost dropping to pieces, now bellied out upon the taut cordage, and all
                  hands were active with a cheerful courage and life, so that it seemed as if she
                  had just started from the harbor.
               And indeed it was a most lovely, animating sight, this activity, after such sleep,
                  and gloom, and drooping. The freshness of the wind, before which they now seemed
                  to be flying from death to life; the sparkle and foam of the waves, racing as if
                  they too had a glad intelligence; the splendor of the evening sky, where they
                  seemed about to sail into heaven; the invigorating elasticity suddenly diffused
                  through the air, as if it were a new creation; what a blissful change in all
                  things! Every sense felt its influence; their heaviness of spirits was all gone, a
                  burden was lifted from the soul, and they were filled with such rejoicing of
                  heart, that they could not help breaking forth spontaneously into a hymn of praise
                  expressive of their feelings. They sung with their whole soul, as birds escaped
                  from prison; it seemed as if they never had known what it was to sing before; and
                  it was with such a deep sense of the presence and goodness of the Saviour, his
                  loving kindness and tender mercy, and their entire dependence upon him, out upon
                  the wide ocean, that nothing could be more suitably melodious. 
                     
                        Jesus, at thy command,
                        I launch into the deep,
                        And leave my native land,
                        Where sin lulls all asleep.
                        For thee I fain would all resign,
                        And sail to heaven with thee and thine.
                     
                     
                        Thou art my Pilot wise,
                        My compass is thy Word;
                        My soul each storm defies,
                        While I have such a Lord.
                        I trust thy faithfulness and power,
                        To save me in the trying hour.
                     
                     
                        Though rocks and quicksands deep
                        Through all my passage lie,
                        Yet thou wilt safely keep
                        And guide me with thine eye.
                        My anchor, Hope, shall firm abide,
                        And I each boisterous storm outride.
                     
                     
                     
                        By faith I see the land
                        The port of endless rest;
                        My soul, thy sails expand,
                        And fly to Jesus' breast.
                        O may I reach the heavenly shore,
                        Where winds and waves distress no more.
                     
                     
                        Whene'er becalmed I lie,
                        And storms and winds subside,
                        Lord, to my succor fly,
                        And keep me near thy side
                        For more the treacherous calm I dread,
                        Than tempests bursting o'er my head.
                     
                     
                        Come, heavenly wind, and blow
                        A prosperous gale of grace,
                        To waft me from below,
                        To heaven my destined place.
                        Then in full sail my port I'll find
                        And leave the world and sin behind.
                     
                  
               
               Now when they had finished singing, it chimed eight bells, and the watch was set
                  for the night, and every one on board went with a glad and grateful heart to his
                  duty, and Peter and John resumed, in the quiet of the evening, beneath the stars,
                  the conversation which the ominous sight of the wreck had led them into.
               My brother, said Peter, did you ever know a truly good man, who did not daily
                  mourn over his own sins? I am sure, the more there is of such sorrow, the more
                  proof there is of God's work. And some- times afflictions themselves may be given
                  as a reward of such sorrow for sin, and a means of taking the sin more effectually
                  away. The-sparing of the rod would spoil God's children.20
                   There is a perfection in reserve for them, in the righteousness of Christ.
                  And we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence
                  steadfast unto the end.21
                   The righteousness of Christ is ours now, to stand upon, and be justified
                  and forgiven on the ground of it; and if we hold fast, it will be ours by and by
                  in his perfect likeness. We shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.22
                   And meantime even in this world, beholding as in a glass the glory of the
                  Lord, we shall be changed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the
                  Spirit of the Lord.23
                   But that is a great work, and providence and grace are both concerned in
                  it. Sometimes it goes on by fiery trials.

               Well, said John, you say true; and there is no other way to account for it, why
                  God sometimes seems to afflict those the most severely, who appear to be the most
                  earnest in doing his will. I know an experienced and wise old naval Commander, who
                  used to say that the Church in this world is God's workshop, his jewel-shop, where
                  his jewels are a polishing for his kingdom and glory above. They are to be his crown-jewels, adorning the crown of
                  the Redeemer. But while they are here below, in the shop, he has many sharp tools
                  for their filing and cutting, and they lie among these tools, and often have to
                  come under their operation. And those that the King most esteems, and means to
                  make the most resplendent, he hath oftenest his tools upon. That was a beautiful
                  saying, and a true one.
               Indeed, it is true, answered Peter. Those whom he loves, he rebukes and
                     chastens.24
                   And O, to be such a living stone, to be a jewel fit to shine in the
                  Saviour's crown for ever, what would not any man in his senses be willing to give
                  or to undergo for such glory! Why, I think that to get rid of sin, say nothing of
                  the crown, to have God mercifully work upon us to remove our sin, is infinite
                  love, mercy, and glory. And then to think that he has promised to make us perfect,
                  if we will submit to his discipline! Oh what joy there is in that! And then to
                  think that all this is done for the Redeemer, that he who died for us may be
                  glorified and admired in us, when he comes to take possession of his inheritance
                  in the saints;25
                   indeed, that raises the joy and the glory infinitely higher, to think that
                  it is Christ's own joy, and Christ's own glory.

                  25 2 Thess. i. 10.
               
               Yes, said John, it is the love of the Father to the Son, as well as to those who
                  are sons by Adoption, that makes him deal thus with his children. There is a great
                  mystery in affliction, sometimes, to those who do not see by faith, but it is
                  sweetly clear to those who do. For what dear Son is there, whom his father
                  chasteneth not?26
                   I have known some, who have gone in a tempest all the way, and others who
                  have had fair weather. But the tempest-tossed were almost always the deepest in
                  Christian experience. And that agrees with the passage about the trial of our
                  faith working experience.27
                   God seeth not as man sees. Man seeth the appearance, but God looketh at
                  the heart.28
                   The fact is that God sees through us, quite through, and sees
                  a great many hidden evils, that need to be brought out. So he puts us into the
                  crucible.

                  28 1 Sam. xvi. 7.
               
               Well, said Peter, the crucible is a wonderful thing, and those that go into a
                  goldsmith's shop, and watch its operation, may learn a great deal that they never
                  knew before. You know that in that passage in the Old Testament about the
                  Refiner's fire,29
                   it is said that He shall sit as a Refiner and purifier of silver. Now the
                  Refiner sits patiently, till the silver or the gold become so clear, by the dross
                  rising, and being skimmed away, that he can see his own face in it. So the Saviour
                  patiently and lovingly watches and
                  
                     
                     29 Mal. iii. 3.
                  
                   works
                  upon his children, when he puts them into the crucible, till he can see his own
                  image in them.
               Well, said John, as long as the dross rises, he cannot do that, except at
                  intervals; and I'm thinking that, as long as we live, the dross will keep rising.
                  Who can even say, in this world, that he is perfectly free from sin? And if the
                  crucible were taken off from the fire before the dross is all taken away, and it
                  were so left, what then?
               Why, said Peter, that is the very point I was coming to. You see that there is
                  many a piece of gold in a goldsmith's shop, that a strange man coming in, or one
                  who knows little about gold, might think was very pure. But what does the
                  goldsmith do? Why, he just takes that same piece of gold, that shines so
                  beautifully, and puts it into his crucible, and kindles the fire, and then, as
                  soon as it is melted down, he bids the stranger look, and then, to be sure, it is
                  all covered with dross, and it is not till that dross is all taken away that the
                  gold is pure, though it might shine very brightly, and answer many purposes, even
                  with the dross mingled up in it. But this shows why and how it is that while the
                  processes of refinement and purification are going on with God's dear children,
                  their sinfulness appears to themselves clearer than ever, and they sometimes think
                  they are more sinful, while the Lord is making them more holy. It is because the
                  Lord Jesus, the Great Refiner, brings out the dross that was before concealed.
               Then, said John, how much do we need to pray with David, Cleanse thou me from
                  secret faults.30
                   Search me, and know my heart, try me, and know my ways, and see if there
                  be any wicked way in me.31
                   It is pretty plain that there may be many wicked ways in a man, that have
                  never yet shown themselves out of him.
               
                  
                  30 Psa. xix. 12.
               
               
                  
                  31 Psa. cxxxix. 23, 24.
               
               Oh yes, said Peter, and what a mercy to have them brought out, disclosed, brought
                  up to the surface as dross, and taken away; otherwise the whole lump might have to
                  be thrown away as good for nothing. It is a great thing to be good to be tried,
                  good for something. Where there is gold, there may be dross; but if there is gold,
                  then the Lord Jesus will have the dross away. It is a great deal worse mixed up in
                  the composition, and concealed, than when it is brought to the surface; though
                  while it is out of sight the gold seems gold, and when it is rising it seems
                  oftentimes nothing but dross. So a child of God has to cry out in the bitterness
                  of his soul, finding so many hidden evils disclosed, that he hardly dreamed of,
                  Oh, alas! I am all dross, all dross! when the Lord Jesus is making him really
                     better than he was before. Let not the
                  lump of gold upon the goldsmith's counter, boast itself above that which is
                  groaning in the crucible.
               In such sweet conversation the time passed rapidly away, and meanwhile no language
                  can tell how soft and beautiful continued to be the weather and the prospect. The
                  sea was serene and quiet, the air balmy, and the breeze delightful. It was so
                  lovely, that for whole days, and almost weeks, they hardly changed a sail, and
                  things went on so easily and regularly, that it seemed hardly worth while to be at
                  the trouble of a daily observation. And yet it was just precisely here that a
                  mistake was made in their reckoning, which, had it not been for the Lord's great
                  mercy, would have led them to destruction in the midst of apparent peace and
                  safety. The uninterrupted calmness of the weather, the regular daily progress of
                  the ship, and the fine appearances in every direction, had made them forget about
                  the currents, and not taking account of those, their real progress was by no means
                  what it appeared to be by the log, and they had been carried aside from the point
                  where they thought they were upon the Chart.
               It was just precisely here that some sunken rocks were laid down in the Chart, and
                  they were now in that vicinity without knowing it. For the currents hereabouts
                  could not be put down with any accu- racy at a given point, because they were very
                  changeable, and it was so much the more necessary to have been upon the watch, and
                  to have used every means for detecting both their force and direction. A concealed
                  current is a thing that may be very powerful the wrong way, even when the wind,
                  waves, sails, helm, weather, and everything in the vessel's progress, may seem to
                  be right. There is no time at sea, when men can be safely off their watch, and no
                  time when they can safely neglect any necessary precaution. They know not what may
                  come of it. The sins that do so easily beset us,32
                   need a steadfast care and patience agninst them, for they may ensnare us
                   in a thousand unsuspected and dangerous ways.
               
                  
                  32 Heb. xii. 1
               
               Enjoyment and security had made the pilgrims almost feel as if there could be no
                  change in the weather, and yet it came. The sky was no more seen, although there
                  were neither clouds nor tempests. They had had a bright clear air and serene
                  heavens, up to this time for weeks; and a slight haze in the horizon, like the
                  smoke of the Indian summer on the land, was the first indication of change; but
                  soon a bank of mist rolled up and then unrolled and spread over the ocean, till
                  they were in the midst of a thick, damp fog, so like a blanket round about them, that nothing could be seen, not
                  even the water a fathom from the ship's side. Now as soon as this was the case,
                  the danger from the sunken reefs might be considered imminent, simply because, as
                  I said, they had not reckoned the strength nor discovered the direction of the
                  currents, and therefore were really to a great degree ignorant of their position.
                  The fog distressed them much, and though they had no idea of the neighborhood of
                  rocks, yet they kept as good a look-out as seemed possible. When the night fell,
                  the darkness was like Egypt, and Peter and John, as they went forward to the bows
                  of the ship, and gazed earnestly out into the gloom, felt an awe stealing over
                  their spirits, and a presentiment of evil, they hardly knew why. But they called
                  to mind the direction, Who is among you that feareth the Lord, and obeyeth the
                  voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? Let him trust
                  in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God.33
                   So they besought the Lord's guidance, and kept watching, and that night
                   sleep fled from them, and they continued in prayer.
               
                  
                  33 Isa. 1. 10.
               
               And well was it that they did; for about midnight suddenly a cry was made of
                  breakers, a loud startling cry; and hurrying on deck, there was, sure enough, the
                  angry dash of the waves over the rocks, and as the fog had lifted a little, the
                  foam could be seen cresting and creaming right ahead of the ship, and seeming
                  hardly the ship's length distant.
               Hard up the helm, shouted Peter. Let fly the main sheets! Then he rushed to the
                  helm himself, while John flew to the men's assistance, for their life depended on
                  the rapidity and correctness of their movements. Peter saw at a glance the
                  direction of the reef, and now the whole reality of the rocks in the Chart came to
                  his mind like a sudden revelation, and the anguish of the conviction that they had
                  stumbled into this danger by their own carelessness was exceeding great. Lord save
                  us! cried Peter; we perish!34
                  
               
               
                  
                  34 Matt. viii. 25.
               
               And here, if the vessel had been in the same condition as she was when they were
                  tossing off the coast of Self-Conceit, she must have gone upon the rocks in spite
                  of all their manÅ“uvring; but she minded her helm since Humility and Self-Distrust
                  had had the handling of her ballast, and escaped, though very narrowly, in the
                  midst of appalling peril. A little delay in the watch, a little later, a little
                  further, and she must have struck. The men trembled from head to foot, when they
                  saw the danger, and it was not till daylight came, and the fog lifted, showing
                  them that they had a clear sea before
                  them, that they found any relief.
               Then Peter and John went to work upon their reckoning, and they had to cry out,
                  Who can understand his errors?35
                   But pleasant it was to see the exceeding great earnestness with which they
                  now studied the King's Chart. With compasses in hand they were poring over it day
                  and night, and making their measurements, and with new anxiety and many tears they
                  sought to be taught of God, for they found that a sailor might speculate
                  excellently well, and yet, but for God's mercy, go to the bottom. The warning ran
                  in their minds continually, Let us, therefore, fear lest a promise being left us
                  of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short.36
                   They trembled for the danger of Self-delusion.

               CHAPTER V.
               CAPTAIN GLIB'S YACHT.
               NOW it came to pass, as they stood upon their way with a fine favorable wind,
                  after the fog had passed over, that they chanced to espy a sail bearing down upon
                  them, and thinking she might be of the King's service, forthwith trimmed their
                  course so as to meet and speak with her. But as they drew near, they found she
                  looked more like a pleasure yacht with streamers, than anything else, and they
                  could not make out her rig till they got close enough to speak without difficulty.
                  Her course lay athwart the bows of the ship, westward, while they were going South
                  East. The vessels lay to for one another, and as the sea was quiet, they could
                  easily converse without changing position.
               The vessel's name they found was False Confidence, and she had a rakish look that
                  truly did not belie her name, and her Captain's name was Glib, a man well known and highly honored in his native
                  land of Oppositions of Science falsely so called.1
                  
               
               
                  
                  1 1 Tim. vi. 20.
               
               The vessel herself was built in the Country of Liberal Christianity, and had been
                  constructed with a propeller in her stern called Philosophy, which, together with
                  the Engine, was put under the charge of one Deism. Nevertheless, they went by the
                  wind when it was favorable, and only took to the propeller when the wind did not
                  serve, or when they would go in the teeth of the wind. Sometimes the Captain put
                  Deism at the helm, but more generally left it in charge of the regular steersman,
                  one Mr. Man's-Wisdom.
               The Mate's name was Plausible, and he had under his control a number of men, some
                  of whom were mariners, and among them a notable crew named Surface, Shallow,
                  Second-hand, Explain-away, Pick-flaw, Fair-speech, Voluble, Anything, and Nothing.
                  There was on board in the steerage a library for their use, entitled Salvation
                  made Easy; or, Every Man his own Redeemer. In the hold they had many bales of
                  stuff, called Rudiments of the World,2
                   Profane and Vain Babblings,3
                   Accommodations, Perfectibilities, Refinements of Science, and Vain
                  Janglings. They had also a stuff both for cargo and ballast together, called the
                  Dignity of Human Nature.

                  3 Tim, vi. 20.
               
               The first salutation was made by Captain Glib, who stood upon the quarter deck and
                  cried, Well, friends, what cheer? How goes the world-with you?
               Then said Peter, Not at all; we go from the world, and it will not
                  take passage with us at any rate.
               CAPTAIN GLIB.â€”Then answered the Captain, The more's the pity for you, to leave so
                  pleasant a companion behind you.
               PETER.â€”But the Word of God, said Peter, admonishes us that the friendship of the
                  world is enmity with God,4
                   and we are not sorry to leave the world's vanities behind us for things
                   that are much better in store for us.
               
                  
                  4 James iv. 4.
               
               CAPTAIN GLIB.â€”Well, you may take your course, and we'll take ours. We
                  are bound now to Cape Transcendental, to carry our wares, and get the latest
                  notions.
               PETER.â€”Then said Peter, The Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after
                     wisdom;5
                   but it is only Christ and him crucified that can ever be the power of God
                  and the wisdom of God for salvation.6
                  
               
               
                  
                  5 1 Cor. i. 22.
               
               
                  
                  6 1 Cor. i. 24.
               
               CAPTAIN GLIB.â€”Then Captain Glib answered with a sneer, that he did not believe
                  salvation hung upon any dogma, and, moreover, said he, I thank God the world is no
                  longer in leading strings to a squad of
                  Calvinistic Theologians. One man has his way, and another man
                     his; in the end all will come out right. God is good.
               PETER.â€”Well, said Peter, I am glad you thank God for anything. But I can tell you
                  there is only one way of salvation, only one name, only one Saviour.7
                   And if any man be not in that way, his is the wrong way, whatever name he
                   bears. And the wrong way leads to death.
               
                  
                  7 Acts iv. 12.
               
               CAPTAIN GLIB.â€”How do you know that? You speak as if you knew all about these
                  things to a dead certainty, and as if all other opinions were but smoke and
                  nonsense.
               PETER.â€”And so they are, all that goes against the word of God; for we get our
                  knowledge from him, and we speak that we do know, and testify that we have
                     seen.8
                   Certainly God would not leave us in doubt which was the way to Hell, and
                   which the path to Heaven.
               
                  
                  8 John iii. 11.
               
               CAPTAIN GLIB.â€”Oh, we don't want any of your fire and brimstone preaching. Men can
                  be drawn by love much more easily. And as to the hell you speak of, why, every man
                  may have his share of that in this world, and be purified by it.
               PETER.â€”But the hell of sinners is to come, and if you die in your sins, you shall
                  have your part in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone, in the second
                     death,9
                   where the Lord Jesus has said that their worm dieth not, and the fire
                  shall never be quenched.10
                   Furthermore, they who know not God, and obey not the gospel of our Lord
                  Jesus Christ, shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of
                  the Lord and the glory of his power, when he shall come in flaming fire with all
                  his holy angels, taking vengeance on the wicked who once neglected and despised
                     him.11
                  
               
               
                  
                  9 Rev. xxi. 8.

                  11 2 Thess. i. 9.
               
               At these words Captain Glib seemed as if he would choke, and he turned and said
                  something to the Man Deism, who stood beside him, whereupon the same person took
                  up the word, and said,â€”
               DEISM.â€”Men have got light enough to sail by, if they will use it.
               PETER.â€”Oh yes, answered Peter, plenty enough; but if the light that is in you be
                  darkness, how great is that darkness?12
                   There are many men whose understanding is darkened, being alienated from
                  the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of
                  their hearts,13
                   and such men go blindfold to perdition. You may think you are safe enough
                  when you are next door to ruin.
               
                  
                  12 Matt. vi. 23.
               
               
                  
                  13 Eph. iv. 18.
               
               DEISM.â€”But where is your boasted ruin? Since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as
                  they were from the beginning of the Creation,14
                   save only that the world is growing better and more scientific. And have
                  not we ourselves come safely all the way thus far across the ocean? To-morrow
                  shall be as this day, and much more abundant.15

                  15 Isa. lvi. 12.
               
               PETER.â€”But you are willingly ignorant that the heavens and the earth are reserved
                  unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.16
                   Moreover, these present seas are dangerous, and fatal for any not under
                   the King's flag, and bound to the Celestial Country.
               
                  
                  16 2 Pet. iii. 7.
               
               DEISM.â€”Who talks about the Celestial Country, as if Heaven were a place? We shall
                  have heaven on earth when society is reconstructed.
               PETER.â€”Bnt did you not know that there are sunken rocks and very hazardous reefs
                  hereabouts?
               DEISM.â€”Oh, no fear of that; we dont draw water enough for any harm from that.
                  Besides, we have an infallible, elastic life-boat, in case of any difficulty, made
                  by one Save-all and Company, that can never sink, but will hold as many people as
                  can crowd into it, which ensures us against any possibility of damage
                  personally.
               PETER.â€”Then said Peter, Your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your
                  agreement with hell shall not stand.17
                   Your miserable pretended life-boats will do you no good, but can only sink
                  you deeper in perdition, unless you take refuge in Him who only is the
                  Resurrection and the Life.18
                  
               
               
                  
                  17 Isa. xxviii. 18.
               
               
                  
                  18 John xi. 25.
               
               DEISM.â€”Ho! Ho! You talk of that old story of the Resurrection and the Judgment,
                  just as if all men were not judged in this life, and raised as fast as they die.
                  We can tell you a thing or two about these mysteries.
               Then said John to Peter, One might think that two persons, at least, had really
                  made a resurrection already, and were here before us, namely, Hymeneus and
                     Philetus,19
                   or those other two, whom Paul long ago delivered unto Satan, that they
                  might learn not to blaspheme.20
                   Let us not talk with them any longer; it is casting pearls before
                     swine.21

                  21 Matt. vii. 6.
               
               Then answered Peter, These men do indeed seem given over to strong delusion to
                  believe a lie.22
                  But just ask him if he has the King's Chart aboard ship.
               
                  
                  22 2 Thess. ii. 11.
               
               Then said John to the man, What do you sail by? Have you got the King's Chart in
                  your cabin?
               DEISM.â€”To be sure we have it, and an Amended and Do-away Version of it. But do you
                  think that was meant to tie us down to one and the same line of passage in all generations? Do you think there
                  has been no progress in navigation and the knowledge of the seas, all this time of
                  the ages? Why, you don't suppose we are such bigoted, superstitious fools, as to
                  go for navigation in this nineteenth century by the letter of a record made near
                  two thousand years ago! No, no! We belong to the School of Progress. Do you think
                  Science is going to advance at such a rate, and Religion stand still? Or that
                  Christians are for ever to be like a wheel in a treadmill, always turning over the
                  same route, grinding the same bark? I tell you we are tired of that, and the world
                  is growing older.
               Then said John, All flesh is grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of
                  grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away; but the Word of
                  the Lord endureth for ever.23
                   And now stand still, and hear the judgment of God concerning you. For as
                  natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, you speak evil of the things
                  that you understand not, and shall utterly perish in your own corruption.24
                   For thus saith the Lord, Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and
                  maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the Lord.25
                   And, again, Wo unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in
                  their own sight. Therefore, As the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame
                  consumeth the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall
                  go up as dust; because they have cast away the law of the Lord of Hosts, and
                  despised the Word of the Holy One of Israel.26
                  
               
               
                  
                  23 1 Pet. i. 24, 25.
               
               
                  
                  24 2 Pet. 2. 12.
               
               
                  
                  25 Jer. xvii. 5.
               
               
                  
                  26 Isa. v. 21, 24.
               
               At this speech the whole crew and company of the vessel seemed greatly abashed,
                  and Mr. Deism's tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth. But Captain Glib willing to
                  restore confidence, stepped up to the bulwarks, and said in a bold tone, Thank
                  God, we are not to be judged by man's judgment.
               Then answered John, No, by no means; if you were, it might fare better with you.
                  But the Lord hath said, He that rejecteth me and my words hath one that judgeth
                  him; the Word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.27
                   And, again, He that despised Moses' law died without mercy, under two or
                  three witnesses. Of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall be thought worthy,
                  who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the
                  covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto
                  the Spirit of Grace?28
                   And this for you, Mr. Deism, Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousand of
                  his saints, to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly
                  among them of all their ungodly deeds
                  which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly
                  sinners have spoken against him.29
                  
               
               
                  
                  27 John xii. 48.
               
               
                  
                  28 Heb. x. 28, 29.
               
               
                  
                  29 Jude 14, 15.
               
               Now Captain Glib seemed as though he would fain make answer to this also; but
                  Peter gave orders to square the yards, and put the helm to the wind, and there
                  being a stiff breeze just then, the ship shot forward like an Arab courser, and
                  was speedily beyond hailing distance. But looking back, they could see by the foam
                  in the stern of the False Confidence, that she was plying her propeller with all
                  earnestness, as if determined on making headway against the wind that was now
                  blowing fresh from the Celestial Country.
               Alas, alas, said Peter, it brings tears to mine eyes to see how these obstinate
                  foolish men are bent upon their own destruction. For I know that evil men and
                  seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.30
                   And they seem verily like those of whom it is said, that even as they did
                  not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate
                     mind.31

                  31 Rom. i. 28.
               
               Then said John, Was it not rather rough in us to dismiss them in this manner?
               But Peter answered, These are of those who, having the form of godliness, are
                  denying the power thereof, those who, as James and Jannes withstood Moses, do
                  likewise resist the truth, and from such we are commanded to turn away, for they
                  are men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.32
                  
               
               
                  
                  32 Tim. iii. 8.
               
               But said John, Might we not have done more to persuade them of the folly and
                  madness of their career?
               PETER.â€”And what could we have done more or better than present the Word to them?
                  Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? There is more hope of a fool than of
                     him.33
                   And, again, Though thou bray a fool in a mortar with a pestle, yet will
                  not his foolishness depart from him.34
                   And if they receive not the Word, what common ground have we to stand
                  upon, or how can we argue with such? For if they receive not the record that God
                  hath given of his Son, they make him a liar.35

               JOHN.â€”But methinks we might have invited them on board, to break bread with us,
                  and see some of the King's instruments and curiosities.
               PETER.â€”And if we had, they would only have departed better satisfied with
                  themselves, and falsely persuaded of some saving agreement between us. Alas! They
                  are ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.36
                   And if we sin wilfully after
                  having received the knowledge of the truth, you know there is no more sacrifice
                  for sins but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation,
                  which shall devour the adversaries.37

               JOHN.â€”Well, but I cannot help groaning in myself to think how little impression we
                  have made upon them. Might we not have sailed with them a little way, to persuade
                  them of our good will, and mayhap run a better chance to win them?
               PETER.â€”And what effect could that have had, but to confirm them in their error?
                  No, my brother, we have done right. Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but the
                  kisses of an enemy are deceitful.38
                   And, besides all this, do you not remember what is said, Whosoever
                  transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that
                  abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. If there
                  come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house
                  neither bid him God speed. For he that biddeth him God speed, is partaker of his
                  evil deeds.39

               JOHN.â€”But is it not passing strange that with the Word of God before them they can
                  be so blind?
               PETER.â€”Why, there's none so blind as those that wont see. They prefer the
                  darkness, and, besides, they trust in their own wisdom, and walk by the light of
                  their own sparks, which they are as proud of as if it were a fire for the
                  universe. But God says they shall lie down in sorrow.40

               JOHN.â€”Well, we say of a drunken man that he gets high; so these people get high on
                  the fumes of their own vanity; and with high-minded people, their pride is always
                  a kind of drunkenness.
               PETER.â€”Moreover, have you never observed what is said against handling the Word of
                  God deceitfully?41
                   These people are great hands at that kind of work. You heard their talk of
                  the Amended Version of the King's Chart, but you could hardly tell which was North
                  and which South upon it. And as to those base fellows, Explain-away and Pick-flaw,
                  they are two notable wretches as ever lived. If we had had them aboard with us,
                  and tarried in the Cabin only long enough to take bread, they would have left
                  their marks. Ten to one you would have found holes in our charts, and blank
                  spaces, where there are important signs, and you would have found marks and
                  directions rubbed out, that now to us are as plain as day. They are as bad as
                  rats.
               
                  
                  41 2 Cor. iv. 2.
               
               JOHN.â€”You make me think of the saying of a wise man, that infidels show the nature
                  of their investigations on the King's
                  Chart just as snails mark their path over a wall, by the tracks of slime left
                  behind, and the lines of film drawn across it in their progress.
               PETER.â€”'Tis worse than that, and sometimes it is hard to detect their progress,
                  and undo the mischief. If you could always see it plain, it would be much less
                  dangerous. They have various ways of casting off God's Word, and hiding from it.
                  Do you remember the beautiful last verse in the 17th Psalm? "As for me, I will
                  behold thy face in righteousness. I shall be satisfied, when I awake, in thy
                  likeness." How sweetly David speaks of the time when he shall see God in glory!
                  Well, what should you think of a man telling you that that meant merely getting up
                  early for morning prayers?
               JOHN.â€”Why, I think that would be about as wise, as if I should read aloud the
                  chapter where it says, My voice thou shalt hear in the morning,42
                   and you should tell the crew that that meant, that in the morning aboard
                   ship there would be eight bells.
               
                  
                  42 Psa. v. 3.
               
               PETER.â€”And yet these villains Explain-away, Pick-flaw, and others like them, are
                  the most credulous of all fools that the sun ever shone upon, in the matter of
                  their own speculations, their own wisdom. They will believe that men grew out of
                  monkeys. Indeed, they have the credulity of sharks, that will take down a man's
                  hat, believing it to be his head, or a box of old nails for a junk of salt pork,
                  and yet, the simplest things in God's Word stumble them. They stumble at the Word,
                  being disobedient.43
                   A man once said of them that they will swallow a whale any time to avoid
                   believing that a whale swallowed Jonah.
               
                  
                  43 1 Pet. ii. 8.
               
               JOHN.â€”But I have heard of others, who take another tack. Some there be, who are
                  for casting off the letter of the Word, and relying, as they pretend, wholly upon
                  the Spirit. These may be as bad, in their way, and more deceitful, than your
                  Pick-flaws and Explain-aways. And I have heard a very experienced and holy old
                  Captain say of them that if any pretend that they have the Spirit, and so turn
                  away from the strait rule of the Holy Scriptures, they have a spirit indeed, but
                  it is a fanatical spirit, a spirit of delusion and giddiness; but the Spirit of
                  God, that leads his children in the way of truth, and is for that purpose sent
                  them from heaven to guide them thither, squares their thoughts and ways to that
                  rule whereof it is the Author, and that Word which was inspired by it, and
                  sanctified them to obedience. Can there be anything better than that?
               PETER.â€”Better! Why, that is the very source of life and knowledge, the Spirit with the Word.
                  Sanctify them by thy truth; thy Word is truth.44
                   An old navigator used to say, Thy words were found, and I did eat them,
                  and they were to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart.45
                   That is your right stock of provision for a long voyage; it never gets out
                  of order, but is always fresh, pure, and refreshing.

                  45 Jer. xv. 16.
               
               JOHN.â€”Well, you make me think of Ezekiel's description of the Tree of Life; the
                  fruit thereof was for food, and the leaves thereof were for medicine.46
                   That is God's Word, both food and medicine. The medicine is to search out
                  and purge away our sins; the food is to nourish and strengthen us in Christ Jesus,
                  and make us grow in grace.
               
                  
                  46 Ezek. xlvii. 12.
               
               PETER.â€”Yes! And all by the Spirit. The Spirit takes of the things that are
                  Christ's, the things of his Word, and shows them to the soul.47
                   When the Spirit and the Word go together, then there is safety. We must
                  study the Word by the Spirit, praying for the Spirit, relying upon the Spirit, for
                  it is he who will thus guide us into all truth, and where the Spirit dwells, there
                  the Word dwells. And so another old navigator says, Thy Word have I hid in mine
                  heart, that I might not sin against thee.48
                   He does not say that he had it merely painted astern, or on the figure-
                  head, or on the sides of the ship, or wrought into the flag, but hid away with the
                  Spirit in the heart. There in the heart, is where all sin comes from, and so he
                  says, Hid in my heart, that I might not sin against thee. With some men the Word
                  is all paint, but with good Christians it is inside work, work in the heart; life
                  and not paint merely.
               
                  
                  47 John xvi. 13.
               
               
                  
                  48 Psa. cxix. 11.
               
               JOHN.â€”That is just what I would say. And now let us evermore remember, that there
                  is no safety but in heartfelt reverence of the Word, and reliance upon it. What
                  could we do, if we laid aside the King's Chart, and trusted to the compass only?
                  Or if we had the Chart only, without the compass, what could we do? But the
                  compass shows us where we are upon the Chart, and the Chart shows us whither we
                  are moving by the compass. Then we take our heavenly observations, having the
                  Earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.49
                   But if we cut loose from these dependencies then we go astray, then we
                  would be sure to make shipwreck of our souls. Did you ever play at flying of
                  kites, when you were a boy?
               
                  
                  49 2 Cor. i. 22.
               
               PETER.â€”What man, that ever was a boy, did not? Why, you bring to mind in that word
                  all the sports of childhood. My boy's kite! How I used to start it on the green,
                  and then, when the wind was high, and the kite had gone almost out of sight into
                     the blue firmament, we would send
                  messengers fluttering along the string after it!
               JOHN.â€”Well, did you ever think of its being the confinement by the string, which
                  along with the wind was the only thing that kept your kite soaring, for the moment
                  you let it loose, down it would come, fluttering, waving, tumbling. You had to
                  hold it in, or it would have been ruined. Just so it is with our minds, if they be
                  cut loose from God's Word. It is the Spirit that makes them soar, if they truly
                  rise at all; but only while they keep fast to God's Word. If they cut loose from
                  that, then they go into all imaginable foolish, wicked, and unbelieving fancies,
                  and then go tumbling into utter ruin. I can tell you a fine parable between the
                  kite and our hearts, with their dependence on God. It was written by an old Sea
                  Captain, who is now praising God in heaven; but he was himself as a brand plucked
                  from the burning. Hear his lines. 'Tis not a long yarn, but a right good and wise
                  one, and well spun. 'Tis entitled,â€”
               
                  THE KITE;
                  OR, PRIDE MUST HAVE A FALL.
                  
                     Once on a time a paper kite
                     Was mounted to a wondrous height,
                     Where, giddy with its elevation,
                     It thus expressed self-admiration;â€”
                     "See, how yon crowds of gazing people
                     Admire my flight above the steeple!
                     How would they wonder, if they knew
                     All that a kite like me can do!
                  
                  
                     "Were I but free, I'd take a flight,
                     And pierce the clouds beyond their sight.
                     But ah! like a poor prisoner bound,
                     My string confines me near the ground,
                     I'd brave the eagle's towering wing,
                     Might I but fly without a string."
                  
                  
                     It tugged and pulled, while thus it spoke,
                     To break the string;â€”at last it broke.
                     Deprived at once of all its stay,
                     In vain it tried to soar away,
                     Unable its own weight to bear,
                     It fluttered downward through the air;
                     Unable its own course to guide,
                     The winds soon plunged it in the tide.
                     Ah foolish kite! thou hadst no wing,
                     How couldst thou fly without a string?
                  
                  
                     My heart replied, O Lord I see
                     How much this kite resembles me!
                     Forgetful that by thee I stand,
                     Impatient of thy ruling hand,
                     How oft I've wished to break the lines
                     Thy wisdom for my lot assigns!
                     How oft indulged a vain desire,
                     For something more, or something higher!
                     And, but for grace and love divine,
                     A fall thus dreadful had been mine.
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VI.
               FISHING FOR PEARLS, AND CATCHING ICEBERGS.
               THE change from the South Pole to the North is hardly greater than that which
                  befel our navigators, soon after all this gracious experience. It seemed almost
                  impossible that such a change could come. The mercy of the Lord was now so great,
                  and they enjoyed so much in Christian communion, conversing by the way, their
                  hearts burning within them in love to the Redeemer, with bright anticipations of
                  the Celestial City, that sometimes, unless their senses deceived them, they
                  thought they could verily see, far, far away over the ocean, at the point where
                  the horizon was lost in heaven, the gates shining, and the domes and spires
                  rising. Often and long did they gaze towards the appearance, which sometimes they
                  caught at noon, and sometimes in the evening just at sunset; and sometimes a sound
                  as of very distant heavenly melodies would come floating over the waves,
                  entrancing all their sensibilities. On such occasions it seemed to them as if they
                  were not far from the end of their voyage, and had no more perils or difficulties
                  to encounter. But as before the lovely weather had thrown them off their watch, so
                  now these fair-enchanting scenes, and continued prosperous breezes, lulled them in
                  security.
               A sense of security is always a dangerous and false thing at sea, and the more
                  secure men feel, the less secure they are. An uninterrupted continuance of
                  blessings sometimes provokes an imagination of permanent safety, which is almost
                  as bad as the insensibility produced by prayerlessness and carelessness. Indeed,
                  it may make the soul so dependent upon God's blessing, instead of God himself, and
                  withal so neglectful of prayer, by little and little, as to give the Adversary of
                  the Soul, a great advantage in laying snares, or in sudden assaults, or in gradual
                  and unsuspected temptations. By reason of these things, instead of being able to
                  follow our navigators still on their onward progress serenely over the deep, we
                  have to trace them, after no long interval, struggling among icebergs.
               The ship went into that peril, partly from neglect of her directions. She was to
                  have kept her course, according to the Chart and required navigation, Southward by
                  the Isles of Contrition, where a warm
                  trade-wind would have taken her on a steady pull for very many leagues, and
                  carried her entirely beyond that danger. But it is well known that Northward from
                  those Isles there are great fishing-grounds for pearls, where, in favorable
                  seasons, much wealth may be made, or cargoes gained, that can be disposed of to
                  great advantage elsewhere. The position of those banks is uncertain, and the
                  Pilgrims did not intend to make for them, and if they had had any such idea, they
                  could never have been aware how far off from their true course a visit thither
                  would take them.
               But one day it so happened that they hove in sight of a strange sail, whose course
                  seemed to be in that direction, though they tried all the signals in the King's
                  Book for telegraphing, but could not make her out, and her rig, so far as they
                  could tell by the glass, was not of the Celestial Country. However, as it would
                  cause but little delay, they concluded to trim the ship and put up the helm so as
                  to lay her athwart the strange sail, that they might speak with her. In a little
                  time they got near enough to hail. So they hailed, and the Captain answered that
                  she was a merchantman from the Country of GAIN-IS-GODLINESS, seeking goodly
                  pearls.
               Now if they had not been thrown off their watch, the very name of the vessel might
                  have bethought them of a warning laid down in the Chart; for it was there as plain
                  as day, and they afterwards found and remembered it. But before they took time to
                  examine their Chart, and overhaul their reckonings, they were in communication
                  with the stranger, and the Captain had invited them to come on board, and consult
                  about his adventure for the pearls.
               What do you think? said Peter to John. Shall we go?
               Why, my brother, answered John, you know best, aud are the most experienced; but I
                  would be very cautious in these seas.
               Well, said Peter, it is wise to know something of the ways of the world, and we
                  may have opportunities of being useful. Besides, we don't want to be discourteous;
                  and it can do no harm just to go and see the man's Cabin.
               But said John, The friendship of the world is enmity with God.1
                   Had we not better ask him to come with us, for we can talk as well and
                   better aboard our own ship, and more freely.
               
                  
                  1 James iv. 4.
               
               So they answered the Captain's invitation by inviting him in their turn, to come
                  with them, and they would show him many things. But he told them that he had a
                  supercargo on board, who could not speak their language, and needed continual looking after, and that just then they
                  were very busy taking account of stock, so that it was not a convenient season;
                  but if Peter and John would do him the honor to come on board and partake of a
                  plain dinner of tongues and sounds, he would be extremely happy of their
                  company.
               So, not to be obstinate, they concluded to accept the invitation, and ordered the
                  boat to be lowered. Just as they were stepping down into it, two of the crew,
                  named Watchful, and Mind-the-things-of-the-Spirit, together with the men
                  Contrition and Sincere, before spoken of, as having done such good service with
                  the pumps, made bold to press forward for a word with Peter; and indeed he would
                  have waited to hear whether they had anything to say, for all the communion with
                  the crew on board the King's ship was kind, confiding and affectionate in the
                  greatest degree; but they, perceiving that they were a little too late, and
                  fearing to be out of order, drew back. But there was much anxiety and whispering
                  about the matter, and they did not feel easy till Peter and John came on board
                  again, nor even then.
               Meantime, Captain Demetrius, for that was his name, received Peter and John with
                  great cordiality, and they found him a most agreeable, friendly, and well-spoken
                  man, and all things aboard ship looked in excellent good trim, and exceedingly
                  comfortable. As they examined the compass, however, they could not help observing
                  that it did not bear the King's mark, nevertheless, it looked like a fine
                  instrument. The Chart bore the King's name, but did not seem to have been handled
                  or studied at all; and indeed it was true that they had on board a smaller chart,
                  condensed and abridged from the firm of Expediency and Company, which for
                  convenience' sake, could be carried in the pocket, so that they rarely troubled
                  themselves to consult the other. The Barometer looked entirely new, and it had a
                  trick of stopping at fair weather, so that in any time of real danger it could be
                  of little practical use. Nevertheless, it was a bright and polished instrument,
                  and had the effect of putting all hands in a pleasant feeling of security, which
                  kept them quiet and half-happy for the present, and made them shut their eyes upon
                  the future.
               The Supercargo's name was Alexander; he had been a coppersmith in Asia,2
                   but had left his trade for the pearl-fishery, as being more lucrative. He
                  was not introduced to Peter and John, but the Captain opened a secret drawer, and
                  commanded the man to show some rare pearls there carefully hidden, any two of
                  which, he said, were worth enough to buy the whole vessel. Then Peter, seeing the
                  trembling eagerness of the man, as he handled the pearls,
                  
                     
                     2 2 Tim. iv. 14.
                  
                   remembered the passage, And covetousness, which is
                     idolatry,3
                   and John called to mind the expression, Sirs, ye know that how by this
                  craft we have our wealth.4
                   So they enquired of Captain Demetrius, if he could show them the pearl of
                  great price, or knew anything about it. Then he confessed that he had it not,
                  though he had heard of its value, and it was his intention, so soon as he had made
                  one or two voyages more, to find it; but he declared that for the present his
                  whole time had to be given to his employers, for the vessel was not his own, and
                  he was not at liberty to neglect her interests.
               
                  
                  3 Col. iii. 5.
               
               
                  
                  4 Acts xix. 25.
               
               Then they asked him if he could tell them what it would profit a man, if he gained
                  the whole world and lost his own soul, or what a man could give in exchange for
                  his soul?5
                   Then Captain Demetrius answered that that was all true, and that such a
                  great interest ought to be attended to, but at the same time that a man must live,
                  and support his family.
               
                  
                  5 Mark viii. 36, 37.
               
               But, said Peter, know you not that the gospel commands you to seek first the
                  kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto
                     you?6
                   Moreover, The love of money is the root of all evil.7
                  
               
               
                  
                  6 Matt. vi. 33.
               
               
                  
                  7 1 Tim. vi. 10.
               
               Aye, aye, answered the Captain; the love of money; but the money
                  itself is not evil, but may be very good, and used for very good purposes. Then he
                  pulled out of his pocket the chart aforesaid, and demonstrated by it that the
                  nearest fishing station was so close upon the course the King's ships were
                  running, that it would require hardly any perceptible change out of that course to
                  come to it; so that if they chose to do so, they could easily visit it, and see
                  what was doing there, and a few pearls, more or less, could not encumber them, and
                  might be of great advantage to them in strange ports.
               Now these words troubled Peter and John, and stayed by them even after the
                  conference was ended, and they had got back to their own ship. They did not mean
                  to neglect their voyage, nor go out of the way, but yet they had half a mind to
                  see the pearl fisheries, and the more they thought upon the matter, the stronger
                  this desire grew in their hearts, and they thought as this would probably be the
                  only opportunity they would ever have, it seemed a pity to neglect it. With this
                  feeling, they let the merchantman part company for the present, intending
                  themselves to keep much more directly on their own course than he was minded to
                  go. However, they knew not what they were doing, in altering their helm even a
                  single quarter of a point; so that they were in great danger.
               
               For, of the currents in those parts they were quite ignorant; and although the
                  children of this world, being wiser in their generation than the children of
                     light,8
                   could take advantage of those currents, and trim in such manner as to be
                  carried by them more directly to the fishing-banks, yet it required a wide berth,
                  and perfect freedom in consulting the main chance. Now the main chance of the
                  King's ship lay in keeping as strait as possible for the Celestial Country, and to
                  that they were resolved to adhere, nor would they ever have dared to turn
                  manifestly from it. But they did not give sufficient heed, nor did they remember
                  sufficiently the caution, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.9
                   They should have minded beforehand what they thought upon afterwards with
                  great bitterness, He that despiseth little things, by little and little shall he
                     fall.10
                   There was also one of the King's own proverbs in the gospel, which they
                  might have heeded, Behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth!11
                   For a very little deviation at first, grew greater shortly, till in a few
                  days they quite lost the trade breeze, and then, under the power of a gulf stream,
                  of which they never dreamed being in the neighborhood, they were carried unawares
                  rapidly northward.

                  11 James iii. 5.
               
               Moreover, they began to encounter fogs, and the air grew so cold, and begat in
                  them such a torpor of the system, that it was almost as bad upon the crew as if
                  they had had the scurvy. They could hardly summon energy enough to work the ship;
                  and yet, as the event proved, there never was need of greater activity. They knew
                  not where they were, for they could not get an observation, by reason of the thick
                  weather, and they had lost their reckoning again, by not knowing the currents, and
                  the barometer was falling, and they heard strange rumbling noises in the direction
                  towards which they were now hastening. In fact, the gloom had already settled down
                  in their hearts, and they began to be full of anxiety and black forebodings, when
                  in the night, about midnight, in thick darkness, a grating noise sounded under the
                  keel of the vessel, and repeated shocks were felt from the striking of loose huge
                  masses of ice, which, as soon as the dawn broke, were seen floating all around
                  them, as far as the eye could reach. They had never met with anything of the kind
                  before, and the prospect was gloomy and terrible. The sense of desolation in the
                  souls of the whole ship's company was almost the experience of despair; the hope,
                  and almost the very thought of the Celestial Country died away.
               But distress would neither clear up the weather, nor melt the ice, though it was a
                  great mercy that they 1 now were
                  thoroughly awakened to a sense of the great evil they had brought upon themselves.
                  But it soon came on to snow, and day and night the flakes filled the air, silent
                  and solemn, for there was little or no wind, and the storm fell heavy, gloomy, and
                  damp, and while that continued, they could no longer see the ship's length before
                  them, though even if they could have seen clearly, they could have done nothing,
                  nor prevented the evil. They were getting deeper and deeper embayed in blocks and
                  bergs of ice, to the great hazard of the ship, especially if the wind should rise,
                  and a gale take them. Now they would have given the whole pearl fisheries, if they
                  had had them to give, for a clear open area, back to the point where they hailed
                  the merchantman; but no open sea was any longer visible.
               And now the weather began to be so intensely cold, that the fire in the cabin
                  hardly seemed to warm the air in the least. They thought they must have perished,
                  and the only way of preservation was by constant activity and watchfulness, for as
                  soon as the system yielded to the desire of sleep, it was almost certain death, if
                  they were in an exposed condition. O now they thought, if they could once get back
                  to the warm steady breezes, and the clear sunny air, that had been so sweet to
                  them, nothing should ever again tempt them out of the way. But still the cold
                  continued, and at length it seemed to them that the ship was quite immovable, and
                  the whole region around them seemed to have become one solid continent of ice. If
                  left thus, they must perish.
               And now they felt that God only could help them, and they were reduced to such a
                  state, that help must come soon, or they never could be recovered. They had
                  renewed seasons for fasting and prayer, and in the course of these exercises they
                  sang; but it was a strange thing to hear the melancholy melody amidst that frozen
                  sea, for indeed it was a melancholy strain, though not utterly hopeless. 
                     
                        Where is the blessedness I knew
                        When first I saw the Lord?
                        Where is the soul-refreshing view
                        Of Jesus, and his Word.
                     
                     
                        What peaceful hours I once enjoyed!
                        How sweet their memory still!
                        But they have left an aching void,
                        The world can never fill.
                     
                     
                        Return, O Holy Dove, return!
                        Sweet messenger of rest!
                        I hate the sins that made thee mourn,
                        And drove thee from my breast.
                     
                  
               
               They still endeavored to trust in the Lord, and encouraged themselves by
                  remembering his Word of Mercy; Only return unto me, saith the Lord.12

                   They thought of that passage, O
                  Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself, but in me is thy help.13
                   They turned over the records, made diligent search, and considered the
                  days of old,14
                   to see if any had ever fallen into such a condition and been released.
                  They communed with their own heart, and cried out, Will the Lord cast off for
                  ever? and will he be favorable no more? Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his
                  promise fail for evermore? Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger
                  shut up his tender mercies?15
                  
               
               
                  
                  13 Hos. xiii. 9.
               
               
                  
                  14 Psa. lxxvii. 5.
               
               
                  
                  15 Psa. lxxvii. 7-10.
               
               Then they found also the place where it says, If any man sin, we have an Advocate
                  with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.16
                   If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins,
                  and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.17
                  
               
               
                  
                  16 1 John ii. 1.
               
               
                  
                  17 1 John i. ix.
               
               And looking again, they found the log-book of one, who said, He hath set me in
                  dark places, as they that be dead of old. He hath hedged me about, that I cannot
                  get out; he hath made my chain heavy. Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out
                  my prayer. He hath enclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths
                  crooked. And I said, my strength and my hope is perished from the Lord.18
                  
               
               
                  
                  18 Lam. iii. 6, 7, 8, 9; 18.
               
               O my brother, cried Peter, and the tears filled his eyes, so that he could read no
                  further, Was not this poor man's case at least as desperate as ours? And yet he
                  lived to record these things for others. Let us not despair.
               No! answered John, for whereas this coldness and gloom are dreadful indeed, yet
                  there is nothing too hard for God; but unbelief and despair are destruction. If
                  you read a little further, you will find him, saying, The Lord will not cast off
                  for ever, but though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the
                  multitude of his mercies.19
                  
               
               
                  
                  19 Lam. iii. 31, 32.
               
               Then Peter wiped the tears from his eyes, and read on. It is of the Lord's mercies
                  that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. They are new every
                  morning; great is thy faithfulness. The Lord is my portion, saith my soul,
                  therefore, will I hope in him. The Lord is good unto them that wait for him, to
                  the soul that seeketh him.20
                  
               
               
                  
                  20 Lam. iii. 22-25.
               
               Then they set themselves anew to seeking God, and continued long time in prayer
                  and supplication with great earnestness; and it came to pass that even while they
                  were praying, the air began to lighten, and the sun shone out with a power such as
                  they had not experienced for many days. So they called a council of all on board,
                  to see what farther could be done, and in that consultation, Contrition and
                     Sincere, together with one of the
                  hands called Patience, proposed that they should take some of the small ballast
                  which was put on board in the harbor of Good Hope, and strew it along in lines
                  upon the ice around and before the ship, so that the heat of the sun might more
                  readily melt the ice, in places where they could saw it, or break it up. This they
                  did, although it was evident that no human power could release them from their
                  imprisonment.
               And now the ship's company spent another day in fasting and supplication, and it
                  being Saturday, Peter and John remained that whole night in prayer, for they knew
                  not which way to turn, if God did not have mercy upon them. They called to mind
                  all the promises they could think of, and at length committed themselves
                  submissively to God, to do with them whatever seemed good in his sight. They also
                  fired signal guns of distress at intervals, though what they expected to gain by
                  that, it was hard to see.
               Well, in the course of Sunday, as they were still praying and confessing their
                  sins, and bemoaning themselves before God, Peter, listening, thought he heard a
                  bell, though he thought also at the same time that he could not have heard it, but
                  that it must be a mere fancy. But at length it was quite certain that they did
                  hear it, and sure enough, soon after, by a crashing movement of some huge masses
                  of ice in the direction whence the sound came, they saw clearly, without doubt, a
                  strong steamer making her way towards them.
               The Captain of the Steamer, which was a Relief Ship commissioned by the King, wore
                  the King's uniform; aud the sympathy, kindness, and activity, with which he
                  labored to get them out of this perilous condition, showed him to be one of the
                  King's true servants. But no time was to be lost, and with all their energy on
                  both sides, it was exceedingly difficult to cut the ship loose and get her afloat
                  in the passage which the Steamer had broken for her. When that was done, a strong
                  cable was conveyed from one vessel to the other, and so, by great care and effort,
                  they once more gained the open sea, and began to put some distance between
                  themselves and the masses of ice they had encountered.
               As soon as this was done, the Captain of the Steamer ordered his boat to be
                  lowered, and came on board the King's ship, to see Peter and John; and the first
                  thing he did was to look for the King's Chart. So they had him down in the Cabin,
                  and there spread it out before him. Then he asked them what was the point where
                  they started from, and how they came so far out of the way, and with great sorrow
                  and humility they told him all, and gave him the name of the merchantman by whom
                  they had been persuaded. Then said he,
                  You have been on the verge of great sin and peril, but the Lord has had mercy upon
                  you. And now hearken unto me, and to the Word which bids you beware of the
                  perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing
                  that gain is godliness; from such withdraw thyself.21
                  
               
               
                  
                  21 1 Tim. vi. 5.
               
               Then as he spake these words, they seemed to see, as their eyes followed his
                  finger on the Chart, the whole warning which they had neglected, come out in
                  letters of fire, while he read on. But godliness with contentment is great gain.
                  For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing
                  out. And having food and raiment, let us be therewith content. But they that will
                  be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts,
                  which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of
                  all evil; which, while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and
                  pierced themselves through with many sorrows.22
                  
               
               
                  
                  22 1 Tim. vi. 6-11.
               
               Now at these words Peter and John remembered their own conversation with the
                  Captain of the merchantman, and called to mind how they had applied part of this
                  very warning to him, but had neglected to apply it also to
                  themselves; and they stood before the King's Messenger overwhelmed with shame and
                  contrition. But he looked lovingly upon them, and continued,â€”
               But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness,
                  godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness. Fight the good fight of faith, lay
                  hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good
                  profession before many witnesses.23
                  
               
               
                  
                  23 1 Tim. vi. 11, 12.
               
               Then Peter and John thanked him for his great kindness and love, and moreover,
                  they could not help throwing themselves on their knees, in the presence of all,
                  and giving thanks to God for his goodness, that he could have such compassion upon
                  them; and they besought with tears that they might have grace to be kept evermore
                  from such sin and wandering. Then the Master of the King's Steamer did most
                  lovingly embrace them, and bade them farewell. And as he went, he told them to
                  beware of pride, and to be clothed with humility, for that God resisteth the
                  proud, and giveth grace to the humble.24
                   Also he said, Let your conversation be without covetousness, and be
                  content with such things as ye have, for He hath said, I will never leave thee,
                  nor forsake thee.25
                  
               
               
                  
                  24 1 Pet. v. 5.
               
               
                  
                  25 Heb. xiii. 5.
               
               And now, as soon as the Relief Ship had passed out of sight, they began to see and to feel more
                  clearly and vividly what a mercy it was that the relief had come as it did; for
                  that very night after their deliverance, a tremendous storm arose, which set the
                  frozen space in such commotion, that they must have been dashed in pieces had they
                  been then among the icebergs. They knew that, well, and they called to mind with
                  thankfulness that the gale which was now driving them back to the right course,
                  must have sunk them in the bottom of the sea, had it come upon them in their cold
                  and terrible imprisonment. They thought of David's prayer, Bring my soul out of
                  prison, that I may praise thy name.26
                   The storm increased till it was almost a hurricane, but still it was fair
                  weather to them, in comparison with the terror of such gloom as they had
                  encountered. For now the light of God's forgiving mercy was shining, and they were
                  ready to exclaim, 
                     
                        The tempests that rise,
                        Shall gloriously hurry our souls to the skies!
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  26 Psa. cxlii. 7.
               
               But indeed they were in great peril, and were driven under bare poles through such
                  a raging sea, that sometimes it seemed as if the ship was going under the waves
                  bodily, never again to rise. At length there seemed a slight lull in the tempest,
                  and the ship was so far steady, that they ventured to gather for prayer, and not
                  only so, but sent up a song amidst the roaring of the elements, for they had a
                  heart to sing as well as to pray, and they thanked God even for a hurricane, if it
                  would snatch them from tempation. 
                     
                        The billows swell, the winds are high,
                        Clouds overcast my wintry sky;
                        Out of the depths to thee I call,
                        My fears are great, my strength is small.
                     
                     
                        O Lord, the Pilot's part perform,
                        And guide and guard me through the storm;
                        Defend me from each threatening ill,
                        Control the waves, say, Peace, be still!
                     
                     
                        Amidst the roaring of the sea
                        My soul still hangs her hopes on thee;
                        Thy constant love, thy faithful care,
                        Is all that saves me from despair.
                     
                     
                        Dangers of every shape and name
                        Attend the followers of the Lamb,
                        Who leave the world's deceitful shore,
                        And leave it to return no more.
                     
                     
                        Though tempest-tossed, and half a wreck,
                        My Saviour through the floods I seek;
                        Let neither winds nor stormy main
                        Force back my shattered bark again.
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VII.
               POMEGRANATE HARBOR, AND THE HALL OF REVELATIONS.
               NOW as they pursued their course, humble and penitent, and rejoicing in the Divine
                  goodness, they beheld, one fine day, an Island rising before them, which they
                  found, on examining the Chart, to be the Island of the Communion of Saints. They
                  were exceedingly glad at this, for there was a noble harbor in that Island, where
                  they were to stop for a season, and receive fresh water and provisions; and here
                  also they could feel secure, being in one of the King's own ports. It was a sweet
                  day as they entered the Harbor, and behold, the flags of very many nations were
                  flying, with the King's flag high above them all, a sight which it did the heart
                  good to look upon. The Harbor they found was large enough to hold all the fleets
                  of the whole world, and never had they beheld so magnificent and goodly a scene.
                  Moreover, it was surrounded by mountains, green and wooded to the very tops,
                  sheltering it from every wind that could blow, so that there was nothing to be
                  compared with it for safety and beauty.
               Here the crews of the ships that visited the place were regaled, as long as they
                  stayed, with choice grapes from the King's own vineyards, and apples most
                  delicious to the taste. Here were trees, whose fruit was for meat, and the leaves
                  for medicine.1
                   Here were orchards of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits, spikenard,
                  cinnamon, and all trees of frankincense, myrrh, and aloes, with all the chief
                     spices.2
                   Here were fig-trees, with ripe delicious figs, also fragrant vines with
                  many kinds of grapes, also the flowers appeared upon the earth, and the singing of
                  the birds made the air melodious. There was a fountain of gardens, and a well of
                  springing waters, and there were streams from the mountains, and whether the North
                  or the South winds blew upon the gardens with their beds of spices, the fragrance
                  went forth upon the sea.3

               In this region all that came in the name of the King were welcome, and they were
                  entertained at the King's own expense, so that everything reminded them of his
                  loving kindness. There was a grand banqueting house of cedar and fir, where the
                  guests assembled with holy joy, and ate and drank in memory of the sufferings and death of their King.
                  It was a spacious, vast, magnificent temple, in the midst of an open plain at the
                  foot of the mountains, sloping down, green and beautiful, to the very borders of
                  the harbor. In that House they spake a language that all understood, from whatever
                  nation under heaven the guests might have been gathered, and it was said to be a
                  dialect very like the language of the Celestial Country, a dialect taught of God,
                  and understood only by the Spirit of God.
               Now in this House there was a large Room, the sides of which were all filled with
                  round windows, through which those that looked could see grand instructive
                  panoramas of various scenes. It was a place where one might have studied all his
                  life-time, and still found something always new, instructive, and entertaining.
                  But though the windows were the same to everybody, yet the wonders that were seen
                  depended very much upon the state of mind in the persons that looked through them;
                  and some would go away, having seen very little, while others could never be tired
                  nor satisfied with gazing, and some were ready to exclaim with Peter on the Mount,
                  Let us build here three tabernacles,1
                   and never more depart from such blissful visions. But some went away as
                  ignorant as they came; for they are not all Israel, which are of Israel;2
                   and the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for
                  they are foolishness with him; neither can he know them, because they are
                  spiritually discerned.3

               Over the door of this room was written in large golden shining letters this motto:
                  OPEN THOU MINE EYES, THAT I MAY BEHOLD WONDROUS THINGS OUT OF THY LAW.4
                   Moreover, the Keeper of this room, who was a grave, but very affable and
                  gentle personage, encouraged all the visitors, saying, Eye hath not seen, nor ear
                  heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath
                  prepared for them that love him, but God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit;
                  for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea the deep things of God.5
                   He also told them, If any man think that he knoweth anything, he knoweth
                  nothing yet as he ought to know.6

                  6 1 Cor. viii. 2.
               
               Now when Peter and John came into this room, the Keeper of it looked pleasantly
                  upon them, and kindly and lovingly bade them welcome, and forthwith carried them
                  to a place, where was a succession of very important sea-views to be seen, besides
                  other things full of instruction, and bade them look earnestly. Then they looked,
                  and saw a ship, riding in a storm at night, tossed fearfully by the tempest; and making for a light that blazed upon
                  the coast, which seemed to be at no great distance. But they saw plainly that that
                  light was burning at a point where there was no harbor, and nothing but sharp,
                  perpendicular, jagged rocks. Then they looked again, and behold the ship had
                  struck upon the reef, just where the light was stationed, and was breaking to
                  pieces, with the sea dashing over her, and every soul perishing. Then their
                  Conductor told them that this was a representation of the false lights that
                  allured unstable souls to ruin, pretending to guide them to a safe harbor, where
                  no harbor was.
               But you perceive, said the Conductor, that these lights of falsehood are
                  various-colored and revolving lights, whereas, the King's light-houses are all
                  lighted with a light that shines like the sun, and is fixed, and not changeable.
                  Now if those on board this ship had studied the King's Chart, and kept their right
                  reckoning, they would have known where they were, and would have been in no danger
                  from mistaking those lights for the King's harbor. And if they had studied the
                  Coast Pilot, they would have known the false lights in a moment. But those lights
                  are put up to lure souls to perdition, by the same firm that made the life-boats
                  of the yacht you encountered, Security, Save-all and Company, under the superin-
                  tendence of the Great Adversary, and multitudes have been deceived thereby.
               Then said John, Many there be that cry, Peace, peace! when there is no peace.7
                   But methinks it would have been better and safer to have kept out at sea,
                  and endeavored to ride out the gale, rather than make for a harbor in such
                  dreadful uncertainty. Is not this a part of that which is called the
                  deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish?8

                  8 2 Thess. ii. 10
               
               Yes, said the Conductor, thou speakest right. These light-houses are sometimes
                  built after the working of Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders,
                  and sometimes by handling the Word of God deceitfully.9
                   But it would be better to be tossed in any storm, be it ever so fearful,
                  than to seek a refuge that God hath not sanctioned and appointed. They should have
                  known better. But Satan had blinded their hearts through the ignorance that was in
                  them because of their unbelief.10
                   And there be also those, whom God hath given over to strong delusion to
                  believe a lie, because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be
                     saved.11
                   But look now through this next window, and you shall see another
                  lesson.

                  11 2 Thess. ii. 10, 11.
               
               Then they looked again, and behold they saw a ship, noble and stately, under a full press of
                  canvas, sailing in beauty over the deep. Oh how lovely was the sight, for the sea,
                  and the air, and the breeze were glorious! But again they looked, and there was a
                  scene of revelry in the cabin, and the company were eating and drinking, while the
                  crew also were occupied in a similar manner, and some were dancing. Then again
                  they looked, after a moment, and lo, the ship was on fire, and all was confusion
                  and terror, and the flames darted from sail to sail, and licked the masts, and
                  flew up the shrouds, till the ship was a great sheet of fire. Then, again, once
                  more they looked, but all was dark, and the ship's hulk was floating, burned to
                  the water's edge, and not a living soul had escaped the conflagration.
               Then exclaimed Peter and John, O how dreadful is this!
               Yes, said the Conductor, solemnly, this is the representation of a soul setting
                  out well, but not laying aside besetting sins, nor discovering and watching
                  against inward corruptions. One indulgence follows another, till the watch of the
                  soul is all neglected, and through carelessness the habits of sin become as flames
                  of fire, till the soul is destroyed thereby. The people in that ship had been
                  carrying strong drink, and indulging themselves in the use of it, and this has
                  destroyed many a noble vessel. Let every man beware. Beware of every evil habit.
                  Beware of the indulgence of carnal appetites. Beware of sensuality. Beware of
                  unchaste thoughts, words, and actions. There be those whose god is their
                     belly,12
                   and there be those having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease
                  from sin, who shall utterly perish in their own corruption.13
                   There be those guilty of unclean conversation, whose tongues are set on
                  fire of hell,14
                   and shall be grievously tormented for ever in that flame. Beware of secret
                  and unseen temptations, and mortify your members which are upon the earth,
                  fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, and covetousness, which is
                  idolatry, for which things' sake the wrath of God cometh upon the children of
                     disobedience.15
                   Put ye off all these, and let your speech be always with grace, seasoned
                  with heavenly salt.16

                  16 Col. iv. 6.
               
               Then exclaimed Peter, Oh how many things do we meet at every turn to teach us our
                  danger! May the Lord search us and try us, and not leave us in the power of
                  undiscovered sin, or of habits of evil that cannot be conquered!
               Then said the Guide, Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to
                  judgment, and some they follow after.17
                  There may be secret sins, that burn
                     
                     17 1 Tim. v. 24.
                   like a slow fire, smouldering, half-smothered, yet
                  burning, all the voyage through. Vicious habit is a thing of awful power. A
                  navigator once came into this port, after having been at sea many days, with such
                  a fire in the hold, and they did not know when nor how it began, but it was down
                  so deep under the cargo that it could neither be got at, nor put out, but would
                  burn, in spite of all they could do to help it, and they knew it was burning by
                  the heat and smoke, and expected every hour to see it burst out for their
                  destruction. They turned great quantities of water down into the hold, but it was
                  manifest that still the fire held on, somewhere, and if they kept the hatches
                  open, it would soon all be a bright flame. So they shut down the hatches, and put
                  the ship for the nearest land, and cried to God for deliverance.
               The Cabin itself became so hot, that they could hardly stay in it, and to keep the
                  fire as long as possible from breaking out, they closed the Cabin also as tight as
                  they could do it. The decks grew so hot in some parts, that the pitch fried in the
                  seams, and one would have thought they must blaze up every moment. Day and night
                  they could neither rest nor sleep, but at length, through God's great mercy, they
                  got in sight of land; and when they came into the harbor, it was found that though
                  the fire had, in a wondrous manner, (the hatches being shut upon it) gone down
                  without breaking out into an open flame, yet it had charred the ship almost to
                  charcoal. The navigator lost everything but life, and had it not been for God's
                  mercy, he would have lost that also.
               To the day of his death he never forgot the awful danger. He warned his
                  fellow-sinners, by his own experience, and he told them in his own peculiar way of
                  illustration, which was very powerful, that when people are putting up a bridge,
                  centre-pieces, or wooden frames, are put under the arches, while it is building,
                  to support the masonry, but to remain there only until the solid arches themselves
                  are fully constructed and established. When that is once done, the wood is taken
                  away and burned. And just so, the pleasures of sin are only the devil's
                  scaffolding, to build a habit upon, and when that habit is once formed and steady,
                  then the pleasures are taken away, and sent for firewood, and the hell begins in
                  this life. And if it does not begin here, so much the more certain to begin and
                  hold on hereafter.
               O many are the souls thus sailing on over the Sea of life, with the fire of sin in
                  the hold, burning, charring, that never get into port, but the flame breaks out at
                  length, and envelopes them in a winding sheet of destruction! And now, remember,
                  that although sensual habits are the most perceptible here in this world, yet evil spiritual habits, habits
                  that in this world by most persons are hardly heeded at all, habits of the neglect
                  of prayer, indifference, stupidity of heart, insensibility to sin and to divine
                  realities, neglect of the Saviour, neglect of God's word, delay of the claims of
                  religion, lukewarmness, conformity to the world, procrastination; all these things
                  are the fire of sin, smouldering, charring, preparing the whole being for becoming
                  firewood, for that fire of holy retribution, which if a man passes into it, if he
                  will neglect all God's warnings, invitations, entreaties, expostulations, will be
                  a fire in God's anger, that shall burn to the lowest hell.
               But now, added the Guide, if there be those destroyed by fire, there is frost
                  also. Then he had them to another window, and bade them look again, and when they
                  looked, they saw a scene of great gloom and terror, and it came so near their own
                  experience, that it almost curdled the blood in their veins to think of it. It was
                  a vast, dreadful, frozen sea, and a ship fast frozen in the ice, and not a sign of
                  life aboard, but dead corpses lying on the deck as stiff as the silent ribs and
                  rocks of ice about the vessel. It seemed as if the tall, motionless, glaring
                  ice-bergs were keeping watch over them, for they rose on every side higher than
                  the mast-head. Then they looked again, and the cabin was open before them, and in
                  the cabin were two men seeming to be the Captain and Mate, seated at a table, with
                  a chart open before them, and a rule and the compasses in their hands, but they
                  were both stark dead and stiff with the frost, for death had come over them even
                  there while they were making their calculations.
               And now once more they looked, and behold there was a rushing storm, and a mighty
                  rushing whirlwind among the ice-bergs, so that they were tossed and ground
                  together against one another, like the beams of a shattered world, and the ship
                  was crushed just as if it had been an egg-shell, till in a few moments every trace
                  of her existence, hull, masts, and every thing had utterly disappeared.
               Then said the Conductor, ye know the meaning of this. Be humble, and thankful, and
                  watch evermore, and pray without ceasing.18
                  
               
               
                  
                  18 1 Thess. v. 17.
               
               Then the same kind and loving Guide bade them look into the next window, which,
                  when they had done, they saw what seemed to be a Marine Insurance Office, and it
                  was crowded with people going in and out, getting underwriting done for their
                  vessels. The policies of insurance pretended to have the King's seal, and also to
                  secure a ship against all possibility of damage or loss, and also to establish an
                  entire certainty of a safe entrance into the King's haven in the Celestial Country. But these things were all lies
                  and forgeries, though the people were willing to trust their salvation to them.
                  They also gave policies for ships that were never built, receiving risks on
                  fictitious capital, the pretended owners of which were willing to pay something
                  for the sake of deceiving themselves and others into the delusion of great riches.
                  Over the door of this place there was the sign of the same firm that put the
                  life-boats on board of Captain Glib's yacht, namely, Messrs. Security, Save-all,
                  and company. There were runners going up and down, pretending to be the King's
                  ministers, whose employment and charge it was to persuade men to come and transact
                  all their business for the Celestial Country at this office. Many seemed perfectly
                  satisfied as to the soundness of the concern, and the ability of the underwriters
                  to pay; but some still remained uneasy, even after they had received their
                  policies.
               Then said the Guide, The underwriters at this office are of the kingdom of
                  darkness, though they pretend to be angels of light. Their signatures are utterly
                  worthless, and he that trusts in them will certainly ruin his soul. There were
                  just such insurance offices, and keepers of them, and underwriters, in the days of
                  Noah, pretending to secure men against the deluge; but the flood came, and swept
                  them all away.19
                   And so shall it be in the end of the world.20
                   For when they shall say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh
                  upon them, for the day of the Lord shall so come as a thief in the night.21
                   There were such underwriters in the days of the Prophet Jeremiah, and also
                  of Ezekiel, crying Peace, peace, when there is no peace,22
                   seducing the people with a lying divination, seeing vanity and prophesying
                  lies, and saying, the Lord saith, when the Lord had not sent them.23
                   They prophesied security out of their own hearts, and pretended to have
                  made a covenant with death and an agreement with hell,24
                   for mankind, to strengthen the hands of the wicked, that he should not
                  return from his wicked way, by promising him life.25
                   But the King's wrath is against such prophets, and against all who put
                  their trust in such delusions, because they are willingly deceived, when from the
                  Word of God they know better.

               Then said John, These things, by the grace of the Lord, shall help us, that we be
                  no more children tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine,
                  by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to
                     deceive.26
                  
               
               
                  
                  26 Eph. iv. 14.
               
               Then said the Guide, "Our hope of you is stead- fast,27
                   if ye be unmoveable in Christ; and ye are made partakers of him, if ye
                  keep the beginning of your confidence steadfast unto the end.28
                   For ye know well that there is no true insurance but what is done by the
                  Lord Jesus Christ, and no getting any interest in that, but by coming to him, and
                  abiding in him. If a man abide not in him, there is no assurance but that of being
                     burned.29
                  
               
               
                  
                  27 2 Cor. i. 7.
               
               
                  
                  28Heb. iii. 14.
               
               
                  
                  29John xv. 6.
               
               Some men think they will be saved by the Church, some think they will be saved by
                  baptism, some by partaking of the sacrament; and there are various loan and life
                  insurance companies on these different principles; but the management of them is
                  all alike deceitful. It is a great swindle, and all assurances of salvation by any
                  thing but the blood of Jesus Christ, and faith in him, with repentance towards
                  God, even the renewing of the Holy Spirit, are hypocritical and rotten. Wherefore
                  he saith, Enter ye in at the strait gate; for wide is the gate, and broad is the
                  way that leadeth to destruction, and many there be who go in thereat. Because,
                  strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there
                  be that find it.30
                  
               
               
                  
                  30 Matt. vii. 13, 14.
               
               And again he saith, I am the Door. By me if any man enter in, he shall be saved,
                  and shall go in and out, and shall find pasture. But he that entereth not by the
                  door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a
                     robber.31
                   Wherefore, if a man get into the sheepfold by a profession, or by the
                  sacrament, or by what he calleth baptismal regeneration, and not by Christ, he is
                  a thief and a robber. Wherefore, again, our Lord saith, Many will say to me in
                  that day, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our
                  streets, and we have prophesied in thy name, and cast out devils, and done many
                  wonderful works; and then I will profess unto them, I never knew you, depart from
                  me all ye workers of iniquity.32
                   So it is that many will sail on proudly for a time, only to be the more
                  utterly and wofully lost forever?
               
                  
                  31 John x. 1. 9.
               
               
                  
                  32 Luke xiii. 46, 47.
               
               But come, said the Guide, look into another window, and you shall see a pleasant
                  sight. Then at his bidding they looked, and behold, a wide and shining sea, but
                  broken into quick waves by the breeze, and nothing to be seen in it but a bird
                  like an albatross, struggling to rise from the water. At first it seemed as if the
                  efforts of the creature only plunged it deeper, and its wings went under the water
                  instead of over it; but in a few moments it got the upper hand, and began to rise,
                  though at first it seemed only to skim the waves, but at length it rose higher and
                  higher, till it went strait up towards heaven, and then it seemed to soar without labor, and almost without
                  motion, even like a white fleecy cloud in the atmosphere.
               Then said the men what meaneth this?
               And the Guide told them they might there see how the righteous shall hold on his
                  way by prayer, and wax stronger and stronger.33
                   At first it would be difficult to rise above the world; difficult it
                  always is to begin to pray, and sometimes it seems as if the prayers of such a
                  wo-begone, sinful and burdened heart only disclosed sin, and carried the soul
                  deeper down in guilt and misery. But looking to Christ, and coming to him, prayer
                  shall be successful, and though at first it seems to do nothing more than get the
                  wings free, and though the flight has to commence fluctuating and doubting along
                  the very crest of the waves, yet soon the persevering soul shall soar, and then,
                  the higher it rises, the purer grows the air and light, and the easier it is to
                  keep flying. And so, if a Christian will thus wait upon the Lord, he shall mount
                  up on wings as eagles.34
                   But if he falls again into the sea of worldliness, he is in great danger
                  of sinking in it outright, and of drowning.

                  34 Isa. xl. 31.
               
               Then the Guide had them to another window, and he said, What you see here will
                  depend upon your faith. So they looked, and behold at first they only saw men as
                  trees walking.35
                   Then were they greatly disappointed, and the tears fell from their eyes
                  for sorrow of heart; but the Guide bade them look to Him who is the Author and
                  Finisher of our Faith,36
                   and gaze again. So they cried within themselves, Lord increase our
                     faith.37
                   And again they looked, and lo, they saw what seemed to be the very
                  uttermost end of the Ocean, and the shining coast of the Celestial Country, and
                  sweet green fields stretching down to the sea, and angels in companies walking up
                  and down, and also the walls and gates of the New Jerusalem, and happy beings in
                  white going in and out continually. They saw likewise the domes of the City, which
                  seemed to be floating off into the sky further than the eye could reach, and they
                  thought they heard a melodious sound of bells, exceeding sweet and musical, but
                  they were so ravished that they knew not what to say. They thought it had been
                  night, and that the morning had come, and that they had just awakened from a long
                  sleep; and they exclaimed, both at once, Let me go, for the day breaketh!38
                  
               
               
                  
                  35 Mark viii. 24.

                  38 Gen. xxxii. 26.
               
               Then the Guide smiled, and looked lovingly upon them, and bade them God speed upon
                  their voyage, and gave each of them a little book, in which was folded up a
                  parchment, written within and without,
                  that no man could read but they themselves, and it was called the Earnest of the
                     Inheritance39
                   and they were bidden to keep it in their bosoms, and never let it go, for
                  that it would be a great solace and joy to them in all the way of their voyage,
                  even to the end. So with hearts full of thankfulness and love, they hastened down
                  to the Harbor, to get all things in readiness for their departure. They found that
                  by orders from the King a great supply of everything requisite for the
                  continuation of their voyage was waiting their order, so that they had only to say
                  the word, and everything was accomplished. Nothing was wanting.
               
                  
                  39 Eph. i. 14.
               
               They were overjoyed at all this, and it seemed as if now there were no more
                  troubles by sea or by land, between them and glory, but a certain and smooth
                  passage thither. And, indeed, that had come about spoken of by the Prophet, that
                  before they called, God answered them, and even while they were speaking, the
                  blessing was with them.40
                  
               
               
                  
                  40 Isa. lxv. 24.
               
               But the Master of the Harbor, who was a very sage and venerable person, and of
                  great experience, gave them some grave warnings in the midst of all their joy, and
                  bade them beware of self-exaltation, for that they did not know what enemies
                  within, as well as without, they might yet have to encounter. He told them they
                  must call to remembrance what it was that happened to Peter and John even after
                  they came down from the Mount of Transfiguration.41
                   Be not high-minded, but fear,42
                   said he; a contrite mind is the safest, and though present comforts and
                  delights are precious indeed when God sends them, yet the soul that can follow the
                  Lord contentedly without them is in a sweet and humble frame, that is very safe
                  and exceedingly desirable. Moreover, the Lord is very near to such a soul, and
                  communes with it, but the proud he knoweth afar off.43

               And now were all hands active for again setting sail, and they went to work with
                  great joyfulness, for the hope that maketh not ashamed animated them, because the
                  love of God was shed abroad in their hearts by the Holy Spirit that was given
                     them.44

               CHAPTER VIII.
               A CONFLICT WITH THE GREAT PIRATE, AND HOW TO RESIST
                  TEMPTATION.
               NOW it happened that as they were all busy, getting in their water and provisions,
                  there was a fellow named Pride, who came under the disguise of one of the King's
                  Stevedores, and took hold along with the crew, to help them in their labors. He
                  seemed to be an active, zealous workman, ready for anything, whether to carry
                  coals, hew wood, or draw water. He had tried before to get in with the crew, in
                  his own proper character, but could not succeed, and now resorted to this
                  stratagem, for he was a secret spy and soldier in the service of Beelzebub, the
                  Prince of the Devils. So he made himself very humble and very busy, and just as
                  the ship was getting in her last supplies, and was all ready for sailing, he came
                  on board with a wheelbarrow of packages for the ship's use, and instead of
                  returning, slunk unperceived away to a dark place in the forecastle, to hide
                  himself till the ship should be under weigh, and then stand his chance for holding
                  on in the voyage, though there was no name under which he was down in the Ship's
                  manifest.
               Well, for some time he kept quiet, but at length managed to get the key of one of
                  their sea-chests, where he found a whole suit of seamen's clothes, even to a
                  tarpaulin, and having rigged himself in this toggery, he made his appearance in
                  the first dirty weather they encountered after leaving the harbor, and pulled at
                  the ropes, and reefed sails, with the rest of them. They were too busy to take
                  much note of the man, or even to see at first that he was a stranger, though
                  Contrition and Sincere looked hard at him, and made up their minds to speak about
                  him to Peter and John. But as the weather began to be rough and uncomfortable,
                  they had much to occupy them; and what had never been known before, there began to
                  be a spirit of discontent at the squalls and wet weather they were encountering;
                  for the fellow Pride had a way of whispering and muttering, so peculiar that it
                  was like ventriloquism, and what he said seemed to come from the heart and belly
                  of the person to whom he said it, so that there began to be heart-burnings and
                  hard thoughts, where before there had been nothing but sweet peace, content and
                  patience.
               
               Now all this was not for nothing, as the event proved. One night, while all the
                  rest of the crew were sleeping, and the watch were looking astern across the sea,
                  this fellow, Pride, contrived to hoist a lantern signal with a blue light, which
                  he had conveyed on board for that very purpose, and by which he was to communicate
                  with his Master, whom he knew to be on the watch in those regions. For the devil
                  is a great and cunning Pirate, who watches for ships richly laden; and the seas
                  about the Island and Harbor of the Communion of Saints are a favorite
                  cruising-ground for his privateers. So the fellow, Pride, who knew his Master to
                  be somewhere thereabouts, kept up the signal as long as he dared, and then managed
                  to haul it down again without discovery. The night was very dark, but the light
                  could be seen so much the farther for the darkness.
               The very next day there hove in sight a black, doubtful-looking craft, bearing
                  down upon them, and as she neared, and got close enough for hailing, up went the
                  black flag of Beelzebub, and the Master stood upon the quarter deck, and in a
                  voice that roared through his trumpet like thunder, called upon the Captain of the
                  King's ship in the name of his Infernal Majesty, to surrender at discretion, for
                  that he was Master of those seas.
               Then Peter stood forth and answered for his King, that this was the King's own
                  ship, even Immanuel's, and owed no allegiance to any but him, nor would ever
                  surrender to his enemies; furthermore, that this was the King's own highway, and
                  the course of the ship just what was laid down for her in the King's chart, and
                  that none had any right or authority over them, either to stop the way, or turn
                  them out of it.
               Then the Master of Beelzebub's ship answered that by the King's own laws all their
                  pretended rights were forfeited to Beelzebub, for they had sold themselves to him,
                  and must come to him for wages, nor would he relinquish his hold upon them for
                  service, but if they fled away, would recapture them wherever he could find them,
                  for that they were his slaves and his property, and as such he claimed them, and
                  called on all in the ship to help in the execution of the laws whereby they should
                  be delivered up.
               Then Peter answered that it was indeed true, and with shame and sorrow of heart he
                  spoke it, that formerly, under great delusion and guilt, they had been in the
                  service of Beelzebub, serving divers lusts and pleasures, but that God, having
                  delivered them from the power of darkness, and translated them into the Kingdom of
                  his dear Son,1
                   had delivered them wholly from the power of Satan, and made them, by
                  adoption, Sons of God, and meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light;2
                   that of their own accord they chose the service of God's dear Son, and
                  should have done it sooner, had not the god of this world blinded their minds3
                   and made them perverse and unbelieving; but by the Lord's help they never
                  more would serve the devil, nor any of his laws or works.
               
                  
                  1 Col. i. 13.
               
               
                  
                  2Col. i. 12.
               
               
                  
                  3 2 Cor. iv. 4.
               
               At this Beelzebub fell into great wrath, and raved and swore with such passion,
                  that he could hardly speak English. But at length he roared out that by the King's
                  own laws they were under his jurisdiction, for that it was one of those laws that
                  they should render unto CÃ¦sar the things that were CÃ¦sar's,4
                   which they had not done, for that the god of this world, in alliance with
                  CÃ¦sar, had made laws which they had contemned and disobeyed, and if they continued
                  to do this, there could be no civil government, and that the first rule of all was
                  to obey the powers that be, for that they were ordained of God.5
                  
               
               
                  
                  4 Matt. xxii. 21.
               
               
                  
                  5 Rom. xiii. 1.
               
               Then Peter answered that as to that matter, the god of this world had trampled on
                  the word and authority of God, and had made God's laws of none effect through his
                     traditions,6
                   which he, the devil, was trying to enforce as law, and to get men's
                  consciences under his authority; but that they were commanded at all hazards to
                  render unto God the things that were God's, and in all those things they were the
                  Lord's freemen, and would be bound by none but him.
               
                  
                  6 Matt. xv. 6.
               
               But Beelzebub still maintained that they were his servants from the outset, and
                  had broken away from his allegiance without cause, and as miserable fugitives from
                  justice, ought to be rendered up again. Besides, added he, you have got on board
                  of your ship one of mine own subjects, impressed unwillingly and detained
                  violently, and if you do not instantly release him, I will blow your ship into ten
                  thousand pieces.
               Now Peter and John trembled at this, for they did not fully understand the
                  accusation, and as they knew they had never themselves been kidnappers, and were
                  not aware of any smuggled hands on board, they began to question about their own
                  identity. Likewise the whole crew, all but that fellow, Pride, began to say within
                  themselves, Is it I? Is it I?7
                   And their sins rose up before them in such wise, at the great roaring
                  voice of Belzebub, that they were ready to question, each for himself, whether he
                  was not really the man that ought to be given up to Satan as his prey.
               
                  
                  7 Mark xiv. 19.
               
               However, Peter managed to answer with apparent boldness, that the King's ship was the King's ship,
                  and they would defend her for him to the last. And whether it were right to obey
                  God or man, or to hearken to Beelzebub more than unto God, all on board might
                     judge.8
                     Then Peter commanded to clear the ship for action.
               
                  
                  8 Acts iv. 19.
               
               But even while they were doing this, the Master of the Pirate ship, having brought
                  her into a commanding position, poured a whole broadside upon the King's ship,
                  intending, if possible, to sink her at one blow; and if the shot had taken effect
                  as was intended, the consequences would have been terrible. But just as the order
                  to fire was given, a wave providentially lifted the vessel up and suddenly keeled
                  her over down to the sea, just so far, as to send the whole discharge into the
                  ocean. Not a shot told.
               By this, Peter and John were greatly encouraged. Now that the conflict had really
                  begun, they felt more boldness by far than while they were parleying. But the next
                  broadside did more injury, for the enemy tacked about with incredible swiftness,
                  and brought his guns to bear more truly, though even then most of them whistled
                  across the decks, without striking either the men or the ship. It was a great
                  relief, after these repeated attacks from so terrible an adversary, to find
                  themselves still alive and floating.
               And now they brought the King's own guns into action, and every shot told. The
                  very first report of them was inspiring, while they struck terror, evidently, into
                  the heart of the enemy. Out of the great Mortar, called Promise, they shot a bomb,
                  that fell upon the leeward side of the Pirate Ship, and there exploding, tore out
                  the bulwarks, carrying overboard several of his biggest guns and a number of the
                  piratical crew with them. They also brought to bear with great power and effect
                  the larger gun, WHO SHALL SEPARATE US FROM THE LOVE OF CHRIST?9
                   And also that other piece, which was put on board, IF GOD BE FOR US WHO
                  SHALL BE AGAINST US?10
                   These pieces, however, did as much, if not more in encouraging and
                  confirming Peter and John and all the crew, than in injuring the enemy, though
                  they were not without their effect upon him, as was proved afterwards.
               
                  
                  9 Rom. viii. 31.
               
               
                  
                  10 Rom. viii. 35.
               
               While all this was going on, Contrition and Sincere, who had their eye upon that
                  fellow Pride, observed him at work upon the fire-engine, and coming up to see what
                  he was doing, found that he had cut the hose in three several places, and was
                  trying also to choke the pump with grit, which he had carried for that purpose in
                  his pockets. Then they seized him at once, and in the struggle his hat fell off, which he had always worn over his
                  eyes, and they saw his true name plainly in his forehead, and knew him to be a
                  villain and a spy. But they had a hard struggle to master him, for he was terribly
                  strong, and caught at everything to prevent being thrown overboard, which
                  nevertheless they did succeed in doing, for it was all over with them, if he
                  stayed longer on board. But as to the fellow himself, he no sooner touched the
                  water, than he swam like a fish to Beelzebub's vessel, and was there taken
                  instantly in.
               Meantime, some of the hands set themselves as quick as thought to repair as much
                  as possible the mischief done to the hose, and well was it that they had
                  discovered it in season, for no time was to be lost. Grace to help in time of
                     need11
                     must come now, if it came ever.
               
                  
                  11 Heb. iv. 16.
               
               For now the conflict raged terribly, because the enemy let fly a shower of darts,
                  tipped with fire and brimstone, that came flaming and hissing through the air, and
                  in spite of all that they could do to prevent it, would strike and stick,
                  sometimes in the masts, sometimes in the sails, sometimes on the deck, and several
                  times burst into a flame, so that the fire engine had to be handled with great
                  swiftness and dexterity, and some of the crew had to be stationed in the shrouds,
                  with buckets of water supplied continually.
               While they were hard pressed in this manner, several of the fiends, with that
                  fellow, Pride, at their head, having thrown themselves into the sea, swam
                  unperceived under the stern, got hold of some ropes that had there been left
                  hanging by the villain for that very purpose, and by that means hoisted themselves
                  up to an open cabin window, and entered. Then with shouts of blasphemy, and a
                  rush, with hellish darts, they broke forth suddenly on deck, supposing they should
                  surprise the whole ship's company, and get entire possession. They struck John a
                  terrible blow in the back, before he was aware, just as he was bending over in the
                  act of aiming one of the great guns for another broadside, so that he fell flat
                  beneath the force of the encounter, and would certainly have been murdered, had
                  not one of the crew, named PRAY-WITHOUT-CEASING,12
                     who saw when the attack was made, ran with Peter to the rescue.
               
                  
                  12 Thess. v. 17.
               
               Then commenced a violent struggle, hand to hand, with the fiends, who raised their
                  terrible flaming darts, and also breathed fire so furiously upon them, that they
                  had hard work to draw their very breath in the conflict. Nor is there any telling
                  what would have come of it, had not the
                  clouds, which had been rolling up very black and heavy, ever since the fight
                  began, just then broke in a shower of rain so violent, that the burning darts
                  became almost useless in it, and the fire which had caught in several places was
                  put out. Meantime they had the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God,13
                   the same weapon with which the King himself once conquered Satan in the
                  temptation in the wilderness;14
                   and with this they parried the darts wonderfully, and then struck nimbly
                  and earnestly in the name of the Lord, at every blow crying to God for help, till
                  at length every one of the fiends, being wounded almost unto the death, threw
                  themselves over the side of the vessel, and were seen no more.
               
                  
                  13 Eph. vi. 17.
               
               
                  
                  14 Matt. iv. 4, 7, 10.
               
               Then they gave thanks to God for this deliverance, and now again amidst the
                  confusion of the decks looked towards the Pirate Ship expecting a new conflict.
                  But lo, a great black smoke was seen issuing out of the hold, and fiery-forked
                  flames rose up with it, for their own combustibles had suddenly taken fire, and
                  burned so furiously, that nothing could quench them. And now the night shut in
                  with great rapidity, and the glare of the flames shone lurid over the sea, and the
                  helm of the vessel being abandoned, having been disabled by a shot from the King's
                  ship, she drove on recklessly like a blinded tiger in a burning menagerie, and her
                  shotted guns went off one after another, till at length there was a most awful and
                  magnificent explosion, and for a moment the air was filled with burning, falling
                  fragments, and then all was dark and still.
               But oh, what thankfulness and joy there was on board the King's ship for this
                  deliverance, mingled, however, all night long, with anxious fears and watchings,
                  lest the Enemy might re-appear in boats, or lest the very explosion of his vessel
                  might be only a trick to lull them, for they well knew the greatness of his power
                  and resources, as well as the snares of his malignity and cunning. But the morning
                  dawned without trouble, and the sun rose bright and lovely over the wide horizon,
                  and the sea was smooth, and the wind fresh and balmy, and not a sail or a hulk
                  appeared in sight to give them the least anxiety.
               By and by a white flag like an Angel's wing came into view as they were looking
                  eastward, just as if a fleecy cloud had been suddenly created when there was
                  nothing but blue firmament, and then there was speedily a brave and splendid ship
                  setting towards them, having the King's own colors flying, and everything
                  beautiful and bright. Then Peter and John stood still, and gazed with wonder, for
                  the vessel was coming right towards them, and as soon as she came near enough to speak, one of those on
                  board hailed in a friendly voice, and asked after their welfare. Then they said
                  that all was well, through God's great mercy, but began to tell them something of
                  the great peril they had just escaped; whereupon the Commander ordered his boat,
                  and speedily with his principal officers came on board the King's ship, bringing
                  with them sweet refreshments and delights, that had come from the Celestial
                  Country.
               When they had partaken of these, which they did with much comfort and gratitude of
                  so loving a communication, for they perceived and knew that it was from the King,
                  they gave some farther account of the Conflict. Then the friendly visitors told
                  them that they had been all the while in their neighborhood, and were not
                  altogether ignorant what was going on, for they had even heard the noise of the
                  guns, and had seen the terrible explosion.
               You were not alone, said the Commander, for ministering spirits were with you, and
                  one such it was, who saved John from his peril, when the fiends attacked him from
                  behind, and would have killed him. For God, said he, giveth his angels charge
                  concerning those that be his children, and will not have them leave them.15
                   Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister to those who
                  shall be heirs of salvation?16
                  
               
               
                  
                  15 Psa. xci. 11.
               
               
                  
                  16 Heb. i. 14.
               
               Then exclaimed John, If we had known that you were so near, and that angels were
                  with us, we had not been so terrified.
               No, nor so watchful and prayerful, neither roused up to such strong and earnest
                  faith. But did ye not know, angels or not, that God is with you? Ah, ye must count
                  it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations, knowing that the trial of your
                  faith worketh patience.17
                   But God is always with you. It is of the good pleasure of the King thus to
                  leave his dear people sometimes to a seeming desertion and death, that they may
                  feel more deeply their dependence on him, and their need of his grace to save
                  them. But he is always near them, and never will desert them, when they put their
                  trust in him.
               
                  
                  17 James i. 2, 3.
               
               But is it often, asked Peter, that the Prince of the Devils giveth such battle in
                  these seas?
               Oh, much worse, much more deadly sometimes. Paul himself once had a conflict with
                  him somewhere in this region, and with his companions was pressed out of measure,
                  above strength, insomuch that they despaired even of life. But they had the
                  sentence of death in themselves, in order that they might not trust in themselves,
                  but in God who raiseth up the dead; and
                  who delivereth them from so great a death, and by that very means increased their
                  confidence that he would still deliver them.18
                  
               
               
                  
                  18 2 Cor. i. 8, 9, 10.
               
               But do all escape out of the hands of this Wicked Adversary, asked John, who are
                  thus attacked by him?
               They do, if they be faithful in crying to God, and trusting in him who died for
                  them. For he hath said I will never leave thee.19
                   Blessed, therefore, is the man that endureth temptations; for when he is
                  tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them
                  that love him.20
                  
               
               
                  
                  19 Heb. xiii. 5.
               
               
                  
                  20 James i. 12.
               
               Well, exclaimed John, we shall shout when we get through! Oh, what is all we can
                  suffer here in comparison with that glory!
               Oh, yes! but at present you must walk by faith, and sometimes you are quite down,
                  and seem dying; for many are the forms of faith's trials. In these seas the great
                  Enemy sometimes comes in one form, and sometimes in another, and also the effect
                  of his attacks is very different. It is not often that God beats him down under
                  your feet so signally as you have seen done in that explosion. Moreover, we must
                  tell you that such an explosion might itself sometimes be the devil's own cunning
                  artifice, to make you think he had abandoned you forever, and would appear no
                  more; so you must be watchful against him, being not ignorant of his devices.21
                  
               
               
                  
                  21 2 Cor. ii. 11.
               
               Our dear Lord once conquered him, and will again, and it is good to go with him in
                  the wilderness, and to know that because he himself suffered, being tempted, he is
                  able to succor them that are tempted, yea, and will do it, to the end of time.22
                  
               
               
                  
                  22 Heb. ii. 18.
               
               Remember, also, how the temptations of our glorious Lord in the wilderness began
                  in a time of great spiritual enjoyment and glory. Draw a lesson from that. Within
                  and without there was the presence, the delight, the approbation of God. This was
                  the time the devil chose for his assault. He is a pirate that attacks the richly
                  laden vessels, but lets the empty and the worthless pass. Therefore, never think
                  yourselves secure because of present comfort and sweetness in walking with God. Be
                  always on the watch. Watch and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.23
                  
               
               
                  
                  23 Mark xiv. 38.
               
               Then answered Peter, If the Lord's people are to count it all joy when they fall
                  into divers temptations,24
                   how is it that he saith also, Pray that ye enter not into temptation?25
                   Do they mean the same thing?
               
                  
                  24 James i. 2.
               
               
                  
                  25 Matt. xxvi. 41.
               
               Then said the man, There be two kinds of temptation; temptations which are trials
                  from God, for our discipline and good
                  behavior and growth in grace, such as storms, hardships, sicknesses, poverty, the
                  loss of friends, disappointments and afflictions, of many kinds. These are all
                  meant for our good, and will prove for our good, if they answer God's loving
                  purpose of bringing us near to him, and causing us to seek our all in him. But
                  there be also temptations from within, temptations to sin, when the evil
                  affections and desires of the heart coming in with external allurements, tempt the
                  soul away from God; and it is against entering into such temptation that our Lord
                  bids us to watch and pray. For the Apostle saith, Let no man say when he is
                  tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted of evil, neither tempteth
                  he any man; but every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust and
                     enticed.25
                  
               
               
                  
                  25James i. 13, 14.
               
               Now against such temptation every man must earnestly watch and pray, and against
                  entering into it. There may be temptations to sin, which a man does not enter
                  into, because, by the grace of God, being on his watch, he rejects them at once,
                  and cries to God instantly for help against them, and God giveth him grace to help
                  in time of need. But if a man plays with temptation, if he dallies with it, if he
                  parleys with it, if he shakes hands with it, and enters into pleasant
                  conversation, all the while considering and questioning whether he shall do it or
                  not, then he is entering into temptation. Entering into a thing is a very
                  different matter from standing without and watching against it. You know that
                  entering into a fog is a very different thing from spying a fog bank afar off, and
                  trying to keep clear of it. As long as you can keep outside of it, and clear of
                  it, it can do you no harm, and you are in no danger; but the moment you begin to
                  enter into it, then it closes round you on every side, and you can no more see
                  your course, and sometimes can hardly see your hand before your face, and so may
                  run upon a reef of rocks, without even knowing that you were near them. Fogs are
                  exceedingly hazardous, especially if the King's Chart and the reckoning have been
                  neglected, and no correct observation gained.
               Here Peter and John looked hard one upon another, and it was easy to know by the
                  sorrow and solemnity of their countenances that they were thinking of past
                  dangers. But oh, they thought within themselves, what tender mercy of the Lord was
                  it that we were not ourselves wrecked for ever!
               Then the Man looked lovingly upon them, and went on. He said that just so a
                  careless soul enters into temptation. There be temptations sudden, and temptations
                  gradual, and a careless soul may be
                  overcome of either; but the gradual temptations begin by little and little, and
                  are like a fog, which the vessel enters into before you are aware. A man parleys
                  with them, advances towards them, and his heart all the while grows tender to
                  them, and then at length the fog of sinful inclination is all around him, and
                  everything grows dark. He no longer sees the Word of God clear shining, nor feels
                  its power; his faith diminishes, and the love of God declines, and the face of the
                  Lord is no longer seen by him. And when a man thus enters into temptation, then
                  temptations enter into him. The fog not only surrounds him, but gets within his
                  very soul, making everything cold, listless, and desolate. And if at such a time
                  Satan come upon the soul, what chance is there of escape? Oh beware, beware, lest
                  you enter into temptation.
               The Man said, moreover, that there was once a great house committed by the King to
                  the charge of his servants, with instructions to the Porter to watch. Now there
                  was a garden round about the house, hedged round on all sides with a strong, high,
                  protecting hedge, which nobody could break down from the outside, nor get over.
                  Beyond this hedge was a waste howling wilderness, and in the thick of the forest a
                  terrible band of robbers, whose aim was, if they could by any means do it, to
                  surprise and get possession of the King's garden and house. For this they watched
                  their opportunities at the hedge, hoping they might get into a friendly
                  conversation with some of the servants, and so make a beginning.
               Now the name of the Porter was Parley, and he was a man given to talk, and as he
                  walked about the garden, he heard his own name whispered on the other side of the
                  hedge, and drew near to see what it was. Then the robber entered into a
                  conversation with him, and this was done several days, till quite a fellow-feeling
                  was begotten between them, and the robber went so far as to tell Parley the Porter
                  that it was a shame to be kept cooped up in that little garden under such close
                  restraints, and not permitted to know anything of the world, and its pleasant
                  amusements, and its grand old woods, and its pleasant men and women. These things
                  made an impression, you may be sure, upon Parley's mind, and he was now entering
                  into temptation, and so the thing worked, till Parley the Porter was taken with
                  such a desire to see something more, and also to see the man that had been talking
                  with him, that one day while they were conversing he began to pull away the hedge
                  on his side the enclosure, so as to make a little space for easier
                  communication.
               As soon as Parley began this work, then the robber could begin also, for the King
                  had made the hedge in such a manner,
                  that it could be broken through only by beginning from within, but if it were
                  begun there, then alas, it was easy; so they soon had a place broken, by little
                  and little, big enough for a man to crawl through. The robber entered, but very
                  carefully at first, and entirely alone, and in a plain, simple, peaceable garb,
                  and without any weapons, so as neither to disturb any one, nor terrify the Porter.
                  And Parley for his part was astonished to see such a perfect gentleman, so
                  amiable, so pleasant, so affable, so kind. He seemed to take a great interest in
                  Parley's affairs, and Parley showed him the house, with its doors and its
                  fastenings, though he could not let him in, because of the other servants.
               But at length, by little and little, Parley was persuaded one night, though he
                  would not himself open the door to him, to leave a window unfastened, so that he
                  could open it himself and get in. That very night the man came in armor with all
                  his gang, and they took the house by storm, and though some of the servants
                  escaped, yet Parley was the first one murdered. Such is the course of sin;
                  therefore watch and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.26
                  
               
               
                  
                  26 Mark xiv. 38
               
               Furthermore, said he, never despair, but look to Christ and trust him, in the
                  lowest and most hopeless state. And, remember, that he causes the sins of his
                  people to chastise them, and their very backslidings to correct them. Many of the
                  changes that God suffers his people to pass through are directly for their good;
                  so that, though they may be the result of instability within, or of carelessness,
                  or prayerlessness, or running into needless temptations, yet God makes them the
                  actual means of growth and permanence in grace.27
                   Anything that makes us feel our own weakness, guilt, and misery, and our
                  need of Christ, is good for us, though it may be very painful, mortifying, and
                  perplexing for the present. Discipline and trial now, and the discovery of our own
                  wretchedness, are the way to lasting peace. 
                     
                        Though painful at present, 'twill cease before long,
                        And then, O how pleasant the Conqueror's song.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  27 Jer. ii. 19.
               
               So the man bade them good by, and returned with his officers on board their own
                  ship, where Peter and John, and all the men followed them with their eyes, and
                  kept gazing at the vessel afar off, till she went out of sight, just as they had
                  first caught the vision, like an angel's wing or a fleecy cloud in the horizon.
                  The sun set that night more soft and beautiful than ever, and they saw no more of
                  the Pirate, but with a fair breeze sailed steadily away.
               
               Then they set up a sweet song, recounting their dangers, a part of which ran
                  thus:â€” 
                     
                        Believers now are toss'd about
                        On life's tempestuous main;
                        But grace assures beyond a doubt,
                        They shall their port attain.
                     
                     
                        They must, they shall appear one day,
                        Before their Saviour's throne;
                        The storms they meet with by the way,
                        But make his glory known.
                     
                     
                        Their passage lies across the brink
                        Of many a threat'ning wave;
                        The world expects to see them sink,
                        But Jesus lives to save.
                     
                     
                        Lord, though we are but feeble worms,
                        Yet since thy word is past,
                        We'll venture through a thousand storms,
                        To see thy face at last.
                     
                  
               
            
            
               CHAPTER IX.
               A NAVAL BATTLE IN THE HALF-WAY HARBOR TO ROME.
               THERE was a place formerly laid down in the King's Chart as the Shifting Sands,
                  where of old time a beacon had been established upon two great reefs, one of them
                  called the Rudiments of the World, and another called, The Traditions of Men.1
                   Now in the course of ages, what by shipwrecks, and the flight of birds,
                  and the increasing of the Sands to islands, these reefs were all grown over with
                  soil and trees, and at length the whole region became covered with vegetation,
                  grew into a great commercial resort, and at this time had become a famous country.
                  Peter and John knew by their observations that they were in the region of those
                  Shifting Sands, but they did by no means expect to see a continent. It was,
                  therefore, with extreme surprise, that they found themselves one day beyond all
                  question nearing the
                     
                     1 Col. ii. 8.
                   solid land. The
                  man at the mast-head reported land early in the morning, but at first they thought
                  it must be a mistake of a low bank of cloud, or some other deception, but they
                  soon found that in very truth it was a country, though not one of God's original
                  continents, but composed from first to last of what is called made land.
               Now as they drew near to this country, it became manifest that there was an open
                  Harbor near where they were sailing, and beyond what seemed to be the entrance
                  they could see a grand city rising, the domes thereof, and many of the buildings,
                  being ornamented with crosses. So they determined to see what it was, but they had
                  no sooner entered the Harbor, than a boat hailed them with an officer, whose work
                  it was to collect port-charges. This convinced Peter and John that the place was
                  not under the King's laws, for every port in the way to the Celestial Country was
                  free to all ships carrying the King's colors.
               But before the matter could be settled, a revenue cutter was had up from the
                  offing, and Peter and John were ordered on board, on the charge of not conforming
                  to the laws of Church and State. But they refused to leave their own ship,
                  whereupon the officers of the Revenue Cutter came themselves on board the King's
                  ship in a great rage, which, however, was somewhat rebuked and abashed by the cool
                  and quiet demeanor of Peter and John, who received them with great politeness.
               These men proceeded to tell Peter and John that they would be held to answer,
                  under the laws of that realm, for being in those waters without a license from the
                  State. But to this Peter and John made answer that their sailing orders, and
                  licenses also, were received from Immanuel their King, and that they were free to
                  traverse every one of his highways and harbors, without let or hindrance, neither
                  could any power on earth or in hell rightfully stop them.
               The enquiry was then made of them as to the Ecclesiastical authorities, by whom
                  their free papers were signed and sealed, and they said that there was no
                  authority in the case, that ever had had, or ever would have, any power over them,
                  save only that of God's own Word, ministered unto them by the Holy Spirit, unto
                  which they were bound in all cases whatever to render obedience.
               Then it was told them that unless they could show a permit under the hand of some
                  Priest, who could trace back his own succession to one of the Apostles, they were
                  uncovenanted men, and their vessel an outlawed, uncovenanted vessel. A maxim of
                  that country was had up and asserted in their hearing, No Bishop no
                  Church; and it was told them that
                  unless they hoisted the Bishop's Flag, they could not be suffered to sail, for
                  that it was clean contrary to the statutes of the realm, and too disorderly to be
                  permitted.
               To this they made answer that they never would accept, acknowledge, or hoist, any
                  other Flag than that of their King; that his banner over them was love;2
                   that in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision availed
                  anything, but a new creature.3
                   They added also this; The Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Lawgiver, the
                  Lord is our King; he will save us.4
                  
               
               
                  
                  2 Cant. ii. 4.

                  4 Isa. xxxiii. 22.
               
               Then it was asked them if they ate meat on Fridays; also whether they kept the
                  Saints' festivals; also, whether they shaved their heads in a crescent or full
                  moon.
               To this they answered that they did not shave their heads at all; that they ate
                  whenever they were hungry, the meat that God gave them, giving God thanks; and
                  that they had been commanded of the Lord not to let any man judge them in respect
                  to meat or drink, or a holy day, or the new moon, or the Sabbath day.5
                  
               
               
                  
                  5 Col. ii. 16.
               
               While this conversation was going on, there was a curious little imp of a fellow
                  to be seen up and down the deck, with a strange robe on his back like a sur-
                  plice, having a kind of swash-bucket in one hand, and a sponge in the other; and
                  this sponge he kept ever and anon filling with water from the bucket, and
                  sprinkling it here and there, especially whenever he could get near enough to any
                  of the crew to wet them. This singular personage acted in the capacity of
                  baptismal regenerator-general for the Harbor, and always accompanied the revenue
                  and rudiment officers to communicate the grace of baptismal conversion to any such
                  subjects of uncovenanted mercy as they might possibly encounter. It was singular
                  to see the seriousness of his movements, which had a very ludicrous effect, in
                  contrast with the unrestrained wonder and contempt, with which the men of the
                  ship, as well as Peter and John, regarded them.
               Now these revenue and rudiment men seemed not only astonished, but very much
                  enraged, at what they called the contumacy and rebellion of Peter and John; and if
                  they had had sufficient force with them, they would have taken possession of the
                  vessel on the spot. But this they dared not attempt, especially as the sight of
                  the King's great guns somewhat staggered them, and the more, when they drew near,
                  and read their shining inscriptions. One of the crew, named Watchful, was just
                  then at work burnishing them, and the letters shone like the sun, especially the
                  motto of one of them, If God be for us,
                  who shall be against us?6
                   So those officers, when they had looked round about upon the armament and
                   appointments of the ship, departed with the promise of another visit.
               
                  
                  6 Rom. viii. 31.
               
               Now Peter and John, being peaceable men, and seeing the train in which things were
                  likely to go, concluded at once to weigh anchor and pass quietly out of the
                  Harbor, seeing it was no place for them; neither could they get provisions there,
                  and to be detained there would only delay and injure their whole voyage, and
                  perhaps bring great disaster upon them. Whereupon they proceeded in open day to
                  get all things in readiness for sailing.
               But the authorities on shore had resolved to maintain their jurisdiction, and to
                  this end had ordered up from their naval stations three of their biggest gun
                  ships, namely, BAPTISMAL REGENERATION, SACRAMENTAL SALVATION, and
                  JUSTIFICATION-BY-WORKS. They had also a great ship named Agar, and another which
                  was called Fair-show-in-the-Flesh,7
                   and another named Will-Worship,8
                   and another called Philosophy-and-Vain-Deceit,9
                   and another named Fables-and-Endless-Genealogies.10
                   All these vessels together made a squadron, by the very sight of which
                  they confidently believed they should frighten Peter and John into surrendering at
                  discretion; but they had mistaken their men.
               
                  
                  7 Gal. vi. 12.

                  10 1 Tim. i. 4.
               
               As soon therefore as these ships came closing round about them, and the Great
                  Admiral, whose name was my Lord Obedience-to-Tradition, with Lord Ceremony
                  standing behind him, had summoned them in a loud voice to haul down their colors,
                  and receive the King's Flag at their hands, Peter and John commanded to hoist
                  sail, and while all hands were doing this, they steered right boldly for the open
                  sea.
               But in so doing, the wind having suddenly freshened, and the ship under full sail
                  getting strong headway, she ran directly, with a most thundering crash, into the
                  bows of Fables-and-Endless-Genealogies, just then crossing her course, to take a
                  position for raking her. The concussion was so sharp and powerful, that, the
                  King's ship being of heavy and solid timber, very strongly put together, while the
                  Fables-and-Endless-Genealogies was of slight materials, and poorly constructed,
                  more for show than actual service, the bowsprit and whole head-pieces of this last
                  ship were cut clean off, and carried away like basket work, and the water poured
                  into her hold at such a rate, that a heavy vessel would have sunk instantly. But
                  the three vessels, Fair-show-in-the-Flesh, Philosophy and Vain-Deceit, and
                  Will-Worship, all came to her help, and had as much as they could do to keep her from foundering. They used helps,
                  undergirding the ship,11
                   and sent on shore for carpenters to mend her as well as they could, for
                  their whole dependence was upon her preservation, and they were about to have her
                  newly bottomed in the Dry Docks belonging to the Man of Sin and Son of
                  Perdition.
               
                  
                  11 Acts xxvii. 17.
               
               Meantime the three leading ships in the squadron commenced a heavy cannonading in
                  pursuit of Peter and John, which, had the King's ship been at anchor in that
                  Harbor, might have done mischief, but as she was now on her course, it had no
                  effect whatever; all the shots fell short. Not so with the King's own guns, which
                  the men on board the King's ship now brought into play with great dexterity. Their
                  ammunition was from the great store-house of God's own Word, and every shot told.
                  They brought the great Mortar into action, and the first bomb they fired was this,
                  STAND FAST IN THE LIBERTY WHEREWITH CHRIST HATH MADE US FREE, AND BE NOT ENTANGLED
                  AGAIN IN THE YOKE OF BONDAGE.12
                  
               
               
                  
                  12 Gal. v. 1.
               
               The explosion of this bomb was heard far up the country, and it shook the very
                  houses in the city, so that the inhabitants at first thought there had been an
                  earthquake. They fired also another, I can do all things through Christ which
                  strengthened me,13
                   and another, By grace are ye saved, through Faith, and that not of
                  yourselves, it is the gift of God;14
                   and another, By the deeds of the Law shall no flesh be justified;15
                   and another, In Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor
                  uncircumcision, but Faith, which worketh by Love.16
                   All these were directed with so much precision, that they fell right in
                  the centre of the enemy's gun-ships, and scattered everything before them. The
                  long guns also did great execution.

                  16 Gal. v. 6.
               
               But the most wonderful effect was produced by the last named bomb, together with
                  the following, Wherefore, if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the
                  World, why, as though living in the Word, are ye subject to ordinances after the
                  commandments and doctrines of men?17
                   For these bombs fell, the one upon the main deck of the ship of Baptismal
                  Regeneration, and the other into the hold of Sacramental Salvation. They made such
                  havoc, that the main mast in the first ship went by the board, and the ship became
                  so entangled with her own hamper, that she could not again be brought into
                  action.
               
                  
                  17 Col. ii. 20, 22.
               
               And inasmuch as by their naval etiquette her Consort could do nothing without her,
                  besides being nearly blown to pieces by the bomb in her hold, and as the ship
                  JUSTIFICATION-BY-WORKS had no ammuni-
                  tion of her own, and must receive all orders only as countersigned by my Lord
                  Obedience-to-Tradition, they got into a pretty muss, and in the endeavor to help
                  each other, fell to quarrelling among themselves. The Captain of
                  JUSTIFICATION-BY-WORKS demanded the authority to fight upon his own hook, by a
                  dispensation from one whom they called the Pope, without having to wait for
                  BAPTISMAL REGENERATION and SACRAMENTAL SALVATION. He said, moreover, that one kind
                  of works was as good as another, and that in order to be up to the times, he must
                  have a Chaplain of his own, and an altar and candles to work by.
               The King's ship left them amidst those discomfitures and vain janglings at the
                  mouth of their own Harbor, and with a favorable wind pursuing her course to the
                  Celestial land, soon lost sight of that strange country. Not a single life was
                  lost in the conflict, which was a thing remarkable, in contrast with the former
                  history of those roadsteads, and of the interior of that region, where of old
                  there had been great burnings alive and other barbarities exercised on all who
                  were so unfortunate as to fall into the hands of the natives. There were great
                  catacombs of superstition, and among them a dark underground passage, which was
                  said to open up into a distant place called the Vatican, where was the Palace of
                  that Man of Sin and Son of Perdition, who owned the Dry Dock, in which
                  Fables-and-Endless-Genealogies was going to be newly bottomed. There were
                  predictions that that whole region was to be overthrown by fire, and would one day
                  sink like a millstone in the ocean, with the great Establishments built up there
                  for so many ages. But the inhabitants paid little or no attention to such things,
                  considering that their great Establishments were not only an honor to the Modern
                  Age, but the great support of their glory and gain.
               Now Peter and John were right glad to have escaped this danger, and to find
                  themselves once more in the King's open highway, with a free and fair breeze.
                  Thinking it all over, they could hardly tell how it happened that they got into
                  such a conflict, and they thought within themselves how much worse they must have
                  fared, had they left the King's ship, and gone strolling up the country, either
                  out of a vain curiosity, or agreement with the customs of that land. On studying
                  the King's chart in regard to this region, they found it written, Come out of her,
                  my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her
                     plagues.18
                   Then said Peter, This is verily either that Great Babylon, or a city and
                  harbor that lieth under her jurisdiction, and so must be a partaker of her
                  destruction.

               And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth
                  their merchandise any more. The merchandise of gold and silver and precious stones
                  and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all sweet
                  wood, and all manner of vessels of ivory, and all manner of vessels of most
                  precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble, and cinnamon, and odors, and
                  ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and
                  beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and the souls of men. And
                  the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which
                  were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at
                     all.19
                  
               
               
                  
                  19 Rev. xviii. 11-15.
               
               Then said John, I perceive, brother, that the City extendeth much more widely than
                  we thought it could have done; and if the kings and inhabitants of the earth that
                  have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication are to partake of her
                  plagues, there is a time of great vials of wrath coming. For it is written, Thy
                  merchants were the great men of the earth, for by thy sorceries were all nations
                  deceived. And then it is added, that In her was found the blood of prophets, and
                  of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.20
                     If these plagues are yet to come, there must be great and wide ruin.
               
                  
                  20 Rev. xviii. 23, 24.
               
               Then answered Peter, How it will be we know not, but we do know that with violence
                  shall that Great City Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.
                  Yea, and the merchants of those things, which were made rich by her, shall stand
                  afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing, and saying, Alas! Alas!
                  that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and
                  decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls! For in one hour so great riches
                  is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and
                  sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off, and cried when they saw the
                  smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city! And they
                  cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, and saying, Alas! Alas!
                  that Great City, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of
                  her costliness! For in one hour is she made desolate!21
                   Now when all these things are accomplished, there will be Halleluias from
                  much people, because of the true and righteous judgments of the Lord our God.22
                  
               
               
                  
                  21 Rev. xviii. 15-19.
               
               
                  
                  22 Rev. xix. 1, 2.
               
               Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath
                  avenged you on her!23

               Then said John, I perceive that when all this is done, there shall be for a time
                  an end put to the teaching for doctrines, the commandments of men;24
                   and this City and Harbor out of which we have escaped so happily, if it
                  then exist, shall be altogether changed, and this wickedness clean consumed out of
                  it.
               
                  
                  24 Matt. xv. 9.
               
               Then said Peter, This devil is not so easy to be turned out of his house and home
                  in human affairs, as you think for. There be those who would impose upon the
                  conscience by human law things as acts of religion; but this is quite contrary to
                  God's Word, and is just causing men to take their religion from men instead of
                  God. For that which is enforced by a human law, out of the fear of man, taketh
                  away from the fear and love due only unto God. Again, there be those who would
                  bind the conscience by human law to do things clean contrary to the Divine Law,
                  saying that this quality of contrariness is quite taken out from any action, so
                  soon as human laws have legalized it. But this is a quirk of Satan, to get men's
                  consciences into his own keeping, and to bind them fast into his own notions of
                  morality.
               Well, returned John, these men, whether they live in one age or another, are
                  certainly of those lawyers who have taken away the keys of the kingdom of heaven,
                  and will neither go in themselves, nor suffer those who are entering.25
                   The faithful disciples that would enter only the Door, that is by Christ,
                  they compel to climb up some other way, else they will not receive them. Only to
                  think of their despotism and pride! They would have had us give up the King's
                  flag, from the King's own ship into their hands, that we might afterwards receive
                  it from their authority, and acknowledge a subjection to them! I bethink me of
                  Paul, when they made a like onset upon him and Barnabas and Titus, and other good
                  men, whose liberty in Christ Jesus they hated, and sought to bring them into
                  bondage; to whom Paul said they would not give place by subjection, no, not for an
                  hour, that the truth of the gospel might continue,26
                   which it could not, if it were put under the bondage of men.
               
                  
                  25 Luke xi. 52.
               
               
                  
                  26 Gal. ii. 5.
               
               Then said Peter, These men will have a great guilt to answer for in the Great Day.
                  And yet they seem verily to think that they, and they only, of all mankind that
                  have heard the gospel, are in covenant with God, and safe in the way to heaven.
                  But oh, what a dreadful, overwhelming ruin awaits them, when they come to the
                  judgment, if they have trusted in anything else but the blood of Jesus Christ and
                  the renewing of the Holy Spirit for their salvation. What shame and confusion will be theirs, when,
                  having trusted in their ceremonies and their works to save them, they come up to
                  the Celestial City, and find it shut against them! Then they will say, Lord, Lord,
                  have we not prophesied in thy name, and eaten and drunken in thy presence, and
                  hast thou not taught in our streets,27
                   and have we not builded thy temples and thine altars? But he will say, I
                   never knew you.
               
                  
                  27 Luke xiii. 26.
               
               Then belike they will answer, again, But I was baptized in such or such a city, in
                  such or such a Cathedral Church, by such a priest of the true succession, and also
                  I partook of the sacrament at his hands, and I was taught that after that, the
                  baptism of the Spirit was sure, for that all who were baptized were regenerated.
                  Then might he say, But ye had my word, and wherefore did ye not believe it?
                  Wherefore did ye hearken unto men rather than unto God? For ye were made to know
                  that the word which I had given you, the same should judge you in the Last
                     Day.28
                  
               
               
                  
                  28 John xii. 48.
               
               Alas! how many in that day will hear that dreadful word, Depart from me, I never
                  knew you,29
                   who fully expected to hear that other sweet word, Come ye Blessed of my
                     Father!30
                   But they who choose to risk their salvation on a lie, and take the
                  teachings of men before the truth of God's Word, are twice over determined to
                  perish.
               
                  
                  29Matt. vii. 23.
               
               
                  
                  30 Matt. xxv. 34.
               
               The King's ship did now, day by day, make good progress, and the light came down
                  upon the sea in such glory, and the waves far off before them shone with such
                  brilliancy, where the sea melted into the heavens, that sometimes they could not
                  look steadfastly towards that quarter, because the glory was so great, and the
                  flood of light so intense. And they seemed to be nearing it continually, so that
                  sometimes they felt as if they were very near heaven, and as if it would be an
                  easy thing, a few leagues farther on, to sail straight into it.
               Now and then also there were birds that appeared flying, of a strange celestial
                  beauty, with plumage such as they had never seen before; and they would dart down
                  from the sky, and then shoot up again, till the eye lost sight of them, because it
                  could not follow them so far. But where these lovely creatures could have their
                  resting-places, the whole ship's company were at a loss to know; but they were
                  very beautiful, and when they fled away, took the men's hearts with them.
               While in the midst of these seas, they were exceedingly surprised one day, by
                  coming in sight of an open boat, with a man in it, reclining in the stern, and
                  quietly reading a book, at the same time that he was steering. Then Peter and John hailed him, and
                  asked what he would be at, out there in mid-ocean, or how in the world he got
                  there, seeing that they themselves had encountered such storms, that it did not
                  seem possible that under any circumstances an open boat could have lived through
                  them. So he told them that the country from whence he came was not so far off as
                  they imagined, for that he came from the land of FLESHLY WISDOM, a very wide land,
                  and was bound for the Celestial Country; but never having been satisfied with any
                  proposed views of religion, and being sure that he had himself formed a theory,
                  which would with all posterity take the place of all other systems, he was
                  resolved to set out on his own hook.
               Accordingly, he had laid in a stock of the concentrated essence of provisions, and
                  with a portable steam-engine, which he intended to use whenever occasion called
                  for it, he had come thus far by dint of sails and rowing, and occupied most of his
                  leisure time in perusing and re-perusing a volume of his own works.
               But where, cried Peter and John, is your chart and compass?
               The man answered that they were all safe in a little binnacle, but that in truth
                  he did not really want any; the interior light was so great, that he went by the
                  Spirit, not the letter, of which indeed he was in no need, having himself risen to
                  a personal inspiration. He said, moreover, that to make all sure, he had gathered
                  the creeds of all nations, ages, and sects, and carried them with him. He knew
                  that there was truth in all, and by accepting of them all, he was perfectly sure
                  that he had got all the truth in the world at any rate. As to any creed of his
                  own, he held it yet in reserve, and was ready for new manifestations of light any
                  where.
               He likewise let Peter and John know that he was now engaged in demonstrating that
                  all forms of language were incapable of conveying any true record of the Spirit,
                  and that consequently men must leave off relying on any written form of
                  inspiration, and throw themselves confidently on intuition and the soul. He said,
                  also, that his own works, though so extremely eloquent, proved that language was
                  no adequate exponent of thought, for that with all his great powers he had never
                  been able to make half a dozen persons understand either what he believed, or what
                  he was driving at; and if this were the case with his own writings, he argued, how
                  much more must it be with a volume like that of the Holy Scriptures.
               Then Peter and John looked upon the man with mingled amazement and compassion, for
                  they per- ceived plainly that he was
                  not in his right mind, and they concluded he must have broken loose from some
                  lunatic asylum, so they invited him to come on board the King's ship, entreating
                  him to seize the opportunity of salvation afforded him, for if he went on in this
                  way, he must perish. But he answered with much indignation and contempt, that they
                  need not suppose that all the wisdom in the world was on board their ship, and
                  that he pitied their delusions more than they could his, and indeed if they would
                  consent to follow him, he said that he would cheerfully take them in tow, and give
                  them the benefit of a mind that otherwise might have to wait for posterity before
                  it could be appreciated.
               Then Peter and John could not help smiling, much as they pitied the man, at such a
                  droll conceit as that of seeing the King's ship moored to the stern of a
                  sail-boat. But while they stood looking at him, he shifted his sails, bade them
                  good morning, and scudded off before the wind on a tack some five points different
                  from the course of the vessels, and they soon lost sight of him.
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               THE CAPE OF STORMS, AND THE ISLAND OF PEACE.
               NOW for some days after these encounters, things went smoothly enough, and they
                  seemed to be making fair and rapid progress on their heavenly course. But no good
                  frame of mind in this world is permanent, neither will fine wind and weather last
                  always, nor can anything be relied upon but God.
               After those days of bright and pleasant sailing, there began to be an unexpected
                  change. It seemed as if there were some mighty obstacle before them, they knew not
                  what. The air grew heavy, and at a distance there were heavy, dark, threatening
                  forms looming up like great mountains, and a great shadowy ridge seemed to be
                  resting on the sea, forbidding them to pass beyond it. Also there was a great
                  gloom upon their own spirits, so that, though they tried to commit their way unto
                  the Lord,1
                   and to
                  
                     
                     1 Psa xxxvii. 5.
                  
                   feel what they well
                  knew, that he would be their guide, even unto death,2
                   yet they were anxious and troubled, and the fear of death came upon them,
                  and they trembled and were disquieted.
               
                  
                  2 Psa. xlviii. 14.
               
               What added for a little season to their gloom, was their meeting with a vessel,
                  sailing the contrary way from theirs, as fast as she could go, with a breeze that
                  filled her sails, direct from the black gloomy-looking ridge before them; and when
                  they hailed the Master of that craft, and asked him whither they were bound, the
                  man made answer, To the Celestial Country! But, said he, we had like to have
                  perished on the way, for we ran into head seas and storms, and it was night all
                  around us, and thunderings, and hail, and lightnings; so that we know that we had
                  mistaken our way, and we do now believe that all this is superstition and
                  fanaticism, for that God cannot require his creatures to pass through such fears
                  and distresses. It is the work of gloomy thoughts about God and our own
                  sinfulness; and if we had gone that way much longer, we had all been crazed. We
                  are now determined to go back, and we have no fear but that a merciful God will be
                  merciful to his creatures, for we never have done anything so bad as we seemed to
                  have done, when these desolations and terrors were round about us. It is the work
                  of gloomy, fanatical spirits, to prejudice us against God and ourselves; and we
                  advise you, if you know what is for your good, to keep clear of it. We are
                  convinced that the Celestial Country cannot lie in that region.
               To this Peter and John made answer, that though the Celestial Country might not,
                  and they were very sure it did not, lie in that region, for it was no where to be
                  found on earth, yet all that region might, for aught they knew, lie in the way to
                  the Celestial Country, and that whatever of evil there might be, it could not be
                  so great as their sins had deserved, nor so great as the evil of keeping their
                  sins in the country of sin and destruction. They said, moreover, that if it was
                  the right way, they had a right to expect suffering, for that they had been
                  assured that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.3
                   So, said they, we see not anything in your account to make us think, as
                  yet, that we have mistaken the way; but they added, we are very sure that the way
                  back is not the right way, but the way to perdition. For it is written of God that
                  the just shall live by his faith; but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no
                  pleasure in him.4
                   They said, moreover, We will not be of them who draw back unto perdition, but of them who believe to the
                  saving of the soul.5

                  5 Heb. x. 39.
               
               So saying, they kept on their way, and though it grew more and more gloomy, yet
                  they remembered for their comfort the saying of Paul, that we are saved by Hope.
                  But hope that is seen is not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?
                  But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it, and the
                  Spirit helpeth our infirmities.6
                  
               
               
                  
                  6 Rom. viii. 24, 25.
               
               They also comforted themselves with the saying, Though he slay me, yet will I
                  trust in him;7
                   and also again called to mind the passage, Who is among you that feareth
                  the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and
                  hath no light? Let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God.8
                   Then they said one to another, There is nothing in all these reported
                  fears and tribulations, that goes at all to prove that we are not in the right
                  way; but at any rate there is no direction in the Chart, hereabouts, for us to
                  turn back, and onwards we must go.
               
                  
                  7 Job xiii. 15.
               
               
                  
                  8 Isa. 1. 10.
               
               So they went on, keeping a good look-out, and they soon found that the vast
                  black-looking ridge before them, though it lost its supernatural dimensions as
                  they drew nearer, yet prevented the possibility of a course so direct and speedy
                  as they had of late been running, unless they could find some strait or channel
                  opening through what seemed to be the continent. The coast trended south, and rose
                  forbidding and gloomy, desolate and shrouded with storms. There was no harbor,
                  neither any inlet or passage, and still the farther they went, the stormier grew
                  the weather and the seas, and the less the probability of shelter. At length they
                  came to the conclusion that this must be that Cape of Storms, rounded by David,
                  Job, and Jeremiah, where so many navigators had encountered so great perils, and
                  so many had given themselves up for lost. But they committed themselves for safety
                  to him who had been with them in six troubles, and would save them in seven,9
                   and so they kept the helm on the course indicated, as closely as they
                   could determine.
               
                  
                  9 Job v. 19.
               
               But it was a time of fear, fatigue, and great danger. The cross seas seemed to
                  drive direct upon them from every quarter, angry and swift, as if the fiend was in
                  each one of them, making for the vessel, and resolved to overwhelm it. They passed
                  through a hail-storm, so cold and fierce, that the sharp icicles drove upon them
                  like grape shot, and the decks and shrouds were covered with an icy sleet, which
                  made it almost impossible to handle the sails and rigging. They encountered also a gale so severe, that all
                  their past experience, as they then thought, furnished them with no counterpart of
                  its violence. Sometimes it seemed as though they must go to the bottom. Sometimes
                  it thundered and lightened at such a fearful rate, and at the same time the rain
                  poured down in such torrents, that it seemed as if creation's doom were
                  approaching, and they could only stand still, and wait for God to finish his
                  judgments. Thus for many days and nights they were beating about, conflicting with
                  storm, darkness, and uncertainty. All this time they cried unto the Lord,10
                   and often with groanings that could not be uttered,11
                   for a sense of sin lay upon them, and of terror, sometimes inexpressible,
                  so that repeatedly it seemed as if the ship at the next move forwards would plunge
                  bodily underneath the rising wave, instead of riding over it.
               
                  
                  10 Psa. cvii. 6.
               
               
                  
                  11 Rom. viii. 26.
               
               All this while they could scarcely tell where they were, but at length the sun
                  came out long enough to give them their true reckoning by observation and then,
                  deeming themselves past the extent of that stormy continent, they set the ship due
                  East, and prayed, if it were God's will, that they might have clear weather. They
                  had not gone far when the clouds lifted and broke, and though there was nothing,
                  either before or around them, but a waste of waters visible, and the ocean
                  everywhere wild and gloomy, yet now it seemed as if again they knew their way, and
                  were under the King's jurisdiction. Then they called to mind God's loving
                  kindness, and exclaimed, When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou
                  knewest my path!12
                  
               
               
                  
                  12 Psa. cxlii. 3.
               
               And now they felt so grateful to God, for causing them to persevere, that no
                  language can tell the happiness of their emotions. They bethought themselves
                  likewise with sorrow and pain of the ship they had met hurrying backwards, for
                  they knew, by the Word of God, that all on board must be ruined by that course.
                  Then said John, It is very strange that they should have come so far on this
                  voyage, and after all turn back. But they could not have had the King's
                  commission, nor any true knowledge of his cross, his laws, his love, or their own
                  hearts.
               Then answered Peter, There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end
                  thereof are the ways of death.13
                   There be those who set out well, and as long as it is smooth weather and
                  sunshine they may keep sailing, and this may be for a long time, finding nothing
                  to try them. These be they, where the seed of the gospel is sown in stony ground,
                  having no deepness of earth, and getting no root, yet springing up rapidly, but
                  under the heat of the sun it wither-
                  eth away.14
                   So they made great sail at first, but you see nothing had been done in
                  their hearts, for as soon as their inward corruptions were stirred up, and the
                  terrors of hell began to be presented, together with some opposition from this
                  world, they took offence, and went back, denying the truth of the gospel. Indeed,
                  there is no knowing how many there may be in every age, who have some experience
                  of the powers of the world to come, and also of the Sword of the Spirit which is
                  God's Word, who afterwards fall away, and are never again renewed unto
                     repentance.15
                   It is not likely that that vessel will ever be seen again with her head
                  towards the Celestial Country.
               
                  
                  13 Prov. xvi. 25.

                  15 Heb vi. 5,6.
               
               Then said John, I think we have more reason to be afraid of all sunshine than all
                  storm. But for men to turn back because of storms is madness indeed. It makes me
                  think of that night of the disciples on the Lake.16
                   If they had tried to put back to the harbor when the storm came on, they
                  would not have met the Saviour; and just so, if Peter, when he found he was
                  sinking, had tried to put back to the ship, he would have been lost; but he held
                  on, looking to Christ, and crying, Lord save me,17
                   and so the Lord saved him. And I am persuaded the Lord is always near us
                  and with us, and just as near in the storm and darkness as in fair weather and
                  sunshine. It is no argument, because we do not see him, that he does not see us,
                  and care for us. But oh, when a soul turns back, it becomes mad against him, and
                  hath such venom against the truth, saying that it has had all that experience that
                  Christians pretend to have, and found it false, that with such devilish lying,
                  such a sinner and apostate may destroy much good.
               
                  
                  16 Mark vi. 48.
               
               
                  
                  17 Matt. xiv. 30.
               
               Then answered Peter, It was once said by a great navigator, that experience, like
                  the stern lights of a ship, only serves to illumine the path that has been passed
                  over; a man learns but little from it on his future way, except he learns to be
                  watchful unto prayer, throwing himself entirely upon God. But if this be true of
                  the different periods of individual experience in this navigation, how much less
                  can the experience of others answer for our own. It is like the track of a vessel
                  on the ocean; it may be put down on the chart, it may be described in the logbook;
                  but you could not possibly put another vessel on the same track. You too must go
                  by the chart and the compass, for there is no line of foam left in the trackless
                  sea. Each soul has to go through the same experience for itself, and must be
                  taught by the same Divine Spirit all the way. Ah, let us be looking always to our
                  great Captain.
               
               And now again the weather began to grow soft and balmy, and the way seemed all
                  bright and calm before them. They had now a succession of such pleasant days and
                  nights of sailing, that after a time it seemed as if they had got into a new
                  world, and indeed, an unusual sparkling light filled the air, accompanied with
                  such an elasticity of their inward spirits, that they felt sometimes like flying
                  from the deck of the vessel. Here too they came in sight of that group of Islands,
                  called, The Peace of God that passeth all Understanding,18
                   and they might almost have mistaken them for the Celestial Country itself,
                  they were so beautiful. The woods were always fresh and green, and filled with
                  melodious warbling birds, singing the praises of their Creator, and the grass was
                  all inlaid with fragrant amaranthine flowers, so beautifully sprinkled, and so
                  sweet and lovely in themselves, that it was a delight only to look at them. At
                  these Islands they had more direct communications with the Celestial Country than
                  ever before, for here there were to be seen, sometimes, the angels of God
                  ascending and descending; and wherever they came to anchor, as they were permitted
                  to do anywhere, according to their pleasure, everything was so calm, so pure, so
                  peaceful, that they exclaimed, This is none other than the house of God, this is
                  the gate to heaven!19
                  
               
               
                  
                  18 Phil. iv. 7.
               
               
                  
                  19 Gen. xxviii. 17.
               
               It seemed as if heaven's own Sabbath had lighted down upon those Islands, with all
                  its fulness and serenity of blessing. The people that were there brought down to
                  the pilgrims very many fruits, and a supply of such sweet, refreshing water, that
                  never in all their lives had they tasted anything so grateful. The people of the
                  Islands were all clothed in white, and their talk was of the Celestial Country and
                  the King, and they never seemed so happy, as when conversing about his glory and
                  goodness. They were overjoyed at the arrival of Peter and John, and the more when
                  they told them what great perils and storms they had encountered.
               It was, therefore, many days that Peter and John remained coasting among these
                  Islands; and at the last and farthest of them they staid so long, that there began
                  to be a great uneasiness on the part of some of the men, among whom were
                  Contrition and Watchful, together with one, whose name was,
                  I-COUNT-NOT-MYSELF-TO-HAVE-ATTAINED. These men felt that things were getting
                  careless, with so great a detention on their voyage, and they came to Peter and
                  John, and made bold respectfully to tell them that they feared the consequences if
                  they remained at those Islands any
                  longer, for that some of the men would not be willing to stir, and they had
                  already two fellows on board from the interior, one of them named Spiritual
                  Indolence, and the other Ease-in-Zion, whose example and conversation had infected
                  them all, or was creeping upon them with a very evil influence.
               They also stated that that great villain, Pride, had been seen again about the
                  vessel, and they suspected he had lodged there more than once, while the people of
                  the ship had been securely feasting and sleeping. They also stated that they had
                  been informed that it was a law of the Islands, and of the King for all visitors,
                  that here they had no continuing city, but must seek one to come;20
                   and also that forgetting the things which were behind, they must reach
                  forth unto those which were before, and be pressing towards the mark for the prize
                  of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.21
                   When they had humbly and respectfully said this, then they withdrew.
               
                  
                  20 Heb. xiii. 14.
               
               
                  
                  21 Phil. iii. 13, 14.
               
               That same night, while Peter and John were sleeping, a great clap of thunder was
                  heard, and a voice which said, Arise ye, and depart hence, for this is not your
                     rest!22
                   By this they were greatly aroused and terrified, and the more because
                  there came a messenger down from the Islands, saying, It is high time to awake out
                  of sleep, for now is your salvation nearer than when ye believed. The night is far
                  spent, the day is at hand.23
                   He added to this the following. Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from
                  the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. See then that ye walk circumspectly,
                  not as fools, but as wise; redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
                  Wherefore, be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.24

                  24 Eph. v. 14-17.
               
               Now were Peter and John exceeding sorrowful, because that they had merited this
                  rebuke, and they began to feel that they had been slothful in the midst of ten
                  thousand mercies, and they feared lest they should have been called to account as
                  servants who had wasted their master's goods. They at once set themselves at work
                  to weigh anchor and set sail. But what was their amazement to find that the best
                  chain cable on board, which had stood all the strain and tug of so many storms,
                  dangers, and anchorages, had been rusted almost entirely through, so that they had
                  to procure the services of the King's Smith, before they could fit it for service,
                  or even weigh anchor by means of it.
               It was also discovered that that villain, Pride, had indeed been at work upon the
                  sails and shrouds, where he had by some means untied and rotted the fastenings,
                  and yet left them seemingly whole, so
                  that the trick was only discovered by a severe fall of Peter himself, who set his
                  foot upon a rope, thinking it was perfectly firm, and came down headlong, not
                  without much injury. They also had but just got the mainsail half way up the mast,
                  when the rigging there gave way, and the whole came down by the run, burying two
                  of the men, and much bruising them. If these things had not been discovered before
                  they had got out at sea, there is no telling what evil might have happened.
               Peter and John were now greatly distressed and mortified, as well they might be,
                  because it was by their gradual letting loose of the watch and discipline on board
                  the vessel that these things had taken place. As it was while men slept, that the
                  Enemy sowed tares,25
                   so now it was very gradually and imperceptibly, while they had been
                  spiritually so full of confidence and enjoyment, that these mischiefs were
                  accomplished. But the discovery of these things caused Peter and John to look more
                  narrowly about them, and they found that not only the shrouds and sails had been
                  tampered with, but that that master of all villainy, Pride, had secretly worked
                  upon the compass, and also had eaten at the hinges of the rudder in a very
                  dangerous manner.
               
                  
                  25 Matt. xiii. 25.
               
               These things prevented their getting again at sea, so soon as they otherwise would
                  have done, though they made all possible diligence. It was deeply impressed upon
                  their hearts that they had done great wrong, and been very ungrateful to God, in
                  remaining so long at those Islands, almost forgetful of the great purposes of
                  their voyage. They knew that those Islands had been placed there and furnished by
                  the Lord's great mercy for the refreshment of his Pilgrims on their way to the
                  Celestial Country, but that he never intended that what he had given for their
                  help should be used for their heaven. It was never the King's intention that they
                  should be willing to linger on the way; and they found that even spiritual
                  delights, if rested in, and made the great object of the soul, instead of God's
                  glory, and the soul's advancement towards heaven, might be turned into a kind of
                  selfishness, which would really in the end, separate the heart from God. They were
                  exceedingly humbled and mortified to think of it, and they deplored it before God
                  with tears, and besought his pardon.
               But indeed they had delayed so long, that the best season was already somewhat
                  passed over for the most favorable navigation on that side of the Islands; and a
                  wet month had set in, in which sometimes a thick fog was encountered, produced, it
                  was said, by the Prince of the Power of the Air, the Spirit that now ruleth in the children of disobedience,26
                   but who also did all that the Sovereign Will of God would ever permit him
                  to do, wherever he found opportunity to put obstacles in the way of the sailing of
                  the King's vessels. This Wicked Prince of the Air was almost continually in
                  communication with that villain Pride, and ever and anon received notices from
                  him, as to the occasions on which he might probably succeed in doing mischief; and
                  it was partly by that means, that now, as soon as Peter and John had got upon
                  their way again with apparent prosperity, they began, all unawares, to enter into
                  that fog. It was very distressing to them, for it was accompanied with a horror of
                  great darkness, and in the midst of it a storm arose, where such weather had not
                  been at all expected.
               
                  
                  26 Eph. ii. 2.
               
               Moreover, there was a great Reef of Rocks in that neighborhood, called
                     Neither-Cold-nor-Hot,27
                   and some fearful shipwrecks had been known there of old, and it was still
                  a place of great danger in every age, and some thought more dangerous now than
                  ever, although there was a Light-House erected there by the King's orders, in
                  charge of a faithful keeper, with all means to warn vessels, and keep them from
                  the danger. On the other side of the Reef the danger was still greater, for there
                  the Enemy of souls had planted the appearance of a Harbor, and a floating Island
                  covered with an atmosphere of such potent sleepy efficacy, that whatever Captains
                  or crews could be got round on that side, and persuaded to enter that Harbor, they
                  were almost sure never to awake again, but they lay there, till their vessels
                  rotted and fell asunder, and they themselves perished.
               
                  
                  27 Rev. iii. 15.
               
               Sometimes, by reason of the prevailing fog, the warning light was but very dimly
                  visible, and vessels passing the reef in safety, and not knowing where they were,
                  were very liable to be imposed upon by appearances on the other side, where in
                  some instances they were hauled round into smooth water, and being invited to
                  enter the Harbor, were deluded to their great injury, and made the prey of
                  pirates. It was important here to keep a very sharp look-out, and an accurate
                  reckoning, and accordingly neither Peter nor John closed their eyes in slumber,
                  for the night, coming after the fog, terrified them.
               It was a great mercy that they had been kept upon their guard; for in the middle
                  of the night, while the waves were running high, and the storm unabated, the
                  Light, by an extraordinary lifting of the cloud, rose suddenly upon them, and they
                  found, by the manner in which it loomed up through the fog, and seemed almost to
                  hang over the bowsprit, that they had
                  come very near running headlong upon the rocks, so that the danger sent a thrill
                  of horror through their souls. And now they cried out still more earnestly to God,
                  while they used every exertion to keep the ship off, and to round the reef without
                  striking. And how thankful were they, as indeed they had reason to be, that they
                  had been awakened from their carelessness and put upon their guard before they had
                  run into these perils; for if these things had come upon them unawares, while they
                  were dreaming of peace and safety, then they would have found sudden
                     destruction.28
                     But God had better things in store for them, and would not leave them.
               
                  
                  28 1 Thess. v. 3.
               
               When the morning broke, the fog had gone, neither the reef nor the Islands could
                  any more be seen, and the sun rose beautifully clear upon a sea, that looked as if
                  never a storm could visit it, so serene, so radiant, so lovely. After praising God
                  for his mercy, the men got out their chart, and began again with great closeness
                  to scrutinize their position and prospects. The image of that Light, looming up so
                  suddenly at midnight, and as it were, towering over them, continued to make a deep
                  impression. I think, said one to the other, we little know how much we owe to the
                  faithfulness of the Light-keeper. What a post of trial and of danger! What if the
                  man should fail? It is well enough in fine weather when communication with the
                  shore is easy; but in storms it must be terrific.
               It is a post of great honor, returned the other; and our Lord puts none but
                  faithful and tried men as the keepers; indeed, it is only such who know how to
                  tend the lantern, or can be got to engage in such service, though sometimes the
                  Enemy smuggles in by stealth some of his own creatures to play false with the
                  lights. There are places, where, in winter seasons especially, the work is much
                  more hazardous than it ever is here. I knew an old seaman, who held a station like
                  this, in the midst of a great winter's storm, and he told about its perils
                  afterwards, and they were enough to make the soul tremble. He began writing down
                  his account in the very height of the tempest, and put it safely in a bottle,
                  which might get to land in case they perished, for the fury of the seas was so
                  great, that they did not know but each raging, devouring billow would carry away
                  the whole structure.
               When I engaged, said he, to keep this Light-House, little did I think that my
                  heart, which had never, for twenty-five years, in the most boisterous regions,
                  failed me, would tremble at anything here. But there are things, I perceive, still
                  in the back- ground, to shake a stouter
                  heart than mine; and so precarious is our present situation, that there is a
                  prospect that this may never reach you. The ice around us from the frozen spray is
                  so massive, that there is no appearance of our ladder, the sea is now running at
                  least twenty-five feet above the level, and each sea roars like a heavy peal of
                  thunder; the northern part of the foundation is split, and the Light-House shakes
                  at least two feet each way. I feel as sea-sick as ever I did on board a ship.
               Think not that I will ever flinch from my post, though the waves should gain the
                  mastery for which they are so incessantly striving. When I accepted the post, I
                  closed mine ears against the reports of the former keeper, treating them as I now
                  find, too lightly; and here I shall remain, so long as a vestige of the
                  Light-House remains; but the truth must be told. At intervals an appalling
                  stillness prevails, creating an inconceivable dread, each gazing with breathless
                  emotion at one another, but the next moment the deep roar of another roller is
                  heard, seeming as if it would tear up the very rocks beneath, and as it bursts
                  upon us, the Light-House quivering and trembling to its very centre, recovers
                  itself just in time to breast the fury of another and another, as they roll upon
                  us with resistless force.
               Our lantern windows are all iced up outside, an inch thick, although we have a
                  fire continually burning; and it is not without imminent peril that we can climb
                  up outside to scrape it off, which I have done several times already. I have a
                  dread of some ship striking against us, although we have kept the bell constantly
                  ringing all night. Our water is a solid mass of ice in the casks, which we have
                  been obliged to cut in pieces with an ax ere we could obtain any to drink. Our
                  situation is perilous. If anything happens ere day dawns upon us again, we have no
                  hope of escape. But I shall, if it be God's will, die in the performance of my
                  duty.
               Then said John, This is terrible indeed, but duty is always safe. Better so, than
                  shrinking back, or disobeying. God's faithful ones are always prepared for
                  whatever may happen, and how great must be the reward of those who have been thus
                  faithful unto death! The mouth of the fiery furnace looked grim and terrible to
                  the three bold men as they came towards it, nevertheless, they would rather go
                  into it, than disobey God, and meet the fire of God's wrath for their apostacy.
                  Jonah found more difficulty and darkness in the sea and in the whale's belly,29
                   than he could ever have encountered in going to Nineveh. But a man has
                   need of great

                    faith for such stations.
                  He must take his life in his hand, for his work may be finished suddenly.
               Blessed are those servants whom their Lord, when he cometh, shall find
                     watching.30
                   In the Celestial Country there are no Light-Houses to be kept, nor any
                   need of them; no more sea, no more dangers, no more sin.

               CHAPTER XI.
               ALMOST SAVEDâ€”ALMOST LOST.
               NOW as they were sailing swiftly, the man at the mast-head suddenly cried out that
                  they were in shoal water. Then, as they ran to the sides of the ship, they found,
                  to their amazement and distress, that the bottom was as clearly visible as the sea
                  itself. They got out their sounding lines, threw all aback, and lay to, for every
                  instant they expected to strike, but still the ship did not touch, and as it was
                  at least as safe keeping her on their course amidst this great danger, as any
                  other way, for they could not go back, so they proceeded with little sail and much
                  trembling, throwing the lead every few fathoms of the way. This continued all
                  night, and the water was so clear, that they could distinctly see the bottom, even
                  by the light of the moon. Great forests of sponges and marine shrubs were visible
                  at intervals, and the forms of grim and glittering sea-monsters could be seen
                     trail- ing in and out; but the
                  greater part of the bottom was white sand. All night long the melancholy voice of
                  the leads-man, By the deep seven! now shoaler, now deeper, rose like the wail of a
                  prophet of evil, and there was little sleep on board, or closing of the eyes,
                  except in prayer.
               But the day dawned, and the bright and cheerful sun rose up in glory, and the
                  waves danced and sparkled in the favorable breeze, as if the gladness of
                  intelligent life were in them. So the men began to take heart once more, though
                  they kept up all their watchfulness, and glad and thankful they were, when they
                  found themselves again passing into deep water. There was nothing on the surface
                  of the sea to indicate danger, not a ripple, nor a crested wave, that showed signs
                  of breakers, nor any point of land, or island, or rising reef, to intimate that
                  they were anywhere but secure in mid-ocean; and yet, as they looked back, they
                  could not but tremble; the more so, as the sea showed no sign, and yet they knew
                  what they had passed over.
               Now said Peter, as they were trying to find some intimation of these banks on
                  their course in the chart, there are times when a man's hidden corruptions and
                  evil propensities seem to him much more clearly visible than at other times, when
                  it seems as if the ship must strike, as if it were hazardous to move, or attempt
                  to go forward. And yet the danger may be greater, when we seem to be in deeper
                  water. Unseen reefs are worse than visible sandbanks. At intervals we may have
                  greater revelations of what is within us, and a deeper conviction of its being
                  God's power and mercy only, that can carry us onward in safety, even when we are
                  drawing nearer to the Celestial Country, than we ever had at first setting out, or
                  in the earliest dangers of the way.
               If the King's grace is sufficient for us, if we only have water enough to float,
                  the sight of the bottom so near is indeed terrible, but it throws us upon God, and
                  teaches us how the strength of the King is made perfect in our weakness. Paul
                  himself once had to pass over just such shoals as these, and the ship's keel even
                  grated on the bottom, so that he was distressed and terrified; but the King
                  brought him off safe. And who was it that cried out, Oh wretched man that I am!
                  Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?1
                   He was much nearer deliverance, much more likely to be delivered, when he
                  knew his actual condition, and realized it, than if he had mistaken life for
                  death, and felt secure in deep water and fine weather.
               
                  
                  1 Rom. vii. 24.
               
               Then said John, it is never safe to be off one's watch, for who can tell what may
                  be before us? Yet I suppose some may
                  have passed these shoals, and known nothing about them, but slept all the way.
               Yes, said Peter, some slumber through the whole voyage, but where will it end? Let
                  us not sleep as do others, but let us watch and be sober.2
                   Sleepers and breakers often come together. But as to this experience of
                  shoals, I think I said that David also was sometimes near the bottom, so that it
                  was quite plain to him; his soul seemed to be cleaving to the dust, and melting
                  for heaviness, but he cried out for God to lighten him and quicken him.3
                   It is only the tide of Divine Mercy that ever bears us up, and certainly
                  it is more apparent how it bears us up, when we seem to be just grating the
                  bottom, than where no such danger is perceptible.

               Well, said John, We know not only where David was in shoal water, but just where
                  he struck; and it has always seemed very strange to me, that a man who could keep
                  guard so diligently, when he could scarce lift his eyelids for the weight that
                  seemed to be on them, should have run headlong upon a sharp rugged reef, when it
                  was right plain before him.
               It was a wind of nature, said Peter, not of grace, that he was running before, at
                  that time, and he had so much headway that he could not stop. Nay, even after the
                  crash, he was carried clean over the reef, and it was not till the King's
                     Quarter-Master4
                   and Inspector came on board, that he was made to know what he had been
                  doing, and what mortal injuries had been committed. He had to be hauled into the
                  docks for repair, and underwent great suffering.
               
                  
                  4 2 Sam. xii. 7.
               
               Now for some days they ran on quietly, except that the southerly breeze increasing
                  to a gale, drove them further northward than they cared to have set their course.
                  Still they were in such warm latitudes, that the possibility of ice or snow never
                  occurred to them. But one night the air seemed suddenly cold, nor could they
                  account for it, till in the morning they caught sight of a squadron of floating
                  icebergs driven by wind and tide across their way. It was truly a grand spectacle,
                  to behold such pyramids of ice glittering in the clear sun, floating like a city
                  of crystal temples; but there was great danger in it. As they passed very near one
                  of these splendid objects, or rather as it neared them, for it was with great
                  difficulty that they were kept from contact, they conjectured that its immense
                  pinnacle of solid ice must have risen a hundred feet at least from the surface of
                  the water.
               Suddenly they perceived it move with a drunken sidelong lurch, as if some
                  inexplicable power from below had worked at it, and then with a most stupen- dous crash it fell into the sea,
                  disappearing entirely for a moment, when it rose again from the other side, having
                  turned upon its own axis a complete summerset. The sea was raised into a great
                  commotion, and poured in cataracts down the sides of the rising mountain of ice,
                  which was much worn into caverns by the action of the water, and having become
                  lighter than the half above the surface, at length it suddenly plunged, and turned
                  bottom upwards. If it had struck the King's ship in falling, it would most likely
                  have made an end of her. But she passed onward in safety, the men having witnessed
                  a wonder of the deep, that made their minds solemn, and reminded them, besides, of
                  a dangerous passage in their own past experience.
               But they were reminded of another thing that had been told them, namely, how a man
                  might turn, and yet not be changed, but remain the same after his turning as
                  before. Men sometimes, coming into warm latitudes, make a great summerset in
                  religion; worn by currents, or melted by the water being warmer than the air, they
                  turn sheer over, but remain with the same icy cold heart as before. Just such too
                  are the changes that are often made for expediency's sake, disregarding principle.
                  Sometimes you cannot see the causes that operated, and the change comes as
                  suddenly as the upsetting of an iceberg. It is dangerous to be in the wake of such
                  persons, or to place any dependence upon them; for though the top may look firm
                  and grand, the bottom may be all worn hollow; and when they are among the Romans
                  they will do as the Romans do. Currents change them, but no inward, firm, upright
                  heart keeps them.
               Then said Peter, It is no doubt a great mercy that we had come so far into the
                  warm zone, before meeting these ice mountains, for otherwise we might have been
                  crushed in the fields of ice that we should have found floating with them for the
                  space of many leagues in extent.
               I have heard of a ship, driven northward by a gale from the South, and then,
                  though the weather was cold, standing on still further towards the North than the
                  usual track, not remembering the importance of returning as near as might be to
                  her right course, when she made the following encounter:â€”
               It was night, and blowing fresh. The sky was overcast, and there was no moon, so
                  that it was quite obscure upon the sea, though not without glimmerings of light;
                  not total darkness, though darkness was upon the face of the deep.5
                   The man that told me this, happened himself to be in the middle watch that
                  night, from midnight to four o'clock; and he had
                  
                     
                     5 Gen. i. 2.
                   only been on deck about half an hour, when the
                  look-out forward sung out, Ship ahead! Starboard! Hard a starboard! These words
                  made the second mate, who had the watch, jump into the rigging.
               A ship? he exclaimed, An iceberg it is, rather! All hands wear ship! he shouted in
                  a tone which showed there was not a moment to lose.
               The watch sprang to the braces and bowlines, while the rest of the crew tumbled up
                  from below, and the Captain and other officers rushed out of their cabins. The
                  helm was kept up, and the yards swung round, and the ship turned towards the
                  direction from which they had been sailing. The Captain glanced his eye round, and
                  then ordered the courses to be brailed up, and the main topsail to be backed, so
                  as to lay the ship to. The men soon discovered the cause of these manÅ“uvres; for
                  before the ship had quite wore round, they perceived, close by, a towering mass
                  with a refulgent appearance, which the man on the look-out had taken for the white
                  sails of a ship, but which proved in reality to be a vast iceberg; and attached to
                  it, and extending a considerable distance to leeward, was a field, or very
                  extensive floe of ice, against which the ship would have run, had it not been
                  discovered in time, and would, in all probability, instantly have gone down, with
                  every soul on board.
               In consequence of the extreme darkness, it was dangerous to sail either way; for
                  it was impossible to say what other floes, or smaller cakes of ice, might be in
                  the neighborhood, and the ship might probably be on them, before they were seen.
                  They, therefore, remained hove to. As it was, a man unaccustomed to such things
                  could not see the floe, till it was pointed out by one of the crew.
               When daylight broke the next morning, it was easy to see the dangerous position in
                  which the ship was placed. On every side appeared large floes of ice, with several
                  icebergs floating like mountains on a plain among them; while the only opening
                  through which the ship could escape was a narrow passage to the northeast, through
                  which she must have come. What made their position the more perilous was, that the
                  vast masses of ice were approaching nearer and nearer to each other, so that they
                  had not a moment to lose, if they would effect their freedom.
               As the light increased, they saw at the distance of some three miles to the
                  westward, another ship in a far worse predicament than they were, insomuch that
                  she was completely surrounded by ice, though she still floated in a sort of basin.
                  As for themselves, the wind still held to the northward, so they could stand clear
                  out of the passage, if it should remain open long enough. By this time the distant
                     ship had discovered her own perilous
                  condition, as they perceived that she had hoisted a signal of distress, and they
                  heard the guns she was firing to call their attention to her; but alas, they could
                  do nothing to help her, for all they could do was to attend to their own safety,
                  till they had themselves got clear of the ice. It was truly a fearful
                  situation.
               It was very dreadful to watch the stranger, and to feel that they could render her
                  no assistance. All hands were at the braces, ready to trim the sails should the
                  wind head their ship; for in that case they would have to beat out of the channel,
                  which was every instant growing narrower and narrower. The Captain stood at the
                  weather gangway anxiously watching. When he saw the ice closing in, he ordered
                  every stitch of canvas the ship would carry to be set on her, in hopes of carrying
                  her out into the open sea before such a catastrophe. It seemed a very close
                  chance, whether or not they would be hemmed in. Still they were not so entirely
                  absorbed with their own danger, as not to keep an eye on the stranger, with a deep
                  and sympathizing interest in her fate.
               The man that told me this got into the mizen top, that he might see more clearly,
                  and by the aid of a spy-glass could watch everything that occurred. The water on
                  which the stranger floated was nearly smooth, but the space was becoming smaller
                  and smaller, and the surface began to be covered with foam, caused by the whirling
                  and tumbling masses of ice, as they approached each other. There were now but few
                  fathoms of water on each side of her, but as yet she floated unharmed. The peril
                  was exceeding great, but still the direction of the ice might change, and she
                  might possibly yet be free. The man watched narrowly for some hope; but onward
                  came the ice with terrific irresistible force, till he fancied that he could hear
                  the edges grinding and crushing together.
               There was no stop, nor any possibility of resistance; for the stranger was no
                  better prepared against the threatened crash and pressure, than the other vessel,
                  not being built for polar regions, nor having any instruments with which they
                  might ward off, or cut away the masses. At length the ice closed upon the
                  ill-fated ship. At first the man on the watch thought that it lifted her bodily
                  up; but probably it was not so; she was too deep in the water for that. Her sides
                  were crushed in; the stout timbers were rent into a thousand fragments; her tall
                  masts tottered and fell, though still apparently attached to the hull. For a
                  moment, the men gazing concluded that the, ice must again have partially separated
                  by the force of the concussion, leaving open sea-space enough to sink in; for the wrecked mass of hull,
                  spars, and canvas, seemed suddenly drawn downward with irresistible force, and a
                  few fragments, which had been hurled by the force of the concussion to a distance,
                  were all that remained of the hapless vessel. Not a soul of the crew could have
                  had time to escape to the ice.
               Precisely such might have been the fate of the remaining vessel, with all on
                  board; but God mercifully ordered otherwise. The danger was imminent. The passage
                  through which alone they could pass grew narrower and narrower. Some of the parts
                  they had already passed through were even now closed up behind them. The wind
                  mercifully held fair, and although it contributed to drive the ice faster in upon
                  them, still it favored their escape. The ship flew through the water at a great
                  rate, keeling over to her ports, but though at times it seemed as if the masts
                  would go over the sides of the vessel, still the Captain held on. A minute's delay
                  might prove their destruction. Every person held his breath, as the width of the
                  passage decreased, though they had but a very little distance now to make good,
                  before they would be free. Yet their failure by a single ship's length might be
                  their ruin. It was a moment of terrible suspense and anxiety.
               All this while the man kept watching in the mizen top, where he could see the
                  whole danger. At length a shout rose from the deck, and looking round, he saw
                  clearly that they were on the outside of the floe. They had shot through but just
                  in time, for almost the instant after, the ice met, and the whole length of the
                  passage through which they had come was completely closed up. The order was now
                  given to square away the yards, and keep the helm hard up; and so with a flowing
                  sheet they ran down the edge for upwards of three miles before they were clear of
                  it. So in God's mercy they were saved, but nothing to this day was ever heard of
                  the vessel there imprisoned, crushed, and carried to the bottom.
               The Lord save us, exclaimed John, from such dreadful hazards! Truly, this was
                  being saved, yet so as by fire.6
                   Oh how wretched was the condition of the poor creatures whom the ice
                  overtook and buried. And how mysterious are God's dealings! One shall be taken,
                  and the other left.7
                   No man can tell why that lost ship was there, on what errand, or how at
                  first she became involved in such perils. But oh, when God shutteth up, there can
                  be no opening; when God breaketh down, it cannot be built again.8
                   When we see such hazards in the deep, and then think how heedless most men
                  are upon the voyage of life, it seems a wonder that ever any get into port.

               They never do, said Peter, except by the pure, unmerited, sovereign grace of God
                  in Christ Jesus. But it is strange to see how far some go towards heaven, and yet
                  never enter, and also how far some go towards hell and yet are plucked back as
                  brands from the burning. But God warneth us, as ofttimes we have heard, that we
                  are made partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence
                  steadfast unto the end.9
                   We may go a great way, and yet turn at length from the right way for ever.
                  There is no safety but in Christ, and none in him, but by keeping close to his
                  Word, for so he saves us.
               
                  
                  9 Heb. iii. 14.
               
               Then said John, there be some who sin with great daring, and venture with
                  headstrong wilfulness into dangers of which they have been forewarned. It may be
                  that the lost ship had been running on such a career. For if we sin wilfully after
                  that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more
                  sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and of fiery
                  indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.10
                   But the other ship was saved, for that time, though we know not what
                  followed. The King saith, Of some have compassion, making a difference; but others
                  save with fear.11

               Then said Peter, To come so near to destruction at any time is a fearful thing.
                  The good navigator giveth all diligence to make his calling and election sure,12
                   lest by any means he be a cast-away.13
                   To have but a ship's length in time and space, and heaven or hell hanging
                  upon it! Who would be willing to be thrown into such peril? Yet many of their own
                  accord run into it. But there is a last time, and a limit beyond which they can
                  never go, and return. There is a last degree to God's forbearance; there is a last
                  call, a last opportunity, a last hour of hope. There is a fixed line that marks
                  the boundary of mercy, and the confines of despair. When the soul crosses that
                  line, sometimes the ice closes on it like the jaws of Behemoth, and the deep
                  swallows it up. But sometimes it may still seem to be making profitable voyages,
                  and the end is not yet. There was once found in the log-book of an unknown mariner
                  (I say unknown, for I never yet heard of his name, though he must have seen great
                  dangers, and he had a knowledge of some terrible truths), the following lines
                  concerning the unseen line, of which I have spoken. 
                     
                        There is a time we know not when,
                        A point we know not where,
                        That marks the destiny of men
                        To glory or despair.
                     
                     
                     
                        There is a line, by us unseen,
                        That crosses every path;
                        The hidden boundary between
                        God's patience and his wrath.
                     
                     
                        To pass that limit is to die,
                        To die as if by stealth;
                        It does not quench the beaming eye,
                        Nor pale the glow of health.
                     
                     
                        The conscience may be still at ease,
                        The spirits light and gay,
                        That which is pleasing, still may please,
                        And care be thrust away.
                     
                     
                        But on that forehead God hath set
                        Indelibly a mark,
                        Unseen by man, for man as yet
                        Is blind, and in the dark.
                     
                     
                        And yet, the doomed one's path below
                        Like Eden may have bloomed;
                        He did not, does not, will not know,
                        Nor feel that he is doomed.
                     
                     
                        He knows, he feels, that all is well,
                        And every fear is calmed;
                        He lives, he dies; he wakes in hell,
                        Not only doomed, but damned.
                     
                     
                        O, where is that mysterious bourne,
                        By which our path is crossed?
                        Beyond which God himself hath sworn
                        That he who goes is lost?
                     
                     
                        How far may we go on in sin?
                        How long will God forbear?
                        Where does hope end, and where begin
                        The confines of despair?
                     
                     
                        An answer from the skies is sent;
                        Ye who from God depart,
                        While it is called to-day repent,
                        And harden not your heart.

               It so happened, as if to give demonstration of these truths, that just at the time
                  when Peter was repeating these lines, they passed a dangerous place in the ocean
                  called Dead Man's Key, which place, though it lay so far onwards towards the
                  confines of the Celestial Country, was nevertheless noted for some very terrible
                  shipwrecks. It was not far from a group of Islands, on one of which a high
                  mountain lifted itself into the skies, where, at sunset, it shone like a new
                  lighted star, and in the morning caught the earliest rays of the sun, and blazed
                  in them like a dome or pinnacle of the Celestial City. It was said that some
                  Pilgrims of old time had climbed that mountain, and gained from the top a very
                  clear view into the Celestial Country, by means of a telescope which they took
                  with them. But of late, nothing of this kind had been accomplished, and the
                  Islands themselves had very much degenerated from their former character, for they
                  were once in much com- munion with the
                  Celestial Country, whereas at present there was little or no traffic that way.
               There was a famous Harbor there, formerly called Humility, having a most safe and
                  delightful anchorage; bnt the great prosperity of the people in the City on its
                  borders, vastly increasing the price of land, they had encroached upon the harbor
                  very injuriously by made land. A great quantity of drainage from the city had also
                  collected in it, together with banks of mud brought down into it by a river from
                  the interior, and neglected by the people till great shoals were formed; so that
                  in truth the harbor was nearly as much changed as its name, which now was called,
                  after the character of the people, Worldly-Conformity. Peter and John, not being
                  aware of this great change, and marking their course by the King's Chart, steered
                  for this harbor as a pleasant and safe resting and watering place for a
                  season.
               But they were yet a good way off from it, and had seen nothing of the Islands but
                  the peak of the mountain aforesaid. The wind was somewhat variable, and the
                  progress of the ship, though pleasant, was not so swift as it had been.
                  Nevertheless, the sailing there, in such fine weather, was so delightful, that one
                  might almost be tempted to wish it would never cease. It brought to mind the
                  description they had somewhere seen of a young sailor passing that voyage under
                  like circumstances. The night, he said, was magnificent, and he remained on deck a
                  long time, enjoying its beauties, and gazing on the high land of the Island, which
                  reared itself far above the ocean to the South. The wind was very light, the sea
                  gently ruffled, and their good barque glided slowly along beneath the silver rays
                  of a beautiful moon, illumining their path over the mighty waters, and bringing
                  out in solemn, majestic relief, against the horizon, the elevated Island they were
                  passing. There was something, he said, in the perfect stillness of the night, and
                  in the whole scene around us, that seemed to command our inmost souls to a solemn
                  holy silence before the Almighty Architect of the Universe; the Being whose works
                  by night so emphatically declare his glory, who himself seemed presently saying,
                  Be still, and know that I am God.14

               CHAPTER XII.
               THE HARBOR OF WORLDLY CONFORMITYâ€”AND WHAT HAPPENED THERE.
               WHEN they ran into the Harbor and dropped anchor, which they did without any
                  mishap, they were surprised at the gay and brilliant look of everything about
                  them. The very vessels at the docks looked all as new as if they had been just
                  launched, and had never seen the open ocean; and to say the truth, of a long time
                  most of them had not, but had remained idle till the dry rot had got into all
                  their timbers. By dint of a curious paint of great strength and color, all
                  symptoms of rottenness were concealed, and the hulks held together; and the
                  inhabitants of the place had an agreement among themselves to sustain each other
                  in this cheat, all things among them being in like manner gilded and
                  superficial.
               As for the King's own ship, it may well be sup posed that by this time she looked
                  black and weather-beaten. There, was, indeed a curious contrast between her weary,
                  way-worn look, and old-fashioned rig, and the showy vessels in the harbor. The
                  truth was, there was another extensive port on the other side of the Island, with
                  commercial relations running to all parts of the globe, and a double railroad
                  direct from that to this city, so that this harbor, being on the side towards the
                  Celestial Country, was of late years almost disused, except for State occasions,
                  and it was a thing extremely rare to have an arrival in that direction. The men of
                  the Harbor proposed to Peter and John to have their own ship newly coppered and
                  painted, but they refused, saying that they had no time for any changes which were
                  not needful, and that they were only anxious to be forwarded on their voyage.
               When they went on shore, they left the Ship in charge of Contrition and Sincere,
                  with orders to be employed as speedily as possible in laying in what supplies were
                  necessary. When their gig touched the landing, it was proposed to them at once
                  that they should be rigged out in a new dress, and meet the Mayor of the City, who
                  would be glad to do honor to the King's Flag; but they felt bewildered by the
                  strange, suspicious appearance of things around them, and were not willing to
                  spend the time requi- site for this
                  ceremony, besides that they found it was to be attended with a feast, involving an
                  expense of money as well as time, in which they would not feel justified.
               They determined to remain no longer than they could help, for the place seemed not
                  at all like the last Harbor belonging to the King, in which they had rested. But
                  it came to pass, as they went up and down the streets, that their spirit was
                  stirred within them as they beheld the manners of the people, and especially some
                  great enormities in the sale of two notable articles in the commerce of the place,
                  Rum and Opium. They were so roused, that they could not help speaking boldly
                  against these things, and in a short time they had a great crowd collected
                  together to hear them. They said they were astonished at the sale of these things
                  in any place that had been under the King's dominion. They affirmed that the
                  traffic would bring upon them utter misery; that though it might seem profitable
                  for a time, yet it was really neither more nor less than the slow murder of men's
                  souls and bodies. They said it was clean contrary to the laws of the King, and
                  that the people might almost as well set up for a liberty to deal in hell-fire, as
                  a freedom to pursue such sinful and ruinous practices.
               There was evidently a great awakening of con- science under these speeches, for
                  their hearts were full and earnest, and the multitude could not resist the wisdom
                  and spirit with which they spake.1
                   Nevertheless, some of the principal dealers, being exceedingly enraged at
                  having their profitable business interfered with, took unto themselves certain
                  lewd fellows of the baser sort,2
                   and having got a marshal with them (for the law of the place favored
                  them), they made an address to the people, among whom were many workmen of like
                  occupation with themselves, to whom they said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we
                  have our wealth,3
                   and furthermore the whole riches of our Island are greatly increased by it
                  and dependent upon it, so that the words of these new-comers are not only
                  seditious and treasonable, as being to the reproach of the law of the land, which
                  is supreme, but also greatly to our detriment, and contrary to every man's own
                  personal interests.
               
                  
                  1 Acts vi. 10.
               
               
                  
                  2 Acts xvii. 5.
               
               
                  
                  3 Acts xix. 25
               
               Thus they worked upon the passions of the people, till the whole town was filled
                  with confusion; and while the baser fellows threw dirt into the air, and some
                  cried one thing, and some another, they seized upon Peter and John, and put them
                  in Bocardo (which was the name of their prison) as disturbers of the
                  peace, and also as guilty of treason for speaking against the laws of the
                  Island.
               
               The next day they had them before the high Court of the place, with a jury
                  summoned, and deputies to implead against them; and there stood up to convict them
                  a great man in those parts, whose opinion was wonderfully regarded on all matters
                  touching commerce and the laws of the realm. The great merchants of the town of
                  Worldly Conformity, and also of the grand port on the other side of the Island,
                  made up a large sum for this man, that he might plead their cause valiantly, and
                  put his whole heart in it; and indeed it seemed to delight him, for he went at it
                  with great speech, alacrity, and energy.
               He said that the doctrines of these men were disorganizing and treasonable, that
                  they were opposing a law of the land, which law was supreme, and being once
                  passed, must and should be obeyed, and being for the high interest and union of
                  both sides of the Island, it should not be spoken against, nor was such a thing to
                  be once thought of as that it should ever be altered or repealed. He said that the
                  law was perfectly constitutional, and that under it the people of every city were
                  bound to protect the dealers in Rum and Opium from all infringement upon and
                  injury against their business. He said that this was law, the law of the land, and
                  that those who went against it under pretence of what they called the King's law,
                  were miserable fanatics. He then in- sisted, with great and strong words, on the
                  unconstitutionality, and illegality, and inadmissibility of private men setting up
                  their notions above the law of the land, under the pretended idea of the higher
                  law, that exists somewhere between us and the third heavens, he never knew exactly
                  where.
               This seemed greatly to tickle and delight the sense of the assembly, and the
                  orator was quite interrupted in his plea by the applause of the Court and
                  bystanders; for, poor creatures, they were nearly all under the same blinding
                  delusions that had for years prevailed in the place; but as soon as order was
                  restored, he went on again, although there was one man who gave some disturbance
                  by crying out every now and then, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.4
                  
               
               
                  
                  4 Acts xix. 28.
               
               As he went on, he said that all judicial opinions were in favor of the law of the
                  land in this case, and that no man in the Island, whose income was worth thirty
                  pounds a year, would stake his professional reputation against it. He said that
                  therefore the opposing of this law of the land was treason; and here he looked as
                  black as a thunder-cloud upon the prisoners, and stamped his feet to give the
                  greater weight to his reasonings; whereupon, being a big man and heavy, as well as
                  vastly eloquent, the Court room shook, and there was a great sensation.
               
               He then proceeded to ridicule the conscientious scruples of Peter and John, and of
                  any who might be so far gone in their wits as to think as they did, and he made
                  the Court laugh at the idea of such scrupulous consciences. He said they were the
                  men above ordinance, who walked about like the man in the play, prim and spruce,
                  self-satisfied, and thankful to God that they were not as other men, but had
                  attained so far to salvation as to be above ordinances. That, he said, was their
                  higher law. At this there was great laughter.
               Nevertheless, the man in his plea did not attempt to deny the immorality of the
                  traffic, but stood for its legality, putting law above conscience. He said that
                  the prisoners at the bar had with unparalleled effrontery accused the makers and
                  upholders of the law, and those who pursued that traffic according to it, of
                  setting up profit against conscience; setting up the means of living, while they
                  ought to go for conscience. But he said that this going for conscience was just a
                  flight of fanaticism, and the people of that worthy city must beware of any such
                  teachings; for as long as there was a law of the land, and they became men of
                  substance under it, in all their labors no iniquity could be found that was
                     sin,5
                   no iniquity that was what the lawyers called malum
                     in se. To put con- science against profit in such a case was a mere
                  flight of fancy. If what we propose, said he, is right, fair, and stands well with
                  a conscience not enlightened with those high flights of fancy, it is none the
                  worse for being profitable; the matter of being profitable, he insisted, could not
                  make a thing bad which is good in itself, if you and I, said he, can live on it,
                  and our children can be supported and educated by it.
               
                  
                  5 Hosea xii. 8.
               
               All this, and much more, he argued in the case, though it was worthy of note that
                  he did not anywhere say that the traffic, which Peter and John had spoken against,
                  was a good thing in itself. He stuck mainly to the argument that the law of the
                  land was to be obeyed at all hazards, and must govern conscience, and that all
                  agitation against it was treasonable, and must be put down. He said, moreover,
                  that religion probably was a good thing in the main, but in politics it only made
                  men mad.
               Now the words of this great man had great weight with the whole Court and Jury,
                  and when he had finished, the case looked black against Peter and John, and there
                  seemed to be but little hope for them. Nevertheless, they were not in the least
                  degree daunted, but having gotten permission to speak for themselves, rejoiced
                  exceedingly in such an opportunity to declare the truth. Accordingly, Peter stood
                  forward first, and said that he spoke for the King, and in behalf of the King's laws, which alone were
                  supreme, and against which some of the statutes of late years passed in these
                  Islands were in manifest opposition. He said that he would not undertake to argue
                  the case anywhere but out of the King's own statute-book, and that if this
                  honorable Court did not know exactly where that higher law existed, by which all
                  human consciences were bound, they were not fit to sit as judges in any cause
                  involving any principles of morality whatever.
               If they did not know, then it must be, said he, because that is come upon them
                  foretold in the statutes of the King, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with
                  their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far
                  from me, and their fear towards me is taught by the precept of men, therefore,
                  behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a
                  marvellous work, and a wonder; for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and
                  the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.6
                  
               
               
                  
                  6 Isa. xxix. 13, 14.
               
               Also, he said, that the earth is defiled under the inhabitants thereof, because
                  they have transgressed the laws of the King, changed the ordinance, broken the
                  everlasting covenant.7
                  
               
               
                  
                  7 Isa. xxiv. 5.
               
               None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth; they trust in vanity, and
                  speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity. They hatch
                  cockatrices' eggs, and weave the spider's web; he that eateth of their eggs dieth,
                  and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper. The way of peace they know
                  not, and there is no judgment in their goings; they have made them crooked paths;
                  whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace. So truth is fallen in the street,
                  and equity cannot enter.8
                  
               
               
                  
                  8 
                     Isa. lix. 4, 5, 8, 14.
               
               To the law and to the testimony, said Peter, for if your judges speak not
                  according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.9
                   Then he made it clearly to appear that the Statutes of the King speak
                  plainly against unrighteous laws, as having no righteous authority. He repeated in
                  their hearing the King's Statute on this point, Wo unto them that decree
                  unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness which they have prescribed.10
                   Also, Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which
                  frameth mischief by a law?11
                   But there was no need, he said, of any argument on such a point; it could
                  be only time-servers and men-pleasers who would ever undertake to excuse men's
                  wickedness by human law, or to justify the wicked for reward, and God will be a
                  swift witness against such men.
                  
                     
                     9 Isa. viii. 20.
                  
                  
                     
                     10 Isa. x.1.
                  
                  
                     
                     11 Psa. xciv. 20.
                  
                  
                  Moreover he said that it was an incontrovertible principle, clearly laid down,
                  that WHENEVER HUMAN COMMANDS RUN COUNTER TO THE DIVINE COMMANDS, THEY CEASE TO BE
                  OBLIGATORY; AND NO MAN CAN AID IN THE EXECUTION OR SUPPORT OF SUCH COUNTER
                  COMMANDS, WITHOUT AIMING VIOLENCE AT THE AUTHORITY OF HEAVEN.
               In the matter of the charge against them, he said he would detain their honors
                  only so far as to read the King's Statutes on the point. Wo unto him that coveteth
                  an evil covetousness to his house! For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and
                  the beam out of the timber shall answer it. Wo to him that buildeth a town with
                  blood, and establisheth a city by iniquity! Wo unto him that giveth his neighbor
                  drink, that puttest thy bottle to him, and makest him drunken!12
                  
               
               
                  
                  12 Hab ii. 9, 11, 12, 15.
               
               He also quoted a more recent statute. That no covetous men, nor drunkards, nor
                  extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.13
                   He then demonstrated that the traffic in Rum and Opium, though it might be
                  for the seeming temporary interest of the City of Worldly Conformity, was just
                  nothing else than the work of making drunkards, and that by the Statutes of the
                  King it was in every respect illegal, inhuman, and unjust.
               
                  
                  13 1 Cor. vi. 10.
               
               Furthermore, said Peter, all your talk about peace and union is but a covering of
                  sin. For what ought to be the object of a union of these Islands, or of these
                  great cities, save only the protection of every man's liberties, the redemption of
                  every man from sin, bondage, and misery, and the establishment of every household
                  in favor with God and man? But if your union be founded on any bargain with the
                  King's Wicked Adversary, and kept up only by that, then it is accursed of God, and
                  cannot prosper. If it were the support and protection of slavery that this union
                  were pledged for, then you and the whole world would cry out shame; or if it were
                  a traffic in slaves that your pretended articles of partnership bound you to
                  support, then also the curse of God would be upon it. But is it a less monstrous
                  defiance of God and his righteousness to pretend that your union depends on the
                  infernal traffic in Rum and Opium, and, therefore, that the said traffic, being
                  legalized, and becoming a great matter of state policy, ought to be sustained?
               You dare to call it a flight of fancy, when we arraign you, and all your pursuits,
                  and your laws also, and your political expediencies, at the bar of God's law for
                  judgment. It is a greater piece of fanaticism, and flight of fancy by far, for you
                  to dream that you can throw dust in the eyes of God and man by your pretended profit and law as the
                  guide of conscience. The fanatics in this case are those who worship Dagon, and
                  affront the very presence of God, and the sanctity of his law, with the demand of
                  a protection for their profitable idolatry. What are all your Islands, and all the
                  commerce of them, in comparison with Freedom, Truth, and Righteousness? They had
                  better every one of them go to the bottom, than be upheld at the cost of man's
                  guilt and misery, and God's violated law.
               And let me tell the honorable and learned Counsel, that as to law in the case,
                  Caiaphas and Pilate argued in the same way as he has done, when they condemned the
                  Holy and Just to be crucified. They said in that case also that there was a law of
                  the land, perfectly plain and constitutional, and not to be spoken against nor
                  repealed, and by that law he ought to die.14
                   They argued also that it was far better that one such man should die, than
                  that their whole hierarchical union, and the very perpetuity of the state, should
                  be endangered. And they said, that those who thought or spoke on the contrary side
                  were miserable misguided fools, who could not conquer their prejudices, and knew
                  nothing at all concerning the matter. But they are the fools in this present case,
                  said Peter, who set man's law above God's, and who make mock at a religious
                  conscience; they are the men in the play, above ordinance, who imagine a vain
                  thing, and set themselves to take counsel together against the Lord, and against
                  his Anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords
                  from us. He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh; the Lord shall have them in
                     derision.15
                  
               
               
                  
                  14 John xix. 7.
               
               
                  
                  15 Psa. ii. 1-5,
               
               After this, Peter closed his speech with a strong and terrible passage from the
                  King's Law-book, at which the faces of the people turned pale, and even the Court
                  trembled. Wo unto them that call evil good and good evil, that put darkness for
                  light, and light for darkness, that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! Wo
                  unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong
                  drink! Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the
                  righteous from him! Therefore, as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame
                  consumeth the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall
                  go up as dust, because they have cast away the law of the Lord of Hosts, and
                  despised the Word of the Holy One of Israel.16
                  
               
               
                  
                  16 Isa. v, 20, 22, 23, 24.
               
               Then John arose and spake briefly, and said that he should add but little to the
                  argument of his brother, for that it
                  was so plain a case, that he felt ashamed to argue it in any place lying within
                  the King's dominions, and professing the worship of the true God; so plain a case,
                  as they all knew, that we must always obey God rather than men.17
                   He would only remind their Honors that for disobeying the unrighteous laws
                  of Nebuchadnezzar, the names of Daniel and the three Hebrews were had in
                  everlasting remembrance, while those men who helped to execute those laws were
                  themselves devoured in the burning fiery furnace.18
                   He would add what their Honors well knew, that the Slave-trade itself was
                  once supported by law, and that in some countries on the globe there was still so
                  much wickedness practised under statute, that even slavery was protected by law, a
                  thing which all the inhabitants of the Islands admitted to be a sin, and that so
                  clearly, that the law could not make it otherwise. He prayed them only to judge of
                  this traffic by the same principles on which they proclaimed the iniquity of
                  slavery, and he had no fear whatever but they would condemn it.
               
                  
                  17 Acts v. 29.
               
               
                  
                  18 Dan. iii. 22.
               
               Now these speeches, together with the heavenly deportment of Peter and John,
                  produced no small effect upon the people, and made many among them wish that they
                  had had nothing ever to do with this business, and others there were, who resolved
                  to give it up instantly. But the Court had taken care to have a packed Jury, and
                  thought they had made sure, in regard to a great majority of them, that they were
                  not addicted to any flights of fancy about any higher law than that of profit and
                  the land. They, therefore, felt secure, and the Judge proceeded to give them their
                  charge.
               He charged them to hold close to their minds two considerations, the law, and the
                  profit. He thanked the learned and honorable counsel for the important principle
                  so powerfully and clearly laid down, that a business good in itself was not any
                  the worse for being profitable. He said that he did not need to add anything to
                  the cautions they had received against listening to conscience against profit; he
                  was perfectly persuaded that in this enlightened city there was no danger of
                  that.
               He said that as to the evil of the traffic, it was clear that it would be pursued
                  by some, and that if they did not pursue it, it would be worse pursued by others;
                  whereas, if they kept up this traffic, they could do much to regulate the evil of
                  it, and might, in time, bring it to an end. On a general consideration of
                  benevolence, therefore, and their obligation to do all the good in their power, he
                  thought the business ought to be sustained, or at any rate that good men ought not to be denounced for
                  sustaining it. He said also, that being a partnership from an early date in the
                  Islands, and some of them having entered into it on the faith of that article in
                  the agreement protecting them in the said traffic, none in the community could be
                  considered at liberty to disavow or withdraw from that article, but according to
                  their compact were bound to sustain it. The very existence of their Union wonld be
                  perilled by any attack against this law.
               On a general review of the authorities, the Judge said that they fully maintained
                  the point stated, that though a thing be contrary to natural right, to the
                  principles of justice, humanity, and sound policy, yet, if any city or State see
                  fit to establish such thing, and continue it by law, then we are not at liberty to
                  hold that unlawful, and wrong, which the legislative power of the place hath
                  pronounced lawful. As to the claims of conscience in such a case, and the question
                  whether God's law or man's were to be obeyed, he would say, Obey both, and make no
                  trouble about it. When there was power to enforce the law, and the community chose
                  to pass it, then the will of the majority ought to be the settled conscience of
                  every individual. But he trusted it was not necessary to enlarge upon this; they
                  must remember that they were citizens of no mean city, even the town of Worldly
                  Conformity, and would conduct themselves accordingly.
               When the Judge had thus delivered his charge, he let the case go to the Jury, with
                  a demand that they should bring in a summary verdict.
               Now it happened, as the righteous providence of the Lord would have it, that one
                  was drawn upon the Jury, an old man named Weep-in-Secret, who had been a humble
                  unnoticed inhabitant of the place, and another man, a kinsman of the same, named
                  Judge-Righteous-Judgment. These men had grieved and groaned a long time over the
                  growing pride and declining piety of the place, and the worldliness and wickedness
                  of the inhabitants. It might be said of them that rivers of water ran down their
                  eyes, because the law of the Great King was so little regarded.19
                  
               
               
                  
                  19 Psa. cxix. 136.
               
               Being quiet melancholy men, they had not been challenged on the Jury, and so with
                  some others, escaped being set aside on account of their opinions, which the Judge
                  never suspected. These men had taken a keen and lively interest in the trial, and
                  when the Jury went out, could repeat by heart every argument that Peter and John
                  had used, and every part of their speeches, with the meaning of them. So what did
                  they do, but set themselves to work
                  upon the hearts and consciences of the other jurymen, which they did also with
                  much earnest silent prayer, after the example of Nehemiah, when he answered
                     Artaxerxes,20
                   for they felt that the honor of the King was much concerned in this
                   matter.
               
                  
                  20 Neh. ii. 4.
               
               And it was wonderful to see what success attended their efforts, for they so
                  wrought upon the minds of the jurors, that at length they brought them to be quite
                  convinced that it would be a great sin to condemn Peter and John, who owed no
                  allegiance to the laws of the place, and had only be faithful to their Lord and
                  Master. Also there was no great difficulty in proving the ungodliness of the
                  traffic, the more because some of the jury-men had children rolling in the gutter
                  because of intemperance, and that could not be reclaimed, because everywhere the
                  bottle was put to them to make them drunken. So they were all brought to such a
                  state, that at length their resolution was made up, and they set Mr.
                  Weep-in-Secret as Foreman, who, when the verdict was demanded, stood up, and gave
                  it forth in this form; GUILTY OF OBEYING GOD'S LAWS RATHER THAN MAN'S, WHICH THEY
                  OUGHT TO DO.
               When these words were uttered, the Judge stared at the man for a moment, as one
                  astonished, or who did not quite understand the meaning; then he became red in the
                  face, as if he had been insulted, and he angrily told the Jury to go out again,
                  and bring in a proper verdict, or they should be broken for contempt of Court. So
                  they went out again, and concluded; and when the question was put, What say you,
                  Mr. Foreman, guilty or not guilty, the Foreman spoke up in a loud clear voice, NOT
                  GUILTY.
               Now this was a dreadful blow to the Court, and altogether unexpected, but there
                  was no help for it; they had to discharge the prisoners, for they could find
                  neither cause nor quibble whereby they might detain them. Moreover, the
                  consciences of more than half the people that had witnessed the trial went in
                  favor of Peter and John; and indeed the whole thing had been brought about by the
                  King to help on a reformation among them, and it could now be much easier for any
                  man to oppose the traffic in Rum and Opium, which some would gladly have done
                  before, but that they had stood so much in fear of being proscribed and ruined for
                  their politics.
               As for Peter and John, they were exceedingly overjoyed, and thanked God in their
                  hearts. But they went quietly and gravely out of Court, all the people gazing at
                  them with a kind of awe and sympathy, that kept them from being molested. But they
                  had had enough of the town of Worldly Conformity, and as they had no instructions
                  from the King to detain their ship in
                  that harbor, they would not abide there another night, though old Mr.
                  WEEP-IN-SECRET entreated them so to do, telling them that bad as things looked,
                  there were a few godly souls that would be glad to meet them. However, Peter and
                  John said they could by no means be detained, for they felt anxious concerning the
                  ship and the harbor, remembering what had happened to them even in the King's
                  Islands of Peace. So they commended their friends to the care of the King, and
                  bade them farewell, and good Mr. WEEP-IN-SECRET accompanied them the nearest way,
                  past Time-serving Row, down to the vessel. Their ship had been warped by the men
                  up to the docks, to take in some provisions, and they were glad when they found
                  themselves again walking the dear old deck in security.
               But they were destined not to get under weigh again, without some little trouble.
                  For the men, instead of anchoring, had merely moored the ship to the bulwarks of
                  another vessel for convenience, not knowing but that it was staunch enough for a
                  friendly grip upon them; and now, in casting off, by a sudden strain and wrench,
                  before the Cable was thrown loose, the bitts broke away, taking the rotten
                  timbers, and planking of the deck, along with it, almost to the water's edge, just
                  as if the vessel had been made of dry ginger-bread. The men at first were very
                  much alarmed, seeing what had happened, but as soon as they saw that the vessel
                  would fall to pieces almost at a touch, and had only lain there painted up for a
                  show, they could not help laughing heartily; and asking the Harbor-Master to send
                  in his bill for damages, they enquired what he would take for a fleet of such
                  vessels. They said they could mend the broken ship, but they had neither paint nor
                  sawdust, and she would not endure spars of sound doctrine. They asked if all their
                  shipping was of such material, and enquired how long it was since Hymeneus and
                  Philetus had given them the canker?21

               Then said Peter, Let them alone. Every man's work shall be made manifest, for the
                  day shall declare it.22
                   The calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces; for they have sown the
                  wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind; it hath no stalk; the bud shall yield no
                     meal.23
                   It shall be as when a hungry man dreameth, and behold he eateth, but he
                  awaketh, and his soul is empty.24
                   In them is fulfilled the prophecy, Their root shall be as rottenness, and
                  their blossom shall go up as dust.25

               There being no wind to carry them out of the Harbor, they were now compelled, as
                  soon as they got clear, to put all
                  hands in the boats, with sweeps, so that the work of getting away from that place
                  was some of the hardest they had had in all their experience. Nevertheless, they
                  were so glad to be moving, that they broke forth of their own accord, in an old
                  song, whereat Peter and John were greatly delighted, and joined with them; and the
                  melody was so new and strange to the people on shore, and it was so surprising a
                  sight to see a vessel clearing the Harbor in that style, that they crowded down to
                  the docks, and ran aboard their old painted ships to listen. The song they sang
                  ran as follows:â€” 
                     
                        O when shall I see Jesus,
                        And reign with him above?
                        And from that flowing fountain
                        Drink everlasting love?
                        When shall I be delivered
                        From this vain world of sin,
                        And with my Blessed Jesus
                        Drink endless pleasures in?
                     
                     
                        But now I am a sailor,
                        My Captain's gone before;
                        He's given me my orders
                        And bid me not give o'er.
                        His faithful word is promised
                        A righteous crown to give,
                        And all his valiant seamen
                        Eternal life shall have.
                     
                     
                        Through grace I am determined
                        To conquer, though I die;
                        And then away to Jesus,
                        On wings of love to fly.
                        Farewell to sin and sorrow,
                        I bid you all adieu,
                        And O my friends prove faithful,
                        And on your way pursue.
                     
                     
                        And if you meet with troubles
                        And trials on your way,
                        Then cast your cares on Jesus
                        And don't forget to pray.
                        Gird on the heavenly armor
                        Of faith, and hope, and love;
                        Then when the combat's ended
                        He'll carry you above.
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIII.
               THE EFFECTUAL CALLING.
               WHEN they had once got clear of the Harbor, they found that whereas it had been
                  almost a dead calm within, there was a fresh breeze blowing without, rendering
                  boats and oars superfluous. So the men gladly returned to the ship, and all sail
                  was again set for the Celestial Country.
               Now did Peter and John busy themselves with running up in their log-books some
                  account of what they had gone through on land; and comparing notes as to the
                  strange things that had happened, Peter said that for his part, if he did not know
                  better, he might have thought they had fallen upon the very Island laid down in
                  the King's Chart, as inhabited by those who taught things which they ought not,
                  for filthy lucre's sake, of whom it was said The Cretians are always liars, evil
                  beasts, slow bellies.1
                  
               
               
                  
                  1 Tit. i. 12.
               
               JOHN.â€”They pretended a great regard for law, but it was on purpose to trample upon
                  equity and righteousness. They are well known hypocrites, for the very same law
                  that they professed to hold so sacred, as to be of power to bind the conscience,
                  even in spite of God's law, they did not scruple to laugh at and defy, in
                  smuggling their own rum and opium. Yet these are the men who made such fierce
                  proclamation of rendering unto CÃ¦sar the things that be CÃ¦sar's.2
                  
               
               
                  
                  2 Matt. xxii. 21.
               
               PETER.â€”Do you imagine they have any conscience at all in the matter?
               JOHN.â€”They may, but if they have, it is only as the Cretians had, of whom Paul
                  said that their very mind and conscience is defiled.3
                   But what is conscience good for in such a case? Only to make the worse
                   appear the better reason. Despising God's Word, there is no light in them.
               
                  
                  3 Tit. i. 15.
               
               PETER.â€”Well, truly, a man can no more set his conscience right, without God's law,
                  than one at sea can keep the true time without the sun; night and day, summer and
                  winter, would soon get mixt and confounded together.
               JOHN.â€”No, neither can the conscience any more be a reliable guide without the Word
                  of God to instruct it, than the compass can set a ship's course without the needle. Indeed, it is no compass at
                  all without the needle. It would make the ship go round and round as in a
                  whirlpool.
               PETER.â€”These are Corban-men,4
                   such as Christ hated. Has there ever been any kind of wickedness on earth
                  that has not been sanctified by law? And, truly, if human law could make a thing
                  right, there is no form of sin under the whole heaven that might not be
                  consecrated. Yea, verily, the Hebrew midwives were bound to have killed all the
                  Hebrew children as soon as they were born, and the three men ought to have bowed
                  down to Nebuchadnezzar's image as soon as it was set up, and Daniel himself ought
                  not to have made any prayer to any god or man save the mad king, for thirty
                  days.
               
                  
                  4 Mark vii. 11.
               
               JOHN.â€”I have heard people say, in a hurrah for an unjust war, Our country, right
                  or wrong! Go it blind! Now that ignorant Pagans, who never heard of God's Word,
                  and of the Christian religion, should be ready to go it blind, would not be any
                  wise astonishing. But that a Judge in a Christian land should teach such a
                  doctrine is indeed amazing. God is not in all his thoughts, and he would make
                  atheists of all the people, when he tells them they are to recognize no law of
                  higher social obligation than the constitu- tion of their country, and the laws
                  made in pursuance of it.
               PETER.â€”This is the ready way to sanction and perpetuate all wickedness. The man
                  who says this, would bow down to Moloch in a land where Moloch's worship is part
                  of the constitution and laws of the country. The man who teaches this must be a
                  lineal descendant from Cain, who was of that Wicked One, and slew his brother; for
                  this teaching would slay its ten thousands, while common wickedness would only
                  take its thousands; and, indeed, a country must be in danger of being abandoned by
                  God, when its judges utter such atheistic and monstrous principles.
               JOHN.â€”Well, there is no knowing to what lengths Satan may carry a man if God once
                  gives him over into his power. He will go it blind, then, with a vengeance; and,
                  indeed, it is the devil's own blindness when men can be got to believe that human
                  law takes the place of God's, and is supreme over the conscience. Methinks a
                  people that can be tricked in that way will not long keep their liberties in any
                  thing. It is next door to bowing down to stocks and stones. He feedeth on ashes; a
                  deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say Is
                  there not a lie in my right hand?5
                  
               
               
                  
                  5 Is. xliv. 20.
               
               
               PETER.â€”It makes me think likewise of the word of the prophet, that the vile person
                  will speak villainy, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and
                  to utter error against the Lord; to make empty the soul of the hungry.6
                   But God says, Thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked, therefore,
                  judgment and justice shall take hold on thee.7
                   Do you imagine that those who thus handle the Word of God deceitfully, and
                  make the law of God of none effect, can escape the damnation of hell? They are
                  kinsfolk to the hypocrites and generation of vipers, whom the Lord condemned to
                  fill up the measure of their iniquities,8
                   and who were endured only as vessels of wrath fitted for destruction.9
                  
               
               
                  
                  6 Is. xxxii. 6.

                  9 Rom. ix. 22.
               
               At this time the watch reported a sail to the North, and looking with the glass,
                  they judged her to be a whaler, perhaps on a return cruise; so they shortened
                  sail, and lay the ship on such a course as to meet her, if she were so disposed.
                  And it was not long before they came near enough to hold some conversation. She
                  was a clumsy, dingy, gloomy-looking craft, and seemed a slow sailer, though stout
                  and strongly built. The first question came from the Captain, through his trumpet,
                  for he seemed in great haste to speak.
               What cheer? was his cry; any whales, any blowing, any oil? 
               Then, said Peter, This ship is the King's own, and bound to the Celestial
                  Country.
               CAPTAIN.â€”Oh, I understand. I'd be glad to go there myself, if I had got my
                  cargo.
               PETER.â€”As to that matter, if you are emptied of self, the less cargo you have, the
                  better, except it be the fruits of the Spirit. We brought nothing into this world,
                  and it is certain we can carry nothing out.10
                  
               
               
                  
                  10 l Tim. vi. 7.
               
               CAPTAIN.â€”Well, for my part, I don't wish to carry anything out, but only to have
                  plenty while passing through. But it takes a great deal for that. A man can't live
                  in this world for nothing. But some men seem to have all the luck. Now have I been
                  nigh two years on expense all the time, and have caught nothing. But I'm not going
                  to be a fool always; some day I mean to have the pearl of great price.
               PETER.â€”If I am not much mistaken, you are one of those who are always going to
                  buy, but never buying.11
                   After you have made this one voyage, then you will set sail on the King's
                  account. But the convenient time never comes, and, meanwhile, in most cases the
                  door is shut. What, if it should prove so with you? Is'nt it very likely?
               
                  
                  11 Matt. xxv. 10.
               
               
               CAPTAIN.â€”Well, as to that matter, I honestly confess that I am not without my
                  fears and thoughts. But just at this present I have neither time nor heart for it,
                  no room in my hold to stow it away. No! I don't even think of it, I know nothing
                  of the subject; 'tis all crowded out. I do believe, if I could only catch a whale,
                  I should be a pious man. I'll tell you what; I've been now more than twenty-one
                  months looking for whales, whales, whales, nothing but whales. I have been
                  ploughing the mighty deep in search of whales, and I tell you I am bound to have a
                  whale, I must have one. And if you could look into my heart, I believe you would
                  see nothing but a whale there. What can a man do? It's my destiny to have a whale.
                  But if ever I get into port again, I tell you I mean to take the first King's
                  vessel I can find; for this is a dog's life, and I'm tired of it.
               PETER.â€”If you have really a mind to quit it, you may do it now. We'll give you the
                  best berth in the Ship's company, if you'll come aboard. What's the use of putting
                  it off? You may never see land again, nor have any other opportunity.
               CAPTAIN.â€”No! but I must have my whale. It will never do to leave the voyage half
                  finished.
               PETER.â€”Aye, aye, always thus! Suffer me first to go and bury my father.11
                   Had you not better leave the dead to bury their dead, and attend to your
                   own business.
               
                  
                  11 Matt. viii. 21.
               
               CAPTAIN.â€”Well, well, I'll think of it.
               But just at that moment, the conversation was interrupted by the man at the
                  mast-head crying out, There she blows! being deceived by an appearance at a great
                  distance, like a jet of smoke rising from the ocean. Whereupon, though it was out
                  of all probability that they should encounter a whale in that latitude and
                  longitude, all on board seemed almost crazy with the excitement.
               Where away? shouted the Captain. Three points on her weather bow! returned the
                  mast-head. Then, without seeming to be aware of the existence of any other object
                  on earth except the whale, he set the vessel before the wind, and crowded all sail
                  in that quarter, to be for the hundredth time disappointed.
               Peter and John gazed after her a little while in silence; then, as her form
                  receded from the vision, That man, said Peter, will soon pass his last
                  opportunity, always reckoning on one more. Alas! when men's hearts are filled with
                  a ruling passion, it makes not much odds what it is; it carries them away as with
                  a flood.12
                  There is no standing against it.
               
                  
                  12 Psa. xc. 5.
               
               But this business of whaling, said John, I have always heard that it swallows men
                  up as thoroughly as ever the whale
                  swallowed Jonah. 'Tis true that they can think of nothing else.
               PETER.â€”'Twould be the same thing with any other business, provided the heart were
                  set upon it. No matter what it is; ever so small, ever so large; a man may drown
                  himself in his own garden-spring, as well as in the ocean, if he will put his head
                  under water.
               JOHN.â€”But there are certain things that carry men away as with a whirlwind. Just
                  think of it! I have heard of the boat of a whaler being once knocked several feet
                  in the air, by a blow from the tail of a fish to which it was fastened. Upon
                  coming down, the steersman fell into the whale's mouth, and the teeth of the
                  animal closed upon his leg. After being in this terrible position for some time,
                  he was released, picked up by another boat, and carried on board; where, while
                  preparations were making to amputate his crushed limb, he was asked what he
                  thought of while in the whale's mouth? With the utmost simplicity he replied, Why
                  I thought she would yield about sixty barrels!
               PETER.â€”That was nature. It would have been all the same, if the poor fellow had
                  been in the jaws of death. But he would have made a noble seaman for the King, if
                  he could have been persuaded. Such a narrow escape sometimes changes a man from
                  stem to stern entirely.
               JOHN.â€”And sometimes it leaves him just where he was before. 'Tis according to
                  grace, for one is taken, and another left, though the King is ready to take
                  all.
               PETER.â€”But there are strange providences. Do you remember the wonderful
                  preservation of that drunken sailor, between the jaws of a tiger and an
                  alligator?
               JOHN.â€”Perhaps I may have heard. But tell it again.
               PETER.â€”Why, he was in that dark part of the King's dominions called Africa, where
                  wicked men and devils waxed worse and worse, trading in slaves and the souls of
                  men. It was the coast of Guinea, in a river called Congo, where, in a state of
                  intoxication, the man went in to bathe. But he had not been swimming many minutes,
                  when the men aboard ship discovered an alligator making after him. By firing guns
                  and shouting, they succeeded in rousing the man to an understanding of his danger,
                  when he began to swim, with all his strength, for the nearest point of the shore.
                  It was a place like a jungle for wild beasts, and in fact there was a ferocious
                  tiger in the thicket among the canes, watching him. Just as the man neared the
                  shore, and was about to spring out of the water, the huge alligator from behind
                  had over- taken him, and would
                  certainly have seized him; but at that very instant, the tiger, making a spring
                  towards him, encountered, instead of the man, the jaws of the alligator, and a
                  fierce conflict ensued between them, which ended in the tiger being overcome, and
                  drawn down to the bottom, while the man, trembling and half dead with terror,
                  escaped. He was carried on board, thoroughly sobered, and the moment he reached
                  the deck, he fell down on his knees in the presence of them all, and gave thanks
                  to God for his preservation, and from that time to the hour when the good man that
                  afterwards told the story was writing the account of it, he was never again seen
                  in the least degree intoxicated, nor ever was heard to utter a single oath. If
                  there ever was a reformed creature, they believed that that sailor was the
                  man.
               JOHN.â€”Well, that was a wonderful case, certainly, but not more so than one, the
                  account of which I can give you almost in the words of the sailor himself, who
                  became one of the King's own seamen. There were two large ships in company, with
                  soldiers from certain regiments aboard each, and they were about crossing the
                  line, and being nearly a mile apart, on a fine day, the soldiers and crew of both
                  ships got leave to have a swim. So that this sailor that I speak of plunged in,
                  with a great many more. Meantime, one of the swimmers from the other ship, with a
                  bottle of rum in his hand, swam out from the rest, and challenged any one of the
                  other ship's company to meet him half way. The sailor that I speak of, being a
                  daring swimmer, struck out with a soldier in company, but none of the rest dared
                  go. They had got to about the distance of half a mile from the ship, when the mate
                  in the rigging saw a shark, and called out to the men to come aboard. Then you may
                  be sure there was a panic, and those that were the nearest, obeyed with all haste
                  for their lives, and a boat was lowered for the rest, but still the soldier and
                  the sailor were left swimming.
               Now a hook had been baited with a great piece of pork, and thrown overboard, in
                  hopes of decoying the shark from the men, but it seemed as if he steered strait
                  for them, and by the time they reached the ship, and got hold of a rope, the shark
                  was just beneath them. The weight and jerks of the men broke the rope loose, and
                  both plunged again into the sea alongside the monster. Nevertheless, the sailor
                  succeeded in getting round to the stern of the ship in safety, and by another rope
                  got on board. But the poor soldier, being almost exhausted, was still in the
                  water, and the shark could be seen from the deck just opening his mouth to snatch
                  his prey. Then the men shouted to the swimmer to kick with his feet violently,
                  which he did, and as a kind Providence
                  would have it, struck the shark on the nose, which made the monster turn away for
                  a moment, for you know he is a great coward, and then the man was instantly
                  secured by a rope with a noose to it, and drawn on board. So they were both saved,
                  and the shark, disappointed, encountering the bait that was dodging about for him,
                  seized hold upon that, so that the men caught him fast and killed him. He measured
                  near sixteen feet, with a pair of jaws that could with ease have craunched a good
                  sized barrel.
               Now this was a most merciful escape for both these men, though I never heard that
                  more than one of them laid it seriously to heart. But as for the sailor, all the
                  thoughts about God and eternity that he had ever known (for indeed he had been
                  taught concerning the things of religion in his childhood,) did come crowding into
                  his mind, and his being rescued from that untimely death was the means of his
                  enlisting for the Celestial Country.
               PETER.â€”Well, I would it had been so with the other; but ten to one he went on just
                  as before.
               JOHN.â€”Perhaps he did; for almost always, when some believe, divers mock and are
                  hardened; and even the very same providences are followed by different results in
                  different persons. Some are set to praying, others go on without prayer, just as
                  before.
               PETER.â€”Don't you know that by the very same wind a ship may steer either North or
                  South, East or West, by nice trimming. 'Tis according to the will that rules on
                  board, and governs the course. Have we not seen vessels scudding into the harbor,
                  and others standing out, by the same breeze? Just so by the same Word, and grace,
                  and providence, some men make for life, some for death, some for heaven, some for
                  hell.
               JOHN.â€”And pray tell me, if it be so, how may one distinguish between an effectual
                  calling, and the ordinary calls of God's mercy, that every man has, but not every
                  man attends to?
               PETER.â€”How do you know when a ship is anchored? Is it not when she brings up, and
                  swings round to the wind and current? But if she drags her anchor, or the bottom
                  will not hold, or the cable is parted, she drives on, and you know by her actions
                  that she is not anchored. Just so with a sinner that is called of God. If he
                  stops, swings round, and brings up, then you know that God has anchored him; but
                  if he drives on as before, all God's callings are in vain.
               JOHN.â€”Well, that is plain enough; but some make a great mystery out of it, and
                  puzzle themselves with the question whether they be of the elect.
               PETER.â€”Who knoweth that, or can tell it, abso- lutely, but God only? The foundation of God
                  standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his; and, Let
                  every one, that nameth the name of Christ, depart from iniquity.14
                   Now even we on earth can tell when we see this last seal shining, just as
                  men took note of the disciples, that they had been with Jesus;15
                   but only God can see where he has placed the first, or can tell all about
                  it. But the King says, By their fruits ye shall know them.16
                  
               
               
                  
                  14 2 Timothy, ii. 19.
               
               
                  
                  15 Acts iv. 13.
               
               
                  
                  16 Matt. vii. 16.
               
               JOHN.â€”So you would say that where there are fruits, there is an effectual calling,
                  and that men should be anxious first of all about the fruits, and the question of
                  the calling will be soon determined, or will take care of itself.
               PETER.â€”Why, certainly, if they be fruits of the Spirit. If men see a ship loaded
                  with spices or with pine-apples, do they not know pretty nearly where she came
                  from? And if men see plainly in another man the Spirit of adoption, the Spirit of
                  Jesus Christ, do they not know where he got it? Why, truly, it needs no great
                  depth of theology, for it is plain sailing, and any good seaman could make it out.
                  When a man truly obeys any of God's calls, that is an effectual
                  calling, and when a man himself calls earnestly upon God, then he may be sure that
                  God is effectually calling him, for that is the way in which God's
                  call is known to have taken effect, and that only is effectual, which hath such
                  effect.
               JOHN.â€”So then, if a man pray earnestly, 'tis a proof that God has hold upon him,
                  and will not leave him. Well, that is full of encouragement to all that call upon
                  God, and it minds me of the saying, With supplications will I lead them.17
                   For God reins up and guides his children with prayer, as a man doth his
                  mule with bit and bridle, or as we would throw a cable on board a ship which we
                  were to take in tow, and fasten it to the Capstan. So, if a man be possessed of
                  the Spirit of prayer, he may take it as a sure sign that God is with him, that it
                  was God who fastened his cable aboard of him, and not he himself, and so he may be
                  sure that God will save him.
               
                  
                  17 Jer. 31. 9.
               
               PETER.â€”He may, if he keep praying; but if he leave off praying, then instantly
                  again he begins sinning; and then what proof hath he of God's mercy? Why, then he
                  hath rather proof that Satan is aboard of him, not God, and that his adversary,
                  the Devil, hath a coil of rope upon him, the which he will not find it easy to
                  cast off. A man's success and certainty in everything depends upon prayer, and
                  every blessing is promised to prayer.
               JOHN.â€”Well, for aught I see, it's the same as work- ing and willing, and God does it all, though under
                  God we do it also. He worketh in us both to will and to do, according to his good
                     pleasure.18
                   If he did not work in us, we should not work, so that if we be truly
                  working, this is the best proof that he is working in us. It is not less his
                  working, because we work, nor is it less our working because he works, but God is
                  all in all.
               
                  
                  18 Phil. 2. 13.
               
               PETER.â€”Yes! Just as we walk the deck, but it is none the less the ship that
                  carries us; nor, because the ship carries us, are we any the less really walking.
                  So, though it be God's grace that carries us, and works all good things in us, it
                  is none the less we ourselves that walk in God's grace, if indeed we are his, if
                  we are really alive in him. It is none the less our life, because it is his life
                  in us. But it is sweet to trace all things to him, and to receive all things from
                  him.
               JOHN.â€”Well, if it is grace in the hull, it is grace in the rigging also, and yet,
                  at the same time we have to be busy at that. It is the wind that fills the sails,
                  but we must work the sails. The wind might blow, but to no good purpose for us, if
                  the sails were not hoisted. God gives some men both wind and sails, and yet they
                  do not work, and make no progress, which is such a waste of God's gifts, that they
                  had better never have had either, than make such an abuse of them.
               PETER.â€”I tell you, true faith and true works always go together, and neither is
                  true and genuine without the other; but faith is at the beginning, faith comes
                  first, and then works come out of faith, just as a flower comes out of the bud, or
                  the fruit of the flower, and all out of the roots. So everything is of the King's
                  love and grace, and nothing good that hath not its root in him.
               It was exceeding fair and bright upon the sea, as they continued these
                  conversations, and the air had a wondrous lightness and elasticity, so that it was
                  a joy to breathe. Moreover, they could see afar off with great distinctness, and
                  the prospect seemed to stretch into infinitude. It was a pleasure to walk the
                  deck, and gaze, and meditate. It seemed almost as if heaven had come down upon the
                  deep, and the waves danced in the light, as though they too were intelligent and
                  joyous creatures. The water also was so clear, that far down in the depths the
                  creatures of the sea were visible; huge fishes of the form of the grampus could be
                  seen sporting and gambolling, exceedingly beautiful; now darting with incredible
                  swiftness around the ship from stem to stern, now shooting off at a distance,
                  rising to the surface, cutting the crest of a wave in the air, then returning and darting this way and that, and
                  thus, as from mere sportive delight, keeping company with the ship a long time, as
                  if they believed her to be a creature of the deep with themselves. Everything
                  above, below, around, seemed full of glory; but as yet no land was visible.
               Their hymns of praise arose in the midst of all this loveliness and beauty,
                  whether at morning, noon or night, with an indescribable richness and power of
                  melody. 
                     
                        O Lord, my King, where'er Thou art,
                        Thy light is sweetness to my heart;
                        Thee in all objects I would see,
                        By seeing all things, Lord, in Thee.
                     
                     
                        Hast Thou not lit the secret flame,
                        That burns in love at thy dear name?
                        How else should I to thee aspire,
                        Or who could answer my desire?
                     
                     
                        What can subdue my stubborn will,
                        Or keep me in obedience still?
                        What power but thine, Almighty Lord,
                        Thy Spirit, and thy Sovereign Word?
                     
                     
                        Oh then redeem and set me free,
                        To find my happiness in Thee,
                        And fill me, from its source above,
                        With thy refining flame of love.
                     
                     
                        Then shall I, with exulting mind,
                        Thy service perfect freedom find;
                        My life, through all its days, be given
                        To Thee on earth, with Thee in Heaven.
                     
                  
               
               It was such a night as this, said Peter, the air soft and balmy, the breeze
                  gentle, the heavens serene and cloudless, and the sea calm, that a sailor was once
                  walking the deck and admiring the loveliness of nature, when suddenly and
                  unaccountably the words Pray-without-ceasing19
                   came across his mind, or rather darted upon it, as an arrow might dart
                  from the sky, created on the instant. Pray without ceasing! The utterance was so
                  definite, and the impression so strong and decisive, that he could not help
                  repeating over the words again and again, and asking himself where he could have
                  heard them. At length he recollected. Seven years before, after a long absence
                  from his native land, he had returned with plenty of money, and one day in the
                  time of Divine Service strolled into a large open Church in the great City, where
                  those words, just then uttered by the Minister, were the only words distinctly
                  heard and remembered by the sailor amidst his idle curiosity. He had never thought
                  of them since. But now, in God's wonder-working providence, by some mysterious
                  association with the cloudless heavens and the calm sea of this
                  
                     
                     19 1 Thess. v. 17.
                  
                   beauteous evening, the text came again into his
                  mind, and with it, the thought of that dread Being who had commanded him to pray,
                  and the conviction of his own guilt in living without prayer ever since he had
                  been born.
               From that moment the power of God was upon him, his sins flashed upon his
                  conscience, and the thunder of the Divine law shook his heart. He fled earnestly
                  to prayer, found a Bible that had lain untouched in his chest for near twenty
                  years, deposited there by the careful hand of an anxious praying mother; he read,
                  wept, prayed and prayed again, and at length found mercy in the Lamb of God, who
                  taketh away the sin of the world. Such are some of the wonders of God's
                  providence, in bringing souls from darkness to light, from the power of Satan unto
                  God. Everything in nature, this twilight on the deep, this azure starry sky, these
                  purple waves, this vast expanse of ocean, this serene and solemn stillness in the
                  sparkling air, may prove a Word of God to the soul whenever he pleases.
               Thus, by one way or another, God will effectually call those whom he hath chosen,
                  and by his Word, Providence, and Grace, will sanctify them. For we know that all
                  things work together for good, to those who love God, who are the called according
                  to his purpose.20
                   And by and by, all the grand steps in the process shall be seen in all
                  their sweetness, loveliness, and glory. For whom he did foreknow, he also did
                  predestinate, to be conformed to the image of his Son, and whom he did
                  predestinate, them he also called, and whom he called, them he also justified, and
                  whom he justified, them he also glorified.21
                   And well do we know, 
                     
                        Grace will complete what grace begins,
                        To save from sorrows and from sins
                        The work that mercy undertakes
                        Eternal Wisdom ne'er forsakes.

               CHAPTER XIV.
               EXAMPLE, GRACE, AND GLORY.
               NOW, said John, all this is done only through the power of his Cross; yet there be
                  some who affirm that Christ Jesus came only to be our example, to lead us on to
                  goodness and to heaven. Do you not remember how many such there were in that
                  country of Self-Conceit, where we were once so bogged and entangled, and nigh unto
                  ruin?
               Well now, answered Peter, that is just as good as counting the blood of the
                  covenant an unholy thing,1
                   a perfectly waste thing; and a strange enmity it is that such persons have
                  to the great and precious truth of our dear Lord's sacrifice of himself for dying
                  sinners. 'Tis the sacrifice, and the grace attending it, that does all. No example
                  could ever have done anything without that. Besides, the wonderful greatness and
                  glory of the example itself is in Christ DYING to save us. They who believe in his
                  death, and trust to that, follow his life, and are saved by his life, and none
                  others. His death for us had to come first, that we might be reconciled to God,
                  and then, and not till then, we can be saved by his life, or drawn by his
                  example.
               
                  
                  1 Heb. x., 29.
               
               JOHN.â€”And that is what it means, when it says, I, if I be lifted tip, will draw
                  all men unto me.2
                   'Tis the lifting up of Christ upon the cross, and the preaching of his
                  blood, his grace, for salvation. Anything but this, hides the gospel, instead of
                  revealing it. Yea, if the example itself be lifted up before this, or without
                  this, 'tis a hiding of it; and if the gospel be hid, then the soul is lost; or if
                  any other gospel be preached than that which is preached in the Word of God, and
                  the soul trusts to that, then it cannot be made a partaker of the Spirit of
                  Christ, nor be changed into his image.
               
                  
                  2 John, xii., 32.
               
               PETER.â€”No, my brother, it is by manifestation of the truth alone that the Spirit
                  works this blessedness in us, and if the truth be darkened, or the Word of God
                  handled deceitfully, especially in reference to Christ, then, and in that same
                  degree this blessedness becomes impossible; for all imagined blessedness, without
                  the truth as it is in Jesus, is a mere delusion. It is not light, unless it is
                  seen in God's light; and it is not the
                  fountain of life, except in Him, and in Him only, who is the Way, the Truth, and
                  the Life.3
                  
               
               
                  
                  3 John, xiv., 6.
               
               JOHN.â€”Well, I wish that all the blind would see it so. But seeing any other way
                  than through the death of Christ only makes men proud. The gospel of the example
                  is poor stuff indeed, without the gospel of the cross.
               PETER.â€”A man must come with the heart; no man can see with the understanding
                  merely. Did you never see a man with his spectacles raised upon the top of his
                  head, and lodged in his hair, going about anxiously after his spectacles,
                  declaring that he cannot find his spectacles, and cannot see without them? Just
                  this is the case with many a man who thinks he is searching for truth. Men put
                  their spectacles on their heads, and then leave their hearts behind them, and
                  wonder that they cannot see, or perhaps deny what they do not see. A great many
                  men carry their faith in the understanding merely, and then run about, looking
                  after their Christ and their religion externally, when, if faith were in the
                  heart, the kingdom of God, and Christ who is its life and light, would be found
                  within them. And until it is there within them, what can they know of a Saviour's
                  dying love?
               JOHN.â€”That is the very thing, for as I was saying, some of them do not care to
                  know; they think little or nothing of the death, and yet seem to make much ado
                  about the example.
               PETER.â€”Example! And what effect did that alone ever have with self-willed,
                  obstinate sinners? Why, it did not even prevent the very men, who saw the glory of
                  a divine example before them, from putting the Saviour himself to death. Example!
                  Set example before Behemoth! He snuffeth at it. Behold, he drinketh up a river,
                  and hasteth not; he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.4
                   Canst thou bind the unicorn with the band of example in the furrow, or
                  will he harrow the valleys after thee? Wilt thou trust him, and leave thy labor to
                  him, and believe him, that he will gather thy corn into thy barn?5
                  
               
               
                  
                  4 Job. xl. 23.
               
               
                  
                  5 Job. xxxix. 10-12.
               
               JOHN.â€”Well, it is the same old unwillingness to owe all to Christ. These men
                  cannot bear to confess and feel that they have nothing but sin to bring to God;
                  they will have it that they can obey the example of Christ, and make such
                  obedience their Saviour.
               PETER.â€”But the example of Christ can do nothing for us except by the grace of
                  Christ. Those who rejoice in Christ as their Saviour, by his sufferings and death,
                  and those only, love to follow his example; and they do it, not to purchase
                  heaven, for the Lord Jesus alone can
                  purchase heaven for them, by his own most precious blood, but out of gratitude and
                  love. Example, forsooth! to those who do not feel their guilt! Can you draw Lamb's
                  wool over the eyes of a shark? Will the Ethiopian change his skin, or the Leopard
                  his spots?6
                   Canst thou draw out Leviathan with a hook; canst thou bore his jaw through
                  with a thorn? Will he speak soft words unto thee? Wilt thou bind him for thy
                  maidens, or take him for a servant forever? Behold the hope of him is vain. His
                  heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.7
                   And just so vain is the force of mere example in the heart of an
                  unbelieving sinner.
               
                  
                  6 Jer. xiii. 23.
               
               
                  
                  7 Job xli. 1-5; 9, 24.
               
               JOHN.â€”Very true. And after all our provisions and our efforts, 'tis all of grace
                  still. Have we not the King's Chart? And can we not trace the course of noble old
                  ships upon it, that went safely all the way? But is that enough for us? Will that
                  fill our sails with wind? Will that carry us onward? Who can do that but God only?
                  'Tis sweet to have Christ for our guide, and to be commanded to walk in his steps,
                  and to have the same mind in us which was also in Christ Jesus,8
                   and to arm ourselves also with his mind.9
                   And furthermore, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, we shall
                  be changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the
                     Lord.10

                  10 2 Cor. iii. 18.
               
               PETER.â€”Yes indeed! You have got it now. And when a poor sinner has fled to Jesus,
                  with humble, heartfelt sorrow for sin, and has thrown all upon him, trusting in
                  his death and righteousness, then he begins to see his glory, and to be changed by
                  it. But how shall this ever be except by the same all-conquering grace and love
                  that brought the King of Glory down to die for mortals? Of this we might and must
                  everlastingly despair, if left to ourselves, and thrown upon our own
                  resources.
               For though the example of such infinite excellence comes to us in human form, and
                  though the Divine glory and majesty are so veiled, that we may not be dazzled and
                  overwhelmed by it, but may come into an acquaintance with it, and may measure
                  ourselves by it in Christ Jesus, yet we are so entirely alien from such a spirit,
                  so bent and deformed against it, so native and inveterate in selfishness, that it
                  will have no more effect upon us, than whistling will have upon the wind. You
                  might as well attempt to fasten the anchor to the main truck and hold the ship by
                  it.
               Furthermore, we are so plunged and lost in the ocean of our guilt and wo, without
                  the blood of Christ, that such an example even as his, would have no more power
                  with us, to draw us up, and save us, except for that blood, than the sight of a phalanx of
                  resplendent angels, hovering over the deeps of hell, would have upon its depraved,
                  despairing inmates. For there would be no more hope for us, without the blood of
                  Christ, than for them; and the bare sight of such an example could be of no more
                  avail for us, than it would be for a shipwrecked mariner, left alone and
                  struggling all night long, in mid-ocean, to behold, with clearest vision, the
                  unclouded sun rising out of the horizon, and flaming over the sea. If indeed he
                  could take the beams of the sun for his chariot, if he could lay hold upon those
                  shafts of morning rays, that fall upon him only to light up his misery, and reveal
                  more clearly his hopeless, irremediable ruin, then indeed might the glory be to
                  him not a vision of despair merely, but a medium of salvation.
               JOHN.â€”Well, and just such a power, just such a medium, is Christ's dying love, if
                  a sinking sinner will but gaze upon him dying, will but look and live.
               PETER.â€”Yea, even so. And now suppose that as the orb of day blazes over the waste
                  of waters, and the eye of the sinking, despairing, dying, shipwrecked man takes in
                  at once both the glory of the scene, and the extent and certainty of his own ruin,
                  the rays of light assume a power and form within him, enter into his soul,
                  irradiate and envelope his frame, play upon his shoulders as wings, and give him a
                  feeling and capacity of such conscious energy and impulse, that gazing earnestly
                  and intently upon the rising light, he finds its pinions unfolding from his body,
                  bearing him up above the deep into which he was plunging, and giving him the
                  disposition and the power to soar like an Albatross, and fly to some hospitable
                  shore of safety. You will say that this would be a miracle; and yet, even this
                  would be but an image of that change by the grace of a dying Saviour, when the
                  guilty, perishing soul beholds him with a believing heart; a faint image of that
                  investiture of glory and of power, with which every despairing, dying sinner is
                  clothed, the moment the Sun of Righteousness rises on the soul; that mighty
                  transformation into the capacity of imitating Christ, and that participation in
                  the reality of his own holiness, which takes place with every guilty soul, the
                  moment it will but look to Christ with humble faith, casting all on him. Then the
                  chains drop off, then the powers and impossibilities of a selfish and inveterate
                  depravity are conquered, then Christ himself begins to be formed within the soul
                  the hope of glory, then it rises from the depths of guilt, ruin, and despair, then
                  it tries its pinions, and finds them, in humble dependence on the Saviour, bearing
                  it up above the waves, soaring away with it towards holiness, and heaven, and everlasting glory. This is dying
                  love, this is the power of the sight by faith of a suffering, bleeding, dying
                  Christ, the sight of the Saviour's blood, this is redeeming grace and glory. And
                  this is just the experience of every guilty soul that flies to Jesus. 
                     
                        For God has breathed upon a worm,
                        And given me from above
                        Wings such as clothe an angel's form,
                        The wings of joy and love.
                     
                  
               
               Well, answered John, after silently musing a few moments, You have taken a high
                  flight in your thoughts, this time, almost out of the reckoning of many a sailor,
                  at least in the trim and spread of your canvas; but it is all true. There is
                  nothing that can be said about the love of Christ to dying sinners, that reaches a
                  hundred thousandth part of the way to the beginning of its greatness. And,
                  therefore, great and godly Paul, when he sets forth, by the Spirit, the steps of
                  this flight, this flying ladder up to glory, up to the unsearchable riches of
                  Christ, begins with praying That we may be strengthened with might by His Spirit
                  in the inner man, that Christ may dwell in our hearts by faith.11
                   There's the wings! Christ in us the hope of glory.12
                   Christ formed within us, That we, being rooted and grounded in love, might
                  be able to comprehend with all saints what is the length, and breadth, and depth,
                  and height, and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that we might
                  be filled with all the fulness of God!13
                   There's the wings! And, oh, how wonderful, how glorious! There, too, is
                  the amazing flight, passing all knowledge, and never ended, till it is lost in all
                  the fulness of God, and still again never ended, but on, on, on, from height to
                  height, from depth to depth, from glory to glory, to all eternity!

                  a Seaman on his course for the Celestial Country, had a view of it when he sang so
                  sweetly,â€” 
                     
                        I'll praise my Maker with my breath,
                        And when my voice is lost in death
                        Praise shall employ my nobler powers.
                        My days of praise shall ne'er be past,
                        While life, and thought, and being last,
                        Or immortality endures.
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XV.
               PRAYER, PROVIDENCE, AND FAITH.
               THE morning after this talk, it was blowing heavily. During the night the change
                  had come, for though the weather was still clear, and not one speck of cloud to be
                  seen, and the stars shining intensely bright through the deep, unfathomable blue,
                  yet the wind had come with fury, none could tell where from, and now had got to a
                  gale, and the sea was high, and the ship uneasy. Some of the men had been busy
                  aloft during the night, shortening sail; for the day before, and at sunset, all
                  sail had been crowded, the wind and weather being so perfectly fair and
                  prosperous. In the morning, just as they had finished clewing up and securing the
                  fore and main-top gallant sails, all on a sudden a startling report was heard,
                  like the firing of cannon, and the fore-topsail split bodily, whereupon the men
                  lay out upon the yard, and had hard work reefing. They had scarcely got through
                  with this, when the main-royal blew loose from the rigging with another explosion,
                  and flapped and banged like the wings of a demon, as if it would tear the mast out
                  of the ship's centre. Here was a double piece of work, and not without danger; and
                  all hands sprung aloft to get in the royal, and send down the yard. Bnt the wind
                  blew so furiously, that it almost held the men fast bolted to the spars and
                  rigging, and they had the greatest difficulty to secure their work.
               So they drove on for a while, still under a good press of sail, considering the
                  fury of the elements, and perhaps too rashly, had they continued it, though Peter
                  and John were not afraid of the wind, so long as they could hold on safely, and
                  keep the ship quick answering to her helm. However, the order soon came, Let fly
                  the topsail halyards! Haul upon the clew-lines! and the men, as quick almost as
                  the words, lay aloft, and got upon the yards, while the ship lay at such an angle
                  in the water, that it seemed as if they would be buried in the deep.
               But while this was going on, one of the foot-ropes gave way, where the men were
                  reefing, and one of them, who just at that moment had no hold on the reefing point
                  or life-line, fell sheer over headlong into the raging sea. But by a gracious
                  providence, before ever the shout could be raised, A man over- board! Peter saw him as he fell, and with a sudden
                  and almost incredible dexterity, cast forth the end of a coil of strong rope,
                  called Grace-to-Help-in-Time-of-Need,1
                   in such a direction, that before the ship had shot ahead too far, the man
                  succeeded in catching it, and getting a turn round his body, or otherwise it
                  seemed as if he must certainly have been lost. But the rope held, and the man
                  clung to it, though half drowned, and in a moment he was drawn on board, thanking
                  God for such a merciful preservation.
               
                  
                  1 Heb. iv. 16.
               
               Now when the wind abated, and they talked over this matter, they could not help
                  remarking on the good providence of the man's fall happening by day-light, when
                  Peter could see him; for if it had been at night, and no help instantly at hand,
                  he could not have been saved, with the ship driving so swiftly. It made all the
                  men feel anew their dependence on God, and the importance of being prepared, every
                  moment, for anything that might happen; for a sailor's life is so exposed to
                  danger and death, that he needs to have all made tight for a better world, and to
                  live in unceasing faith and prayer. And whether he is reefing sail in a storm, or
                  dog-watching in fair weather, or what not, he ought to be keeping his mind
                  anchored according to that great rule of Paul, by the Spirit, In everything by
                  prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto
                  God, and the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your heart
                  and mind through Christ Jesus.2
                  
               
               
                  
                  2 Phil. iv. 7.
               
               Then, said Peter, The Lord upholdeth all that fall,3
                   and if never a sparrow falleth to the ground without our Father,4
                   how much more, never a man. And God saith, A just man falleth seven times,
                  and riseth again,5
                   but the Lord only can make him stand. The longer we live, the more we see
                  of God's interposition. And what says David, Wilt not thou deliver my feet from
                  falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?6
                   Thus did he pray unto God, and God answered him Yes, for he saith
                  afterwards, I was brought low and he helped me. Return unto thy rest, O my soul,
                  for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee. For thou hast delivered my soul
                  from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling. I will walk before the
                  Lord in the land of the living.7
                   So He keeps us.

                  7 Ps. cxvi. 6-10.
               
               I think, said John, that both the sovereignty and the particular providence of God
                  are very precious to every true seaman; and in truth, these things constitute the
                  security of our hope; for God can and will do as he pleases, and will save us, if he chooses
                  to do so, whatever enemies may oppose.
               PETER.â€”Yes, but some men make both these things stumbling blocks, and reasons of
                  offence and faultfinding, and others plead both the sovereignty and the special
                  providence of God in excuse for their own stupidity.
               JOHN.â€”But they never do this when once they begin to be in earnest. 'Tis a bank of
                  fog, in which Satan wraps the soul, but the moment a man begins to cry out, Lord
                  save me, I perish, then the fog breaks, and the soul advances. A man may have been
                  as undecided, fitful, doubtful, as the wind in the Variables, but the moment he
                  really begins to pray, there is a resolution and decision of his whole being. The
                  first hearty, agonizing prayer brings him at once to his moorings. 'Tis like the
                  mooring of a great ship. Suppose one end of your cable were secure on shore, but
                  the other end only in your own hands, loosely, like a man's mere thoughts about
                  prayer, like his evanescent feelings, or his coming and going anxieties concerning
                  heaven and hell; neither you, nor all the crew on board could hold on to the cable
                  so, or hold the ship by it. But suppose you take a turn with the cable round the
                  capstan, why then you have done something; and that is like the fastening of
                  prayer. There may be a great strain, and the cable presses, starts, and is ready
                  to give way under the strong pressure; but you take another turn, and now you
                  begin to be secure; the cable will neither start nor break, and the fixture to
                  which it is fastened is part of the ship's centre. You take another turn still,
                  and all is safe and quiet; the vessel is moored. And when this is once done, then
                  the law of his God is in the man's heart, and none of his steps shall slide.8
                   And even though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down, for the Lord
                  upholdeth him with his hand.9
                   Yea, and when the ship is at sea, though a rope now and then should give
                  way, and let him down into the deep, yet there is also sudden grace for sudden
                  troubles, and grace to help in every time of need.

               PETER.â€”Well, these are sweet promises, and waiting upon God in prayer is the only
                  way of working the ship safely. But the way of a fool is right in his own
                     eyes,10
                   and he putteth darkness for light, and light for darkness.11
                   Moreover, there is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet
                  are not washed from their filthiness. There is a generation, O how lofty are their
                  eyes, and their eyelids are lifted up.12
                   Therefore God says, Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not to
                  your own understanding.13

                   Humility sees clearer, even in the
                  darkness, than pride when surrounded with light.
               JOHN.â€”There is one thing we may be sure of; if we trust in the Lord, He will cause
                  all things to work together for our good; and under this rule, for it is God's own
                  rule for his own providences, the things that seem contrary at first often turn
                  out best. God sometimes leads his children by what seems to them a very round
                  about way, but the proverb then holds good, that the longest way round is the
                  shortest way home. Travellers often endeavor to make short cuts for themselves,
                  across lots, but generally run into trouble. We may think we are going straight
                  forward, almost upon an air line, but all of a sudden we are brought up against
                  some mountain, and then we must either coast it till we find God's way, or return
                  to the point where we started. Air lines are good things for calculation, but they
                  can very seldom be travelled upon. The North Star is good for navigation, but from
                  any one point to any other point under the North Star, a man can seldom sail in a
                  straight direction. A man may have to make many a tack, and in going North, he may
                  sometimes have to make Easting, and sometimes Westing.
               PETER.â€”That is true; and it takes a great many things to constitute experience.
                  The children of Israel might have gone in a straight line from Egypt to Canaan in
                  one month, but God's way for them cost them forty years. God regards not what we
                  wish, but what we need; not what is of quickest enjoyment for us, but what is most
                  for our permanent good. We have to be guided in a great many things by
                  circumstances; and one of the greatest trials of character here on earth is in the
                  use of circumstances, whether a man will bend them for God, whether a man's
                  supreme end shall be guided by circumstances, or whether, having his end in God
                  and heaven, he will simply make use of circumstances to aid him in reaching that
                  end. A great many persons put circumstances instead of the end, and spend their
                  whole life at the half-way house. Many get no further in their earthly pilgrimage
                  than the World's Fair, or the Crystal Palace, where they go into business, which,
                  instead of being a circumstance in the pilgrimage, becomes its main end, till all
                  thought of the Celestial City is abandoned. Now all the employments and concerns
                  of life are but circumstances, not substances; means only, not ends. They are
                  transitory, and we are only passing by them, and our use of them is but momentary;
                  and God would have us every day live as pilgrims, as sojourners, who have here no
                  continuing City, but who seek one to come.14

               JOHN.â€”Now that is just where God's providence, as well as his word directeth us,
                  if we know how to use it right. But alas, there be many so blinded, that they
                  cannot look up; and the labor of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because
                  he knoweth not how to go to the City.15
                   They can see the things temporal, but not the unseen and eternal. A man
                  dwelling a long time in a cave or dungeon where there is no sunlight, can see
                  everything there, can see the insects and their movements, the spiders and their
                  webs; but if you were to take him into the open day, he would be quite blind, he
                  could not see nor bear the sun. And so it is with men long buried in the things of
                  this world, with hearts set upon them, instead of the things of another world.
                  They can see nothing else, neither God, nor Christ, nor heaven, nor grace, nor
                  providence.
               
                  
                  15 Eccles. x. 15.
               
               PETER.â€”Well, in regard to providence there is too much of this blindness every day
                  in those who ought to know better, and ought to understand the meaning of God's
                  discipline with them. God sometimes has to put his own children in the carriage of
                  his providence, and drive them on, they know not whither. They tell him they want
                  to reach such or such a point. They think, if they had their own way, they could
                  drive straight, but they would speedily overset the carriage. But God leads the
                  blind by a way that they know not,16
                   and their trust must be in him that leadeth them, content to leave the
                  management of their affairs wholly in his hands. If in all their ways they
                  acknowledge him, then he will direct their steps,17
                   and Oh, how happy such a life, with every step ordered by the Lord!

               JOHN.â€”A man must walk closely with God by prayer, and then God will walk closely
                  with him in providence. Many a seaman has found that out, to his great content and
                  joy, and has come to know by sweet experience, in a great many things, the truth
                  of the rule that all things shall work together for good.18
                   There was a case that I will tell you of, about an anchor. One of the
                  King's Captains once had a commission to sail a ship with some ugly hands on
                  board, that cared more for swearing than they did for praying, and two of them
                  were of the Man of Sin and Son of Perdition, believing nothing but their own
                  Corporation. Now before the King's Captain would set sail, he made particular
                  examination, as was always his custom, to see if all things were right and in good
                  trim on board, and when he came to the cable of the kedge anchor, there was
                  something in his mind that told him to have a new cable bent on to that anchor. It
                  was not that he found anything
                  
                     
                     18 Rom. viii. 28.
                  
                   in that
                  cable out of order, but still there was something that made him very uneasy, and
                  he could not be satisfied to set sail till he got a new cable; and though it took
                  some time, he would get a new strong cable bent on to the kedge anchor instead of
                  the old one. So they set sail.
               Well, it so happened that after a safe voyage all across the ocean, they came to
                  anchor in a great roadstead where there were more than a hundred vessels anchoring
                  beside themselves, for it was a place much frequented by ships, though by no means
                  a safe harbor in a storm, as the event proved. For it came on to blow with such
                  fury, that almost all the ships dragged their anchors, and a great many went on
                  shore and were dashed to pieces. It was an awful night, for the gale rose to a
                  terrible tempest, and they had out the best bower anchor and the kedge anchor, not
                  knowing but both would fail, and indeed expecting it, and that all on board must
                  perish; for even amidst the darkness and roar of the tempest they could see that
                  the ships in every direction were breaking from their moorings, and were wrecked
                  without remedy, and they looked for the same fate. Especially they began to
                  despair, when the cable of the bower anchor parted, and the ship was frightfully
                  tossed and laboring, and held from immediate de- struction only by the kedge
                  anchor. If that cable gave way, they were certainly lost.
               And now the poor miserable creatures on board, who had been swearing and
                  ridiculing the Captain's prayers all the way across the ocean, began to cry out
                  for mercy; and even the two Pope's men came to the Captain, for they knew he was a
                  man of prayer, and besought him to have a prayer-meeting. So he told them that
                  they ought to have learned to pray before this, if they would find God's mercy in
                  the hour of danger. However, he got them together, and prayed with them, and
                  though the gale blew on, all through the night with unabated fury, still, to their
                  great joy, the kedge anchor held, and the cable was not parted. And now the
                  Captain looked back to God's providence, and bethought him that if he had not been
                  led, and constrained, as it were, of God, to put a new strong cable to that kedge
                  anchor, they must before this have gone to pieces.
               The daylight came, and with it a dreadful scene of wreck and ruin all around them,
                  while they themselves were safe. But what was the great wonder of the providence
                  was this, that when the gale at length abated, and they drew up the kedge anchor
                  that had held them from destruction, which they had great difficulty to do, they
                  found hanging to it one of the most enormous anchors they had ever beheld; and
                  they found that their comparatively
                  little kedge anchor had, by God's wonderful directing providence, when they first
                  came to anchor, slipped one of its flukes right through the bolt of the big
                  anchor, and there held fast, and that was the sole reason why, when almost every
                  other vessel in that roadstead had dragged her anchors, and either perished or
                  been greatly injured, their ship had held, and held only by the kedge.
               And now the Captain and all on board saw indeed why it was that he had been led to
                  have that new strong cable bent on to the kedge instead of the bower. And they
                  were so affected by this instance of God's providential care and great mercy, that
                  they could not help weeping. And I hope that even those two Pope's men from that
                  time began to pray, and to pray to the true God instead of the Virgin Mary. O,
                  there is nothing like being suspended over the mouth of death and hell, to make
                  men feel the need of prayer! And O the happiness of trusting in the Lord daily,
                  and having him for our God, who can and will cause all things to work together for
                  our good.
               They found, on measuring the ring bolt of the big anchor, in which the kedge had
                  caught, that it was just barely of a size for the fluke to pass through; so that,
                  if it had been the bower anchor instead of the kedge that caught, it could not
                  have held them. The big anchor had perhaps been lost there a great while before by
                  some man-of-war.
               Well, said Peter, What man in his right senses can ever deny a particular
                  superintending providence? A man might as well be a fool, and done with it, saying
                  in his heart, There is no God.19
                   I knew a young sailor aboard ship, that had gone through a thousand perils
                  of storm and rough weather, one fine pleasant day within a hair's breadth of death
                  while leisurely working. He had been aloft all the afternoon, nearly, very busily
                  at work, and for as much as an hour he was standing on the fore-top-gallant yard,
                  which was hoisted up, and hung only by the tie. And when he had got through his
                  work, he brailed up his yarns, took his sewing-board in his hand, and laid hold
                  deliberately of the top-gallant rigging, and had only taken one foot from the
                  yard, and was just lifting the other, when the tie parted, and down the yard
                  fell.
               
                  
                  19 Ps. xiv. 1.
               
               One instant longer, or if the tie had parted but an instant sooner, he would have
                  been thrown from a height of ninety or a hundred feet overboard, or perhaps on
                  deck, which must have been instant death. But he was safe, as a good providence
                  would have it, by his hold upon the rigging, though it made his heart beat quick, for he felt his
                  danger. A true King's seaman will never make a joke of such narrow escapes, for he
                  knows that often there is but a step between him and death,20
                     and that it is only God's loving care that keeps him.

                  Nor blasts of evening air,
                  Shall take my health away,
                  If God be with me there:
                  Thou art my sun, And thou my shade,
                  To guard my head, By night or noon.
               
            
            
               CHAPTER XVI.
               CAPTAIN GOOD-ENOUGH AND HIS CARGO.
               NOW in the midst of all this lovely weather and scenery, a ship one day hove in
                  sight towards evening, and as they saw her against the horizon, which was now
                  flaming with light, it seemed as though she were on fire with a blaze of glory,
                  and they even doubted, sometimes, if she were not floating in the heavens. But
                  after watching her for awhile, it was evident they were gaining on her, and at
                  length by the glass they could pretty clearly not only distinguish her flag, which
                  was the King's flag, but also were enabled to make out the sign on her stern,
                  which was neither more nor less than GOOD WORKS from the Town of
                  SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS. At this discovery they were quite in a maze, but Peter
                  observed at length, Good Works, good works! 'Tis a good sign, if well used,
                  according to faith and godliness; but that Town I know of old, as a place that
                     hath bred many distempers against
                  the King and his ordinances. It is a place, where they will not so much as admit
                  the right of the King to save them on his own account, and even when the King's
                  recruiting officer is asking for seamen, they have been known to maintain a
                  quarrel among themselves, whether it was they that offered first to go, or he that
                  called them.
               Moreover, all the merchants and shipbuilders of that place enter into an imaginary
                  running balance with the King, of debt and credit, maintaining that they have
                  capital of their own, for the possession and use of which the King is bound to
                  allow an original claim upon him for salvage. So they come into his books (that
                  is, as they say) half by right, half by mercy, and all that they carry, or make,
                  on any voyage, they put down to their own credit first, to the King's afterwards;
                  and they are very jealous of leaving anything to him, but always want a mortgage
                  executed on their own virtues, never admitting themselves to be bankrupt.
               JOHN.â€”But will the King have anything to do with such persons, or does he ever
                  save by halves?
               PETER.â€”Oh, they think so. And besides they seem to think that they do honor to the
                  King in entering into such a partnership, and keeping the firm under his name.
               JOHN.â€”Well, the son of the bond-woman shall not be heir with the son of the
                     free-woman.1
                   If they are of the Law, they cannot be of the King; and this would I learn
                  in regard to them, whether they received the Spirit by the works of the law, or by
                  the hearing of faith.2

               PETER.â€”I much fear they have never received the Spirit at all, for the Spirit
                  would lead to faith and love, and a hearty submission of all things to the King,
                  especially renouncing their own boasted righteousness. Good works are good things
                  for necessary uses,3
                   and to prove the truth and goodness of one's faith, and there can be no
                  true faith without them; but if good works are put first, and are built upon for
                  salvation, it is just as if you should plant a tree with the branches downwards,
                  and the roots sticking up and abroad in the air. For it is nothing but Christ and
                  his love, and faith in him, that can produce good works, according to that he hath
                  told us, Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself,
                  except it abide in the vine, no more can ye, except ye abide in me.4
                   Moreover, the very faith that produces the good works is also the gift of
                  God, so that there can be no boasting, but it is forever excluded, and all is of
                  God's undeserved mercy.5

               JOHN.â€”Well, let us speak the ship, and we can soon tell what her hope is, and how far she answers
                  to her title. She maketh a fair show at any rate.
               Now at length they come within hailing distance of the stranger, and forthwith she
                  made her course known as for the Celestial Country, and the Captain courteously
                  invited Peter and John to come on board, Thereupon they determined so do to; and
                  there being a light breeze and a smooth sea, the two ships meanwhile kept an easy
                  course nearly alongside.
               On coming aboard, they found the captain of the ship was named Captain Goodenough,
                  and they found him a very polite and gentlemanly man, so long as they gave in to
                  his pretensions. The men in the forecastle called him by a nick-name, Old
                  Climb-up, from a habit which he had while a sailor, of going up the masts by the
                  long rigging, instead of the shrouds, and always coming down by the run.
               They found also that though the King's flag was hoisted, yet the Captain had no
                  commission from the King, nor had ever applied for one, but that the ship had been
                  sent out as a private adventure, with a cargo, which they relied upon for
                  acceptance in the Celestial Country. So Peter and John desired to look at the
                  cargo, and accordingly, Captain Goodenough opened the hatches, and took great
                  pleasure in showing many of the parcels, which were easy to be come at, there
                  being no heavy or lumbering articles, except what had been thrown in for
                  ballast.
               The first goods he showed were a set of boxes, carefully marked and arranged, such
                  as
                  Natural-Affectionâ€”Good-Natureâ€”Kindness-to-the-Poorâ€”Public-Spiritâ€”Patriotismâ€”Obedience-to-Lawâ€”Good-Moralsâ€”a
                  great assortment and variety of things, held in much esteem in the town of
                  Self-Righteousness. There were likewise along with these, certain parcels of
                  Sweet-Temper, Prudence, No-Harm, Good-Neighborship, Punctuality, and other like
                  things.
               PETER.â€”These are all good in their place, remarked Peter, but you do not expect to
                  present these things for sale at the gates of heaven, do you?
               CAPT.â€”And why not? said the Captain. People that possess these commodities must of
                  necessity be proved by them to have been too good to be shut out of heaven. Where
                  can they go? People that are such good citizens and neighbors, such kind parents
                  and friends, so honest and upright, so strict in the payment of their debts,
                  certainly cannot be sent to hell.
               PETER.â€”But are those the terms on which heaven is promised? Did ever the King of
                  the Celestial Country make any such proclamation, as that honesty to man would be
                  accepted in heaven instead of love to
                  God and faith in the Saviour. Moreover, that which is highly esteemed among men is
                  abomination in the sight of God, for he looketh on the heart, and he says, Ye are
                  they that justify yourselves before men, but God knoweth your hearts.5
                   There may be all these virtues in a man's life, and yet in his heart he
                  may have neither love to God, nor faith in his Redeemer, but a great opposition to
                  both. But let us go a little further.
               
                  
                  5 Luke xvi. 15.
               
               In the next lot of boxes which they overhauled, they noticed some that were marked
                  on the top, This side up, with care; which made them rather curious
                  in their inspection, and they found that underneath they bore a very different
                  appearance, as for example, a box marked GENEROSITY, This side up,
                  was found to have three private marks underneath, Love of Applause, Ostentation,
                  Pride. A box marked Industry and Frugality, was privately inscribed Covetousness,
                  and a box marked Gratitude, had, underneath, the words Self-Congratulation and
                  Joy. A parcel marked on the top Self-Denial, This side up, with
                  care, was found underneath to be Self-Seeking. A bundle described as Much Prayer,
                  was written underneath, To be seen of Men, and a package done up as Integrity, was
                  written underneath, In the fear of Man.
               These things made Peter and John remember the King's Words, All their works they
                  do to be seen of men.6
                   But when they attempted to ask Captain Goodenough about them, it made him
                  angry, and he said hastily that the goods had the mark of their owners upon them,
                  and he knew no other; but they were as good as bullion.
               
                  
                  6 Matt. xxiii. 5.
               
               Then they continued their examination only a little longer, but found no small
                  part of the cargo to be occupied with Rudiments of the World, Ordinances,
                  Circumcisions, Baptisms, Commandments and Doctrines of men, and divers boxes of
                  weak and beggarly elements,7
                   among which was a great box marked Apostolical Successions, and another,
                  Sacramental and Ceremonial Regenerations. These things they had not expected to
                  find, and indeed Captain Good-Enough said they did not belong to the regular
                  cargo, but were put in, or ordered aboard, at some of the Only-True-Church
                  Insurance Offices in the Town of Self-Righteousness, for the sake of the
                  underwriters. As to the whole contents of the Ship, the Captain remarked that it
                  was one of the best assortment of goods that had ever gone out of the harbor.
               
                  
                  7 Gal. iv. 9.
               
               Then said Peter, Captain Goodenough, I would not give a single barrel of the
                  King's salt, or a junk of our beef, for your whole cargo. If those that loaded
                     this ship intended to condemn her
                  before-hand with the King, they could not have taken a surer way. You will have to
                  cast your whole cargo overboard, and throw yourself, thus emptied, on the King's
                  mercy, or you will be lost. This trumpery is worse, compared with the gold,
                  silver, and precious stones of the gospel, than wood, hay, and stubble.
               Then said the Captain, all things are not measured by your standard, thank God. We
                  have something else besides fanatical notions of faith to go by. You have put down
                  human nature long enough, and it is high time that virtue as is virtue should be
                  acknowledged, and a man should know his dignity.
               Well, said Peter, if you will do it, take your own risk, but we have delivered our
                  souls. Behold, we tell you by the word of God, that if you trust in these things,
                  Christ shall profit you nothing. Christ is become of none effect unto you,
                  whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace;8
                   yea, ye make the grace of God in vain,9
                   with your hold full of such bundles of self-righteousness. You make your
                  pretended good works your saviour, and yet profess to sail under the King's own
                  flag. Don't you see that this is adding hypocrisy to pride and self-delusion? But
                  it cannot prosper, for the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself upon
                  it, and the covering is narrower than that any man can wrap himself up in it.10

                  10 Isa. xxviii. 20.
               
               Well, said the Captain, be that as it may, I cannot think that all the men in our
                  town were mistaken, some of them the most respectable and wisest merchants in the
                  whole country. I think a man is tolerably safe in such company. And 'tis not at
                  all likely that all their great pains in such a cargo should be lost. There may be
                  defects, as will happen with the best; but upon the whole, they can't but be
                  accepted, for God is merciful.
               God is merciful indeed, cried John, so merciful, that he gave his Son to die for
                     sinners.11
                   But did he ever tell you, or any man in your town, that having done this,
                  he would save a man for his cargo, or that any man could buy heaven with his
                  cargo, or that any man could rely upon his cargo for acceptance and salvation, or
                  indeed that he would ever save any man in any way but by the blood of Jesus
                  Christ, that cleanseth from all sin?12
                   Is there any other way but faith in Christ? And as to a man's company, was
                  Lot safe in Sodom? They were very respectable people in Sodom, in their way, with
                  one another; and your standard, just like theirs, is one another's example, and
                  not God's word.
               
                  
                  11 John iii. 16.
               
               
                  
                  12 1 John i. 7.
               
               CAPT.â€”But a good man is a good man, and good works are good works; and what is to be done with
                  them?
               JOHN.â€”Done with them? I tell you they shall all be burned up; for your very
                  thinking that they are good, without Christ, proves them to be wood, hay, and
                     stubble.13
                   There is none good but One.14
                   They are altogether become evil; there is none that doeth good, no, not
                     one.15
                   And as to their works, where did they come from? Out of what heart? Who
                  produced them? What motives? Was there any love to God? Did they not put the whole
                  cargo together for a bargain? Did they not think they were going to purchase
                  heaven at a price, instead of. having it as God's free gift to lost sinners for
                  Christ's sake? So! is there any thing but selfishness on board? I tell you there
                  are no good works, but in Christ. Christ's love, and a humble faith in him, with
                  repentance toward God, must be at the bottom of them, or else they are only works
                  of the flesh in some shape or another, altogether.

                  15 Ps. liii. 3.
               
               CAPT.â€”Well, well, but after all I cannot and will not believe that any man will
                  ever be lost, who does as well as he can.
               JOHN.â€”As well as he can! cried John. But what sinner ever did, or ever does, or
                  ever will do, as well as he can? Besides, what is to be done with the old score?
                  How is a man to dispose of old sins?
               CAPT.â€”But what if a man's heart acquits him of any evil intention? As long as my
                  own heart does not condemn me, I am sure I am safe.
               JOHN.â€”Now my friend, said John, let me put a case. He that trusteth in his own
                  heart is a fool.16
                   Suppose that in a storm, when the safety of the ship requires a sure
                  anchorage, and all hands have got hold of the anchor to drop it, a sudden insanity
                  should come upon the captain and crew, and instead of dropping it into the sea,
                  they should warp it over the hatchway, and drop it down plump into the hold,
                  imagining that there they had got a safe anchorage! Would that imagination secure
                  them? Or would the sincerity of that mistake save them from destruction? Would
                  their insanity preserve the ship from driving? Would the anchor in the hold keep
                  her from striking on the rocks? Now your reliance on the cargo of virtues in your
                  hold is just like casting anchor down the hatchway. It is all a perfect delusion
                  of Satan.
               
                  
                  16 Prov. xxviii. 26.
               
               CAPT.â€”Well, but after all, a man can do no better than he can. No man ever heard
                  me swear. I never take a drop too much. I always pay my men regularly, and treat
                  them well. I endeavor to walk by the
                  golden rule, and do to others just as I would have others do to me.16
                     What would you have more?
               
                  
                  16 Matt. vii. 12.
               
               JOHN.â€”Captain Good-enough, you make me ashamed for your ignorance. The most
                  uninformed Sailor, that ever pulled a rope on board the King's ship, could teach
                  you better. You can't deny that you are a sinner. I say then, again, what are you
                  going to do with the burden of your sins? How will you have them pardoned? Let me
                  tell you what a poor converted sailor once said to a messmate about faith in the
                  Lord Jesus. I don't know, said he, that I can tell you what it is, or how to get
                  it. But I can tell you what it is not. It is not knocking off swearing and
                  drinking, and such like; and it is not reading the Bible, nor praying, nor being
                  good. It is none of these; for even if they would answer for the time to come,
                  there is the old score still, and how are you to get clear of that? It is not
                  anything you have done, or can do; it is only believing, and trusting to what
                  Christ has done. It is forsaking your sins, and looking for their pardon, and the
                  salvation of your soul, because he died and shed his blood for sin; and it is
                  nothing else. That sir, is a poor converted sailor's definition of faith, for he
                  was taught by the Spirit of God, and knew what he knew from God's Word and from
                  experience. And just that faith you must have, that humble reliance on Christ, or
                  you will die in your sins, and must be lost for ever.
               Now while these words were speaking, a number of the crew had gathered within
                  ear-shot, and Captain Good-enough, lifting up his eyes, saw them intently
                  listening. Then did the devil, by means of the man's pride, take away the good
                  seed that John was trying to sow in his heart; for he turned and said, If I were a
                  poor drunken sailor, or any of my men, then might such a religion be good for us;
                  but we be all good moral men, from the high and mighty town of SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS,
                  and we will not belie the credit of our birth-place, for 'tis an ill bird that
                  betrays its own nest.
               Then did John groan within himself, and said, If our gospel be hid, it is hid to
                  them that are lost, in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them
                  that believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the
                  image of God, should shine unto them.17
                  
               
               
                  
                  17 2 Cor. iv. 3, 4.
               
               But Captain Good-enough was not moved at all; so when they agreed not among
                  themselves, they departed, after that Peter had spoken one word, Well spake the
                  Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers, saying, Go unto this people and
                  say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall
                  not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive; for the heart of
                  this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes
                  have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears,
                  and understand with their heart, and should be converted and I should heal
                     them.18
                  
               
               
                  
                  18 Matt. xiii. 14, 15.
               
               However, they departed not alone, nor without consolation; for one of the men,
                  whose heart the Lord opened, that he attended to the things spoken19
                   of Peter and John, begged so hard to go with them, and enlist in the
                  King's ship, that having got Captain Goodenough's consent, which he was ashamed to
                  refuse, after all that he had said, although very much mortified, they took the
                  man with them, and gave him a place with their own crew, who received him
                  joyfully. The man's name, aforetime, was Better-Late-than-Never, which now they
                  changed, and entered him on the King's books, after much affectionate catechising
                  and instructing of him, as Lost-but-Found. He speedily proved as apt and good a
                  seaman as the best of them, and he had a great many curious and interesting things
                  to tell of his former experience aboard the Good Works, and in the famous town of
                  Self-Righteousness.
               
                  
                  19 Acts xvi. 14.
               
               It was already night-fall upon the deck, when they reached their own ship, and
                  they soon lost sight of the GOOD WORKS in the darkness, though they thought they
                  should see her again the next morning. But when the day broke she was no where
                  visible, nor did they ever see or hear of her from that time. It was a solemn
                  thing to have seen such obstinate blindness, and they all felt that it was only
                  the Lord's wonderful mercy, that had kept them from just such fatal delusion, or
                  had plucked one soul as a brand from the burning. In the evening watch that day
                  they sang a hymn expressive of the danger: 
                     
                        There is a way that seemeth right,
                        The steps go on with ease;
                        And conscience slumbers, while the soul
                        Forsakes the path of peace.
                     
                     
                        A way that lulls the careless heart,
                        There's death upon the air:
                        The soul that sleepeth wakes at length
                        In anguish and despair.
                     
                     
                        There is a way that leads to death,
                        God hath the warning given;
                        And multitudes pursue that way,
                        Still dreaming on of heaven.
                     
                     
                     
                        Then let me tremble at the Word
                        That shows this danger nigh
                        And wake, and pray, and keep the path
                        That leads to joys on high.
                     
                     
                        For God will teach the contrite mind
                        The way of death to shun;
                        He ne'er will leave a praying soul
                        By sin to be undone.
                     
                  
               
            
            
               CHAPTER XVII.
               NONE BUT CHRIST! NONE BUT CHRIST!
               WELL, my brother, said John the next day to Peter, as they were gazing towards the
                  quarter whither their course lay, and watching the bright appearances that began
                  from time to time to fill the horizon; this trusting in Christ is a deeper
                  business than most men imagine, and I begin to think that a great multitude have
                  but very superficial ideas about it.
               Deep? answered Peter, It goes to the very inmost being of a man's soul, and
                  carries everything before it; pride, self-righteousness, self-dependence, all a
                  man's peculiar property it carries away. It brings down all high looks, and vain
                  imaginations, and everything that exalteth itself against God, and brings every
                  soul into captivity to the love of Christ.1
                  
                     
                     12 Cor. x.5.
                  
                   It is stronger than the strong man
                  armed, and taketh from him all his castle, and his goods wherein he trusted.2
                   It leaves him nothing that he can call his own, and what is better, leaves
                   him willing to be stripped of everything, willing to owe everything to Christ.
               
                  
                  2 Luke xi. 22.
               
               JOHN.â€”But some are not so, but seem very unwilling to owe all to Christ, always
                  keeping back part of the price, as it were, some foundation of self-trust or
                  self-merit.
               PETER.â€”Yes, and they that will have but half a Saviour, are most likely to have
                  none at all. He must be everything or nothing. There cannot be in one and the same
                  vessel such a cargo as Captain Goodenough's, and faith in Christ accompanying
                  it.
               JOHN.â€”Faith! There was not even the conception of it. The man evidently did not
                  know what it means, and to say the truth, of the nature of good works he had no
                  better imagination, notwithstanding the name of his vessel, and his own name.
               PETER.â€”Did you ever hear or know of a more obstinate case? But there is never in
                  all the world such blindness as that which seals the heart against Christ and his
                  glory. And it holds on, sometimes, even till death, the man all the while feeling
                  sure of salvation, till he marches up to the door, and hears the terrible voice of
                  the King from within, saying, Depart from me, I never knew you.3
                  
               
               
                  
                  3 Matt. vii. 23.
               
               JOHN.â€”This is a great wonder of sin, this blindness, but a greater wonder it is
                  that any ever see; a wonder of grace, when it pleases God to shine into the heart,
                  to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus
                     Christ.4
                  
               
               
                  
                  4 2 Cor. iv. 6.
               
               PETER.â€”True, most true is this, but men are very slow to learn, even when they
                  have begun to learn; they often stop with the milk for babes, instead of pressing
                  on to perfection. Sometimes they learn this mystery soon, sometimes not till very
                  late, always only by the Spirit. Nothing else can teach it, and God's Divine
                  Providence sometimes seems employed in vain upon men for years, without bringing
                  them to it. I call to mind the case of a man of God, who was one of the King's
                  ministers, or thought he was, a long time, without having seen this light. But one
                  day he went to visit a woman of very great and true humility and piety, whose life
                  everybody felt was that of one of the King's dear disciples, but who was then
                  dangerously sick. Well, he set himself in his ignorance to endeavor to prepare her
                  for death, and so he said to her, I doubt not but you will die calm and happy. But
                  how so, and wherefore? asked the sick woman. Because, said the poor ignorant
                     man, your life has all been made up
                  of a series of good works.
               Oh what a stab of Satan was that! Then did the sick woman groan in spirit at the
                  thought of her own unworthiness, and she sighed deeply, and turned her face
                  towards the man, and answered him thus: If I die confiding in the good works that
                  you have called to my recollection, I know for certain that I shall be condemned
                  and lost for ever; but what renders me calm at this solemn hour is that I trust
                  solely in Jesus Christ my Saviour.
               Now this was what the minister himself had never yet done, what he knew nothing
                  about, though he was thought to be a very holy man, and had been piling up his
                  good works for years, to be accepted of God as his Saviour! But just think of the
                  marvellous mercy of the Lord, and the many ways and means, and sometimes very
                  despised and insignificant instruments, that he makes use of for his own glory,
                  and to bring souls to the knowledge of it. From that time forth the man began to
                  seek after Christ and his righteousness, and he soon found him, and preached him,
                  lifting up Chirst and his cross and his love and simple faith in him, and no more
                  good works as the soul's saviour. And he afterwards said, when he told this
                  history of the Lord's saving mercy to his own soul, that those few words from the
                  mouth of a dying woman who was reputed a saint, and who he thought was going to
                  glory on her good works, opened his own eyes for the very first time. If that
                  woman could not be saved by her good works, then he was sure that he could not by
                  his. And now he began to find out Christ, and from the time that he trusted in
                  him, he preached him to others, so that many others found him, who had before been
                  in darkness.
               JOHN.â€”Well, that was great mercy indeed, great grace. And sometimes those that
                  struggle so long in the dark without ever finding Christ, love him better than
                  others, and see him more clearly, and keep to him more closely, and talk about him
                  more warmly, than those that knew him from the outset. Oh, the blessings that cost
                  the most we always prize the most. There is nothing like having to go through
                  storms to make a harbor precious. When a soul has been almost shipwrecked forty
                  times, yea, has been every day going down into darkness and the deeps, then to
                  come at once into a fair, safe haven, with the sky clear, and the sea as gentle as
                  a baby, and the green and fragrant land all locking you about, Oh, then the land
                  is sweeter than it ever was before. You think you will never go to sea again,
                  except under the King's commission. Yet perhaps the very next voyage that offers,
                  you'll be sorely tempted. But what
                  seaman was it that made that hymn in the dogwatch, for the King's honor? 
                     
                        In form I long had bowed my knee,
                        But naught attractive then could see
                        To win my wayward heart to Thee,
                        My Saviour!
                     
                     
                        Yet, though I had so long withstood,
                        Thou didst redeem my soul with blood,
                        And Thou hast brought me nigh to God,
                        My Saviour!
                     
                     
                        Through storms and waves of conflict past,
                        Thy potent arm has held me fast,
                        And Thou will save me to the last,
                        My Saviour!
                     
                     
                        And when the voyage of life is o'er,
                        I hope to gain the heavenly shore,
                        And never grieve thy goodness more
                        My Saviour!
                     
                  
               
               PETER.â€”'Tis a sweet hymn, and whover it was that wrote it, must have had a happy
                  time, even in his dog-watches, for the presence and smiles of the King can make
                  any place comfortable. Bnt a man is never happy, who is not happy in his mind.
                  There's Captain Good-enough, with all his cargo, and all his certainty of finding
                  a market for his wares, in the Celestial Country; do you suppose he is always at
                  ease?
               JOHN.â€”Why truly, I know not; but there are some men, whose strength is so firm,
                  that they have no bands even in their death, no terrors, no plagues, no troubles,
                  as other men.5
                   Yet are they none the happier for that. For a man had better be in trouble
                  and in terror all his days, than die in his sins. But I marvel that so much good
                  and evil could be mixed together in the Captain's cargo. If Satan himself should
                  sift it, he could not have it all.
               
                  
                  5 Ps. lxxiii. 4, 5.
               
               PETER.â€”Well, I don't know about that. You would have to judge the heart about
                  that, and God only can do it. But there was nothing good, unless there was good
                  behind it, unless it came from good, and was put into the ship for good; and I
                  doubt whether anything was put there, but just to make a trade for heaven. Now
                  there be men that are always seeking self in all things, and your self-righteous
                  men are of this stamp, for they do every thing either to be seen of men, or else
                  to bribe God, but nothing out of love. But a man's very virtues are turned into
                  vices, if they grow out of self, if he has no view but self-advancement in them.
                  They are rotten, and it is abominable hypocrisy for him to offer them as virtues
                  in any market, knowing as he does, that he would not have had them in his hold at
                  all, but for selfish purposes. He never put them there because the King commanded it, nor out of regard to his master,
                  but just to drive a bargain with them.
               Even that nice-looking box on board Captain Good-enough's ship, that was marked
                  Kindness-to-the-Poor, and that ought to have been fresh and genuine, if any thing
                  was, you would have found, if you could have opened it, either to have contained
                  some smuggled contraband article from the town of Self-Righteousness, or else as
                  full of worms as ever a box of figs or remainder biscuit after a long voyage.
               As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.6
                   The intention and the purpose are everything, and a man may be intending
                  to make a wrong use even of his virtues, and if so, then they are condemned and
                  broken. You know a ship may be a good ship, but suppose it be discovered that she
                  was built as a slaver, and is engaged in slaving, why then she is taken as a
                  pirate. There are some things that are lawful, like the law itself, if a man use
                  them lawfully,7
                   but if he put them in the place of Christ, if he set out to make a saviour
                  of them, if he mean to smuggle himself into heaven by them, then they are
                  piratical, and must be treated accordingly.
               
                  
                  6 Prov. xxiii. 7.
               
               
                  
                  71 Tim. i. 8.
               
               Or if a man be making stepping stones of them, and instead of entering into the
                  sheep-fold by the door, boosts himself up by means of them, to climb over some
                  other way, the same is a thief and a robber.8
                   Captain Good-enough was well-named Old Climb-up. Such a man may think he
                  had good works to stand upon, yea, to climb upon, and he may draw up his ladder or
                  his under-pinning after him into the sheep-fold, but if he had forty thousand such
                  bolsters or beam-ends to rest upon, the more he has, the worse for him. Striking
                  through the lubber-hole would be nothing to that.
               
                  
                  8 John x. 1.
               
               JOHN.â€”And yet he felt sure he was going on well and that all was right and safe.
                  But the man's ignorance was surprising, and any man that has ever seen the King's
                  Compass, or any true sailor's logbook, ought to have known better. But I have
                  heard of men who knew so little about sea affairs, that they could not tell the
                  mainbrace from the Captain's breeches. Captain Good-enough had a catalogue of
                     virtues, but knew nothing about Grace. It is like
                  carrying a cargo of topsails, but neither yards nor masts. And yet he must have
                  been active in his way, for he could climb to the main truck without touching
                  shrouds or foot-ropes.
               PETER.â€”The King will not only have the right things done, but in the right way. A
                  monkey might get to the mast-head by the running rigging, but a good seaman will
                  go up the shrouds. There is never a true virtue but faith in Christ must be at the bottom of it. Some men take their
                  virtues as light lumber, that, in case of shipwreck, they may swim upon, as the
                  soldiers that were with Paul got to shore on planks and broken pieces of the
                  wreck; for really, though they think they trust Christ half way, yet they do not
                  trust him at all. They pretend to have got under weigh, having all sail set, and
                  the flag hoisted; but the anchor is down all the while, and they never will weigh
                  it, unless they can first have assurance of a safe voyage. But that is a thing,
                  you know, that the King keeps in his own hands, and will make no bargains
                  beforehand, except with faith. But where there is faith, there is no desire for
                  any bargain beforehand, and no need of any. The soul says, I leave everything with
                  Christ, and Christ may do as he pleases; but I'll serve him, any way, come what
                  may.
               JOHN.â€”Well, my brother, you speak in this according to the Law and the
                     Testimony?9
                   There is certainly nothing good, except the heart be good,
                  and good works never yet mended a bad heart, any more than the waters of a stream
                  can change the fountain. No man ever yet got a good heart, or ever will, but in
                  Christ. All things else may be brought to Godâ€”gold and silver, prayers, penances,
                  sacrifices, and what not; but no good heart ever yet was brought to him, except
                  through Christ. And so he saith, Christ in you, the hope of glory.10
                   No hope of glory, except Christ is the soul of it. The meek and lowly
                  spirit cometh no other way.
               
                  
                  9 Isa. viii. 20.
               
               
                  
                  10 Col. i. 27.
               
               And so he saith, that to this man only he will have respect, even to him of a
                  contrite spirit, and who trembleth at his word.11
                   Yea, without this, and the humble faith in Christ that bears it up, he
                  that killeth an ox, is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as if he
                  cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered swine's
                  blood; he that burneth incense, as if he blessed an idol.12
                   Whereby God saith, that the very things commanded as duties, if done with
                  a proud spiritâ€”done without faith in Christâ€”done in reliance upon self-merit, are
                  no better than sins; yea, they are dog's-neck duties, he that burneth incense to
                  them, and cometh with them, burneth incense to an idol, and cometh to God with the
                  idol of his own worship in his own hands. It is a terrible delusion, and may the
                  Lord preserve us from it.

               PETER.â€”Well, I sometimes think, terrible as it is, it is the last devil that is
                  cast out. In this form Satan is always at hand to plague us, and the King himself
                  does not reign supreme, till every high ima- gination is cast down, as Dagon, and every thought
                  brought into captivity to the obedience of Christ.13
                   When our life is thus hid with Christ in God,14
                   then, oh, then! we begin to be truly at peace and quiet. Yea, then is
                  Christ in us the peace of God that passeth all understanding.15
                   Then is self all gone, and heaven begins on earth.

               But, as I said, if ever there was a man, in whom it was thus all gone, before the
                  seal of deathâ€”before mortality itself was swallowed up of life,16
                   I know not the man. Even Paul counted not himself to have attained to
                  this, or become perfect, but only to be reaching forth, and pressing on,
                  forgetting the things that were behind.17
                   Nevertheless, he said, Our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we
                  look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile body, that
                  it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby
                  he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.18

               So, the leagues of ocean we have passed over, we forget, and still every day have
                  to cast all upon Christ as at the outset, and every day we need forgiveness, and
                  every day the Divine Spirit must fill our sails, and waft us onwards; and if any
                  time we stop to consider our progress, and say, This is ours, as if
                  we of ourselves had done some great thing in getting thus far; then is the Lord
                  ready to smite us, and the wind is all taken out of our sails, because we give not
                  God the glory; then, there is that villian, Pride, who is always the forerunner of
                  Satan; for he smelleth for him, and leadeth him, as a pilot-fish doth the shark,
                  ready to cut our shrouds for us, and give us a grievous fall. The life of self is
                  our death; the death of self in Christ is our life; 'tis the last enemy that shall
                  be destroyed. But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this
                  mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying
                  that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. And thanks be to God, who
                  giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.19

               JOHN.â€”Yea, brother, self hath as many lives as a cat, and pride hath the appetite
                  of a shark, and will swallow everything. Grace itself disappears in the maw of
                  that monster. Yet grace shall conquer himâ€”shall swallow him, if we only hold on to
                  Christ. 'Tis a sweet word of the watch, None but Christ! none but Christ! Have you
                  not lain awake sometimes, thinking, Where is God, my Maker, that giveth songs in
                  the night?20
                  And then that word has
                     
                     20 Job xxxv. 10.
                   come, as
                  if booming across the deep, or borne on the wings of the wind from a distant
                  vessel, None but Christ! none but Christ! Oh, 'tis a sweet sound! Then I say to
                  myself, I can do all things through Christ that strengtheneth me.21
                   I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless, I live; yet not I, but Christ
                  liveth in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of
                  the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.22
                   Oh, those are precious words, Who loved me, and gave himself
                  for me! Sometimes I say to myself, when Satan would take them away
                  out of my mouth, Why may I myself not have them, as well as Paul? I am as big a
                  sinner. Then Satan draws back, and the fear of death itself is conquered, and God
                  seems to have given me the victory.

               PETER.â€”Well, indeed, there is none other victory. And this is the victory that
                  overcometh the world, even our faith.23
                   This is the King's victory, in us, over the god of this world, and by this
                  he will bring us off conquerors. Nothing but this can sustain us in life, nothing
                  but this can comfort us in death. We must throw all upon Christ. A man that had
                  been a faithful servant of God, as the King's Ambassador, once lay a dying, when
                  he was visited by a dear and loving fellow-minister. This man, seeing him so near
                  death, put the question to him, And what are you doing now, my brother? Whereupon
                  he answered, "I'll tell you what I am doing, dear brother, I am gathering together
                  all my prayers, all my sermons, all my good deeds, all my ill deeds; and I am
                  going to throw them all overboard, and swim to glory on the plank of
                  Free-grace."
               
                  
                  23 1 John v. 4.
               
               JOHN.â€”Well, we've nothing else to swim upon, and even then, 'tis not our swimming,
                  but his grace, that holds us up. We should as often dive down to the bottom, as
                  swim upon the top, if it were not for that. And who is it that makes our weather
                  for us? Who knows what is the best weather? Why, verily, we know not even what to
                  pray for as we ought,24
                     unless out of the same Free Grace his Divine Spirit teacheth us.
               
                  
                  24 Rom. viii. 26.
               
               Now the time wore away in such talk with surprising rapidity, and if the days were
                  as days of heaven, the nights that followed were still more lovely. For indeed no
                  language can tell the glory of the starry sky above the ocean, as they now flew
                  upon their voyage, nor the beauty of the sea beneath the waxing and waning moon;
                  for they could follow its increase from the first silver thread of light, to the
                  brilliance of the full orb, and then again as it slowly, gently faded from the
                  sky. And when it was riding in the
                  heavens in silent majesty, it seemed to look down upon them, in the loneliness of
                  the wide ocean, with a melancholy tenderness, as if appointed of God to watch over
                  them. And those long, long lines of light, streaming from the furrows and liquid
                  undulations of the waves, between them and the horizon, when the moon was an hour
                  or two before setting; and at the horizon the whole ocean shining as if it were
                  nothing but a sea of tremulous, billowy light, rolling into infinitude, so that if
                  they could only be there, where the eye followed the glory, they could have
                  sailed, without death or change, right into the expanse of heaven! So it sometimes
                  seemed to them, and they were almost in an ecstacy of transport with such views.
                  Sometimes the silence of midnight, under such a lovely sky, was broken by the
                  notes of a hymn rising and floating in indescribable sweetness and melody. 
                     
                        Beyond, beyond that boundless sea,
                        Above that dome of sky,
                        Farther than thought itself can flee,
                        Thy dwelling is on high:
                        Yet dear the awful thought to me
                        That thou, my God, art nigh:â€”
                     
                     
                        Art nigh, and yet my laboring mind
                        Feels after thee in vain,
                        Thee in these works of power to find,
                        Or to thy seat attain.
                        Thy messenger the stormy wind,
                        Thy path the trackless main.
                     
                     
                        These speak of thee with loud acclaim,
                        They thunder forth thy praise
                        The glorious honor of thy name.
                        The wonders of thy ways;
                        But thou art not in tempest-flame,
                        Nor in day's glorious blaze.
                     
                     
                        We hear thy voice, when thunders roll
                        Through the wide fields of air;
                        The waves obey thy dread control,
                        Yet still thou art not there;
                        Where shall I find him, O my soul,
                        Who yet is everywhere!
                     
                     
                        Oh not in circling depth or height,
                        But in the conscious breast,
                        Present to faith, though veiled from sight,
                        There does his Spirit rest.
                        Oh come, thou Presence Infinite,
                        And make thy creature blest!
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               THE LAST ENEMY.
               NOW all through the day they had seen lovely strange birds flying, and sometimes
                  alighting at the mast-head, and this, with the sight of some flowers of exquisite
                  beauty among the sea-weed that came floating by, made them think that they could
                  not be very far from land. And in the evening, when the sun set, it no longer went
                  down straight into the ocean, but seemed to sink behind a towering cloud-ridge,
                  which they knew might veil a continent, but whether of the Celestial Country, or
                  of this, they could not tell. They kept watch all night, and compared their course
                  and observations very earnestly and carefully with the chart, where they found it
                  written, at the point near which it was evident they had now come, Thine eyes
                  shall see the King in his beauty; they shall behold the land that is very far
                     off.1
                   They also found, by references in their tables, such results of their
                  calculations as these, For this God is our God for ever and ever; he will be our
                  guide, even unto death.2
                   Also, Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterwards receive me to
                     glory.3
                   Also, I will behold thy face in righteousness, I shall be satisfied, when
                  I awake, with thy likeness.4

                  4 Psa. xvii. 15.
               
               In the morning when the sun arose, they thought they could plainly descry, behind
                  the white cloud that still rested on the sea eastward, what seemed the flashing of
                  light from glittering spires and domes, but they were not certain. That same day a
                  sail was seen at a great distance, and as it drew near, it proved to be a
                  sentinel-ship from the King to meet them, whose sign was an almond tree and a
                     grasshopper.5
                   There was a broad white flag flying at the foremast, and by the help of
                  the glass they could plainly read these words, Precious in the sight of the Lord
                  is the death of his saints.6
                   Then did they both gaze long in motionless silence, for though the sight
                  was beautiful, and the sea smooth and calm, yet an awe stole irresistibly across
                  their souls, and a deep solemnity brooded upon them, not knowing what was to
                  happen. Nor was it removed by the loving-kindness of the commander of this ship,
                  although he was very cheer-
                  
                     
                     5 Eccl. xii. 5.

                   ful and
                  encouraging both in his words and looks. He entered into sweet conversation with
                  them, and told them that they must here wait the King's pleasure, which would soon
                  be made known to them. He also showed them where they might safely drop anchor,
                  for in the King's ship they were to go no farther. There is no more sea,7
                  said he, though you have come all this long way through storms and dangers.
                  But now the glorious Lord will be to you a place of broad rivers and streams,
                  wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ships pass thereby.
                  And the inhabitants shall not say, I am sick. The people that dwell therein shall
                  be forgiven their iniquity.8
                  
               
               
                  
                  7 Rev. xxi. 1.
               
               
                  
                  8 Isa. xxxiii. 21, 24.
               
               You have come, said he, all this way through deaths and sorrow and crying, with
                  many changes and dangers; but now there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor
                  crying, neither shall there be any more pain; for the former things are passed
                  away. Out of the earthly house of this tabernacle dissolving, you pass into the
                  tabernacle of God, and God will dwell with you, and you shall be his people, and
                  God himself shall be with you, and be your God, and God shall wipe away all tears
                  from your eyes.9
                   The sea also shall give up its dead,10
                   and them which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.11
                  At these words they were much comforted, and listened further to the man as
                  he took them to their place of anchorage, and there bade them watch.

               There is no safety, said he, till you put off this tabernacle. For even in these
                  parts the great Pirate hath at times made his appearance; and why should he not,
                  since whole fleets are sometimes convoyed by him to the last hour, and sometimes
                  the King's own ships give him opportunities of attack here, that he never found
                  all the way across the ocean. Therefore watch, for blessed are those servants whom
                  their Lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing.12
                  
               
               
                  
                  12 Luke xii. 37.
               
               Now the manner of the man was at times so exceeding grave and solemn, especially
                  when he gave them this charge, that though both his countenance and his words were
                  full of love, and he looked upon them with a face of joy, as if it had been the
                  face of an angel, yet Peter and John could not help trembling, and their sins
                  began to rise up before them, even those things that had been long forgotten, and
                  because they lost sight, for a season, of the face and promise of the King, the
                  thought of so soon standing before God caused them to shrink back with dread,
                  because of their own unworthiness, although they had now so nearly gained the
                  point after which they had been
                  struggling. They tried hard to dismiss their fears, but unbelief would still be
                  uppermost, and so it was a darker time with them than it had been for many days of
                  their navigation. They did not then know that Satan was trying, even with a last
                  assault, to throw them from the Rock Christ Jesus, and to make them look about for
                  some other hope of salvation, even some comfort and assurance in themselves, and
                  to make them unwilling or fearful even in the full view of their own guilt, to
                  throw all upon Christ.
               Now the man witnessed their perplexity, and pitied them, for he had not yet left
                  them at their anchorage, and he could understand their trials, and knew the nature
                  of this conflict. So he cried out, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?13
                   Wherefore do ye doubt?14
                   Have ye played the man thus far, and will ye now give place to the fiery
                  darts of the Wicked One? Remember ye not how it is said that the just shall live
                  by faith,15
                   and that ye are made partakers of Christ, if ye hold fast the beginning of
                  your confidence steadfast unto the end.16

                  16 Heb. iii. 14.
               
               Oh Sir, exclaimed Peter, but what can we do? Will the Lord receive such sinful,
                  vile creatures, without destroying us? for alas we have not been faithful to him,
                  but exceedingly unprofitable.
               Then said the man Did he receive you at first as great sinners or great saints?
                  Had you ever anything to bring him but guilty hearts, to be renewed by his grace?
                  If he received you as guilty lost sinners, was it not that he might be merciful
                  unto you forever? Yea, the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.17
                   What can you then say to these things? If God be for you, who shall be
                  against you? He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how
                  shall he not with him also freely give us all things?18

                  18 Rom. viii. 34, 31.
               
               Then said John, great sinners need great faith. Lord keep us from adding to all
                  our guilt the last and greatest sin of unbelief. While we were yet sinners, Christ
                  died for us; much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved
                  from wrath through him.19
                   Yea, moreover, do we not remember the hymn we have so often sung amidst
                  the roaring of the sea. 
                     
                        Begone, unbelief, my Saviour is near
                        And for my relief will surely appear,
                        By prayer let me wrestle, and he will perform;
                        With Christ in the vessel, I smile at the storm.
                     
                     
                        His love in time past forbids me to think
                        He'll leave me at last in trouble to sink;
                        
                        Each sweet Ebenezer I have in review
                        Confirms his good pleasure to help me quite through.
                     
                     
                        Determined to save, he watched o'er my path,
                        When Satan's blind slave, I sported with death;
                        And can he have taught me to trust in his name,
                        And thus far have brought me, to put me to shame?
                     
                     
                        Since all that I meet shall work for my good,
                        The bitter is sweet, the medicine is food;
                        Though painful at present, 'twill cease before long,
                        And then, O how pleasant the conqueror's song!
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  19 Rom. v. 8, 9.
               
               Now while they were speaking thus, it so happened that Peter was seated with
                  gloomy downcast countenance upon one of the King's guns, and as his hand
                  unconsciously played about it, he encountered the raised letters of the
                  inscription which it bore, and turning his eye upon them, he saw them shining like
                  the sun, IT IS GOD THAT JUSTIFIETH, WHO IS HE THAT CONDEMNETH? Whereupon the whole
                  passage came into his soul as the lightning. Who shall lay anything to the charge
                  of God's elect? It is Christ that died, yea, rather that is risen again, who is
                  even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. Who shall
                  shall separate us from the love of Christ?20
                   Then was his countenance lightened, and his heart was glad, and he said.
                  Though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I will fear no evil, for
                  thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.21
                  
               
               
                  
                  20 Rom. x. 32-35.
               
               
                  
                  21 Psa. xxiii. 4.
               
               Then the Captain of the King's ship took them by the hand, and pointed to the
                  bright outline of the cloud that rested on the sea, and said, smiling, Be no more
                  faithless, but believing.22
                   Hath he not said, I, even I, am he, that blotteth out thy transgressions
                  for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins? And this he saith, though he
                  hath said also, in the very breath before, Thou hast made me to serve with thy
                  sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.23
                   But O, there is forgiveness with him, and plenteous redemption,24
                   and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth from all sin.25
                   For Jesus' sake all things are possible, and the great sweetness of your
                  salvation is this, that it is all of grace, all of grace. When Paul himself was
                  about anchoring in this roadstead, for the last will of the King, he said, This is
                  a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the
                  world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.26
                   But the sight of his own sins at that time, and of himself as the chief of
                  sinners, instead of casting him into despair, or filling him with gloom, in doubt
                  and unbelief, only served to exalt and glo-
                  
                     
                     22 John xx. 27.
                  
                  
                     
                     23 Isa. xliii. 24, 25.
                  
                  
                     
                     24 Psa. cxxx. 4, 7.
                  
                  
                     
                     25 1 John, 1, 7.

                   rify his Saviour. It humbled himself indeed, and
                  cast out all remnant of pride, if there was any left, but O how lovely, how
                  glorious, how triumphant, it made the grace of Christ appear! Now what if your
                  sins are great, if Christ's redeeming love and mercy are so much greater? Is it
                  not so much the more to his praise? Wherefore let Satan accuse you as much as he
                  pleases, even to his uttermost, (and you know that he is the accuser of the
                     Brethren.27
                  ) that shall but exalt the Lord Jesus, and make him the more precious; let
                  it not terrify you.
               
                  
                  27 Rev. xii. 10.
               
               Sometimes the enemy sets hard upon weak souls, just at this very point, and makes
                  life a burden to them, by the very terror of death; but that is unbelief; he never
                  gains this advantage in any other way. Wherefore remember that the prayer and the
                  plea with which you came into God's kingdom of Grace, is the very prayer and plea
                  with which you must enter the kingdom of glory, For thy name's sake, pardon mine
                  iniquity, for it is great.28
                   Satan may tempt you to think, Oh if my sins were not so great, then might
                  I stand before God with less terror! But what a dishonor to the King is that!
                  Would you lessen the praise of his grace by pretending the smallness of your sins?
                  Oh, no sin is small, and every sin must have cost the blood of Jesus Christ to
                  redeem you from it, even if that had been the only sin ever committed. But the
                  very greatness of your sins is the power of your plea for redemption, coming in
                  the name of Christ. Great sinners, you said, need great faith; but one sinner
                  needs the same faith as another, and it is always great faith and precious, when a
                  soul cometh to God, and crieth out, For thy name's sake pardon mine iniquity, for
                  it is great. You see the prayer is not, as Satan would have it, Pardon me, for I
                  am a little sinner; that would be a great lie to the King, and a great contempt of
                  the power of his blood, and the freeness of his salvation; but, Pardon me for
                  Jesus' sake, because I am a great sinner, whose only plea is that Jesus died for
                  the chief of sinners. Here we rest.
               
                  
                  28 Psa. xxv. 11.
               
               Now when the man had finished these words of instruction and comfort, he left them
                  for the present, having directed the ship to a secure position. Here then they lay
                  at anchor, waiting the King's Word.
               Sometimes it was tempestuous in the roadstead, for even here the Prince of the
                  Power of the Air hath now and then dominion, and raiseth a great commotion among
                  the waves of the sea; and it was said that the King might, of his good pleasure,
                  permit this, as a last trial of the faith of those for whom he was pre- paring a crown of glory. But often the
                  weather was clear, calm, and delightful. Sometimes a thick veil of mist lay upon
                  the whole region beyond this roadstead, or rather rose up like a wall or a curtain
                  before it, and only now and then was partially broken away, so that they could
                  see. Sometimes, when it was thus broken, there came flashes of light streaming
                  from a great distance through the cloud-rifts, in which could be plainly discerned
                  parts of that City that lieth four square, the building of the wall of which is of
                  jasper, and the City pure gold, like unto clear glass.29
                   Sometimes the foundations of the wall of the city were disclosed, even
                  unto the twelfth and last, which was an amethyst, and then the gates could be
                  seen, which were of pearl.30
                   With the use of the King's glass, these things seemed very near when they
                  could be seen at all, and the sight of them was ravishing to the heart, for there
                  was a light round about them, full of glory, and it shone down even on the
                  sea.
               
                  
                  29 Rev. xxi. 16-18
               
               
                  
                  30 Rev. xxi. 19-21.
               
               Moreover, in fair weather there were boats sometimes shooting forth with fruits
                  from the land, foretastes, as they were called, for the refreshment of the King's
                  seamen, after their long voyage. Also, they could sometimes hear songs in the
                  night, as of persons in the air, but very near them; and in the day, it was
                  sometimes the case, that celestial forms could be discerned, or what seemed to be
                  such, walking in the edge of the clouds, where they rested on a glittering pearly
                  beach, as on the shore of the ocean. And now it came to pass, that notwithstanding
                  their seasons of darkness, they began earnestly to desire to be clothed upon, that
                  mortality might be swallowed up of life, saying, one to another, He that hath
                  wrought us for the self-same thing is God.31
                  
               
               
                  
                  31 2 Cor. v. 4, 5.
               
               But they were given to understand that still there was a bar to be crossed, where
                  two seas met, and where the passage might be dark and rough, or it might be as
                  smooth and shining as a summer's sea; but that would be according to the strength
                  of their own faith, and the good pleasure of the King, whenever he should summon
                  them. They were informed, also, that they would have to pass that place in an open
                  boat, which, itself, would also disappear from them, as they crossed the bar. At
                  this their spirits were somewhat damped at first, but there was no help for it,
                  nor any other way of ever coming to the City. Sometimes it seemed as if they could
                  have flown thither, but they were to wait the King's pleasure, neither could they
                  take a step farther but by notice from him.
               Now, being thus situated, the two men spent no little time in pondering the King's
                  Chart, reviewing their log, and
                  considering all the way the Lord had brought them. They comforted one another in
                  much prayer, and in a mutual reminding of the King's great promises; for they
                  rested only upon his infinite love, his cleansing blood, his sanctifying grace;
                  and they said one to another, If the Lord were pleased to kill us, he would not
                  have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he
                  have showed us all these things, nor would, as at this time, have told us such
                  things as these.32
                   And sometimes they would lean over the taffrail of the ship, and gaze
                  towards the heavenly light before them, and say one to another, Even so, come,
                  Lord Jesus, come quickly!33
                   Here the glass was of but little use to them, for it would not penetrate
                  the cloud, except when there were the rifts that have been spoken of, and,
                  moreover, they could see no farther from the mast-head, than from the deck.

                  33 Rev. xxii. 20.
               
               How sweet it is to know, said John to Peter, that our times are in his hands,34
                   and that he hath the keys of death and hell.35

                  35 Rev. i. 18.
               
               Yes! oh, yes! exclaimed Peter. My soul cleaveth to his promises; for, oh, he is
                  faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and cleanse us from all
                     unrighteousness.36
                   Oh, the sweet power of his most precious blood! What should we do without
                  that, at such an hour as this! What should we do without his dying love to rest
                  upon, and his blood that cleanseth from all sin. And oh, how precious his own most
                  comforting assurances. All that the Father giveth me, said he, shall come to me;
                  and him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out. And again, No man can come
                  to me, except the Father which hath sent me, draw him; and I will raise him up at
                  the last day.37
                   What precious security of life, from the Father and the Son!

               JOHN.â€”Yea, that is a blessed assurance, This is the Father's will
                  which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me, I should lose nothing, but
                  should raise it up again at the last day.38
                   If the Good Shepherd had not loved his sheep, and determined to keep them,
                  he had not laid down his life for them.39

                  save to the uttermost all that come unto God through him.40
                   How great and glorious the promise, I give unto them eternal life; and
                  they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My
                  Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is

                  my Father's are one.41

               JOHN.â€”Oh, if we are his, no doubt we are everlastingly his. It is not
                     him that my soul ever doubteth, or distrusteth, but myself. If I
                     should be mistaken, it is for eternity. Lord, save me, I
                     perish!42
                  
               
               
                  
                  42 Matt. viii. 25.
               
               PETER.â€”That, dear brother, must be our last prayer, as it was our first. We are
                  stripped, as at the beginning, and have lost all things but Christ, yet we have
                  all things in him. Our fellowship is with the Father, and with his son Jesus
                     Christ;43
                   and the plank of Free Grace, on which we too may swim to glory, may
                  venture death without fear, is just this, THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST HIS SON
                  CLEANSETH US FROM ALL SIN.44
                  
                  
                     
                        Shudder not to pass the stream,
                        Venture all thy care on him;
                        Him, whose dying love and power
                        Stilled its tossing, hushed its roar.
                     
                     
                        Safe is the expanded wave,
                        Gentle as a summer's eve;
                        Not one object of his care
                        Ever suffered shipwreck there.

                  44
                  
               
               Now when the time came for them to take their departure, it was, by the mercy of
                  the Lord, a lovely day, and they knew that the hour was come, because the King's
                  boat was seen coming for them, with a white flag flying, on which was written the
                  inscription, My flesh and my heart faileth, but God is the strength of my heart
                  and my portion for ever.45
                   Who or what guided the course of this boat, they could not tell, only now
                  it was plain that they were to step down out of the ship, and be taken across the
                  passage. So, as if an angel had them in hand, they felt themselves constrained to
                  quit the long familiar deck, not without pain at thus leaving it, and they went
                  down, something as Peter did of old, when he walked on the water to go to Jesus.
                  But now it was not stormy, but on the contrary, the sea was so quiet, that the
                  very undulations, on which the boat rose and fell, were like the breathings of a
                  sleeping infant. So they were wafted along, and in a moment could no longer
                  distinctly see what they were leaving, but the ship became dim, and then was gone
                  from their sight for ever. But all the while the sea remained so quiet that they
                  hardly knew when the bar was reached, and meantime a softly breathing melody rose
                  upon the air, BLESSED ARE THE DEAD WHO DIE IN THE LORD,46
                   which was still ringing, when a shining wave went over them, and the boat
                  at the same time passed from under them, and was seen no more; and then they
                  
                     
                     45 Psa. lxxiii. 26.
                  
                     
                     46Rev. xiv. 13.
                   found themselves with angels, rising as
                  from a burial, having left their mortal garments in the sea. And even as they
                  rose, they found themselves clad in white raiment, for it was thus that they were
                  to walk with the King in white, being worthy.47
                   They did not know when they were unclothed, nor how they were clothed
                  upon, but it was plain now, that mortality was swallowed up of life.48
                   And indeed the bliss they now experienced was so great, that nothing but
                  an Immortality freed from sense could have enabled them to bear it. And they shone
                  like the sun, so that the angels looked on them with ravishing joy, but they
                  themselves with still greater amazement and ecstacy looked upon the angels. And so
                  they went up to the City. 
                     
                        Firm as the earth thy gospel stands,
                        My Lord, my hope, my trust
                        If I am found in Jesus' hands,
                        My soul can ne'er be lost.
                     
                     
                        His honor is engaged to save
                        The meanest of his sheep;
                        All whom his Heavenly Father gave
                        His hands securely keep.
                     
                     
                        Nor death, nor hell shall e'er remove
                        His favorites from his breast,
                        In the dear bosom of his love
                        They must for ever rest.

            MEMORIALS OF THE LIFE AND TRIALS OF A YOUTHFUL CHRISTIAN,
            
               in pursuit of health, as developed in the Biography of Nathanial
               Cheever M.D. By Rev. Henry T. Cheever. NEW YORK. Charles Scribner.

            "The reading of this volume has resulted in profound respect and love for the
               character delineated on its pages. As an example of filial and fraternal affection,
               we know of nono more worthy of imitation. The subject of this history was
               pre-eminently a sufferer, and at short intervals arrested in his progress by the
               frequent return of an incurable malady. Yet would his trusting, elastic mind recover
               itself on every mitigation of his disease, and resume its progress. His perseverance
               was wonderful, and bore him onward to great attainments in knowledge and piety. There
               were numerous crises in his short life, in which it seems as if almost any other
               youth must have died. At two several times he voyaged to Malaga, in Spain, and
               resided there for several months each time. Thence he sailed to South America, and
               resided for a time at Monte Video and Buenos Ayres, and returned home by the way of
               Spainâ€”making another stay at Malaga. Being compelled by the nature of his disease to
               relinquish his early cherished hope of being a minister of the gospel, he turned his
               attention to medicine, completed a course of studies, and took a diploma from a
               Medical College in New York city; and being unable to endure a northern climate, went
               to Cuba, and established himself in practice at Trinidad, a pleasant city on the
               southern side of the Island. In a few months, feeling death to be near, and wishing
               to die among his friends, as he had no Protestant Christian near him, he set sail for
               home, died on the passage, and was buried in the sea. Of all the countries which he
               visited in pursuit of health, he has left interesting notices, relating to soil,
               productions, general appearance, curiosities, character of the people, their
               government, manners, customs and religion.
            But the great charm of his character is his intelligent and faithful piety, which
               scarcely ever waned, whatever the unfavorable circumstances by which he was
               surrounded. He served his God, when he had no human helper, as was the case in some
               of his sea voyages, and some portions of his sojourn in Catholic countries. He
               remembered the Sabbath day: and if no public sanctuary opened its doors where he
               could be fed with the sincere milk of the word, he spent it in retirement with his
               Bible and his God. We invite our young men to peruse this book."â€”Christian
                  Mirror, Portland.
            
            "The interest of this memoir is peculiar. It has none of the fascination of a life of
               romance, of ambition, or of excitement, in the world of business, politics, or
               letters; but it has the deeper, holier attraction of a spiritual life, beautifully
               developed under the chastening hand of Providence. His character well answered to his
               nameâ€”he was an Israelite indeed in whom there was no guile. While the outward man
               perished, the inward was renewed day by day. He grew in the likeness of God.
            "The memoir is written with good taste and discrimination. The melancholy event that
               bore away this loved brother from the family circle, has long enough gone by to allow
               even a brother to contemplate his character with a good degree of impartiality. His
               delineation tends strongly to illustrate the grace and the glory of God, as displayed
               in the work of human sanctification."â€”Independent.
            
            "The coolest reader will find here such traces of a bright, trusting, gentle and
               submissive spirit, and discern in his experiences, such evidences of the admirable
               potency of grace, that he will hardly fail to reap both of tender interest, and rich
               instruction. Those, especially, who knew the lamented sufferer, will receive his
               memorials with emotion. The hardest lessons of life were beautifully learned and
               exemplified; and every Christian may find in his gentle submission and affectionate
               trust, both an example and an encouragement. It is a work to be particularly
               commended to the young, and might be most profitably introduced to the household
               circle, and to the Sabbath-school library, as furnishing an unusually beautiful
               example of early piety, and of the consolatory power of
                  religion."â€”Evangelist.
            
            "As a record of youthful piety, disciplined and matured in the school of physical
               suffering, this is an instructive book. It is a fraternal memento of departed worth,
               embodying the spirit and thoughts, and words of a beloved brother, called from earth
               just as life seemed to open to him a sphere of extensive
                  usefulness."â€”Christian Observer.
            
            "We have in this volume a beautiful offering from two highly gifted brothers to the
               memory of a third. The individual here commemorated, though not known to fame, was a
               choice spirit, nurtured in the school of disappointment and rich in the Christian
               graces. The biography strikingly illustrates the vanity of human hopes, and the
               sustaining power of Christianity, and shows how the principle of the better life can
               gather nourishment from the cup of sorrow."â€”Albany Argus.
            
            "Seldom do we see such demonstrations of affections so closely entwined as meet us in
               this interesting volume. In all this we see much of the true, genuine Puritan of New
               England; for no where in this wide and selfish world are the domestic and social
               affections so generally and warmly cultivated as in this land of the Puritans. In
               reading the introduction by Dr. C., we think of the friendship of Saul and Jonathan,
               who were so lovely in their lives. Seldom have we read so minute a detail of the life
               of any one as we have here of this amiable young man. Copious extracts from his diary
               may be found in this volume, all of which evince a heart deeply imbued with the love
               of divine things. Such a work, put into the hands of the young, is calculated to
               impart much of its sentiments, and thereby accomplish much good."â€”Christian
                  Intelligencer.
            
            "This is an affectionate tribute to the memory of a departed brother, written in the
               glowing style of the author's recent productions, but with a touching pathos to be
               found in no other of his published works. The brother of whom he writes, was
               Nathaniel Cheever, M.D., a lovely Christian character, nearly the whole of whose life
               on earth was a protracted struggle after health, whose mind and spirit were thus
               tried in the furnace of affliction; and came forth like gold from the fire. It is
               full of the most weighty Christian lessons, and no one can peruse it and not be
               struck with the originality of the character illustrated, nor without laying it aside
               a wiser and better man."â€”Albany Spectator.
            
            "As a book for the family, appealing alike to the secret springs of feeling in the
               heart of the parent or the child, we have read nothing of late possessing equal
               merit. The beautiful example it portrays of parental and filial love, of cheerful
               Christian fortitude and faith amid the early trials and discipline, the hopes and
               fears, and vicissitudes, of an eventful life; the varied incidents of travel, noted
               in distant lands and when a lone sojourner or otherwise upon "the wide, wide sea,"
               invest the work with rare interest. Honored widowed mothers, whose heart's wealth is
               garnered in their children, self-reliant, affectionate and noble brothers, devoted
               sisters who feel that through life's brief pilgrimage: 
                  
                     "â€”â€”The love of a brother shall be
                     An ornament richer and dearer by far,
                     Than pearls from the depths of the sea;"
                  
                youthful Christians who desire to profit by the experience of one who at their
               own age chose the "one thing needful" and proved an unfailing treasure when other
               hopes had perished; will all find the perusal of this volume a stimulant to the best
               emotions and noblest purposes. It deserves to be read the world
                  over."â€”Advocate and Female Guardian.
            
            "The beautiful affection which has instigated and pervades the volume, is one of its
               most charming features. With all allowance for fraternal partiality, the subject of
               the memoir was an unusually ripe and experienced Christian, and the memorials left by
               him are replete with a spirit that is better than genius. The work, in many respects,
               is one of very great interest, and will form a most useful manual for young
               Christians. As an exemplification of youthful piety in its better aspects, it would
               be well fitted for the Sabbath School Library, as well as for the Christian
                  fireside."â€”Christian Parlor Mag.
            
            "This is a rare book. It is rare in the peculiar providences which fashioned the
               character it depictsâ€”rare in the sympathizing and discriminating affection of the
               fraternal pens by which it is writtenâ€”rare in the revelations of deep and artless
               piety which it unfoldsâ€”rare in its helpfulness to those who are aided to follow
               Christ by the sight of the tollings of others of like infirmities toward the heavenly
               hills. We put it on our shelves by the side of the life of Mary Van Lennep, as
               another round in the ladder by which we are daily striving to climb
                  upward."â€”Boston Congregationalist.
            
            "This book will do great good in many ways, and for many reasons. It presents one of
               the finest and most beautiful illustrations of the strong ties of a New England home.
               The record, moreover, is true. There is not a stroke of the painter's
               brush about it. Only the near connection of the writer te the subject of his memoir,
               and to the parties exhibited, has led him to keep back more than he has told, of that
               affection and kindness which burned so brightly and constantly around the youthful
                  hero; for he was one in the highest and best sense.
            There was great manliness and great simplicity in his character. The
               writer has often listened with astonishment to his comprehensive and catholic
               opinions, of men and things abroad in the world, though he himself was as a caged
               bird. Every young man should read this book, and learn that perseverance is the grand
               secret of success in life.
            Every Christian should read and study this life in the furnace of affliction. It is a
               new, fresh, and strengthening commentary upon all the passages of Scripture which
               speak of the afflictions and the consolations of the people of God. The
               whole narrative is a vivid exhibition of those paradoxesâ€”" Troubled on every side,
               yet not distressed; perplexed, but not in despair; cast down, but not destroyed;
               always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of
               Jesus might be made manifest in our body."â€”Puritan Recorder.
            
         
         
            
            Cheever's Sandwich Islands.
            LIFE IN THE SANDWICH ISLANDS;
            OR, THE HEART OF THE PACIFIC, AS IT WAS AND IS.
            BY REV. HENRY T. CHEEVER,
            Author of "The Island World of the Pacific," "The Whale and his Captors," etc. With
               engravings, 1 vol. 12mo, 355 pages.
            An agreeable addition to Rev. Mr. Cheever's former works on the Pacific, written in a
               kindly tone to Christian and Heathen, with an allowance, not always made in books of
               this class, for the doubts and prejudices of the latter, as well as the labors and
               teachings of the former. The Sandwich Islands offer, in various ways, many points of
               interest; in the romantic and tragic interest attached to their discovery, the
               generally amiable character of their inhabitants, their rapid advance in civilization
               under the influence of American missionaries, who have, in this field, met with a
               success in extent and rapidity unequalled since the time of the early Jesuit Fathers,
               their important commercial position, and the beauties and peculiarities of their
               natural characteristics. Information, full and interesting, is given on all these
               points in the present volume, and it will be found an agreeable and sensible work,
               with an appendix containing valuable commercial statistics.â€”Literary
                  World.
            
            There are but few readers, however well read, whose knowledge of the interior of the
               Sandwich Islands may not be greatly increased by this work. With its pleasantly told
               narrative of experience and adventure, it presents so many characteristic facts,
               anecdotes, and illustrations of native life and missionary labor, as to afford vivid
               pictures of things as they really are. The history of the missionary effort is
               admirably and justly told. It is illustrated by a variety of well-engraved views, and
               is written in a pleasing, lively style, the value of which is much enhanced by its
               unaffected religious spirit.â€”New York Evangelist.
            
            In the volume before us Mr. Cheever has invested the rise and progress of these
               people from heathenism with the charms of romance, and presents the reader with a
               dioramic picture of varied beauty. It gives a most interesting sketch of a people who
               he supposes will, ere long, in the ordinary course of events, become one of the
               States of our own confederacy, and furnishes in an appendix of some fifty pages, a
               statistical view of the resources, trade, population, &c. It will be read with
               pleasure by young and old.â€”Parker's Journal.
            
            We know of no volume which surpasses this in absorbing interest, and we take pleasure
               in commending to our readers the sensible and delightful view which it presents of
               "Life in the Sandwich Islands, or the Heart of the Pacific, as it was and
                  is."â€”Phil. American Courier.
            
            We never tire of reading accounts of the Pacific Islands. The fertility of their
               soil, the beauty of their climate, and the romantic interest which attaches to the
               population, and the prospects which are opening to them in the advancement of
               civilization, all attract readers to every well-written account of their condition.
               Mr. Cheever has already distinguished himself by several works upon kindred subjects,
               and has shown an intimate acquaintance with the Pacific. This present volume is a
               work of rare value.â€”Providence Journal.
            
            Who would have conjectured, half a century ago, that such a book as this could have
               been writtenâ€”a book describing a nation reclaimed from the dominion of Paganism, and
               brought in so high a degree under the enlightening and purifying influence of
               Christianity! Mr. Cheever, in comparing the past with the present, and thus recording
               some of the most signal triumphs of the Gospel in modern times, has rendered good
               service to the cause of missions, while he has communicated much valuable information
               concerning the manners and usages of the people of whom he writes. The book seems to
               have been designed specially for seamen, but we mistake if it has not quite as
               important a mission to perform on the land as on the water.â€”Puritan
                  Recorder.
            
            As a picture of the Sandwich Islands of the present day, we have nothing more
               complete than this volume. It is written with a spirited and fanciful pen, and
               contains so much that is truthful and life-like delineated in an exceedingly
               agreeable vein of narrative, that the work will impart entertainment to all
                  readers.â€”Hunt's Merchants' Magazine.
