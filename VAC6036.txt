            To Catharine—my Sister:
            TRUSTING in a love and friendship which have never failed me, and which it were not
               less than a folly and a sin to doubt at this hour, I inscribe the following Tale to
               you, a young, high-hearted woman. Affection for the companion of childhood and youth,
               for the sharer in griefs and joys since infancy, would of itself prompt such a
               dedication. I have, beside, another potent reason: it is as though I laid an offering
               on an altar, in the name of Religion, Purity, and Love.
            The work that I have done has been wrought in no careless, thoughtless mood. You will
               acquit me of idly dreaming through the pleasant summer-time time that has just passed. You know that I have worked
               in earnest-heartedness, with a definite aim. If it be shown that I have labored to no
               purpose, I shall at least have your sympathy—your disappointment I shall more than
               share. For I have done with my might what my heart prompted me to do; and failure
               would not grieve me because it was mine, so much as would the thought that Truth and
               Justice, for which I aspired to speak, had suffered thereby.
            We watched the summer as it came in glory. We have seen it fade away and die, as we
               have seen many another friend: and now withered leaves are around us everywhere. They
               who came at my bidding from the world, to abide with me in the past happy months,
               have gone away again, and I find myself in this autumn presenting their likenesses to
               such as care to look upon them—calling them "CHILDREN OF LIGHT," yet not because they
               answer to the scriptural definition, but for the reason that they are suggestive and
               dear to me.
            They are portraits of human beings—not of angels of light, nor of darkness—of such
               children as the parent gives to the keeping of the world, with prayers, and tears,
               and faith.
            To you, and through you to the Loving, and Patient, and True-Hearted, scattered
               everywhere through this Dominion of the King of the Universe, the Father Almighty, I
               intrust them; never dreaming, however, even for an instant, that they will escape
               their penalty—for, they are pictures of human beings, wrought by human hands! More I
               need not say.

            THE CHILDREN OF LIGHT.
            
               I. ASIA—THE SOLITARY.
               THERE was a picture-gallery—on a small scale, to be sure, still they called it a
                  picture-gallery—at Maderon house, in which were to be seen several very good
                  family portraits, and the masterpieces of half-a-dozen artists who were more or
                  less distinguished in their day.
               Often, during the absence of the Maderon family, had ASIA PHILLIPS found her
                  favorite occupation and resource in the contemplation of these various paintings.
                  Every sort of representation had a charm for her; pictured life she loved to gaze
                  upon: for, to her mind, the meanest portrayal was a symbol and a type of something
                  better and truer than the artist had been able to achieve; the gates and archways
                  of life were, to her fancy, covered with hieroglyphic glyphic pictures: by these alone she formed a
                  notion, and an original conception of the world, and the things therein.
               With the progress of years, and growth of her mind, Asia's taste concerning these
                  adornments of the gallery had changed and enlarged. She was conscious of it, and
                  that of herself she had come to the consciousness; for since the daughters of
                  Maderon house went from home with their stepmother, to complete their education,
                  and acquire some knowledge of the world, Asia Phillips had been left to
                  herself—she was allowed to become her own educator.
               While the young Maderons were at home, she had studied with them, and recited to
                  the same governess; and duly and daily impressed as she was, with a sense of her
                  marvellous opportunity, and being, as she was, a girl of great natural ability and
                  spirit, she profited so much by these advantages, that when the governess was
                  dismissed, and Blanche and Vesta went away, she might be said to need no longer
                  such instruction as she had hitherto received. A different quality, a higher
                  order, might well have followed that which the poor governess was able to impart;
                  but Mrs. Maderon had said it was hardly possible that a girl in her position would
                  be benefited by a higher culture than that she already had. Therefore, Asia was
                  left to herself.
               What followed? The work of Nature. Seeking and finding; questioning and answering;
                  application of outer facts to inner wants; a sense of need, and a high resolve to
                  satisfy that need.
               When she and Vesta Maderon, in the old time, used to run thoughtlessly on through
                  the gallery to the play-room beyond, they had sometimes stopped in the midst of
                  their headlong course, to return the look of a pictured knight, whose eyes most
                  strangely followed them, whichever way they turned. Asia could never forget that
                  morning, when she had waited so long for the coming of Vesta—-how she, looking
                  with wonder and dread on those said eyes, discovered then their marvellous power
                  of looking in every direction without a turn of the head!— and how, when she had
                  drawn the attention of Vesta to them, they had run out in haste from the place,
                  and how that many months had gone by before she could prevail upon herself to pass
                  through that gallery, except in breathless speed.
               Since that day, however, the charm of life had seemed to be associated with all
                  the pictures. They were like friends to her—they were better than friends. Before
                  them her active imagination would weave, in connection with the things
                  represented, and the artists who had wrought them, and herself, the strangest and
                  wildest fancies, and fictions more enchanting than any tales of romance she had
                  ever read.
               Asia did not understand herself, or she would  have known why it was that she never felt content
                  with gazing on the images as they hung upon the walls; why it was that she must
                  endue them with life and motion—must call them down from their high places, and
                  make them answer whatever purpose her fancy or feeling chose to have them.
               Old men, women, and children, the knight, the priest, the saint, the nun, the
                  splendid head that was adorned with those triumphantly-despairing eyes, the
                  beggar-girl, little Red Riding-Hood, the deer, and the water-fall, the ruin
                  covered with ivy, the broken bridge, the cathedral, and the fine landscapes, had
                  each and all to do with that great picture of the world which she fashioned of
                  them. And in that world it was her life to live. She created for herself a
                  likeness of herself, it was a being essentially different from that she really
                  appeared to be, and she placed it as an inhabitant in the universe fashioned by
                  her imagination.
               What was Asia Phillips? A lonely, misanthropic creature, dissociated from the
                  young and the gay? a mere gazer on that which her fancy created? Nothing of the
                  kind.
               When she became capable of entering into the thoughts of the artists, she would
                  frequent that hall of pictures, and by any one of them her mind could be absorbed,
                  to a total forgetfulness of all beside what was there suggested. No enthusiast
                  ever entered more devoutly into the spirit of an artist's work than she. Whichever
                  way her eyes turned, they recognised the author in his achievement. She had before
                  her the many-varying moods of mind, the solitary days and nights which must
                  precede an hour's satisfying work, the moments of inspiration, and the days of
                  labor through which the recollections of such moments must suffice to carry him:
                  by intuition she perceived all this, and it was not difficult for her to form an
                  idea of the self-confidence in which the artist must repose when he contemplates
                  the theme he would portray. But when she likewise thought of the absolute quiet,
                  the necessary loneliness, imposed upon him who would be the master of his
                  subject—the hard study—the unvarying self-denial, an instinctive dread, that she
                  should know altogether concerning this same day, made her tremble and shrink away
                  from the contemplation. How to her could any such reward as artists win seem in
                  the least degree commensurate? For her mind did not yet recognise the fact, that
                  with the aspiration the only true reward springs up within the soul!
               And yet, she questioned, is it thus that the reward must come? Could the doing
                  satisfy the longing? Was it possible that the pursuance of Art, and its
                  cultivation, could be attended by such feeling as that of which she was aware when
                  in pursuance of her daily, common duties? Many an hour did Asia Phillips waste, so
                  the housekeeper assured her, in  these
                  lonely musings in the gallery of Maderon house; many a great question did she
                  propose to herself there, concerning the deep mysteries of the artist's world, and
                  life.
               In the worst light possible hung two pictures, toward which the young girl always
                  went last, and in contemplation of which she remained longest. They were both, as
                  she knew, the work of a youth who had once spent a summer at Maderon. In token of
                  his gratitude, he had presented them, before his departure, to the owner of these
                  grounds, which had been open to him—a paradise, whose beauty had renewed his hope
                  and courage, and aroused to the utmost whatever of talent he had.
               One of these paintings, Asia had heard Mr. Maderon say—that in which the three
                  figures were represented—the artist had intended as a portraiture of his three
                  children; for, in those days, Mr. Maderon always called Asia, "child."
               The figures were a representation of three forms of Beauty—Spiritual,
                  Intellectual, and Physical. Purity, with the dove, her emblem, in her hand, and a
                  halo about her head, was the central, and most perfectly-executed figure. At her
                  left stood Intellect, in advance of either of the other forms, the laurel about
                  her brow, and her hand resting upon a globe. Glowing with physical life and
                  strength, sate, half reclining, the type of Pleasure at the right of Purity; the
                  smile of the world upon her full, red lip—the light of the worldling in her
                  eye.
               Mr. Maderon had not spoken of the figures respectively, nor assigned to either of
                  his children the manner in which they were to develop—to his mind they only stood
                  as fair types of lovely womanhood—the three Graces; Asia one of them, by courtesy,
                  of course—by kindness, rather; for she was an alien from the house of Maderon, and
                  it was not in her power, while he lived, to command courtesy of people in society,
                  rich and courted as these Maderons.
               But Asia bore in mind, she could not forget, what Mr. Maderon had said. She strove
                  to read the language of the eyes—the revelations made by positions and adornments;
                  and, as she grew older, she was at no loss to discern the spirit of the figures,
                  the symbolic character of the piece, nor to understand that the artist had really
                  chosen his ideas from life, and represented them in the spirit of prophecy. This
                  discovery was made long after the Maderons had gone from home. And on that day she
                  made it, Asia could well understand that Vesta did indeed hold, as she had many
                  times in playful presumption claimed her right, the central position occupied by
                  the Spiritual Beauty. And, although not one of the young people thought of the
                  proper names to be assigned to these semblances, Asia saw how it must be that
                  Vesta Maderon ron, in the world, would
                  take that stand of Purity which womanhood and loveliness would make worthy of the
                  halo.
               But where was Asia's position? and what power had the painter intended Blanche
                  Maderon to represent?
               Half assured, yet fearing to entirely assure herself, Asia, as she stood one day
                  gazing upon the picture, called the house-maid to her as she passed, and bluntly
                  asked her which of the portraits bore a likeness to herself. The girl at first
                  laughed, and said, in a light way of reproof: "What a strange creature you are,
                  Asia Phillips."
               But then, willing to humor her, because she was so odd, and because Asia had been
                  a favorite with the late Mr. Maderon, and the playmate of his daughters as well,
                  the girl examined the picture, and the living face that was so patiently and
                  expectantly turned toward her.
               A slow surprise at length gathered force of expression in her face; 
                     aud
                     and
                   she finally said, fixing her bright, bird-like eyes on Asia:—
               "Well! if I ever! cover the lower part of your face with your hand, so."
               Asia obeyed her.
               "You are as like this here as two peas," said the girl. "It's curious. What
                  possessed you to think you looked like that figure with the green leaves on the
                  head? I know you thought so, for you had your eyes on it all the while. Say, what
                  made you?"
               "Oh I don't know, I thought so, that's all," replied Asia. "Did you ever see
                  anybody like the figure on the other side?"
               "No.... Seems to me I have, too. Who can it be, I wonder?"
               "Think."
               "It's somebody I know."
               "To be sure—as well as you do me; better too, probably."
               "Oh, I can't think. It is n't myself, that I'm pretty sure of."
               "You must think. Try.
               "Must! None of your musts to me, if you please. But I can't stand fooling here all
                  day. And I dare say you've guessed for yourself. You are such a bother!"
               "Is it like Miss Maderon? Miss Blanche, you know."
               "I'm beat! Yes, yes! You may go to the head, Miss Phillips, as the little
                  governess used to say. Yes, I should think she'd make just such a lady,
                     I should. Of course, then, the middle one is for Miss Vesta. But I
                  haven't got time to look into that now. Shut the gallery-door and lock it after
                  you, when you come out. Don't forget." And the maid went singing on her way.
               The wreath upon her head! What might that  signify, and why had it been placed there? Did it
                  seem the natural place for such a crown to the artist who had painted it? or, was
                  it a mere adornment, thoughtlessly placed there because it seemed appropriate to
                  the style of face? Or, had some thought of inspiration bidden him portray it? and,
                  had he obeyed the suggestion, hardly conscious of what he did?
               She remembered the artist; she had many times watched the progress of his works:
                  but what could he have known of her? or what did any one now know of her that
                  would warrant such a representation of herself? She had read of victors who were
                  crowned with wreaths after great conquests; she had read, too, of Corinne. But, as
                  she thought of these and of herself, she bent her head—once for very shame, and
                  once for laughter—as she saw herself thus arrayed, her future self; for it was
                  that, of course, for which the honor was reserved.
               But if she was ashamed, and if she laughed, both these emotions passed, and a
                  desire, firm and fixed, took their place—a desire to know what she was, and what
                  was her destiny.
               The other picture hanging in this miserable light was of A MARTYR. It had a
                  strange fascination for our unconscious yet impassioned connoisseur. The villain
                  throng to which the victim's eyes were directed, was not portrayed; but the
                  expression of the work, which made its worth, was such, that every attendant scene
                  and circumstance of the tragedy came, involuntarily, before the mind of whoever
                  looked upon the wondrous face. The artist had painted the human being, as well as
                  the Christian Love—the Enthusiast of Humanity, as well as the Soul of Faith. He
                  was looking, not only his trust in God, but his sense of the passion that had led
                  the multitude to this final deed of murder.
               Often had Asia made this work her study. Often had she called before her mind,
                  while gazing on it, the priestly bigot and the passionate people, the curious, the
                  scornful, the mocking, the wonder-stricken, the taunting men and women; all that
                  host which would be sure to gather thus together to witness the death of a
                  saint.
               The martyr was not a youthful sacrifice. He was in the prime of manhood. Years had
                  not yet dimmed the eyes which shone forth in such lustrous magnificence. The form
                  was stately and serene; the brow undaunted, bold, and full—not a line to give
                  evidence that body or spirit had ever, for a moment, yielded to passion, or to
                  care of any kind. Valiant, the perfect man loomed up in solitary grandeur before
                  the sight, and left a memory on the mind for ever.
               This picture was glorious in the eyes of Asa Phillips. She never looked upon it
                  but to long for some such life as the martyr must have led; to live for some great
                  purpose, or to perish for some noble 
                  end: this was all she asked, but this she asked incessantly.
               It was not strange that her mind should rejoice in escaping to a thought even like
                  this, dreadful as it might seem to one so young. For, of the humdrum life, as she
                  called it, which she led, she had already wearied. To be struggling for some
                  purpose—to be doing some great, some weighty deed—to be recording some individual
                  achievement—why was not this possible for her? Why? why? The question recurred to
                  her as often as she opened her eyes to the light of morning, or closed them to the
                  darkness of night. It was the question of the soul, and the soul will admit no
                  evasions.— To whatever it asks, it will have an answer. You can not look it down,
                  you can not silence it.
               But one other of the paintings had made a distinct impression on Asia's mind—and
                  this was of a nun. It was a pale, youthful face, back from which was thrown the
                  white veil. With the readiness of true genius, Asia also placed herself in the
                  position of the young life which had thus assumed the shroud of the convent. She
                  beheld herself voluntarily renouncing the common joys of life, resigning herself
                  to solitude, and to convent labors. She fancied herself passing through the
                  doubts, and the torments of doubt, to which a young life must be subjected before
                  it can come voluntarily to such renunciation.... She beheld herself prostrate
                  before fore the altar, an actor in the dreadful ceremonial that should separate
                  her from all outward life, from communion with the world. She heard the organ's
                  chant, beheld the robed priests, and the solemn, saintly sisterhood, and thought
                  upon herself as consecrated to the new life she had chosen, in possession of that
                  deep peace which might be supposed to fill the breast of one who had so dissevered
                  herself from the things of time, that knowledge of them, even, could reach her
                  nevermore. And sometimes—for Asia was a proud, shy, solitary girl—this would seem
                  a covetable state of being. But again life would press around her, and dreams of
                  love would haunt her, and the prescience of that great Fact, which had as yet no
                  name, would cause her to turn with shrinking dread from looking on the cloistered
                  bride, to the crowned figure, and the laurel wreath.
               NEARLY five years had elapsed since Mrs. Maderon escorted the daughters of her
                  late husband to a city at some distance from Maderon, which city was somewhat
                  famous on account of its "seminaries of learning:" there it was that their
                  education was to receive its finish. Since that time of departure the daughters
                  had but once returned home; but Mrs. 
                  Maderon had flitted to and fro, as it seemed, continually; and these flittings
                  were made in such a rapid, business-like way, that Asia had but seldom caught even
                  a glimpse of her.
               And now Mrs. Maderon had come again—report said, to remain; and it was said, also,
                  that she had preceded Blanche and Vesta Maderon by only a few days. To learn if
                  this were true, Asia Phillips made herself ready the morning after Mrs. Maderon's
                  arrival, to go up to the house and inquire of the lady; for her curiosity mastered
                  the antipathy she had always felt toward the mistress of the place; which peculiar
                  sentiment, it may as well be said here, was cordially returned by that
                  individual.
               Mrs. Maderon was in the gallery; and Asia, learning this, went thither to speak
                  with her. With a timidity rarely evinced by her, she passed through the hall to
                  the window before which the lady stood.
               "Mrs. Maderon," she said, for her approach had been unobserved.
               There was a quick turning of the head, and those well-remembered, dull, blue eyes,
                  from which petty, but evil passions, spoke still so clearly, were fixed upon her.
                  Asia was aware that she shrunk back as that cold and careless glance of
                  recognition met her. Vexed that she had exposed herself to a manner of greeting
                  which, however, had been anticipated ticipated, she quelled the angry thought that
                  was aroused—had she not come to ask concerning the return of Vesta Maderon? The
                  answer she should hear to that question would more than compensate
                  for any personal indignity.
               "Well, Asia! this is you! How you are grown! Are you very well?"
               Mrs. Maderon compelled herself to say this. She had observed the embarrassment the
                  girl betrayed: and that she had observed it Asia quickly perceived; and an
                  indignant flush swept across her face as she asked:—
               "The young ladies did not return with you, Mrs. Maderon?"
               How hateful the words with which she must now speak of her old playmates, sounded!
                  How hard it was for her to address Mrs. Maderon thus! Yet Asia's self-control was
                  admirable; she spoke with respectful ease and perfect calmness.
               "They come on Saturday," was the reply; "there are four days still. Do you think
                  you will remember them, Asia?"
               "Remember them! Remember Blanche and Vesta Maderon!"
               "Miss Maderon, and Miss Vesta. Yes: do you think you would know them?"
               "It would be very strange if I did not, when I have lived with them almost, for
                  more than ten years. I think I should as soon forget anything as  them. They were the only playmates I ever had, Mrs.
                  Maderon."
               "Hum ..... Old times make a strong impression on some minds. But you must see that
                  the ladies are no longer children, or—or playmates, exactly."
               "Nor companions, perhaps you would say, Mrs. Maderon."
               "Nor companions, eh?—very true—nor companions."
               "I know it." There was too much of bitterness in the voice that said it.
               "That is fortunate." There was more than needful asperity in the tone.
               "They have by this time forgotten me—quite forgotten me."
               "O I do n't know; likely, though—very probable. Much that you know nothing
                  of—their studies, and society, in turn—has occupied them. It was, meanwhile, very
                  natural, I allow, that you should think so much of them. I can not wonder at
                  that."
               "But not at all likely they should think of me? Yes, ma'am, I understand. Still, I
                  will hope that Vesta Maderon has not forgotten me. You say she is coming home on
                  Saturday."
               Asia turned to go as she spoke thus; but Mrs. Maderon, whose practice it was to
                  always improve the opportunity offered by the present moment, called her back.
                  Asia retraced her steps at once; Asia knew when to obey.
               "You do not seem to understand," said Mrs. Maderon in her cool, bitter way, "that
                  the young ladies of Maderon house occupy a different position from that they held
                  when they were children."
               She paused and looked at Asia, who replied:—
               "Oh yes, Mrs. Maderon, I quite understand that."
               "And, consequently, that what might be proper to the playful nature of a child
                  might not be proper for the dignity of a woman."
               "I can see the force of that. Yes, ma'am, I understand."
               "You are a quick-witted girl, as of old, Asia. I shall not need to say more."
               But Asia seemed to think that an exposition of that quick-wittedness was
                  requisite; and she therefore made all haste to utter words which must be repented
                  of afterward, as surely as an afterward should come.
               "I think with you, ma'am, that there is no need. Still, allow me to express what I
                  suppose to be your meaning. There may be some points which you will wish to
                  present yet more clearly to my mind. The Misses Maderon are now no longer
                  children, nor am I a child. It therefore behooves me to keep at a respectful
                  distance from them and you. Mrs. Maderon, perhaps a sense of propriety would have
                  taught me the same thing, and you might have  spared yourself the pain it must have occasioned
                  you to make such a suggestion. Trust a little more to the common sense of those
                  with whom you deal, let me beg in the name of all those who hold the same position
                  that I do. And, pardon me—an eye for the ridiculous might be of some
                  service."
               "Be so good as to leave the gallery, and wait for an invitation before you come
                  into it again."
               Mrs. Maderon forgot herself, and spoke in a quick, passionate way, that excited
                  her own disgust. Asia bowed and obeyed her.
               "A poor, ignorant creature!" thought Mrs. Maderon as Asia went. "I wish to Heaven
                  that abominable pride could be put out of her. Maderon spoiled her; he made her
                  believe that she was somebody."
               "Cruel, stupid fool!" muttered Asia. "What reason have I to care for you, or for
                  any of the Maderons?"
               But, as she said it, the recollection of the generous-hearted and unpretending
                  Vesta Maderon, as she used to be, came before her; and Asia loved that
                  recollection far too well to place her under the sweeping condemnation she felt
                  inclined to pass upon the family.
            
            
               II. ASIA—THE WOMAN.
               IT was late in June, and the village of Maderon was in its glory. Standing on the
                  borders of the lake, at almost any point, and looking through the valley upon
                  streamlet, field, and wood, at one hand, and the distant village at the other, the
                  view seemed to the gazer to comprise one immense garden—a magnificent garden, so
                  fertile, so well cultivated, were the lands through all that valley.
               The lake mentioned was a part of the Maderon property. The family of the original
                  owner of a vast tract of land in that region, of which Maderon was but a small
                  portion, and from which the village had received its name, had never parted with
                  the grounds which compassed the sheet of water: it lay  in the central part of the estate in possession of
                  his descendants. From the wooded land that spread along the western shore of the
                  lake, the finest view of Maderon house and place was to be had. For this reason it
                  had been a favorite place of resort with the late owner of the noble domain; but
                  since his death it had not been frequented, save by one visiter.
               A skiff one evening was drawn to the farther shore, and at a little distance from
                  it sate Asia Phillips, on one of the old rustic benches built there for the
                  resting-place of whoever might choose to seek the solitude of the lake-shore.
               In the loveliness of this place of retreat, where not the sound of a bird, nor the
                  faint noise of the dropping leaf, was to be heard; where the golden light fell
                  brightly and softly from the horizon, beneath which the sun had disappeared; where
                  there was fulness of life, and yet the silence of death—her tempest-swept brain,
                  untouched by the calm, unsoothed by the delicious fragrance freighting the air.
                  Asia brooded over an open book; and her bright eyes, absorbed by no pictured form,
                  or vision, or dream such as might befit the time and place, wandered keenly and
                  searchingly, looking not to discern the mysteries and the beauties of the nature
                  around her—they were absorbed in the contemplation of the mystery of her own
                  human, woman nature.
               This was what she read:—
               "From the first moment when I began to reflect, I have always thanked God that I
                  was not born a woman, deeming them the bestowers rather than the enjoyers of
                  happiness—the flower-crowned victims offered up to the human lord of creation.
                  Passing over the early period of her life, which, however, is one of perpetual
                  restraint and unwearied subjection to the most self-denying forms and observances,
                  we will suppose a female to have attained a fitting age for that great and
                  paramount end of her being, marriage. Men have a thousand objects in life—the
                  professions, glory, ambition, the arts, authorship, advancement, and
                  money-getting, in all their ramifications, each sufficient to absorb their minds,
                  and supply substitutes in case of primary failure; but if a woman succeed not in
                  the sole hope of her hazardous career, she is utterly lost to all purposes of
                  exertion or happiness; the past has all been thrown away—and the future presents
                  little but cheerless desolation."*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *Horace Smith.
               
               Asia closed the book as she read this passage, and, throwing it far from her
                  impatiently, she relapsed into the musing mood that was becoming so habitual with
                  her.
               "'The sole hope of a hazardous career,'" she repeated—"'glory, ambition, arts,
                  authorship, money-getting getting,
                  advancement'—and woman has nothing to do with all these things! 'Cheerless
                  desolation'!—'paramount end of her being'! The man did right to thank God he was
                  not born a woman," was her conclusion. "I loathe the very name. It is only
                  significant of weakness, and folly, and bondage. I shall not thank God that
                     I am born a woman."
               To self-examination she then proceeded. But it failed, as ever, to occasion in her
                  self-condemnation. Honestly she admitted to herself—
               "I loathe the work I have to do. Some other person could do it just as well. I
                  have the ability to do something greater and better—something that will amount to
                  more in the general issue. Another person could wait on Aunt Milly just as well as
                  I. Poor old creature, it makes no difference who serves her, if she is only
                  served. She is a great deal better off without her wits than I am with mine; as
                  long as I am a woman, I almost wish I were in her place! Uncle would hardly miss
                  me if I were away—though I do believe he loves me—but he would love anybody that
                  loved him. Poor old aunty! no wonder she talks about 'the sea and the waves
                  roaring, and men's hearts failing them for fear." What a world it is—like a great,
                  furious sea!—and I wonder if our hearts were meant to quail
                  continually? We run to and fro just like blind men: it's a marvel Providence don't
                  weary of seeing us. When will there be a great calm again, like that which came
                  over the wild sea when Jesus stilled the tempest?
               "I am sick of myself. I'm sick of everything around me that I see or know. I wish
                  I had been born among the mountains. If I had, I believe I should have been
                  glorious. I would never have tended sheep though.
               "I hate such tame scenery as this; it makes us all tame and flat. If I were a man,
                  I would very soon discover what there was for me to do. I'd have some dernier resort beside that of every living girl—I'd
                     never fall in love! I would be clear of dragging out my life in
                  the kitchen, or of putting myself down to the mending of old clothes, or of
                  finding my recreation in walking over the lawn and garden, for all the world like
                  a stupid animal, and nothing more. Quiet and stupid, a well-trained dog! when I
                  feel like rushing out, strong enough to fight all the battles of the world, and
                  with some little disposition that way too, I must confess, Asia Phillips. If I
                  were only a man, no one should stand higher than I; but here I am, only a woman—a
                  housekeeper, the mistress of an hospital as I might say, to be kept in my 'proper
                  sphere' and 'place,' and never to stir an inch out of it in any direction, for
                  fear that all creation would turn out against me, and hunt me down, as they would
                  a wild beast! Oh, these laws of propriety—these  ridiculous customs, that have no shadow of
                  meaning—this miserable human pride! There are Blanche and Vesta Maderon—ah, yes,
                  'Miss Maderon and Miss Vesta.' I wonder if I shall forget their proper titles, in
                  case I ever find occasion to say a word to them! Of course, it's precisely as Mrs.
                  Maderon so politely suggested—times have changed. We're not children
                  now. I'm glad of it—I am glad of that. They are women; so am I. It's no more
                  Blanche, and Vesta, and Asia—what a gulf! I'm glad of that, too, when I consider
                  it. They will have nothing to do with me .... they shall have nothing
                  to do with me. Hu! it's not such a very dreadful thing as one might suppose, to be
                  left alone to one's self. Robinson Crusoe was happy enough, I dare say. Happy
                  enough—Asia Phillips, sitting here alone, and always alone wherever you go, or
                  whatever you do, no matter who is with you; humble creature, who can have no right
                  to hear, or see, or think for yourself, least of all to speak for yourself, would
                  you give up what you have, and take the place of that Mrs. Maderon, with her dull,
                  ugly eyes, and her intolerable pride? 'Nay,' saith the spirit, 'there is no such
                  wish or pride as that in your heart, poor Asia! Whatever else you may be that is
                  horrible and strange, you are not envious of her.' Yet she was once no better off
                  than I. That's the real secret of it all, I know. People who are assured of their
                  own position are not afraid of trifles —such trifles as I! Yet one
                  would think that she should by this time be certain of her position.
               "But 'Miss Maderon' and 'Miss Vesta'—Asia, would you covet the position of these
                  fancy-ladies,—for such they are, I guess, or their mother would not be so
                  satisfied with them—who are coming home to astonish Maderon? Why, they are only
                  women! They have a different station, to be sure, and are looked upon in a little
                  different sort of light from me—a little, I think likely: but they are women,
                  after all. 'Flower-crowned victims to be offered up to the human lords of
                  creation.' The idea! They have a way of smoothing over that fact; but, as the
                  writer means to say, this is the bare truth. If one is born a woman, why have the
                  eyes open to the fact? Men laugh if their eyes are opened, yet why
                  should this man pen such stuff? did he think he was writing a fiction? People were
                  better off in the ancient days of ignorance than they are now. We have too much
                  enlightenment, or not nearly enough. I wish this talk about women would just be
                  stopped.
               "Blanche Maderon, she used to be very proud. I suppose what she has gone through
                  has tended to the development of that in her. No doubt she is conscious of all her
                  gifts, etc. I wonder, though, if she will prove to be of any great use in the
                  world? Perhaps, after the manner of one of those alabaster vases in the parlor—to
                  be looked at and admired  as a work of
                  art, which some connoisseur will buy some day; a
                  pretty vase, to be carefully cherished, of course: for if the vase is injured in
                  any way, what is it good for? I know that she is beautiful—and they say so
                  accomplished, so graceful, so delicate! Dear me, why do I think so much of Blanche
                  Maderon? The thought of her fairly haunts me.
               "Vesta is, I know what. They will never make anything but a true woman of her. I
                  wonder why I feel so differently toward these two girls? Blanche was for ever
                  caricaturing me when she used to sketch; I never cared for that. The artist did
                  not paint her with a wreath upon her head; and there never will be one placed
                  there. If Vesta Maderon needed me in any way, I shouldn't stop to think twice
                  about the trouble of doing anything that would serve her. I could forget myself
                  altogether for her sake; but Miss Blanche—she might look out for herself for all
                  me. No, I would not change places with either of these ladies who are coming home.
                  I don't want what they have, nor to be what they are. I shall get out of this
                  place some day, that I know. No fortune-teller need say it. I will be my own
                  fortune-teller. What do I see?" She opened her clasped hands, and, examining their
                  palms, said gravely to herself: "What do I see? Trials—crosses—enough of them!
                  labor, success, triumph, glory. How won? what shall I do? where shall I begin? No
                  matter. It will be something, and done soon. I will make an experiment, I think,
                  for the purpose of finding out if women must be 'flower-crowned
                  victims for a sacrifice'—if men can monopolize the 'arts,
                  professions, glory, ambition, money-getting.' .... Money-getting! thank Heaven,
                  that is not my ambition. I don't want bags of silver and gold in payment for my
                  work. It is not of poverty that I am ashamed, and I am not afraid of it
                  either."
            
            
               
               III. ASIA—THE DAUGHTER.
               HALF-WAY between the lake and Maderon house was the cottage where old King, the
                  blind man, once the gardener of Maderon place, and Aunt Milly, and Asia Phillips,
                  lived.
               The cottage was a small stone building, painted white, that fronted upon a
                  beautiful green lane, called the Elm-walk, which led to the eastern shore of the
                  lake. The green verandah, its pillars, and lattice-work, was covered with the
                  vines of a fragrant honeysuckle and the Persian rose; a lovely, shaded place it
                  was. The door from this verandah opened into the parlor of the cottage, a tiny
                  room, furnished with extreme simplicity, whose adornments, besides Thorwaldsen's
                  medallions, were some well-preserved toys, the gift of Mr. Maderon when Asia was a
                  child; and a few books, the remembrancers of later years. An old engraving of a
                  sea-fight between two men-of-war vessels hung over the mantel, and just beneath it
                  stood a green china parrot. These things were the treasured property of Aunt
                  Milly. A carpet that had once adorned a parlor in Maderon house was upon the
                  floor, and in a corner of the apartment was a rack for books, half filled with odd
                  volumes. Upon the table of the room was a large vase, that in summer-time was
                  constantly filled with flowers. At either side of this table stood a great
                  arm-chair. Such was the show-room, the reception-room, of Maderon cottage.
               When Asia, returned from her walk, entered the cottage, the glass-door of the
                  verandah stood open, and the sightless old man, King, sat in the clear space,
                  knowing through vivid recollection the lovely scene which stretched out full
                  before him—the garden that vied in its beauty with the more stately gardens
                  immediately belonging to Maderon house, the groves, and the Elm-walk, the lawn,
                  and the waters of the lake beyond.
               Near him was Milly, his sister, a poor creature whose senses had nearly all been
                  borne away by the flood of grief that burst upon her in the memorable summer when
                  her lover perished at sea. The engraving of the sea-fight over the mantel was his
                      gift; there for thirty years it had
                  hung, in the very position she had given it when "he left her for the last time,"
                  as he truly said, though he did not attach to his words such meaning as did
                  Providence.
               When Asia went up the steps, Aunt Milly's mood for the time forced aside every
                  thought not concerned with the two infirm beings who were the objects of her
                  tender care. The poor creature was wringing her hands, and crying in great
                  distress—
               "The sea and the waves roaring—men's hearts failing them for fear. "Poor Ned! poor
                  Ned!"
               There was but one way to silence her when the bitter remembrance flashed upon her
                  thus forcibly. The blind old man felt his way toward her, placed his chair close
                  beside hers, and began once again to tell the oft-repeated story of his own
                  affliction.
               "You see, Milly," he said, in that subdued and gentle voice which always at once
                  succeeded in arresting her attention—and it was successful now, for she
                  immediately became calm—"you see, Milly, I was ailing several days afore any one
                  guessed what was to pay. It was just after Sarah died, and—"
               "Oh yes! Sarah—poor Sarah," interrupted Milly; "go on, Jacob. Poor Sarah!"
               "And I went off a seeking consolation; for I felt broke up complete. I had got
                  away into a strange part of the country, where I had never been afore, when I came
                  down with the pox. And there I was at death's door for days an' days. When I
                  rekivered, you see, Milly—"
               "Yes, when you rekivered, Jacob."
               "I was blind, stun blind—blind as a bat, and you know I've never seen a wink
                  since. Well, it was bad, no mistake. There I was, you see, 'mongst
                  strangers. They was good Samaritans, all on 'em was. An' one man who had tended me
                  through the disease, came all the way here to fetch me back; and when I got here,
                  Milly, don't you think, not a soul knowed me! The man, George Ketchum his name
                  was, didn't lose by it: nobody never loses by doing a good thing. The old
                  gentleman, that was Mr. Maderon, paid him off handsome, and the good fellow went
                  his way rejoicing. But such comforts as I have! no poor, blind creetur never had
                  such afore. There's Asia, now: where is a girl to be found that would do for us,
                  you and I, Milly, as she does, I'd like to know?"
               Milly sobbed softly while he told this familiar tale, and tears stood in Asia's
                  eyes, such warmth and earnestness were in the old man's voice when he referred to
                  her as one of the great comforts of his blinded life. He knew not that she was one
                  of his audience; he had spoken her praise from the sincere depth of his heart.
                  Nothing knew he concerning that sense of wasted years and powers which so
                  tormented her; of the struggling and rebellion of pride, and of abilities that
                  craved a larger, nobler  field of duty,
                  or at least of labor, than that which occupied her now.
               Asia listened to his words as to an innocently-urged reproach which brought with
                  it a momentary consolation. She was doing much, he had declared it—a great work,
                  even in that contracted sphere of action: she was sight to the blind, and
                  intellect to the weak. And what right had she to ask more?
               "Oh, it's dreadful bad off you are, King," said Milly; but the old man answered
                  solemnly—
               "No, not so dreadful, sister. I shall see again after a bit."
               "You will, will you? oh—" she said, with the simplicity of a child.
               "Yes—up there, you know—in heaven."
               "I know; yes, I know. That's where he is, poor Ned!
                  There ain't no waves a-rolling there; no hearts failing with fear."
               "No," replied the old man, soothingly, "not for ever and ever, Milly." As he
                  spoke, the subdued attention with which Asia listened was disturbed by the
                  clattering of horse-hoofs. She looked from the opened window at which she was
                  seated, and saw Aaron Gregorias and another gentleman galloping by. Both were
                  looking toward her; they recognised her with a bow, and Gregorias for a second
                  seemed inclined to rein in his horse; but if that was his purpose, he instantly
                  changed it, and went on.
               A warm flush overspread Asia's face, and for a moment she felt as though she were
                  suffocating. Possibly she had given herself to quite too vaunting a habit of
                  thought of late, but as she turned away it was with a quiet, self-possessed
                  reflection.
               Again she looked into the future. She saw herself, as ever, reflected in that
                  glass, but not as the habitant of the lowly place in the rear of Maderon house—a
                  girl to be passed by with a nod, since her station was so humble that she might
                  thus be noticed, and forgotten.
               Passed by with a nod, and forgotten! This was not quite true, Asia; for they said
                  to each other as they galloped on, Gregorias to his companion—
               "A fine-looking girl, that. She should have been born in Italy. She seems to have
                  a very Italian nature."
               "What, pray, do you know of her nature?"
               "Look, I should have said; a decidedly Italian face and manner. I believe if she
                  were sufficiently self-possessed, she might make a charming improvisatrice."
               "A very singular and handsome girl, that is to say. Rather bold, perhaps."
               "Bold is she? I had thought her simply brave. You should go to Italy, good
                  friend!"
               They spoke of other things besides the gardener's niece. She was not one to
                  interest either of them deeply, beyond the moment's curiosity or purpose;  but a moment's curiosity or purpose may
                  effect results which shall tell on eternity!
               An Italian beauty Gregorias seemed to think her. He should know, for he had been
                  abroad, and had seen Italy and her daughters. The figure of the maiden, as Asia
                  devoutly hoped, had not yet its full growth. She had formed already her own idea
                  of the complete woman; and to tower in physical strength, as in mental force, was
                  her desire. An Amazonian stature seemed to her the only fitting tabernacle for the
                  spirit that was dwelling in her.
               Neither "pretty," nor "interesting," nor "engaging," nor "winning," was this Asia.
                  Her name was significant of the wild, singular, almost fierce life, that glowed
                  within her. The lustrous ebon locks were unrivalled in intensity of coloring, and
                  there was that which spoke of her inward strength of heart and purpose, even in
                  those long and heavy masses of hair. There was a lofty pride in the expression of
                  the strange black eyes—a piercing, penetrating power, that was not to be gainsaid.
                  In the very fulness of life she must live, if at all. Fettered as she was now, she
                  might exist, but such existence she would scorn to call life.
               The expression of the features of Asia's countenance was contradictory. There was
                  power, and will, and intellect, which combated with lower passions. There was much
                  that attracted and much that repelled in the face. Looking upon it, the thoughtful
                  student of character would have found no ordinary theme presented for his
                  contemplation. A scorn for weakness, yet a latent individual weakness; uncurbed
                  passions which must sweep with mastering force in some direction, over a wall of
                  rock, perhaps, to precipitous depths, that were hid in obscurity—or, through
                  sunny, open lands, or mid solitary forest shades: forcibly, and in no straight,
                  undeviating line, whichever course they took.
               Those with whom she lived could not know her. No thoughtful mind would have
                  recognised the portrait her household friends would have presented, had they
                  pictured her according to their own idea of Asia. King was blind, and to learn her
                  one had need to look upon her, to study the strange and varying expression of her
                  features; and Aunt Milly, sane or crazed, what could her poor mind have
                  comprehended of the tragic nature, which, toward her, so far as outward shows
                  went, performed the commonest duties with an ever-seeming, self-forgetful
                  tenderness?
               And then, beyond those cottage-walls, who was there that could understand her? Who
                  were her companions? She had none. With the exception of Gregorias there was not
                  one who had read beyond the titlepage of this strange book of being.
            
            
               
               IV. CHILDREN OF THIS GENERATION.
               AROUND the library-table, at Maderon house, had gathered four individuals, each of
                  whom might be taken as a representative of a different idea.
               They were the returned family: Mrs. Maderon, Blanche, and Vesta; and Mrs.
                  Maderon's nephew, Aaron Gregorias, a resident in Maderon—a lawyer—a young man,
                  considered one of the most promising of the lesser lights of his profession.
               To the student of expression, the characteristic, the individuality of each of
                  these persons, might easily be discovered from a glance at their countenances.
               Look first at the youngest of the party, Vesta Maderon; first, because the eye, as
                  by an irresistible ble attraction, first turns toward her. It is also a very
                  proper order of arrangement, for Vesta Maderon is worthiest to stand at the head
                  of that honorable household. Right of genius, right of birth, right of age, must
                  inevitably give place to right of heart. It was simply this right of rights which
                  secured for her a precedence which was given by the speech of no person, by the
                  act of no mortal.
               Do you not acknowledge the right, looking upon the strong, yet slight and pliant
                  figure—the figure so full of grace, which by no language of its own betrays the
                  manner of spirit that is in her? One day, if it only be aroused, it will move
                  forward to the accomplishing of high purposes. Now the strength is inert, though
                  not altogether undeveloped. If there were an occasion for speaking the cabalistic
                  word, a power would appear that would move, and wholly arouse, the energy of a
                  soul which seems now content to abide in quiet happiness, as if that were its
                  destiny and element.
               There is character even in the hand that rests upon the table in repose. It is not
                  a nerveless, it is not a grasping, it is not an "iron hand." But once given to the
                  plough, the heart that directs will never suffer it to renounce the work
                  proposed.
               
                  "A perfect woman nobly planned"
               
               is revealed in this embodiment. There is a token of strength in the rich tresses
                  of brown hair—a  glory to woman, as St.
                  Paul assures us; there is a power of endurance revealed in the tranquil depths of
                  the blue eyes; a surety of life and health speaks from the whole being. Not for
                  love, not for sorrow, not for pleasure, will she die. The dress that Vesta wears
                  becomes her well; the bracelets on her fair arms have found a fitting
                  resting-place; the rings of pearl and diamond, each and every adornment, seems a
                  proper part of her, a rightful belonging. It is all womanly; no flashing, no
                  betrayal of a gaudy taste; but a manifestation of true ideas of fitness, and of an
                  exquisite discernment. There has evidently been no striving after effect, no going
                  out of the common way to exhibit an eccentricity, or to exhibit wealth, but
                  herself speaks through Vesta's dress, and in her way of wearing it. No baubles
                  deck the hair; amid the braids are only a few orange-buds which Gregorias placed
                  there when they came from the greenhouse a half-hour since. He said then that she
                  was fitly arrayed for a bridal, and offered her his arm, and the offer she as
                  laughingly declined.
               But look beyond the physical and the worldly, to the soul that speaks in the young
                  face before you. It is a changeful face. Upon it the thoughts of the heart write
                  themselves, and blind must be the eye that can not decipher these telegraphic
                  communications. A more intimate knowledge of the world, experience concerning its
                  deeper realities, searching glances into its mysterious abysses, will doubtless
                  cause a veil to drop before that face; then the joy or the sorrow of the heart
                  will not so clearly set forth tidings of itself there. But none will ever need to
                  look behind that veil for worse thoughts, or darker powers and purposes, than
                  those of which the outer manifestations of life are now significant. The strength
                  and richness of her nature, as I have said, is revealed in the masses of brown
                  hair that are wound with classic grace about her noble head; the mild firmness,
                  the beautiful truth, the virtuous thoughtfulness of that nature, find proclamation
                  in the mild light of the blue eyes, and in the fine brow above them. Purity
                  proclaims itself in the nostril and the lip; and this idea of a pure soul is
                  likewise conveyed in the complexion, which is neither brown, nor dazzlingly white.
                  Vesta Maderon lives in my daily thought one of the unconscious heroines and
                  noblewomen ordained to the purposes of daily life: not fired, or convulsed, or
                  maddened beyond reason, with the sense of any peculiar "mission," or
                  overshadowing, relentless duty, or uncommon destiny, but a girl for whom education
                  has done its worst; for whom all has been done that accomplished masters can do,
                  in order to induce an idle mind, a selfish soul, a superficial life; but also one
                  whom Nature made alive to everything in nature—to the pure, and good, and true,
                  and brave,
               She is living in my thought, and in my sight, a  creature of to-day, whom this wondrous TO-DAY will
                  fashion. Maidenly, lovely, noble, good,—screened from the hardships and the
                  ordinary trials of life, yet capable of throwing aside every fiction of
                  circumstance, and of plunging into the activity of a great life. She is strong for
                  endurance of the fierce agonies of existence; though if named to her now her cheek
                  would be sure to blanch, and her hand would tremble.
               No better than Asia Phillips does she know as to what and wherefore she is. And
                  none about her know. The passer-by, like Gregorias, the idle observer, like Mrs.
                  Maderon, would say, with fitting word of compliment, 'A bird for a parlor-cage,
                  that would be lost in the freedom of forests.' Such judgment is not unfrequently
                  passed on the caged bird that has pined in its bondage, and died a prisoner; on
                  many a flower that has drooped to merest enervation, sheltered away from the
                  sun-heat, the rain of heaven, and the frost of earth, when these elements would
                  have unfolded its glories, and made it to answer far other purpose than that of
                  premature development, unhealthful bloom, and sudden death.
               Opposite Vesta Maderon sat her sister Blanche. Read the lovely face: it is a page
                  not difficult to understand. You will meet with no line or note of reference to
                  character beyond translative power. It is a fair face, a beautiful forehead, that
                  was never clouded with passion—that could never be thus clouded, perhaps, and
                  probably because of the want of any high emotional power within. In the tall
                  figure, that never made a graceless movement; in the dark, shining hair, the
                  waving ringlets; the light, clear, brilliant eyes, so fraught with reminiscences
                  of dreams—which opened upon you in such sweet, unfeigned surprise, when you
                  addressed her and called her out from the land of visions which is her home; in
                  the thin, straight lip, and the proud nostril, you read the record of Blanche
                  Maderon—who might have been an artist had she been reared in poverty, and
                  compelled to earn her daily bread. It is a cold, reserved, proud character. The
                  artist who embodied her as his ideal of physical beauty, had done well, yet not
                  nobly, for his prophetic idea had not proved wholly true. Blanche Maderon might
                  have represented such beauty, but it was not glowing health that distinguished
                  her; and, as regarded by the eye of sense, she was far more spiritual than animal
                  in her nature.
               Her character is otherwise marked. Though cold, she is exacting; though liberal,
                  she is profoundly selfish: yet it is such selfishness as appears endearing rather
                  than disgustful at present to her friends.
               You will prove your devotion for Blanche, if you wish to assure her of it. Mere
                  words will not convince. If you say, with the note of the southern bird, "I love
                  you—I love you—I love you," she  will
                  make answer as does the little bird's mate or neighbor, "Show it—show it—show it."
                  Yes, you will "show" her the faith that is in you; she will make no guess at it,
                  neither will she understand it by intuition. You will lay before her eye, or call
                  her attention to, the glories of the garden; else she will not think if the sun,
                  and the dew, and the rain, have done their work, albeit her hands are filled with
                  flowers, which she arranges with such matchless skill.
               To dream, not with the foolish heart, but with the cool and steadfast brain; to
                  fancy, but never permit herself to be carried away by those fancyings; to stand in
                  awe of conventionalities, and to yield to them because they are; to believe,
                  because artists, poets, martyrs, saints, apostles, have believed, and not because
                  religious faith makes poverty rich, distress an honor, life a glory, and death a
                  victory to the most miserable of the heroes of the "religion of sorrow;" to employ
                  herself, and that constantly, because idleness is not in accordance with her
                  tastes, and because it is a luxury to her to see the beautiful expanding before
                  her eyes, and know it of her own creation; to bear the burden, if she were ever
                  called to bear it, come in what shape it might, with a silent, proud disdain; to
                  "pass by on the other side" of shame and sorrow, not so much from want of pity, as
                  in fear of personal contamination; to live in no manner of danger of a fall from
                  the high place of her own purity; to pass judgment quickly, carelessly, if so she
                  might be alone and unmolested; to live above the world, yet so as abusing it—this
                  was Blanche Maderon. "A characterless woman?"—Nay. She was possessed of sufficient
                  talent, intellect, and pride, to be a character; and yet, with no prophetic
                  inspiration, Asia Phillips might well say to herself, as she did, when she thought
                  upon this woman—called from her childhood the glory of the Maderons—"When she is
                  dead and forgotten, there will be a living memory of me."
               At another side of the table, between Blanche and Vesta, opposite Mrs. Maderon,
                  was Aaron Gregorias, one arm resting upon the table, his head bent and supported
                  by his hand. He was engaged in turning the leaves of a volume that contained
                  specimens of Chinese art, his eyes luxuriating meanwhile in the gorgeous coloring,
                  laid with an exquisite skill, on the rice-paper.
               At a glance, he was a man of great personal beauty. His forehead was bold and
                  fine, yet his mouth was weak and sensual, and his chin contemptible; a fiery eye,
                  penetrating, unmasking, for ever in unrest, for ever at study; a figure well made,
                  well developed, manly—a model of repose; a voice insinuating, mild, and bland.
                  Gregorias had not a progressive soul. It seldom moved, save when hurled away by
                  passion, straight and direct toward 
                  preconceived purposes. A hand that would never raise itself to labor if humanity
                  alone should demand it; a spirit that shunned the discovering and revealing light
                  of day; a frame fitted for labor and endurance, yet never tasked, nor evidently
                  ever to be tasked, for the toil it should perform would be a pastime; a taste
                  elevated by culture, and not in its natural state wholly depraved; a man of
                  passions and of culture, destitute above all of the force of purpose, and of calm
                  determination, which, with his intellect, might have made him almost more than
                  man. Capricious as the wind, he might spend his life in forming splendid plans,
                  some of which he would accomplish could he do so by merely yielding to a
                  temptation. Generous and careless to a fault in some respects, he was selfish and
                  self-willed beyond the verge of crime in others. He was a man who might be on
                  occasion an angel of light; but that fact was no surety that he might not be, for
                  all succeeding time, a demon of darkness. You never could rely on Aaron
                  Gregorias.
               Yet could he fascinate, and charm, and lure those who believed themselves to be
                  quite beyond the power of his arts and eloquence. There was no deficiency of
                  intellect, but of morality; and yet no mortal feared him. He lacked that peculiar
                  faculty which retains power, when acquired, by incessant vigilance and
                  application; unceasing watch for moment and opportunity; instantaneous grasp and
                  control of means apparently insignificant, which, to the amazement of the
                  governed, secure their capture and subjection. He had not the eye of the
                  prophet—he lived in the future, unsatisfied with little things, but not
                     so dissatisfied as to toil arduously for the attainment of
                  greater. In some respects a very high, and yet, as a whole, a very poor and
                  superficial character.
               There remains Mrs. Maderon.
               Precedence in the household by right of age and position, as the widow of its late
                  head, she may take. But, scrupulously, as, in her adherence to established law and
                  custom, she goes on her way, it is well to name her as a lastly, even after
                  Gregorias. A woman and a lady—of the time?
               A very handsome woman evidently, in her day, and that day is 
                     scarccely
                     scarcely
                   passed. She is handsome still—yes, handsome. The serpent has beauty of
                  color and motion, as it hangs from the branches of the banyan-tree; Vesuvius is
                  splendid in eruption; the ocean in a storm. The whited sepulchre
                  looks pure and fair in the light of dazzling sunbeams. The beauty of the frozen
                  lake, of the rock-imbedded crystal, the glory of the autumn leaf, the splendor of
                  a December sunset, meet always with a glance of appreciation from some gazer's
                  eye.
               It is the want of womanliness, though the duties and prerogatives of woman are
                  ever on her lips—the absence of all those qualities which make the  peculiar glory of a character, that renders the
                  character of Mrs. Maderon such as no writer could delight in setting forth. You
                  would not go for sympathy in misfortune to her; you would not look into those dull
                  eyes for tears in the time of your affliction; you would anticipate no tender
                  judgment of that heart for the weak and the erring, no mercy for the lost, no
                  understanding concerning the misery, but only in regard to the guilt, of the
                  depraved. You may tell the story of your grief, if you can not hush the voice, and
                  keep the dreary secret; but look for no consoling word, look for no deed of
                  saintly daring, of moral courage, of self-renunciation, of self-forgetful
                  generosity. Look for nothing of the kind.
               Listen when she speaks. You will hear no tale of scandal from her lips, and never
                  will you hear a generous defence concerning the scandalized and wronged! Her
                  tongue is not generally, save in reproof, her weapon of offence. You see no lash
                  or dagger in her hand; yet a blow is aimed, and it tells as by magic. Hardness of
                  heart! it is that which pre-eminently reveals itself in the bearing, and in the
                  life of Mrs. Maderon. Justice is her law, and yet the Divine idea of "justice
                  tempered with mercy" never entered her head..... The arrangements of her household
                  are perfect; her people stand in awe of the reproof which is never delayed when
                  there is occasion for its utterance. The surety of her manner of government is
                  given in the erect and rigid form; in the dull eye, which seems never for an
                  instant veiled by lid or lash; in the marble-like surface of the olive complexion;
                  in the lines of the face, which become more and more strongly marked as years go
                  on; in the well-arranged hair; in the dress, which is never otherwise than
                  faultless. Wherever she goes, whatever she does, a voice of warning that
                  accompanies her, yet which is not her, nor of her, says: "Set not your hopes, if
                  human fallibility is your only defence, on the judgments of this pattern-lady;
                  they will be measured by the line: nor trust with the trustfulness of a true heart
                  to a righteousness which is to be sounded with a plummet!"
               She might be respected—she was; but no one loved this woman. She could not be
                  regarded with indifference, for her life was one that made itself felt. Gregorias
                  was always conscious of an irresistible desire to try her spirit whenever his came
                  in contact with it; but the daughters seemed to hold her words and wishes in the
                  light of law. As far as they were concerned, she had never abused her rights and
                  privileges, and they had no reasonable reason for dislike, or disobedience, toward
                  so perfect and so just a character. Asia Phillips probably stood alone in the
                  opinion she had revealed; and Maderon had doubtless held up its hands in holy
                  horror and righteous condemnation, had it known the attitude which Asia had dared
                  assume toward Maderon's great lady!
            
            
               
               V. ONE—AMONG MANY.
               GREGORIAS and Asia Phillips were not wholly strangers. During the last three years
                  of the Maderons' absence he had lived in the village, in the practice of his
                  profession; and during those years he had been in the habit of going frequently
                  over the grounds of Maderon place, for his own amusement, and also with the
                  purpose of learning if things went on there as they should. Often in the course of
                  such overlooking he met Asia in the garden, and several times he had seen her when
                  he went to the cottage for the purpose of holding business conversation with Jacob
                  King. He had never been there as a guest; he had never spoken with Asia except in
                  the way their slight acquaintance warranted. No terms of friendship were
                  established between them. He had no occasion for delivering orders to her, for she
                  was not a servant, nor was he a master; yet they seemed, both of them, to
                  entertain a proper knowledge of the fact that he was of another social order than
                  herself. It was only by courtesy, by condescension, that he ever addressed her
                  otherwise than with the slightest recognition. A certain curiosity he seemed to
                  have concerning her—a certain interest—and at times he had manifested a
                  determination to draw her out.
               Her animated manner when he spoke of anything that interested her; a certain
                  eloquent and exaggerated way she had of dealing with things, resulting, as he
                  readily perceived, from the exaggerating light through which she beheld them,
                  excited his curiosity. She was different from the ladies of society, and, he
                  thought, an agreeable variety.
               During those years, as we have seen, Asia had no companion of her own sex, nor of
                  his. The Maderons gone, she was left to her own fate, as it were; for the duties
                  which she so faithfully fulfilled, were far from making the sum of her fate. This
                  she felt and knew. Gregorias she could but think of, when she had once seen him.
                  She remembered his words; she often reflected upon them. It was the only young
                  life with which she came in contact. It was a life that was passing in the midst
                  of the world, that was dealing with the world, that was speaking  and acting with the multitude! What a theme for
                  reflection was such a life to her!
               It was this contemplation of a character and mind which she might well guess had
                  some high thoughts in common with her, though as yet they were all unexpressed in
                  her hearing, that inclined Asia to listen, whenever he spoke, with an intensity of
                  interest that could be accounted for in only one way: she was looking to his
                  words, to some utterance he should make, for a solution of the mystery that
                  encompassed her—the mystery of life.
               It was as though she had placed her hand upon the branch of a tree, and swung
                  herself thereby from the low and lonely place whereon she stood, to a higher
                  sphere.
               It was as though one deaf had suddenly experienced relief. What she had guessed of
                  in the quiet that enveloped her, she suddenly knew, for a human voice spoke to her
                  of life, and a human presence suggested an infinitude of thought all unexpressed;
                  and she heard and understood the sound, and comprehended all that was
                  unspoken.
               It was as though, wandering through the interminable paths of a forest, she at
                  last had struck upon a trail which, boldly followed, led her for the first time to
                  the verge of the wilderness—there to hear and to see all that she had known
                  heretofore by a dim, vague prescience only.
               It was as though, looking up into heaven when a storm had passed, she saw, as
                  heretofore, the rainbow spreading from the east unto the west, and for the first
                  time understood the symbol, for a voice had given to her its divine
                  interpretation.
               The effect was great in comparison with the perceptible cause. Gregorias had but
                  spoken to her the commonest words; they had seemed the veriest common-places to
                  another woman. He had seen their effect (for he was a keen observer) with
                  surprise. He had seen, she had felt, their effect.
               She was as a page of romance to his eyes—pleasant to read, particularly if it were
                  her pleasure to reveal herself in her own peculiar mood and dialect. He wearied
                  not of it, for it was a romance to be thrown aside at any moment, and no more
                  discourtesy would lie in the act, than if she were really a common volume picked
                  up from a world of books.
               Now, since the return of the Maderons, his cousins—for thus he called Blanche and
                  Vesta, though no real relation existed between the step-daughters of his aunt and
                  himself—he seemed to have quite forgotten Asia Phillips. Of this fact she was
                  sensible, but not as though a wrong was thus done to her. She never had presumed
                  to look upon him in the light of friendship. It was but natural, now that the
                  Maderons were come to take the charge of their domain, that he should resign all
                  such superintendence as he had exercised. There was no longer occasion for his
                  visits to her uncle; she herself had 
                  given up her practice of walking in the lawn, and therefore could not meet him
                  there.
               Chance expressions he had dropped, were, however, left in her memory. His actions
                  and looks had not failed of their effect. They were neither intended to exert
                  their influence in her heart, nor were they of that tendency, nor had they that
                  result. It was the life of the soul, individual life, and the world, that began to
                  explain itself under the unconscious 
                     tutleage
                     tutelage
                  . And this was all. She went back into herself more satisfied, in some
                  respects, but still full of questioning in regard to others.
               Once he had stood watching the heavy masses of golden and purple clouds which
                  appeared, in startling relief, out upon the pale-blue of the heavens, when the sun
                  was setting; she was passing through the garden; he saw her, called to her, and
                  bade her look toward the west, and, that she might do thus, she went up to the
                  elevated place where he was standing. His lips seemed then to open involuntarily,
                  and he spoke brief, significant words, which the scene seemed to suggest,
                  concerning the toils, and glories, and the pompous vanities of the world.
               As if constrained to sincerity in the sublimer presence of the evening sky, which
                  seemed, even in its radiance, but as the shadow of something more glorious, he
                  made mention of those poor vanities with contemptuous carelessness; until,
                  glancing from the heavens to her face, he suddenly changed his tone; and then he
                  spoke of the grand achievements of ambition, the miraculous deeds within its
                  power, the gorgeous dreams it can transform into living fact before the gaze and
                  mind of men.
               Of the splendor of life he spoke—and there was illumination for her in the words.
                  Not that they were entirely new words to her—altogether strange themes for her
                  contemplation—nor, that she had never pondered upon them, and found in them
                  incentives and rewards. But human voice had never before spoken of them to her as
                  living realities; the things which were themes for her dreaming were those which
                  he had seen to be real, which he had actually dealt with. Her 'high ideals' were
                  breathing and moving agents in the world where he was living. Her fancies were,
                  after all, not vain and idle; they were of things which were embodied truths, and
                  not fictions, in society. True, the doors of that world were doors she might not
                  open—into that society she might not enter: but it was something to hear it talked
                  of as a real land, a common, an ordinary range of life.
               What was the nature of her ambition to enter in and dwell there? A sense of power
                  that ought not to be crushed: an idea of freedom that made her spirit fret, as the
                  caged bird, against the bars which bound her to what seemed to her a life of low
                  and common duties; an idea of splendor so splendid that  it put to shame the paltry adornments of vanity and
                  stupid pride; an apprehension of beauty in the high; a contempt for that which was
                  revealed in the low. The eagerness of her spirit, the impatience and sincerity of
                  her aspiration, made the greatness and the peculiarity of her danger. It was to
                  transcend the little, the common, the mean, as such, to reign among the greatest
                  as such; and by greatest, Asia Phillips did not apprehend that class made up of
                  Mrs. Maderons!
               "HAVE you seen the cottage beauty since your return?" asked Gregorias, closing the
                  book which had engaged him. Vesta answered:—
               "No, and it's a great shame. You mean Asia Phillips?"
               "Asia—yes: it is a strangely-applicable name. To me, at least, it seems so. I can
                  only think of Asia as a tropical region—a land of volcanoes. What a good thing if
                  we were each called by some significant word, which expressed our characters!
                  eh?"
               "It is nearly five years since we have seen her, Blanche. What a long time! And
                  how much we have all changed since then! Do you remember, Blanche, what a tumult
                  we used to keep up in the old schoolroom, Asia and I? and how distressedly our
                  poor little governess ran about, and scolded, and watched our operations? She
                  might as well have talked to the wind as to us. But she never found that out, poor
                  thing! I must go and see Asia at once. Is she a girl likely to change very much in
                  five years, Cousin Gregorias?"
               "She is crude—needs a deal of polishing. A jewel in the rough."
               "You are sure a jewel worth the polishing, Aaron?" asked Mrs.
                  Maderon.
               "Nothing can be truer than that. Miss Asia is an Amazon, if I mistake not—or her
                  tendency is that way. But she will see a greater change in you, than you will see
                  in her, I fancy."
               "I have been continually trained, and she has grown wild, you mean. I almost envy
                  her."
               "A prickly-pear and a rose-bud."
               "Cousin Aaron," asked Blanche, "is she pert, and bold, and singular, and vastly
                  disagreeable?"
               "Acute, brave, and remarkably independent, rather," replied Gregorias.
               "Blanche never liked poor Asia," quietly remarked Vesta. "I did; I've never seen a
                  girl I liked better. I must go to her the first thing in the morning. I met Jacob
                  to-day, and Milly was leading him. How infirm he is grown! What a dear, fine old
                  creature, he is!"
               "If I were an artist like you, Miss Blanche," said Gregorias, "I would paint him;
                  there should  be a picture of Contentment
                  in the world: it makes one at peace to even look at him."
               Asia Phillips had not always found this to be the case!
               "I have often thought, since I have been away, and could better understand the
                  wild, glorious girl, that there was something peculiar, exceedingly original,
                  about Asia," said Vesta, returning to the subject, which evidently much interested
                  her.
               "The wildest creature that ever lived," said Mrs. Maderon in a censorious,
                  disagreeable tone. "Asia and I could never get on together, in the least. She is
                  not in the smallest degree womanly, but headstrong and passionate. I never knew
                  such a girl. 'Glorious! You will be disappointed in her, Vesta. All that your
                  father did for her has been of about as much service as water spilt on a
                  rock."
               "You are mistaken in her, I think. As Vesta says, this Miss Phillips is
                  exceedingly original, abrupt—far from polished; any one would allow that: but
                  there is a great deal of force in her. They say she is very dutiful in her conduct
                  toward the old man and his foolish sister; that is lovely in her, certainly, and
                  very 'womanly."'
               "I don't profess to understand her, nor do I care to do so. But if you could have
                  seen her fire up when I spoke with her just after I came home, when I met her in
                  the gallery, you would never think of applauding her loveliness, or modesty, or
                  amiability. I don't like her, Blanche, any better than you do. She was a torment
                  when a child—she never knew her place—and I am glad that you have outgrown the
                  acquaintance. Of course, any resumption of it must be voluntary, and on your part.
                  I rejoice that there is no danger of its being resumed."
               "Cousin Aaron," said Vesta Maderon on the 
                     evenning
                     evening
                   of the same day, when they were alone in the library, "you said one
                  thing, to-day, that struck me."
               "Indeed?" exclaimed Gregorias. "Happy man that I am!"
               "And, if you please, express yourself more clearly on the subject. Words must be
                  wonderfully significant, if by them—by one word alone—you could set forth a thing
                  so complex as a character."
               "Words are thus wonderful," replied Gregorias, well pleased to be questioned by
                  such an audience. "Herein, doubtless, lies the secret of our development in a
                  future state. New words—or rather words of which, at present, we have lost sight
                  and recollection—will again occur to us—will open, of themselves, whole worlds of
                  thought and knowledge! I like to study words; and, by-the-way, a wonderful book
                  has been written on the subject."
               "Have you ever amused yourself by such condensations as those of which you
                  speak?"
               
               "Often. Sometimes, at first sight of a person I have given to him a name—a title,
                  rather—to which his every subsequent act proved he had a perfect right. I knew a
                  person by the name of Borland, Theodore Borland, with whom I first went abroad,
                  the noblest fellow in the world. Him I always called Cephas: he deserved the name
                  as well as Peter the Saint. He heard I had given him the title (he was a lecturer
                  at the time), and sought me out on the strength of it. It was an honor to be
                  sought by him, I assure you. I made no miscalculation of his character, as events
                  proved. He is the philosopher on whose authority the new church is being
                  built."
               "What new church?"
               "That of the present age, to which the special illumination is being given. Not as
                  of old, through fishermen and the like, but through the minds of thinkers."
               "Ah! I was so ignorant as to suppose that the revelation had all been made. But
                  about our Asia: what name would you have bestowed upon her?"
               "Asia—as I said. It is, as I explained, to my own satisfaction, peculiarly
                  appropriate."
               "But what other name?" persisted Vesta.
               "She is a Thought. And my Aunt Maderon, even, might acknowledge that."
               "A Thought—good! ... well?"
               "A very powerful thought."
               "Of what order? Don't you comprehend? I am a thought, so are you, and everybody
                  that is anything at all, probably. Go on, Cousin Aaron: you must come more
                  directly to the point."
               "I confess, Vesta, as yet I do not quite comprehend the girl. My impression is,
                  that she is a daring thought of pride—as yet not half awake to itself. In one
                  respect, in spite of Aunt Agatha's judgment, she is a true woman, for she is a
                  perfect enigma. There are others less difficult to decide about, whom you need not
                  stay to discuss with vexatious curiosity, but whom you may pass on directly to
                  admire. What does your sister's genius propose for itself?" he asked suddenly.
               "Blanche? I think she will go abroad soon. She would like to very much. Is it
                  to-night the cereus blossoms? I have such a desire to see it."
               "To-morrow night. I spoke with Healey as I came in, and he said it would not open
                  to-night. What a glory and mystery is associated with that flower! The pure
                  sea-green of the calix makes one think of a fairy springing from the secret depths
                  of bright waters. The green-house is flooded with fragrance when it blossoms. It
                  is like genius, that puts forth its one magnificent effort, and dies even while
                  the token of its birth is being noised abroad. The first blossom, and the most
                  magnificent of the kind I have seen, was at Paris, when I was there  with this Borland. He was so transported with
                  admiration, that he went home and begun, and before noon of the next day
                  completed, a lecture, which was as splendid a production of its kind, as the
                  flower. That shows us something of the nature of inspiration. The Lord Jehovah was
                  not in the flame, nor in the thunder, nor the cloud—but in the still, small voice,
                  that spoke to the truant in the wilderness."
               "What has become of this great Mr. Borland?"
               "Great you may well call him. He is wandering somewhere, I suppose, for he seems
                  to find in no one place rest for the sole of his foot, with locked lips, and
                  working brain. I have lost all trace of him of late. But we shall have something
                  grand from his intelligence ere long, that will, doubtless, astonish. I am
                  beginning to feel greatly the need of some new word from him. When he speaks, it
                  is to astonish, electrify, and affect: to enlighten, in short. We must have him at
                  Maderon, some day; though, doubtless, if he strove to illuminate this people, not
                  one in fifty—not one in a hundred, rather, could comprehend him."
               "And yet they are just such people as make the world, Cousin Aaron. What use is
                  there of man's expatiating on subjects beyond the comprehension of his
                  hearers?"
               "Use! Is not that a new word on your lips? But, Jesus of Nazareth, did so speak.
                  Who comprehended him, when you come to that?"
               "His words had signification for those around him who were willing to think of
                  them; who could not help thinking of them. Besides, yes, I am inclined to think,
                  they understood him."
               "Precious few they must have been. Only those who had force in them; and, perhaps,
                  you have sometimes found it interesting to look about and see how much of true
                  force there is in the minds of people? Those few who do possess it, Aunt Agatha, I
                  am certain, would call headstrong, wild, and so forth, dreadful sinners."
               "You have evidently a sort of sympathy with the headstrong, cousin; we shall prove
                  our legal friend to be himself of that class, I fancy."
               "On the contrary, I am the tamest character in the world. Witness the fact, that I
                  have established myself in this little town, contenting myself, as I did until
                  your arrival, blessed source of variation! with the commonest, dullest
                  routine."
               "I confess it seems to me the strangest thing that you should have been a lawyer,
                  Cousin Aaron."
               "Bah! it would not, could you know the felicity with which I am at present
                  preparing a divorce case! I like the profession; there is ample employment
                  afforded its practitioner for the highest intellectual powers. Imagination is said
                  by some to be the highest intellectual gift, and this faculty  has assuredly to be constantly employed by the
                  'learned counsel.' No, Vesta, no amount of learning, or knowledge, no personal
                  gift, or power of thought, is superfluous; this profession demands the exercise of
                  all."
               As he finished speaking, a servant entered the library, laid the evening mail upon
                  the table, and withdrew. Immediately after, Gregorias also retired, leaving
                  Blanche, who had re-entered the room, to the discussion of the following letter
                  from her friend, Margaret Franklin.
            
            
               VI. A BRIDAL SALUTATION.
               "THE grief that I prayed might be averted, was not spared me, as you know,
                  Blanche. But, as if in compensation, a blessing for which I never asked, and would
                  not hope, is mine. That is a very sounding preface, is it not?
               "When you went from here, last summer, I gave myself over to an obvious fate with
                  as good a grace as possible; but I could not have been very heroic in my
                  manifestations, for, Mr. Lynn, who is discriminating, declared his belief, time
                  and again, in my presence, and out of it, that you had carried off my senses with
                  you. I have seen times when I would gladly have believed you guilty of the theft,
                  for people deprived of their wits are, at least, irresponsible responsible, and I fear I have not been wholly
                  sinless with all this repining, and lamenting—this wrapping of myself away within
                  myself, and so on. But, after all, what affected me the most, was this: that
                  Angelo declared, when he came home, that I had grown, at least, ten years older;
                  the intelligence had a proper effect, and he gave me no peace until he had talked
                  me out of my nonsensical melancholy, as he called it. He was a good comforter,
                  albeit, such a tormentor. I wish so much it would happen, some day, that this same
                  darling brother of mine might be appointed your spiritual pastor! I dread his
                  going among strangers, though confident that he will make his way, and win hearts,
                  wherever he goes; still, he is so sensitive, and so good, I dislike the idea of
                  his being given over to such torments as clergymen have when they commit their
                  worldly interests and happiness to the care of a mortal congregation!
               "Why am I prefacing my letter in this style? Because Angelo is so much in my
                  heart, and, because, in writing to you, for once in my life, I find myself at my
                  wits' end. I hardly know how to begin my letter, because I have so much to tell
                  you that will—dear me! why should it surprise you? The fact is, this
                  morning, at ten, I am to be married! and I am sitting here before our library
                  window in the dim light of a fog, at five o'the clock, to acquaint you with every
                  fact of the case that shall seem to me worth communicating. I wonder if I shall
                  not spin an interminable yarn? I wonder if ever another woman sat down, on a
                  bridal morning, to write a bridal, friendly letter?
               "You will believe that I have jumped at a conclusion. So, indeed, I have. It is
                  the way all great minds accomplish their feats! There are intellectual
                  vaulters—the wonders of the ring, and I claim my place in the company, though it
                  be only to act in the capacity of clown! I must be of the company,
                  therefore, put away your doubts; if I were not, Mr. Borland would not
                  marry me, nor would I marry Mr. Borland."
               (For an instant Blanche laid down the letter, and reflected on the news she had
                  read; then she again resumed her occupation, understanding how it was that
                  Margaret's friend, and the friend of Gregorias, and the benefactor of Margaret's
                  brother, Angelo Franklin, were one and the same person. And she smiled as she
                  continued to read, did Blanche Maderon.)
               "It is a disagreeable morning; but I am content to accept it, and the hours which
                  shall follow, as the emblem of my whole earthly life. Why? Just now I stood at the
                  window of my bed-room. You know what a glorious look-out it has (when there is any
                  look-out at all). I could see only the gloom of a heavy fog over all things. But
                  then, didn't I know that, if the veil were only thrown off, there  was the great sky, blue, and tranquil, and smiling?
                  And wasn't I aware that beneath, upon this earth, this lovely, lovely earth, all
                  through the valley, were thousands of flowers, drinking in new life from this same
                  vexatious mist? Didn't I know that all the trees were in leaf, that the shrubs
                  were in blossom? Wasn't I also aware that the sun could not help itself, but must
                  arise, and shine, and drive away the presumptuous mist, in maintenance of his own
                  proper dignity, and so give us, after all, a glorious day? We shall see!
               "It may turn out a day of storm. I'm no prophetess; rain, thunder, and lightning,
                  may prevail; but then, Blanche, there will be sunshine for me, notwithstanding.
                  And it would be a bridal, perhaps, quite after the heart of dear Mrs. Radcliffe,
                  if a thunder-crash should echo every vow we made in the ceremony. One may well put
                  up with a storm on a marriage-day, for then, if ever, there must be sunshine in
                  the heart.
               "You do not know this man I'm going to marry. Perhaps, have never heard of him.
                  What he has written has possibly escaped you; for, though he is glorious, he is
                  not popular, either as writer or speaker. The friend he has been to Angelo endears
                  him to me—so do his virtues, manliness, and power. I will assign to myself a labor
                  of love. I will picture him for you so exactly that he shall stand a full-length,
                  pen-and-ink portrait before you.
               "He is older than I—much older, I think—but of that I am not quite sure. He should
                  be, at all events, he is so far in advance of me every way. He has been a diligent
                  student, however, and a hard worker—that may make him prematurely old. And yet,
                  old! never mention that I called him so.
               "He is neither gray-headed, nor bowed in any manner with infirmity; perhaps, he
                  may be thirty-five! but, I think, on my honor, not a day older. You always said a
                  man was not a man until he reached that age, so you will be satisfied. I am to be
                  taken care of! Very likely you would not admire Mr. Borland, at first sight—that I
                  am glad to believe. He is not the sort of person one would fancy.
                  They call him a dreamer, but I never saw a man more thoroughly awake; though, to
                  be sure, I know very little of the world, and the men in it. I don't intend any
                  disparagement to your perfect taste, believe me, when I say, in addition to the
                  above, that Mr. Borland is not a fancy man. Oh! I smile as I write that. I should
                  sooner write of him as the great Mogul, or a highway-robber, for the description
                  would answer quite as well, and be far more to my taste. Now don't go immediately
                  to imagining that mine elect is a sort of Hercules, a giant, or a Turk; that his
                  voice is like a thunderclap, and his eye like the flash of lightning. Let me tell
                  you what he isn't; for I think, on the 
                  whole, that he will be more readily disposed of thus. Take the likeness, if you
                  will, as a blurred, imperfect daguerrotype, perpetrated by a bungling artist,
                  likely to prove the very best kind of a caricature; or, better, as an ancient oil
                  painting, so exceedingly old that it really appears, to common eyes, to be an
                  undefined, hopeless daub. We have seen such things, you remember; and, if I
                  recollect aright, you were not always beside yourself with admiration, although
                  you are of the appreciating few.
               "Mr. Borland, then, is neither Turk, Jew, nor infidel; though he has been called
                  'infidel' by those who carry childish minds with them into manhood, and who evince
                  their childish tastes by calling bad names, which from their lips
                  mean just nothing. He is no pigmy—no ogre. A knight for armor, and a grand
                  crusade, he would have been. He is that now; his armor being a love of truth,
                  which enables him to fight valiantly for it. Of his crusade—I will tell you about
                  it hereafter, if perchance you do know nothing of it as yet. In one brief word, my
                  Borland is a Solon!
               "What, then, will he think of his wife when he discovers her silly stupidity? you
                  are asking yourself; and what will become of her when he is tired of nonsense?
                  These are impertinent questions for you to ask, Blanche. I am going to marry a
                  teacher, and of course it will be a part of his business to instruct struct his
                  ignorant wife. Let him acquire wisdom: it will be my part to put it to the test. I
                  am well content. He will teach me! And—be honest—will it not be easier for me to
                  learn of him, than I have found it here, shut up with books as I have been, poor
                  solitary, when Angelo was away, and left to my own foolish devices so
                  constantly?
               "What a quiet life I have led here! And now it is over! How many times I have
                  sickened and groaned over the dreary quiet, longing so to be with you, or with
                  Angelo in college, or anywhere, but here! I look back on many years which seem to
                  have been wasted: and yet when I remember the infinite importance of life, the
                  infinite worth attached to it, dear Blanche, from the fact that it is but the
                  introduction into a real existence, to the future, which is all, I can not with
                  sincerity say these have been worthless years. Wasted they have been, some of
                  them, to my shame I write it. Yet that He has not forgotten me through them, who
                  gave life to me, and every joy, and every sorrow, I know. I have had proof of it
                  in the manifold ways and times in which I have heard His voice saying to me, 'What are you doing in the world?' Sometimes I have thought of Angelo,
                  and said to myself, 'He is my witness that I have been faithful over few
                  things.'
               "And I am not, after all, so weak, and vain, and worthless a creature, that the
                  Creator has disdained  to inquire after
                  me; and he who from this day, almost from this hour, is to be my companion, will
                  aid me, I know, and suffer me to aid him, in what he calls 'the great task of
                  life.'
               "Our childish missionary project, Blanche! how speedily it was forgotten!—perhaps
                  too speedily: or, it may be well that we did forget it. I know not; but I could
                  reflect more calmly upon the matter if I could persuade myself that it was the
                  sober judgment of reason, or the ordering of Providence, and not the vanity of the
                  world, the selfishness of human nature, which induced the forgetfulness. We
                  doubtless should have proved sad laggards at that labor; but have we not a
                  missionary work to do here, even in this land evangelized? Oh, let us do it with
                  brave hearts and unwearying hands! We never can be idle because of want of work.
                  I'm not going to preach to you. There's a God to guide us, to make our path plain
                  before us: suffer him to be your guide, dear Blanche, and Vesta too.
               "Mr. Lynn does not, truth to say, seem grieved in any extraordinary degree at my
                  proposed departure. Indeed, I have sometimes thought he was rather glad, than
                  otherwise, to be well rid of a charge so troublesome. But he was never
                  demonstrative of emotion; and so I will lay this flattering unction to my soul,
                  that it is only because of his supreme regard for me that he remains calm as
                  clockwork in the midst of all this confusion. I do not think that he will remain
                  here long himself. I hope he will marry; and, concerning that point, I have some
                  shrewd suspicions that he has concealed somewhere a consoler, which idea accounts
                  for his self-possession at this crisis.
               "Please understand me, my friend. I am not given over to the mere delight of a
                  child on escaping 'durance vile,' as I go away from this place: it has been a
                  shelter—a home. I love everything in the house, and out of it. I never could have
                  gone abroad on such short notice with another man of whom I know personally so
                  little. You are smiling at this, and you say, with something of a scoff, 'Of
                  course not!' I am willing. Since my mother died, I have had no such confidence and
                  faith in mortal creature as I now have in him. Could you see this 'him,' I think
                  you would understand me. Perhaps you do already, and I am fighting away at doubts
                  you do not entertain.
               "What, now, if I tell you how it all came about? Put the confession, when you have
                  received it, away down in the depths of your heart, and never bring it up into the
                  light again. It is too dear a secret for any but—but just you, and Vesta, and
                  Angelo, and he and I, to know! A precious company to keep a secret! I might as
                  well have it in the papers.
               "Triumph, bliss, and joy! Well may I be generous, and confess! The sun is up in
                  all his splendor dor; the clouds of mist
                  are vanishing at the touch of his golden sceptre: and here I am, even I, Blanche,
                  sitting in a perfect blaze of glory, rejoicing in a presentiment that such will be
                  my life henceforth—bright and splendid to this high degree!
               "Nay, it is not pride and foolish conceit that make me write in such a strain. Do
                  not believe it; you can not, you dare not: for before I ever knew of love, you
                  told me of it, Blanche, with prophetic 'words that burn;' it was the utterance of
                  your own high intelligence. Hereafter, if you have not yet, you will prove that
                  the dream of love is a mere shadow of the reality.
               "In an hour that heavenly blue, glimpses of which I can catch even now, will
                  spread from the east to the west; all along the river-banks those magnificent elms
                  and willows will appear in a dress more beautifully green than ever—and what a
                  brightness will cover the river! There will be such an unfolding of the flowers,
                  such an ascending of fragrant incense! Oh, it will be a day for bridal; but too
                  splendid for me, who am so poor, so mean a mate for him. Why does the recollection
                  of poor Mary Powell come to trouble me? Is there warning in it? God grant that
                  Borland may never awaken to a knowledge of my poverty; that, if he is deluded, he
                  may remain so always. If I could only make my life approach in some faint degree
                  to his, in its clear and lovely brightness! And how is one to do that? how, if not
                  by aspiring after the Infinite tranquillity? Is not that fine, and a little more
                  transcendental than you expected from pen of mine? Perhaps you will flatter me by
                  asking for elucidation. But I shall not give it. Only it is a beautiful
                  philosophy! Ay, and if the restless, hopeless millions only knew it—a true
                  philosophy! Now call me what you will for confessing to a philosophic thought! I
                  recollect the time when you were particularly given to calling names. I hope, in
                  very truth, I do transcend—brutes and clowns—in my thoughts and aspirations.
               "Is not love a transcendent emotion or capacity in itself? O Blanche! this morning
                  I am prone to believe it. And yet love's primal element is not tranquillity, I
                  think. You may have confidence, but not a perfect peace. Who shall assure you?
                  what shall entirely assure you of worthiness, for instance? Perhaps it is that we
                  may more completely die to ourselves, that we may be the more entirely subjugated,
                  conquered, that the ability to love is given. Though this never occurred to me
                  before, it strikes me now, that it must be true. Consider our love to Him whom we
                  have not seen, the great and eternal God; though we are told that love casteth out
                  fear, it is perfect love that doeth so. Here we are imperfect, and
                  capable therefore of making no great offering, not even of love. That would be an
                  humiliating reflection indeed, if it did not  make way for one that is triumphant, and full of
                  glory. We are imperfect here, and after this manner must be all our desires,
                  emotions, and perceptions. Else why do we die?
               "Blanche, that question!—'WHY DO WE DIE?' It strikes me so strangely this morning!
                  Since writing it I have sat here many minutes, thinking it over; and I'm going on
                  to say (for by this time you have perceived that I am writing myself—womanlike,
                  some would say), straight out before you, because at this very moment I must
                  confess to a human being all that is in my head or heart: myself must have
                  expression, and at what confessional could I appear so fearlessly, knowing that
                  the heart and the understanding would listen? I am going to say what I think this
                  morning, even as I have always said my thoughts to you, with trustful
                  calmness.
               "'Many years I shall not live,' I used to say, for a presentiment of early death
                  was always with me; and I have not lost that yet. 'Many years I do not wish to
                  live,' I used to say. I do not say it now. Yet in all sincerity, I think, bearing
                  in mind the presentiment, I can calmly say, even in presence of this highest
                  joy—'As THOU wilt.' For since that dreadful day—dreadful, dreadful still to me,
                  for what an experience has mine been since Angelo and I were left in the
                  helplessness of childhood alone!—since that day when I listened to our mother's
                  er's hopeful and triumphant words, and felt myself drawn closely and more closely
                  to her breast, with a love that could not die, though her human life was
                  passing—since then I have believed in my inmost soul that 'to die is gain.'
               "I wander sadly. It was merely to tell you that this is my marriage-day, that I
                  sat down to write..... During the last year we have seen more of Mr. Borland than
                  we have in any other year since I came here to live. He has been abroad much of
                  his time, but for a twelvemonth he has been at home. As I told you, it is his
                  habit to speak in public. (N. B. I humbly trust he will not reserve his taste for
                  lecturing solely for my edification.) Not long ago, when he came to see Mr. Lynn,
                  he announced his new tour; and it is on this that I am to accompany him. Yes, the
                  knight has really come—a fit knight for romance, too—and he is going to carry me
                  away!
               "A fortnight ago Sunday, at twilight, when I came home from church, I went into
                  the garden as I usually do, without first going to the house. Mr. Lynn was away
                  from home, and I knew that the servants were still in the village. So I sat in the
                  arbor, doing a very difficult thing, or attempting to—the study of myself. I was
                  praying within my soul that God would enlighten me, and guide me into all truth
                  (and I take it for a good omen when I think how happy I had been all that day,
                  through  heavenly meditation), when I
                  heard some one walking in the gravelled path that leads to the arbor. Thinking
                  that perhaps Mr. Lynn had returned, I remained, quietly waiting till the person,
                  whoever it might be, should appear. A minute after I first heard the step, Mr.
                  Borland stood before me. I was surprised and glad to see him, and must have
                  expressed as much. He had served Angelo so nobly, that I could but feel most
                  grateful, and glad whenever he came to us. He also seemed satisfied—that is just
                  the word—to find me there, and alone. He thought to find me there—indeed, he told
                  me so.
               "He came into the arbor and took his place beside me. I had been interested in his
                  conversation before, many times; but on that night, how ashamed I was when I at
                  last recollected to look up, and out into the garden, and saw that the twilight
                  had long past—that the moon was rising, and the stars were all in heaven!
               "I would have gone then, Blanche, I assure you that I would, and I arose for that
                  purpose: but he kept me back, and asked me—me, Blanche!—why I would
                  not stay with him for ever. Oh, you may well believe it was a question which from
                  his lips made my heart to stand still instantly. I was afraid, I was astonished;
                  but then, after that great moment, which I mistook for one of torture, my heart
                  went on with a bound, with such a glowing of life, such an ecstasy of joy, as I
                  had not fancied heart could go before. Why was it so? Because I had never listened
                  to words of like tendency from other lips? No. But such words—I
                  acknowledge SUCH words of love were never before spoken to me, for I think no
                  other man could speak them.
               "What he intended was so beautifully, so earnestly, so solemnly said, as in the
                  presence of God and the angels, though some evil spirits have averred that he
                  believes in neither. The holy quiet of the night was hallowed, not profaned, by
                  such words. Blanche, did I well—I, what am I?—to place my future in his hands,
                  when, with no passionate declaration, but instead, with the solemnity of a high
                  and sincere heart, he chose a sabbath evening for his time to ask me if I would go
                  with him on the journey of life?
               "His words—I can not write them even unto you. They are divine; and if I died a
                  beggar, I should still be rich, through the memory of them. What I said I do not
                  know; but my words seemed to satisfy him. Rejoice with me, that I, who began to
                  believe that there was no life for me, am at last entered at a school in which I
                  may be for ever a student! Rejoice with me, that I am thus accounted worthy—for it
                  is of love alone that I will learn; and love is that sole treasure which we carry
                  with us out of this world! Beautiful, holy, and blessed, are the lessons of life;
                  and then, to think that the lessons sons
                  are appointed by the wisdom of Him who by day and by night, before the world was,
                  and through eternity, is the same—the Almighty, the Unchangeable!
               "Do you remember the time, Vesta, I wonder—it was not very long ago—when you wrote
                  thus to me: "Shall I ever see the day when a woman, with a woman's heart, full of
                  loving impulses, such as you have, and a head moved by that heart, such as is also
                  yours, shall, from her own calm conviction and experience, teach by word and deed
                  that love is not the ultima thule of a woman's
                  existence; that missing it, she is not an aimless, useless thing under the
                  sun—beyond the reach or hope of human happiness?'
               "I never answered this, child—yes, 'child!' for I'm older than you, and to-day am
                  to marry a teacher!—but this morning, as you will see, I can not avoid doing so.
                  You meant by 'love' that mystery which has to do with marriage, the problem which
                  matrimony endeavors to solve; and therefore the query and the longing you express
                  do you honor. Yet I feel to-day how full and immensely significant the word 'love'
                  is. It is more than all other words to me. It is the essence of all language. I am
                  not content that the word should be monopolized by one idea. Yes, to make the
                  matter short, and bring us to a climax, I do believe love to be the
                     ultima thule of a woman's existence. But
                  recollect, by love, I apprehend the God-word. Nobler spirit than a lover's, more
                  exalted and dignifying 'crown name,' could never be given to man or woman.
                  Marriage being one of the institutions established by GOD THE LOVE, is, therefore,
                  'honorable' and 'holy.' But by no means does it follow that marriage is the
                  embodiment or absorbing principle of love. Not even on this day do I think it is
                  so. No thought, or relation, or form, established among human beings, can absorb
                  or be that divine principle. Since love is the great reality or fact of the
                  Highest—since Love created, redeemed, upholds, and saves us—the heart of man or
                  woman can surely glow with no higher, or nobler, or purer emotion. Should not that
                  be the ultima thule of a woman's existence, the
                  very watchword of her life, which is the conqueror of Death, and the reality of
                  that blessedness which lies beyond death? O Vesta, darling, take not this holiest
                  word from my lips, this highest thought from my heart, or I am indeed powerless,
                  dumb, and dead!
               "I hardly thought, when I began this letter, to conclude it as I am doing. You
                  have many a time exclaimed against my tedious tendency, my sermonizing propensity;
                  and I have spared you of late—that you must admit. But to-day I feel, say what you
                  will, that I should be a pauper indeed had I a heart to give my husband filled
                  with human love only—if I could not consecrate the dawning of my marriage-day with
                  a thought of God.
               
               "Blanche, it is as I believed it would be, a perfect day—a fit day for the
                  sacrament of marriage, or, for the sacrament of death! I do not shudder even in
                  writing that. Innumerable birds, fragrant flowers, sunlight, and, more glorious
                  than all, the unveiling 'forward distance'! Angelo is here; I would that you and
                  Vesta were also—that you could go with us into the distant lands and through the
                  many paths which we shall tread. I am as impatient as a child: but the curtain is
                  being lifted! Beyond this quiet valley into life—past all this loneliness into
                  perpetual companionship and sympathy! oh, holy and blessed name of love—more holy
                  and blessed reality!
               "He has come, and they are calling me. Angelo stands at my door, waiting for
                  admittance. Stay, while I lay a kiss on this paper for you and Vesta, the next—.
                  You see I will say nothing that shall even seem to hint at a possibility of our
                  not meeting again. Pray for me, Blanche, that I may be a good, courageous, patient
                  wife; that my womanhood may be of an ever-increasingly lofty character. I
                  aspire—and my aspiration is, to be a worthy wife. I will also pray for you; and
                  because I can conceive now of no prouder or better fortune than this awaiting me,
                  I will ask that as is my joy this day, so may yours also be.
               
                  "MARGARET FRANKLIN (BORLAND)."
               
            
            
               VII. OLD FRIENDS.
               "MEG FRANKLIN a bride! how excellent! Here is an effusion you will hardly get
                  through to-night, but it will amuse you, I think, dear Vesta. Meg's religion,
                  love, and transcendentalism, are meet refreshment for the gods. And then to think
                  that every word was written but a few hours before the fatal ceremony! Who but she
                  could have perpetrated such a deed? I am quite revived. What a pity that we are so
                  seldom regaled by a detail of the like pretty experience of our friends! I wish
                  every woman under the sun, who can 'speak and write the English language
                  correctly,' were bound to give her individual experience of past life, and make a
                  general summing up on her marriage-day.
               
               I shall persuade Cousin Aaron to immortalize himself by suggesting some such
                  statute."
               Speaking thus, in the most beautiful tone of languor, Blanche Maderon passed by
                  Vesta, dropping the letter over her shoulder as she went, and pausing for an
                  instant to salute her.
               An hour after, Vesta, going to her own apartment, looked in upon her sister in her
                  chamber, and said—
               "Do tell me, Blanche, when in the course of time you ever harbored the thought of
                  becoming a missionary?"
               "When I was young and romantic," said Blanche, making no hesitation in the
                  avowal.
               "But you never told me!"
               "Oh, you would have gone with me, of course. What need to acquaint you with my
                  intentions?"
               "You proceeded after the manner of all great potentates; but did you seriously
                  think of undertaking the reformation of savages, of living among barbarians?
                  You—Blanche Maderon?"
               "I—Blanche Maderon. And it was not a thousand years ago that I entertained the
                  magnanimous idea."
               "How singular! and then you changed your mind?"
               "I probably forgot the idle fancy at once. All I remember about it, is, that the
                  first year we were at school, Meg and I were reading, one day, some story about a
                  missionary, and we—charmed, I suppose, with some detail, like two sentimental
                  girls—forthwith resolved, that, as soon as we were old enough, we would go forth.
                  I doubt if we shall ever arrive at that very desirable age. The prospect, at
                  present, seems unfavorable."
               "Oh, Blanche!"
               "Well," said Blanche, looking up with some apparent curiosity, "what is it, sweet
                  sister?"
               "I am so surprised," returned Vesta quietly, closing the door, and proceeding
                  toward her own room. Before reaching it, however, she turned back, and looking in
                  again on Blanche, said: "I am so glad Margaret is married. I wish we had known of
                  it before; it would have been such a good opportunity for you to go abroad with
                  them, you know."
               "Oh, I shall not want for opportunity," said Blanche, "and I shall certainly go in
                  the fall."
               "Is n't Cousin Gregorias odd? But I like what he said of Asia Phillips, and feel
                  quite impatient for morning to come. She must think it strange that I haven't been
                  to see her before."
               "Are you talking in your sleep?" asked Blanche, looking wonderingly on her sister,
                  and speaking in not the most gentle tone. "I should really like it if I never
                  heard that girl's name again."
               "Oh no; you do n't mean any such thing; but you are enough to frighten one. Good
                  night,  Blanche; pleasant dreams! and may
                  you have no vision of—of the Italian beauty!"
               And Vesta closed the door again, not so quietly as at first, and went on to her
                  chamber.
               Early the next morning, in agreement with the determination formed at night, Vesta
                  Maderon went seeking Asia Phillips in her home: and there she found her.
               The two girls presented a peculiar contrast when they met, stood, for an instant,
                  looking with scrutiny on each other, and then, as by a common impulse, advanced to
                  a mutual embrace.
               "Now! why have you not been to see me? Is it not generally supposed that strangers
                  in a place are the ones to receive attention, rather than to extend it? What do
                  you mean, Asia Phillips?"
               "I acted according to Mrs. Maderon's pleasure—at least on her hint," replied Asia.
                  "But after all, and quite contrary to my expectation, you have not outgrown all
                  recollection of me, though you have grown so very much."
               "Have I? As for you, I never should have known you if I had met you in the
                  village, or anywhere but here. How changed you are! And you used to be such a
                  little dump, you remember. No! I'm sure I should never have recognised you. Yet
                  you have the same features."
               "Alas, yes! the same great nose."
               "But your face has grown up to it. And your eyes—when you were little, do n't you
                  remember how you used to wink them like an owl, and then open them so wide? We had
                  rare times then, Asia."
               "You have had still rarer times since then, I suppose, Ves—Vesta?"
               "In quite another sense of the word. I have often wished to get back here so much.
                  We were dreadfully homesick when we went away. That we outlived. But it was a
                  happy day when we finally packed for home. It is so pleasant to be here! and then
                  to look at you—it does me good. We shall have pleasant tasks, learning all about
                  each other, Asia; for, while our recollections make us old friends at heart, we
                  have changed so much that I suppose we are, in other ways, quite like strangers to
                  one another. Let us resort to the catechism: How old are you, Asia Phillips?"
               "Sixteen years and a day," replied Asia laughingly, now quite at her ease, though
                  she had, at first, been much embarrassed by the sudden entrance and salutation of
                  Vesta.
               "Is your education finished, my child?"
               "By no means."
               "Do you go to school?"
               "I graduated five years since, when the little governess departed."
               "What is your occupation?"
               "I am a housewife."
               
               "And your aspiration?"
               "To do my duty."
               "What do you consider your first duty as woman?"
               "To bake, wash, and mend, in a Christian manner; to take care of the house, and
                  aunt, and uncle."
               "Very orthodox in your views, so far. Are you going to marry?"
               "Never."
               "Why not?"
               "Want of an excellent opportunity."
               "Good! Do you row on the lake yet in the little skiff?"
               "Assuredly; with all my strength and heart."
               "Do you like me?"
               "I always loved you, and I have not changed my mind."
               "Well done, my good and faithful friend."
               "Thanks! but you do not mean to escape me in this way? How came you, Miss Vesta
                  Maderon, a plain little girl when you went from here, to grow up into so beautiful
                  a woman?"
               "To that question I take exception. It do n't please me. It's not your natural way
                  of asking. I grew up—how? as God intended I should."
               "Then I have forfeited my right to go on?"
               "Yes."
               "Your sister, Blanche,.I have seen; but only as she rode past with Mr. Gregorias.
                  Do you never ride?"
               "Not often; I prefer boating. You are acquainted with our cousin?"
               "I have seen him occasionally as he went over the grounds, or when he has been
                  here to speak with uncle. He is a handsome man."
               "Handsome? what makes you think so? Handsome! the very last thing I should have
                  said. Do you like him?"
               "I have had no opportunity for judging or deciding whether I do or not."
               "He is so cool."
               "Cool! is he?"
               "Very. He is like a fixed proposition."
               "Ah!"
               "That is, through his philosophy. He has cultivated his repose of manner. I
                  suppose it would be impossible for any one to astonish him. And you know, as long
                  as that is true of a person, he is quite beyond human influence."
               "I have not thought much about him," said Asia; and that was not wholly the
                  truth.
               "Nor have I," replied Vesta. "I have hardly seen him half a dozen times. But from
                  what I have seen, I know he is thoroughly himself, and nobody else. I like a
                  person to have some individuality—to show by his actions that he has fixed ideas
                  concerning himself. That he is not everything to everybody body. Asia, how strange to think what a time has
                  gone since we were children? Are you glad to be a woman, or are you like some
                  others I wot of, unfortunates! discontented still, and for ever—wishing childhood
                  could come again, now that you are all that you so desired to be when a
                  child?"
               "I'm not what I longed to be," replied Asia. "I am yet looking forward. No; I have
                  not the slightest desire to be a child again. I was too fierce and wild to be a
                  happy creature in those days."
               "Were you, Asia? I think, when I look back, that those days were very
                  beautiful."
               "They could not have been otherwise, with you. We were different then as now. You
                  will be glad to say 'yes' to that; and glad, perhaps, to think I can see the
                  difference. I never have wished to go back a single step. It must be on, and on,
                  and on, until I get to be an old woman," she said, in an altered tone, controlling
                  herself in an instant. "And then, I can die, and still go on. I am restless,
                  curious, and always was. If I were even wretched, I should still desire to live,
                  or to continue, that I might know what was really going to come of
                  it."
               "You are the same as ever," said Vesta, looking with affectionate interest, that
                  was, perhaps, animated by curiosity, on the speaker. "Do you ever sing now,
                  Asia?"
               Asia laughed, and said she had long ago outgrown the old delusion concerning her
                  voice. "We shall have no more duetts," she said; "when will you sing for me,
                  Vesta?"
               The answer was a gay and pretty air, which wakened Aunt Milly from her slumbers in
                  an adjoining room, and she came out as at a call. It had also the effect to hasten
                  the steps of Uncle King, who was making his way, led on by his dog, through the
                  lane. He stopped at the garden-gate and listened, and stood again as he was going
                  up the gravel-walk. When the song was finished, he said:—
               "No one about here sings in that way but Miss Vesta, I know. You are
                  there in the house with my Asia, ain't you, Miss Vesta?"
               "Yes, Uncle King, I am here."
               "Then you hain't forgot your old friends? I knew it."
               "How could I forget Uncle King?"
               "Oh! in course you couldn't; at least you wouldn't, in course. Is your aunt up
                  there with you, Asia?"
               "Yes, I am here, Jacob," answered Milly.
               "You remember her, do n't you, Milly? Little Vesta, you know."
               "I know. Yes; to be sure."
               "And she ha'n't changed a bit, has she, Milly?"
               "Growed some, Jacob."
               "Oh, yes, in course she is growed some; but a child like yet."
               
               "A lady, Jacob."
               "Yes! yes—in course she's all that. But though growed some, and very fine, and so
                  on, she is what we used to love, Milly, when she'd come down and sit in the old
                  chair with me, and sing just whatever song I wanted. She's all that, Milly,
                  yet."
               The old man evidently expected an answer, yet he had spoken as in a sort of
                  revery.
               "Every bit she is, and more so," answered Milly, solemnly surveying Vesta.
               "Uncle," said Vesta, who had silently listened to this conversation between the
                  brother and sister concerning herself, much affected thereby, "uncle,
                     you don't look a day older than you did when we went away; nor do
                  you, either, Aunt Milly. And I am not changed at all. You may think of me, uncle,
                  as grown a little, not much; and for all the rest, I'm papa's child, and you're my
                  dear, old uncle."
               "In course," said the old man, with profound satisfaction. "It's what I meant—but
                  you can say it better than I. What's good do n't change, though things about it
                  do. Your heart is just what it allers was. But, about the growing old, you're
                  mistaken some. I'm a great deal older than I was when you went away; though I
                  enjoy things yet. And the great God be thanked, there's a deal to be enjoyed in
                  the world He's made, even for a poor old creetur like me."
               "A great, great many," said Vesta earnestly. "Friends first of all, and then
                  nature."
               "You love nature, then; and you love everything that grows, I dare say?"
               "I love nature; it is the love that keeps us pure at heart."
               "Yes; to be sure! I do n't want to know no more about a body, than that he is
                  careless about such things—nature, and so forth. How mighty like it is to an
                  autumn day."
               "The sky has an autumnal look, but not the earth," said Vesta; "it is so pleasant
                  here, that I had nearly forgotten an engagement I made for this morning;" she
                  looked at her watch, and hastily speaking a few other kindly words to her old
                  friends, was about to leave them thus; but as she turned to go, another
                  recollection caused her to look back, and say—
               "Oh, Asia! Healy says that the cereus will blossom to-night, and you must not fail
                  to come up to the green-house. You have never seen such a wonder in the shape of a
                  flower. Do n't forget—come early in the evening."
               Asia promised, and Vesta departed.
            
            
               
               VIII. A LITTLE PLOT.
               ON her return home, Vesta found Gregorias in the drawing-room with Blanche. He had
                  brought to her a letter for inspection; she was reading it; and, as Vesta entered
                  the room, she heard him saying:—
               "Then it is your command that I write to this young Franklin, in compliance with
                  Borland's wish?"
               "Yes; and do n't let it be a formal letter. Urge him to accept our invitation. If
                  Margaret's brother could be settled here, it would be very pleasant for all
                  parties, and we should take such good care of him! Think of Angelo Franklin as
                  filling Dr. Peters' place, Vesta!"
               "Dr. Peters was quite too large for the place," said Gregorias. "But he should
                  have found it a little more comfortable if I had come to Maderon sooner. If ever a
                  man was abused and misunderstood, he was. But for this boy Franklin, Maderon will
                  be a good stepping-stone for him, and we will try and keep peace among the people
                  during the progress of his unfolding. Of one thing we may be sure, some peculiar
                  merit must attach to him, or Borland would never, even for his sister's sake, have
                  taken such an interest in him."
               "Angelo Franklin, that lame boy, Margaret's brother—are you speaking of him?"
                  asked Vesta in some surprise; "what are you going to do with him?"
               "We are going to work in an underhand manner, to accomplish something awful," said
                  Gregorias—"going to ask him to come and visit us; and then, on some favorable
                  sabbath—some bright, cool day, when everybody is in good spirits—we shall invite
                  him to hold forth from our vacant pulpit. And then he is to carry captive the
                  church-officers, who are to give him a call, of their own free will, of course,
                  and not in consequence of any manœuvring on our part; which call he is to accept.
                  Is not that a satisfactory explanation? But, you are mistaken about his lameness.
                  Borland cured him of that some time ago—by some miracle, I believe."
               "Humbug!" said Vesta, in some disgust.
               
               "A quack!" exclaimed Blanche. "I wish Margaret were safe back under her old
                  guardian's care, and that she had never heard of this remarkable gentleman."
               "So do I," added Vesta.
               "Think as you choose, ladies. We shall have a chance of seeing and believing for
                  ourselves, I trust, how much of a miracle Borland has wrought. But one thing—you
                  must not call him a quack. If you could see him, you would never be guilty of that
                  again. He is my friend; and as for myself, I have no companionship with quacks."
                  Gregorias spoke in a proud, and rather a high tone. But he recollected himself,
                  and added more mildly: "Borland is a theorist, if you please, and his conjectures
                  are beautiful—too beautiful to be hid. They may run away with paltry, weak, inane
                  minds, but never with his own. A nobler spirit never was seen in mortal man. I
                  spoke but in jest when I said he had wrought a miracle. Still, he cured Franklin;
                  how, I know not, and never thought to inquire."
               "They call him hard names, Margaret says; 'they' means the world, I suppose. I
                  wonder if her brother has been in no danger, subjected in such ways as he has
                  been, to the man's influence," said Vesta. "If Mr. Borland cares to make converts
                  in any way, he has taken the right course to secure Angelo."
               "You do not know the man," said Gregorias. "If you did, Vesta, you are the very
                  woman to be enthusiastic in his praise. He would not lift a finger for the purpose
                  of bringing over another to his way of thinking. He reflects for himself, and
                  expresses his opinions because it pleases him to do so. If others see fit to chime
                  in with him, well and good: but he is as ready to listen as to speak; and he never
                  yet has taken any credit to himself as a creator, or a discoverer. The world, with
                  its mysteries, is before him, as it is before any other sane man: he has a right
                  to say what his opinions are concerning it—just as the bird has a right to
                  sing."
               "The bird is at least harmless in its singing," suggested Vesta.
               "Harmless? well, but how do you prove that? Some mortal may be enamored of the
                  melody to a total forgetfulness of all the duties devolving on him; and another
                  may thus have his murderous propensities roused to such an extent, that nothing
                  short of the bird's life will satisfy him. But, Borland is at heart, and in life,
                  as pure as any bird," continued Gregorias. "The idea of my defending such a man!
                  It is too absurd. I would like to see this wife he has married. There must be some
                  peculiar charm about her that has influenced him, after the hey-day of youth, to
                  take such a step; especially, when he is wrapped in the midst of his  speculations, and engaged in the
                  evolution of his grand theories. What is the charm, Vesta? Blanche, I perceive, is
                  lost in some dream or vision, or I would trouble her to tell me."
               Blanche truly heard him not, and Vesta replied: "I do n't know of any particular
                  charm that could be specified. Margaret is very sincere—one of the sincerest
                  persons I know. She is warm-hearted too, and very womanly. This brother of hers
                  has been the object of her devoted love since they were orphans. I'm glad that he
                  is coming here."
               "And there must be no delay in the business: I will go and write him at once,"
                  said Gregorias.
               
                  Vesta. "Dear sister, of what are you dreaming?"
               
                  Blanche. "Of Italy."
               "If you want a glimpse of 'Italian beauty,' go down to the garden-gate—pass
                  through—and Fortune favor your expedition!"
               "What do you mean?"
               "Asia Phillips is to-day just my idea of southern beauty."
               "Her name is quite enough for me; I entirely abhor it. So oblige me—say no more
                  about her. Hush! no scolding! you will frighten away my idea. Come to my room,
                  by-and-by, and I will show you something that shall be exceedingly pretty—an idea
                  I have on canvas."
            
            
               IX. THE GLORY OF A NIGHT.
               ASIA PHILLIPS made no move to go up to the green-house, in accordance with Vesta's
                  invitation, until late in the evening, when Gregorias, sent by Vesta, went for her
                  to watch with them the unfolding of that wonderful flower, whose like had never
                  been seen at Maderon.
               It was Asia's intention to virtually decline the invitation, though she had
                  accepted it in words, for with all her "indomitable pride," the supercilious look
                  of Mrs. Maderon, and the cold greeting of Miss Blanche, were more than she cared
                  to meet. When Gregorias came, however, there was no way for her escape; Uncle King
                  was decided that she should go, and she hastily made herself ready for her
                  escort.
               
               The expression of opinion to which Gregorias had been led concerning the girl, an
                  opinion of which he was hardly aware until led on to such expressions by the
                  manner and words of Blanche, had aroused his own interest in her to a great
                  degree; and when she, looking like a queen of night, stood with the polished and
                  stately Mrs. Maderon, and the lovelier sisters, the contrast that was thus
                  presented provoked his curiosity, and he paid heed to her motions and the varying
                  expression of her countenance, with a deal of interest which was well
                  concealed.
               When he accompanied her into the green-house where the herald of the cereus, a
                  matchless fragrance, had already appeared, Mrs. Maderon, who stood near the door,
                  greeted her with a nod of recognition, which, however, seemed extended to the girl
                  rather as the person her nephew accompanied, than to Asia Phillips in her proper
                  person. She nodded to Asia, but the word she said was addressed to Aaron
                  Gregorias. They moved on toward Blanche and Vesta, where a more kindly reception
                  was offered; and although the elder sister made none of those warmer protestations
                  to which Vesta, in the morning, had given utterance, still, she was a lady, and
                  not forgetful of her duty.
               Blanche Maderon when not totally lost in her dreams, absorbed by them, had a way
                  of assuming authority as her right, which to her equals made her only the more
                  enchanting. Such rule none cared to question. To her, Asia Phillips was no more
                  than one of the green-house flowers, and not so beautiful. She appeared rather as
                  the cactus, and when Blanche said as much to Gregorias, he made rather a singular
                  reply:—
               "Point me out any flower half as gorgeous as these same cactus-blossoms."
               Blanche could not but be struck by the pride that met and more than balanced her
                  own, when this Asia, standing before her in full recollection of the childhood
                  that was gone, when they had been as equals, answered the greeting she extended
                  precisely as she would have had her do, had she instructed her.
               Asia's manner took both Vesta and Gregorias by surprise. With the timidity of a
                  true affection that has fears for its fate, Asia had greeted Vesta Maderon; she
                  loved her, and was in doubt as to the results which might follow a meeting after
                  so long a separation.
               It was with no such dread that her eyes now calmly met the eyes of Blanche. No
                  emotion whatever was perceptible in her voice when she answered the few questions
                  addressed to her; no peculiar thought was revealed in her countenance when she
                  stood back, as became one of her station, after the greeting was over. When they
                  were children, the authority of wealth had been exhibited hibited in another way, in a childish manner. The
                  one had now a new manner of exacting what was due; the other, a different way of
                  yielding what was required.
               Gregorias looked upon the two with surprise. The grace manifested by each was a
                  matter for study; he readily interpreted it. With Asia, it was the instinctive
                  action of high self-respect; with Blanche, an exhibition of a pride that, though
                  it meant not to annoy, had, however, yet to learn the better grace of the heart,
                  before it could in its manifestations fail to wound.
               It was delightful to wander through the illuminated green-house, so many were the
                  rare plants in full bloom. Still it seemed a relief to the little party when the
                  wondrous flower was finally unfolded, and its glory disclosed. They watched it
                  until it began to fade, Blanche meanwhile working rapidly with her pencils and
                  colors, which she had brought with her for the purpose of transferring and
                  preserving the beauty of the short-lived cereus. That accomplished, she arose and
                  led the way back to the parlor. At the door of the green-house, Mrs. Maderon
                  lingered behind the rest, and asked if she should not call a servant to attend
                  Asia home; but the offer was declined. There was bright moonlight; she had but to
                  cross the garden, the meadow, and then came her uncle's garden, so she went off
                  alone; but hardly had she closed the garden-gate behind her, when it again opened,
                  and Gregorias passed through.
               "Will you not be pleased to wait, Miss Phillips?" he called to her; she stood
                  still until he joined her.
               "An absurd idea, your running off in this style! I should like some sensible
                  reason for such conduct?"
               "It is late; high time that I were home. I am accustomed to going alone, and do
                  not need an attendant for so short a distance."
               "Allow me to judge. It strikes me as exceedingly improper for a gentleman to leave
                  a lady to look out in that way for herself; for whatever annoyance it may have
                  occasioned you, you have been repaid, I trust, in the splendid miracle of nature
                  we have witnessed?"
               "I have met with no annoyance."
               "My Cousin Vesta is a great favorite with you, is she not? How singularly she
                  impresses one! When I have listened to her, it seems as though a sweet hymn had
                  been sung for me; or, as though some rare and excellent beauty, like that of the
                  cereus, had unfolded before me."
               "You had not met your cousins until they came home?" said Asia, compelling herself
                  to speak, yet vexed by his attendance, for it struck upon her pride. He had come
                  out of pity, because he believed that she felt humbled, and uncomfortable, with
                  the Maderons.
               
               "We had not met before, yet we had corresponded for several months, and therefore
                  I feel rather more intimately acquainted with their minds than I could otherwise;
                  I had, however, formed a 
                     differerent
                     different
                   idea concerning them. We draw strange pictures in imagination; had you
                  fancied they would be as they are, when you thought of them before they came?"
               "Not precisely."
               "My eldest cousin, dreaming visionary, as she is, differs more materially from the
                  idea I had formed, than her younger sister. She has an acutely discerning mind; it
                  appears in her letters more clearly than in her eyes—in her conversation, if she
                  be aroused, rather than in the manner which distinguishes her."
               "Her eyes are veiled," said Asia.
               "Yet she has scarcely sufficient self-discernment to choose to veil them in that
                  way. It is nature's work."
               "Their expression is wholly changed since the time when I knew her as a
                  child."
               "I almost wish she were compelled to exert herself. If she had motive for
                  exertion, you would read something in those eyes beside what you now read—it would
                  amaze you."
               To this, Asia made no reply; Gregorias therefore spoke again.
               "Miss Phillips, and my Aunt Agatha are warm friends; that, at least, is very
                  evident."'
               "To what manner of eyes?" asked Asia sharply.
               "Of whoso shall gaze. You never visit the gardens now, as you did, Miss Asia; and
                  I am told that a certain gallery has not echoed to your footstep in many a
                  day?"
               "My uncle's garden is in bloom," she said shortly.
               "True, and it has a certain gorgeous flower, most rare and fine."
               He opened the gate with this gallant speech; and Asia, with a slight inclination
                  of the head, passed through, and saying the most formal "Good-evening," entered
                  the cottage-door, and closed it after her.
               She closed the door; she shut out all the world; she stood alone by herself.
                  Never, never had she felt so completely, so utterly alone.
               It was not to despise her own self, nor to nourish hateful thoughts toward those
                  whom fortune favored rather than herself, that, throwing aside hat and shawl, she
                  sat down upon the lowly bench before her chamber-window, and pushing aside the
                  closely-woven vines, looked out upon the moonlit fields and highlands. She had
                  seen the wondrous flower, and that compensated for facts she had been made to
                  feel, even while gazing on it. But now, removed  from the splendor of that blossom, alone in the
                  little, humble apartment, she betook herself to such thoughts as would be sure to
                  occur to her at such a time and season.
               Of all things, she most needed now a human guide—a companion in human shape, who,
                  talking quietly of life, and reverently of the things therein, though it were a
                  child even, could have chained the lion that was loose within her. But around her,
                  instead of companionship, was dead silence; and in that silence she walked
                  restlessly about the room—she laid down upon her bed—and thought and thought
                  again.
               Why did she so thoroughly hate that elder woman, whose chief purpose in life was,
                  as it seemed to Asia, to humiliate her? Why, with a half-contemptuous dread, did
                  she think upon the elder sister, Blanche Maderon, shrined in her saintly show of
                  purity—living that enchanting life of dreams? Why, combat as she would with
                  herself, did her heart still turn so fondly toward Vesta, drawn by an irresistible
                  attraction to think upon her looks, and ponder on her words, and call to mind her
                  gestures, smiles, and dress, and even the very manner of her speech? Because in
                  Vesta there had been no change but for the better; because a wonderful wisdom and
                  a depth of feeling seemed veiled under the fashion of the world, in which guise
                  Vesta appeared. Here, this night, in her loneliness, the verdict dict of former
                  times was repeated, when Asia reflected upon Vesta Maderon.... heartily she loved
                  her.
               And love with Asia was a very weighty thing. Little she knew of it as yet, but it
                  was a passion that must enter the heart of her life. This was what love, with her,
                  comprehended. To treasure up words, the lightest tones uttered by lips beloved—to
                  reflect upon, and cherish them; to delight in, or to grieve over them; to wonder
                  at, to think of rapturously. Love with her could be but an absorbing emotion—an
                  unnatural and absurd emotion it seemed to her now, when she reflected on the
                  manner in which her soul was stirred by the return of Vesta Maderon.
               She lay down upon her bed, but she could not sleep. At length, as at a cry, she
                  suddenly sprang from her couch, paced the chamber with vehement steps, and finally
                  seated herself again by the window-side.
               The stillness, the utter calm without, seemed to rebuke the excitement to which,
                  during the last hour, she had given way. She smiled as she quietly resumed her
                  seat there, and began to reflect more tranquilly and methodically concerning those
                  things and truths which had occupied her mind while engaged in her daily toils.
                  Who had in the first place taught her, by example, how to dream? Dreaming Blanche
                  Maderon. Now she asked herself self
                  somewhat angrily, was she not indebted to this same idle, purposeless creature,
                  for all the restlessness, unhappiness, and discontent, of her life. To her
                  immediately she was thus indebted—to the words of former days, when she and Vesta
                  had listened by the hour to the tales of romance and daring, which Blanche had
                  told—tales which set forth deeds of might wrought by the hands, and by the loving
                  and courageous hearts, of women. This foundation had Blanche Maderon built within
                  her; and the work of Blanche was done. What should be raised thereon?
               It was a strange foundation, and a strong. A Gothic style of architecture would be
                  in keeping with that foundation: but where was the workman to raise pillar, beam,
                  and arch—the carver, the designer, the architect? Who would bring the painted
                  lights, through which the rays of heaven should be transformed for her individual
                  use and need? To what artist should be intrusted the task of producing then the
                  figures of thought which should act as living powers in the service of the temple
                  of her life? 'Twas but an idle fancy: from it she turned away impatiently. If
                  there were indeed an architect who had to do with her life, it was
                     herself—not Vesta Maderon! NOT Aaron Gregorias!
               Unsatisfied with the good that was given her—not because it was common, but that
                  it was merely human—she had withdrawn into herself. There, where the longing
                  originated, perhaps the satisfaction might be found—how found? By heeding the
                  voices that spoke within her. But they were speaking confusedly, and in
                  contradiction. Who should make sense of the disorder? who distinguish the tongue
                  that must be mightier than all the other languages that were spoken in her
                  soul?
               It was thus that Asia communed with herself in the silence of night. When she
                  stirred at last from the bowed position in which she had thrown herself before the
                  window, her eyes fell upon an old volume on the stand near by. Mechanically she
                  arose, opened the book, and began to read. Anything to escape from herself in that
                  hour. It was a volume of plays—plays which had been her delight and her study for
                  years. This night she read them as she would have read the Scriptures—as if,
                  indeed, she had in them life, if not eternal life. Reverently and meekly she read,
                  for she was weary and sick at heart, and not a trace of the evening's pride was
                  now visible in her face. As she turned a page, her eyes fell upon the words, "I AM
                  ONLY A POOR ACTRESS!"—and, as if a new, overwhelming thought was born of those
                  words, she pushed the book away; she bowed her head, and read no more.
               A sense of suffocation, a flying of thought with breathless speed to and fro, an
                  inflooding of dazzling light, a recompense in infinite measure for every past
                  misgiving, was furnished in that instant. It  so startled her at first, so bewildered her, that
                  she stood up and looked into the mirror suspended above the table, for the mere
                  purpose of discovering if she were still herself, or lost in some other life
                  irrevocably. She smiled at her own movement as she made it, and turned away, aware
                  that Asia was still herself, and herself alone—that a veil had merely been taken
                  from her eyes, which had hidden her from that self.
               In a high sense of the great word was Asia Phillips SATISFIED.
            
            
               X. DIVERSITIES OF GIFTS.
               A DAY of excruciating headache naturally followed a night like that which Asia had
                  spent. Of this Vesta Maderon heard through Jacob King, and on going down to the
                  cottage she made her way without ceremony into Asia's chamber. The door of the
                  room stood open, and Vesta, humming a tune, went in, bent over the bed, saluted
                  Asia with a kiss, and took from her hands with gentle force the book she was
                  reading.
               "What right have you to abuse your poor head in this way? Pale as a ghost—and
                  half-distracted with pain, I dare say! You must be marvellously fond of books; and
                  that is a new feature in your case, is n't it, Asia?"
               
               "I have been trying to forget this distracting pain in something pleasanter," was
                  Asia's reply.
               "And you can not go with me! how provoking! I was hoping for a walk to the lake
                  with you. I have been reserving the pleasure until we could go together."
               "I can go very well—it will do me good," said Asia, immediately rising, and making
                  the necessary preparations.
               "You are quite alone?" she asked, as they went out.
               "Certainly. You and I must go there alone. What a lovely view from your window,
                  Asia! I must have Blanche sketch it some day. This Maderon is a beautiful place:
                  one should be contented here." Her voice betrayed an unaffected thankfulness.
                  "Asia," she continued, "what have you been doing?—I was thinking so much of you
                  this morning! Uncle King says you have been living for others: but have you not
                  been living for yourself, too?"
               "For myself? Oh yes, of course."
               "And you have had thoughts of your own all along, too, I know. Yes, and you have
                  lived your own life!"
               "You would not charge me with that crime of thinking, if you had known me better
                  of late. When was I ever guilty of a thought? Wasn't I the veriest romp that you
                  ever knew—an everlasting busy-body body? Could I do anything but to subside into
                  the vigilant housekeeper I am, or have time for thinking of anything but the
                  management of our affairs? My energies lie in my hands and feet, as they have
                  always—not in my brain."
               "And in all this time nothing has occurred to disturb you? What a quiet time! How
                  much you would dislike a city life!"
               "Do you think so?"
               "Yes, unless you are for some special reason dissatisfied and disgusted with the
                  country."
               "I am not dissatisfied; certainly not disgusted."
               "Do you remember how we used to discuss what we read in books concerning the
                  wonderful things to be seen in cities? I was crazy to get away from this quiet
                  place in those days."
               "And were you disappointed?"
               "I would like you to be in a crowd, among the curious things which,
                  huddled together, make that great sham called a city. You would be so surprised to
                  see the wear, and tear, and rush of life!"
               "Of course you went to places of amusement?"
               "Dear, yes!" answered Vesta, as if the recollection were a weariness.
               "To the theatre?"
               There was not the slightest betrayal of any hidden thought in the voice that asked
                  this question, though it was a question that to Asia seemed so weighty.
               
               "To the theatre? Many times."
               "We used to be so dramatic, you remember! I suppose the actors you saw couldn't
                  compare with us, as we used to appear on the library-tables?"
               "Certainly not! But I made my appearance at the theatre many years too late. I was
                  disappointed. I couldn't for an instant rise above the thought that those
                  actresses and actors, great as they might be—called, were leading a perfectly
                  slavish life."
               "Oh, it was that which troubled you!" said Asia, and she seemed relieved.
               "That in part—the toil and weariness were so apparent."
               "Great works of any kind suggest the same reflection."
               "Not so palpably. Inspiration, the glory of genius, the beauty of that which is
                  done—these thoughts are uppermost in my mind when I see a work of art. But when
                  you see a human being, a woman particularly, coming upon the stage, elaborately
                  dressed, painted, adorned with tinsel, her beauty set off by footlights!—A WOMAN
                  occupying such a station, looking up to and down upon the crowd assembled to hear
                  her, and see her represent impassioned life of one description or another—making
                  an exhibition of the feelings which should never be produced for the gaze of the
                  multitude—I confess the sight is quite too much for me. I was at first amused, and
                  once or twice quite overwhelmed by the acting of a great tragedienne; but I pray I
                  may never be 'entertained' again, if it must be in that way."
               "I would like to see for myself," said Asia. "You're sure no canting friend has
                  induced you to think this way?"
               "I hate cant; my opinion is free-born and honest. As for you, there would be
                  excitement for you, doubtless. Perhaps you would find the theatre a constant
                  source of delight. I like well enough to see truth idealized, but on the stage you
                  only see it humanly intensified. A great actress!—well, there may be different
                  kinds of greatness, but I must say no passion peculiar to human nature attracts me
                  when I see it drawn larger than life upon the stage."
               "Are not some persons perfectly unfitted for every other stage of life? gifted so
                  decidedly for that sphere, that it would be impossible for them to fill another
                  station to any purpose?"
               "It may be: I have met with no such characters. For myself, I should choose any
                  other sort of gift."
               "We are not left to choose."
               "That is very true.... O this view! how lovely! It is certainly incomparable—the
                  same yesterday, to-day, and for ever, I trust!"
               "Would you not like to go upon the lake?"
               "Yes—no, you are unfit for exercise in that way to-day; and I shall have to learn
                  to use the oar again. I have quite forgotten that accomplishment, I think.  We will go and sit in the shade of my
                  oak like quiet and reasonable beings. By-the-way, have you kept your faith in the
                  fairies we used to believe in so devoutly, Asia?"
               "I saw them all die long ago, and one day when I was here alone, I attended their
                  funeral; it was just after you went away: they are all laid low," said Asia, with
                  a sad smile.
               "One who saw you last night for the first and last time would suppose you had
                  buried everything in the world you cared for—if, indeed, the thing ever lived for
                  which you really cared. I never before saw such a manifestation of icelike
                  indifference; and you used to be much more like fire than ice!"
               "Do you know how you demean yourself, Miss Vesta, when you speak so much
                  concerning my mind and look?" asked Asia, determined to at once and for ever
                  ascertain the ground on which she stood in relation to her old playmate and
                  friend. "Mrs. Maderon says our relations have changed, yours and mine, so greatly
                  that it is wild presumption in me to think of you at all in the way I used."
               "Does she say that, Asia?"
               "It is the only interpretation her words admit."
               "She and I think differently at times, do we not?"
               "For your own sake I trust so," said Asia promptly.
               "And we have different ways of expressing ourselves, and we are
                  different."
               "Heaven grant it!"
               "Then if you and I are friends, it will be neither your part nor mine to inquire
                  of other people what we shall think of each other."
               "It is a matter of little moment I know, Miss Vesta: You are yourself, and I am
                  myself."
               "In the first place, I do not understand you when you call me Miss;
                  secondly, it makes a very material difference with me if an old friend allows the
                  word of any third person to come between her and myself. We are ourselves; but—we
                  have some sort of interest in—yes, and a good deal of affection for, each other,
                  have we not?"
               "It was what I thought, and verily I hoped so."
               "You thought and hoped as you were bound to do. We are friends just as we were,
                  according to the dictates of our hearts, and of common sense. We'll have no
                  quarrel at all, no matter who attempts to provoke one. Have you any acquaintances
                  or friends in the village?"
               "None whatever."
               "And the house, and uncle, and aunty, and your books, have wholly occupied you. Of
                  course you have several times been in love? What has become of Mark Heaton?"
               "I was never in love. Mark Heaton died years ago."
               "Quite a tender passion I had for him once."
               "Is that what ladies call love?" asked Asia, looking ing with earnest scrutiny into the laughing face
                  before her.
               "I suppose it is, only they learn from a larger edition of the same book."
               "Then I humbly beseech Heaven to defend me from infection of such a humbug! I'd
                  sooner be possessed of the devil."
               "The one power might furnish you a more exciting, wilder career, than the other!"
                  said Vesta. "You make rather a bold speech, at all events. I fancy you do n't
                  exactly understand what it is to be possessed of the devil."
               "To be actuated by a fierce and great desire, which Heaven alone could master. And
                  this, I think, would be a more desirable state than that of a stupidity, from
                  which the unfortunate can be roused only by miracle."
               "Neither are the possessed dispossessed, save by miracle. I should prefer the
                  torpid state. Inaction is preferable to crime."
               "Crime supposes power."
               "And power is what you idolize?"
               "What I respect."
               "Ah! I have found you again. That rejoices me. You are changed somewhat, but you
                  are not altogether another person. Here, then, endeth the first chapter. Tell me
                  the heading of that which is to come."
               "I don't know it myself."
               "Then let me discover it, and make you acquainted with what you are to do.
                  Meanwhile, you are to recollect that I have a certain apartment up at Maderon
                  house, into which I shall admit only those I love."
               "But—Mrs. Maderon," faltered Asia.
               "Is not going to frighten you away, I assure you. How absurd!"
               "And Miss Maderon?"
               "Blanche is my own dear sister. When she knows you as you are now, she will—she
                  will admire you, Asia, trust me."
               "Do you not know," said Asia, "that she can never know me, nor I her? A natural
                  law will for ever prevent."
               "If this is so," said Vesta, "then, at least, you have me, and I you. We shall not
                  very soon outgrow each other; or, if you do happen to outgrow me, why, I will sit
                  at your feet—you shall teach me."
               They laughed; the idea seemed so ridiculous.
            
            
               
               XI. THE END OF THINGS CREATED.
               OUR life in its early morning is as a chamber facing to the east, which receives
                  upon its walls and ceiling the full glory of the rising sun. To the succeeding
                  hours of day we must look for the suffusion, the mild interpenetration of light,
                  which satisfies, and dazzles not. These succeeding hours are, perhaps, the holy
                  hours of life. During their continuance, we walk as seeing the Invisible.
               In a measure had Borland proved the truth of this. His life was yet in its
                  morning, though it had approached nearly to its noon. The fresh dew had exhaled;
                  the first blaze of illuminating glory, the awaking was over. The milder radiance
                  had duly succeeded when he saw and loved Margaret Franklin lin. But now, suddenly,
                  the heavens were enveloped with clouds; cold and heavy winds went sighing through
                  his heart. As he looked forward, the noonday of life seemed fraught but with storm
                  and darkness. A new revelation was made for him.
               No mortal can live and avoid consciously beholding many a transfiguration; a
                  disrobing of soul, not by voluntary revealment, but by involuntary. We can never
                  know another merely by his confessions; the most communicative person that ever
                  knelt at confessional has not betrayed himself to priestly ear—there
                  is something held in reserve. There is a voice more potent than words can be—the
                  voice of glances and of works.
               What can we know of the beings around us? We mingle with them, we buy and sell, we
                  laugh and talk, and love and marry, we live and die with them; but we understand
                  them not, we understand them never, until the day or moment of illumination,
                  revelation, transfiguration—that moment when they stand changed before us in a
                  blaze of light, which shows them to us perfectly, which gives them to us
                  wholly.
               Not always in such times of discovery does the face of the transfigured shine
                  before us as the face of an angel. Hell, as well as heaven, is divested of its
                  symbolism; the great realities of the hereafter, a conception of the wondrous
                  possibility, denied by some and wonderfully misapprehended by others ers, rushes in upon us. We see how it
                  is that a time must come at last, when the light of sun or candle
                  shall be needed nevermore. We understand why the "worm" can prey for ever, how the
                  "fire" can remain unquenched consuming for ever the victim unconsumable.
               Such transfigurations are certainly not acts of will, but of necessity,
                  instead—they are involuntary. The careful soul takes good heed lest it betray
                  itself. It holds fast its precious secrets; it rejoices in its inestimable
                  isolation, when, in a moment, all unconsciously, behold! Heaven or hell—ETERNITY
                  opens, and the revelators appear. They speak to the transfigured, and they so
                  reveal him as they only can reveal. Alas! we do not often hear the glad
                  announcement and recognition from above and beyond: "This is MY Beloved!"
               IT was a dreadful, yet a very beautiful transfiguration, that Theodore Borland
                  beheld in the being loved by him above all others on the earth—dreadful, not
                  because of the revelation, but by reason of the revelator.
               They were journeying among the mountains, the bridegroom and his bride, on the
                  bridal-day, when the revelator, Death, appeared. In the morning of that day these
                  travellers had vowed their love at the altar; only a day's journey, and, in the
                  evening, they stood together at another altar for sacrifice.
               The marriage of Margaret Franklin with Borland was, as we have seen, an impulse—it
                  could hardly be called the result of a deliberate thought.
               Until within a few weeks, they had been merely aware of the fact of each other's
                  existence. Angelo, the brother, was then the connecting link between them. His
                  love for his sister, his devotion toward Borland, had tended to interest them in
                  the divided lives they were leading. His words had greatly excited Margaret's
                  admiration for the devoted and wonderful friend Angelo had found in the great man:
                  they had likewise aroused the great man's desire to see and know more of the young
                  girl than had been possible during his brief occasional visits at the house of Mr.
                  Lynn.
               Thus inspired with renewed interest, they had again met. They had come forth—one
                  in the brightness, and beauty, and lustrous purity of youth; the other in the
                  fulness, and confidence, and strength of manhood—from the two worlds in which they
                  lived. They were impelled toward each other. They married; and then, on the
                  glorious summer morning, as we know, Borland resumed his journey, and Margaret
                  began with him the tour of life.
               And now, suddenly, the anticipations in which  they so rejoiced were terribly broken. They had
                  reached this height, and here Margaret and Borland were to part! She, so 
                     inxperienced
                     inexperienced
                   a traveller, was from this point to ascend, to leave him, her guide,
                  thus early on her first journey—was to go forth without him to the undiscovered
                  country.
               Their destination was far beyond the mountain-land. But Borland chose that path
                  which was noted for its ministrations to the spirit of adventure, preferring, for
                  the sake of the contrast, to come thus upon the vine-land, the fair and sunny
                  plain, the fertile valleys, which stretched beyond and far away.
               Borland was happy. In the glory of that morning he renewed his youth. He forgot
                  that it had been exhausted, as he looked upon the bright and tranquil maiden who
                  had fearlessly trusted herself, with the confidence of love, to his care. He was
                  now once more indulging in hopes which threw their golden shadows far into the
                  future, for he felt no longer alone.
               This girl who manifested toward him such singular (singular to him, but not so
                  would it seem to any woman) and child-like trust, such impassioned devotion, she
                  was with him, she was his. As he looked upon her, and listened to her, this
                  unuttered hope was in his mind; perhaps such trust, enthusiasm, love, would
                  finally become a part of his own nature. A misfortune, for such he conceived the
                  providence to be, had subdued, in a measure, the pride of Borland, had broken his
                  iron strength. For an instant he had felt inefficient, too lonely for conflict and
                  struggle, and for defiant battling with what seemed to be his fate. He was in a
                  state to acknowledge that even he might learn the secret of all true joy from
                  communion with the spirit of a woman, and it was while this mood continued that he
                  married.
               It was the crisis of his life—this marriage-day; a dread event marked the crisis
                  indelibly. According as he accepted or understood the providence of God at this
                  juncture, would it be with him henceforth. Subdued, transformed in the presence of
                  her transfiguration, he might go from the mountain height into the world, or
                  petrified by his own hidden tears, and untold grief, he might remain a monument,
                  and not of grace, henceforth.
               Many times the voice, from the depth of Heaven, had spoken for his hearing; but,
                  according to his own desire, had he interpreted the voice; now it was evident that
                  the fate of what Gregorias termed the new church, was at stake. It was the last
                  ordeal which Borland was to undergo; the last test was being applied.
               The journey through the valley was made speedily, and before noon, the travellers
                  began to ascend the high lands. And now they made no haste; the weary horses went
                  at their own gait.
               
               Many times during the difficult, wild, and inspiriting ascent, Borland and
                  Margaret alighted from the carriage to walk leisurely by the roadside; and, as
                  they went from point to point, from height to height, they turned often to look
                  upon the changing landscape far below and beyond them. Borland's worshipping
                  audiences would hardly have recognised him, had they met him there, and seen him,
                  as he went gathering flowers for his "child-wife," discoursing to her on all
                  lovely, and beautiful, and happy themes; forgetting for a time the grand and the
                  mysterious, which were more frequently the subjects of his converse. For himself,
                  he had on this day truly forgotten all that was in the world save her.
               In blessed interchange of quiet thought passed the hours of that long, blessed
                  day. Never before, to any human being, had Borland spoken the thoughts which now
                  came involuntarily to his lips. He was not afraid to dream aloud before her; and
                  never, even for angels, or for Blanche Maderon, had Margaret Franklin revealed
                  herself so completely, as now to the man who listened to her utterances with
                  unfeigned reverence and awe.
               Oh, day divine, incomparable, in the history of each! Day in which all the wine of
                  life was poured out for them! The joy of years was compassed in those flying
                  hours; for her, they were sufficient; they comprehended all that time could give:
                  for him, for him the remembrance was to remain, a continual cause for
                  thanksgiving, or an abiding occasion for murmuring regret, or rebellious madness,
                  or for the exercise of his philosophy, for the calm endurance required by that
                  stoical philosophy.
               Until the approach of evening, there was no appearance of a storm, and at that
                  time the Mountain House was yet far off; they had intended to conclude their first
                  day's journey with the romance of the moonlight of June. But heavy clouds, red and
                  black, and purple, began to overspread the sky; then, gradually, a thick darkness
                  covered earth and heaven, the clouds opened, as if for a second deluge, and it was
                  during the blind effort made to reach a place of shelter and safety, that the
                  shocking accident occurred.
               To Margaret, when the terror was over, the exhaustion surmounted, and she was
                  dying gradually of the dreadful wounds received when the uprooted pine was borne
                  with thundering crash upon the carriage, to her, beautiful thoughts came as
                  friendly angels, to comfort and refresh her with inward strength.
               Borland never, for a moment, suspended exertions that were almost superhuman in
                  their nature and effect, until he reached the house which was their destination.
                  He left her not for an instant after the accident; so long as there was a hope
                  that  human effort or aid could avail,
                  he sent his messengers to and fro, winged with his own energy.
               Through all the agony of Margaret's sufferings, which he, by sympathy, more than
                  shared, he remained beside her, endeavoring to uphold her, firm himself, and
                  apparently unmoved; but when she in turn conquered the anguish, and waited until
                  the last hour should come, peacefully and quietly as a child unconscious of
                  danger, undisturbed by the wounds, now that they gave her pain no longer, she
                  began to speak, and to comfort Theodore. Then he bowed his head in uncontrollable
                  helplessness; the strong man, who had proclaimed that the power of grief was but a
                  fiction of fancy, which a glance at nature could disprove and dispel; and, beside
                  that bed of death, he wept the bitterest tears of grief.
               It was during that night after the bridal-day, which, in subsequent times seemed
                  to him as verily a "night of years," that Margaret made bare before him the soul
                  he had fancied he already understood; and, during the hour of the transfiguration,
                  even sorrow was mastered by astonishment.
               How beautiful, in that crisis, did her belief stand forth! The rough shock, the
                  unceremonious introduction into the presence of death, which was to Borland as is
                  the reality of poverty, to the poor, deluded dreamer of high and gorgeous dreams,
                  this accident, or rather this providence, manifesting itself self in the
                  withdrawal of his bride, caused him to behold in her a sudden shooting into fuller
                  life of all those uncontaminated buds of thought and faith, of whose existence he
                  might have learned already, by their fragrance and shadow.
               Borland was seated close beside the pallet on which she lay. He was watching his
                  bride, and he fancied that she slept; she lay so quietly, the expression of her
                  face was entirely calm. But he mistook, it was not sleep; nor was it death, which
                  he had never seen; it was a lapsing into heavenly meditation.
               "Only the nearer," she murmured at length, without opening her eyes.
               Borland did not comprehend that a grander truth was being spoken in the seraphic
                  light beaming from her pale face, than could possibly be spoken by mere words. He
                  refrained from 
                     utterrance
                     utterance
                  , he thought she slept. He supposed that the spiritual life illuminating
                  her countenance was only a token of the inward peace which had fallen upon her
                  with some lovely dream; and, therefore, he feared her waking. He dreaded the
                  withdrawal of the visioned brightness, the return of a sense of danger, and of
                  pain.
               He had no need for fear; she was so awakened that she could never again
                  slumber.
               How lovely, how holy, was that expression! not like the splendor of sunlight shone
                  forth the trust  of her soul; it the
                  rather appeared in her calm and confident recognition of an everlasting good. It
                  was a moonlit scene; moonbeams spreading over the bosom of a quiet lake; the
                  subdued glowing of light through polished shell; a lamp-ray from an alabastar
                  vase.
               "Only the nearer," she repeated, "and the next mountain-top lies in Heaven, and
                  there art THOU, and there shall I behold THEE."
               When Borland heard this, he knew that his wife was not sleeping; and awe and
                  silence bound him, heart and hand. Margaret was communing with God—with that
                  HIGHER SELF, he said to his soul, into which she was being rapidly absorbed!
               It was her hour—this he felt—it was not his.
               She turned toward him. Light was beaming in her eyes, and a happy smile—extending
                  her hand she said, as if reading his thought, and endeavoring to combat it in such
                  manner as she might:—
               "Our Savior also went up into the mountain, and he was tempted there. Perhaps it
                  is now with you, as it was then with him. But he proved the temptation to be
                  powerless. Perhaps it was with a human nature's regret that he saw the kingdoms of
                  the earth, and the glory of them, sweeping past in magnificent procession. Yet he
                  let them go. Do not lessen your sacrifice, Theodore, by one murmur of regret.
               "He went up into the mountain," she continued, more tenderly, yet speaking with an
                  enthusiasm that was sublime at such a moment, "and there he was transfigured. Let
                  us receive the symbol. It is here, upon this mountain, that I shall be changed.
                  And the change we know, is not dreadful, but glorious. Yet I must be humble. Oh!
                  we were looking for years of life, in which to unveil our souls to one another;
                  and, perhaps, we have not as many minutes, as the years we anticipated. To
                  eternity then we will look! Let us go forward toward it with joy. There we shall
                  meet, surely to re-unite, and then to learn each other as we can not now. I know
                  ... we had kept to ourselves some dear thoughts which we would have revealed to
                  each other, you for me, and I for you. But we had them in mind only in connection
                  with summer-days, and everything beautiful. This hope, for the present, is gone,
                  and all that belongs to this life passes so swiftly. Angelo! Theodore, remember I
                  spoke his name to you when I was dying. You have loved him so tenderly, and served
                  him so nobly; you will not forget your Margaret's brother... We can not say, we
                  can not imagine, what we shall be; only this we know, it will be well with us, if
                  God be in our thoughts! A reality, or a vision, according as he has endowed us;
                  yes, according as he has advanced, and enabled us! It is so with you, Theodore, is
                  it not? You are looking forward with me to another state of life. You
                      do not fear—you do not
                  think it horrible, now that I am going?"
               "Margaret, I have no fear, not the shadow of a fear for you," he said with sad
                  earnestness, "but I am not satisfied," he added, gloomily. "I am not content with
                  this disposition of things. Had this day seen the conclusion of my journey, as
                  well as yours, I could fold my hands, and be tranquil. But I confess I do not
                  understand the mercy as you would name it, nor do I see the justice or the
                  goodness, that to your mind occasions your removal."
               "All this we shall certainly understand hereafter. Think that, Theodore. Ah, I
                  know you are aware of it already. You believe as I do. I knew it all the while. I
                  might as well look back with sighing to the solitary days of my life, when I had
                  not you, when I had none to think of, and love, and hope for, but Angelo. It is
                  not for us to bewail the past, or to think much of it. Certainly our
                  Father has no design but of good toward us. Let us speak of the future; let us
                  think of that. Do you know what was in my mind just as the carriage—" She
                  shuddered, stopped speaking, and covered her face with her hands for an instant;
                  then said resolutely—"Just before the accident? Do you remember what we were
                  speaking of?"
               "It was of the rainbow that appeared before the storm."
               "Oh yes, and I was thinking of our mutual life, and how we should move on
                  together, and of the steps we should ascend before we could hope to enter
                  heaven."
               "And behold you are going at a bound! How much worthier, then, are you than I! For
                  to you wings are given at once, and so early! while I must resume my walk, lonely
                  as ever." The words he spoke were one prolonged groan.
               "Theodore, when our Father gives to such as you long life, be sure it is for some
                  good purpose. You have something to do. He has seen that you can do the work,
                  whatever it may be, better if alone," said the young wife gently, and with mild
                  reproach.
               She paused, and for a moment her eyes closed. Courageous as were the words of the
                  saint, the heart of the woman shrank from the bitter thought of separation.
               "But," she resumed, "I would not willingly die entirely to you. I would love to be
                  associated with something very beautiful in your thoughts; I would love to be a
                  pleasant recollection, that should cheer and revive you at some weary time when
                  nothing else was near to soothe. My mother," fondly she lingered, as she, for the
                  first time in his hearing, named the blessed name of mother—"my mother used a
                  great while ago, when I was very young, to call me Luna—because it was on a
                  moonlit night, like this it must have been, that my father first  spoke to her of love. Afterward she told me that
                  through this pet name I was a constant remembrance of that night. She who crowned
                  my youth with flowers, and sometimes in her fondness called me their queen, has
                  been associated with the bright summer-days of my life, and with the blessed
                  flowers. Of me—think—will you—in connection with that rainbow, and that last hour
                  when we came through the valley, and began to ascend the mountain?"
               As she said this, a sudden recollection seemed to change the current of her
                  thoughts. Restlessly she moved upon the bed, as though searching for something she
                  had lost. Then clasping her hands upon her forehead, she said, convinced of the
                  folly of her attempt to recall a vanished recollection—
               "I have lost the flowers you gathered for me. What could I have done with them? I
                  should have been so proud had I wakened and found them still in my hands!"
               Borland arose quickly. A smile broke through the heavy cloud of gloom that had
                  settled over his face. From a table he brought a few crushed, fading blossoms, and
                  laid them before her.
               "I took them from your dear hands after you were brought here, my angel of
                  Iris!"
               She looked up with sudden tears and a glad smile, as he called her by that
                  name.
               He stayed not to ask himself, within the stern silence of his soul, whether he
                  believed what his lips now uttered. To make her departure happy was his only
                  desire. The words came forth as irresistible utterances of the spirit of his
                  heart, yet they were strange words on his lips, and had no meaning for his
                  soul:—
               "You shall indeed be to me, Margaret, the angel of Iris. To all the storms of life
                  God sets the seal of promise. I will indeed bear with me a strong heart, for He
                  who is love gave you to me. I will toil upward toward his dwelling-place, and when
                  I enter his presence I shall meet you there."
               They were potent words. "They call this man an infidel," she said in her own
                  heart. "I knew I understood you!" she exclaimed aloud; and, forgetful of her
                  weakness and her wounds, with a thankful, joyous impulse, inspired by the belief
                  that their faith and aims were really one, Margaret sprang forward to embrace her
                  husband.
               When he felt her lying like a dead weight upon his breast, a mighty storm of
                  anguish burst upon the heart of Borland. He laid her back upon the bed with firm
                  and gentle hand, and then he saw it was not death, but weakness, that had silenced
                  her. Speechless, motionless, wakeful, conscious, adoring, yet submissive, she lay,
                  with her hand clasped closely in his, while the hours of night went over them.
               At last a deeper shadow overspread the earth;  the moon had set, and even the struggling starlight
                  was withdrawn.
               It was in the depth of the ensuing gloom and darkness, in the warring of the
                  elements, before the morning broke upon the night of sorrow, that Borland heard
                  again, for the last time, the voice of his bride, as she murmured, softly as a
                  child that with whispered words hushes itself to sleep—"My record is on high;" and
                  then again—"Into the infinite tranquillity translate me, holy Father!"
               The word or the prayer was that instant realized. Even as she said it, was her
                  pure and guileless spirit borne away.
               Borland knew the very instant that she died. Yet when he saw that all was over, he
                  made no effort to arise and call in others who should behold his bereavement.
               Once, after she spoke those final words, he raised his head and looked upon her;
                  and the sight of the fair face, so pale and calm—the thought of the glowing life
                  which had come up with him into the desolate mountain, only to die at midnight
                  there—was more than he could well sustain. The great philosopher was aware of an
                  overthrow, even as he beheld the development of a catastrophe so marvellously
                  common as that of death! And he would not suffer any human eye to be the witness
                  of such "abomination of desolation." And yet, had any mortal witnessed that
                  spiritual overthrow, and said to him, in expostulation, or derision, or
                  sympathy—"Behold, He taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, 'What
                  doest thou?"'—Borland would have looked down from his mental altitude upon the
                  speaker, and by silence have expressed the contemptuous pity that he felt for the
                  driveling morality of the intruder!
            
            
               
               XII. ANGELS OF CONSOLATION.
               THE family at Maderon house had assembled in the drawing-room after breakfast.
                  Gregorias was with them: he had come up thus early in the day to offer the
                  judgment of a critic concerning a piece of statuary, of whose safe arrival the
                  night preceding, Mrs. Maderon had duly notified him.
               The pedestal on which the sculptor's work was placed, was a high, square block of
                  white marble: the figures were an image of the kneeling Savior, and the angel who
                  came to minister unto him.
               A daring theme the artist chose, and glorious was the achievement.
               An agony such as no mere human heart could have borne, a sustaining grace such as
                  no human heart could have extended, was made manifest in the figures of the bowed
                  and drooping Savior, and the seraphic form that bent over, and upheld him. A
                  sorrow that was divine, a sympathy that was angelic—this had the sculptor, acting
                  on the impulse of his moments of inspiration, set forth.
               A fine opportunity was offered for study of one point of the character of those
                  who had secured to themselves this creation of genius, as they placed it to their
                  satisfaction in the alcove, hung, for its reception, with crimson velvet.
               Gregorias, on whose judgment Mrs. Maderon entirely relied, pronounced upon it as a
                  work of art, and thus alone.
               The representation of an overpowering agony, of a form that in its capacity of
                  Godhead was strong to bear up under its matchless burden, that yet in its human
                  capacity drank the bitterness of the cup, and knew its bitterness—and bore the
                  load, and knew its intolerable heaviness—this neither shocked nor moved him. He
                  looked upon the figures cut from marble as on a work that was executed with more
                  or less skill: no higher idea was conveyed to him. He saw the artist's fancy
                  concerning a dying God—the artist's conception of an inhabitant of a sphere of
                  life more radiant than our own: no more.
               The expression of infinite sorrow revealed in the uplifted countenance of the
                  Redeemer, he said, was  perfect: the
                  expression of the seraph's wings was such as none but a true artist could have
                  imparted to marble. But—and he smiled with a refined derision—how unfortunate the
                  curls that bordered the angel's forehead! what a sin against taste, art, and
                  truth! In the name of sense, whence could those curls have come?—from a night's
                  paper-wrappings? or a pair of heated tongs? Then, too, the polished band about the
                  forehead, that kept the rows of curls so properly in their places! And, of all
                  things horrible, an angel in a robe! Gregorias had his laugh, and then went on to
                  praise, which he did heartily, for he saw that his aunt was vexed at his liberal
                  criticism. Ah, they were certainly no human hands, he said; and the angel's feet,
                  so spiritual in their poise and form, they were altogether of another style than
                  the feet of plodding mortals! Yes, as a whole, Gregorias, who had seen many
                  angels, considered this angel quite angelic. And Mrs. Maderon was of the like
                  opinion.
               Silent, dumb with admiration, Vesta Maderon stood at the extreme end of the
                  drawing-room, neither hearing the remarks of Cousin Aaron, nor watchful of the
                  rapt ecstasy of Blanche.
               Gradually, as she gazed, a thought that had never presented itself save in some
                  vague shape, burst upon her, and it lay upon her mind like a cloud of
                  darkness.
               It was a revelation from Heaven. Of such a revelation she had
                  been long in need, though she was hardly conscious of the fact. It answered to a
                  spiritual want: the representation gave voice to a long unbroken silence—gave form
                  to a vague idea of that great sufferer, which had lain half-hidden in the mind,
                  rarely referred to, because the beautiful present satisfied Vesta Maderon.
               But here, and now, there was a sudden change. That Fact of the ancient day came up
                  into the present, and stood before her. She saw it—the one immutable Truth that
                  binds together all times, all lives, all hopes: she beheld it—the world's great
                  and permeating idea; and the divine tragedy was a theme for dreams no longer.
               She gazed upon the marble, until the sight was more than she could bear—until his
                  supplication seemed sounding in her ear, and the stillness of that solitary place
                  which he had sought, encompassed her. She saw him bowed in agony, the Deliverer of
                  all who should agonize thereafter. She beheld the Brightness descending from on
                  high, to support him, when the human nature failed, and her eyes drooped tearfully
                  from contemplation of the representation, so feeble in comparison with all that it
                  suggested. Never before had so earnest a petition burst from her soul, as when she
                  turned from gazing on the vision of the artist.
               Blanche Maderon had also been touched with  silence in presence of the work. She, also, was
                  heedless of the skilful discourse carried on between Gregorias and Mrs. Maderon.
                  She was seated on an ottoman in the centre of the room; and so expressive was her
                  beautiful face of rapt admiration, awe, and sympathy with the artist who had
                  planned, and carried forward his conception to this manner of completion, that
                  Mrs. Maderon, struck by her appearance, posture, beauty, and evident abstraction,
                  could think of no better or wiser thing to do, than to call Gregorias' attention
                  to the rare piece of living statuary.
               Her admiration was not that of the critic—it was a frank appreciation; it awakened
                  the desire, as many a work of art had done before, to achieve herself, some great
                  work, which in turn should yield its measure of delight to others: but this
                  impulse of ambition died, as it had before, almost in a moment away. She cared not
                  to detect a fault where there was so much to praise. Neither was her satisfaction
                  that of the religious heart, inspired anew to thanksgiving and praise by the
                  presentation of that which is the basis of the Christian's hope. One look at the
                  fair face, the graceful figure, the still rapture beaming from her eye, and the
                  smile upon her lip, told the sort of admiration that was unspoken.
               Blanche arose at length, and passing up the room to Gregorias, whose hand rested
                  upon the marble pedestal, she said: "It is something to have seen a creation like
                  this, is it not, Cousin Aaron?"
               A word in answer was upon his lip, as he turned toward Blanche with a glance,
                  which, as it fixed upon her face, revealed an admiration for the living work
                  beside him, such as the marble had not awakened; but, before the word was spoken,
                  Vesta, who had left the room, re-entered, accompanied by a stranger, with whom she
                  advanced toward Mrs. Maderon, introducing him as Mr. Franklin.
               He was Margaret's brother, Angelo. Had Margaret's self stood there in his stead,
                  the centre of that happy circle, sounds of merry voices had been heard within the
                  drawing-room, and laughter, and every manifestation of the gladness of gay hearts.
                  But the sudden appearance of this young, mourning stranger, who had been the theme
                  of Margaret's converse, and the hope of Margaret's heart so many years—spite of
                  the words of welcome that were said, and the gentle chiding of Blanche for his
                  delay in obeying their call—chilled and embarrassed the friends gathered around
                  him.
               He was pale and haggard, as if worn out with journeying, or toil, or a great
                  grief; and, as he looked from one to another of the family, he seemed hardly able
                  to control some powerful emotion.
               But his silence concerning the invitation which had been extended to him a month
                  ago, and the unceremonious manner of his final acceptance of it,  were explained, when he made known the irreparable
                  loss which Borland and himself had sustained in the death of Margaret.
               Franklin had a claim upon them all, which he needed not to urge, in the friendship
                  existing between Borland and Gregorias, and in the affection which had united his
                  sister with Blanche and Vesta Maderon. The very manner of his speech concerning
                  his bereavement and desolateness—the confidence manifested by this stranger in
                  these people, merely because they had been Margaret's friends—won upon the
                  worldliest heart among them. They received him as a brother; and it was no
                  difficult thing, to learn to love him, on his own account, with a sincere
                  affection. His youth, his earnestness, his manliness, his piety, and his
                  profession, awakened a variety of interest for him in Maderon house. On the other
                  hand, for years he had not known another home than the student's humble room, and
                  these people bade him call their splendid place his home!
               Several weeks he remained with them as a guest, preaching each returning Sabbath
                  in the vacant pulpit of the church which the Maderons attended. And the
                  unsuspected manœuvre of Blanche and Gregorias perfectly succeeded. The fervent
                  eloquence and natural dignity of the young preacher, who in this place first made
                  his appearance as a teacher, and the calm, high praise which the great family
                  bestowed upon him, as if his abilities were not to be questioned even, succeeded
                  in convincing, and in captivating, those most interested. A call was accordingly
                  extended to him: Angelo, after consultation with Mr. Lynn, accepted it; and from
                  Maderon house he went into the village, and secured lodgings there.
            
            
               
               XIII. WOMANHOOD.
               THE whole summer following their return was as one long day of pleasure to Mrs.
                  Maderon and her daughters. At Maderon house, all things went on precisely as its
                  mistress could have wished. Visitors came and went through all the season. Blanche
                  and Vesta were the admiration of all eyes, plebeian and aristocratic. Angelo
                  Franklin, whom she considered under her especial care, was drawing larger
                  audiences than any pastor of the church had ever done before in that village. The
                  church itself was become the pride and boast of the people, and the lady of the
                  house more than their admiration, since the organ, Mrs. Maderon's gift, and the
                  stained window-lights, also her gift, and the new altar-furniture niture, also her
                  gift, appeared in the little edifice to such advantage.
               It was a high place, in truth, that this lady occupied; and with high dignity—high
                  "womanly" and "Christian" dignity, they said—she filled it. Maderon was the field
                  of her labors, Maderon was the recipient of her benefactions. Never was her purse
                  withdrawn when a demand was made upon it; never was her potent name withheld, when
                  it was needed for the purposes of charity.
               We are told that "the gift without the giver is bare:" but this, no doubt, is a
                  mere flimsy bit of sentiment; the idle poet who perpetrated it should have been in
                  better business; and the spirit of the Douglass who entertained Lord Marmion was
                  that of a genuine hospitality! Sentimental poets are sad humbugs. Just and
                  righteous was Mrs. Maderon in all her ways, they said; but Asia Phillips,
                  methinks, was a stubborn fact these praisers should have noticed.
               The summer had been to them, they would all have said at Maderon house, as a day
                  of pleasure. Yet a summer-day of pleasure has its light annoyances, which none
                  remember when the day is past, and still, at the time of their occurrence, they
                  were none the less annoyances.
               And beyond measure had Mrs. Maderon been sometimes annoyed by the mention, which
                  Gregorias seemed rather fond of making, of the name of  Asia Phillips. Perhaps, if the wary and wayward
                  Gregorias did really admire the style, or speech, or appearance of the girl, his
                  aunt could not have pursued a course more impolitic than that she saw fit to
                  adopt.
               Had it been in the power of Mrs. Maderon to effect their removal, the family at
                  the cottage would not have remained in possession a day after the interview
                  between herself and Asia in the gallery; but the cottage, by the will of Mr.
                  Maderon, was the home of Jacob King so long as he should live.
               Though Asia was a favorite with her, it was hardly possible that Vesta Maderon
                  should remain wholly unaffected by the unconcealed dislike of Mrs. Maderon, and
                  the light but sneering censure which Blanche would sometimes pronounce. And yet,
                  whenever Vesta had a wish to escape the commonplaces of society, it was to Asia
                  that she went, as sure of entertainment as she could have been, had she, instead,
                  sought companionship or relief of any powerful author. And never, when she had so
                  sought her, did she go again from Asia but to feel deeply the wrongful judgment so
                  often passed upon her, for the uncommon things she was found guilty of saying and
                  doing. It was, besides, quite impossible for Vesta to behold the devoted
                  tenderness, the constantly thoughtful care which Asia manifested toward the old
                  people of the cottage, and not suspect that all true womanliness was abiding in
                  her, however she might appear to those who, in their refinement, shrunk away from
                  an exhibition of the slightest originality of thought, word, or deed. Vesta
                  ventured to say as much, one day, to her mother, who thereupon took occasion to
                  skilfully conduct an argument with her, which led to Vesta's complete conviction,
                  as she supposed: but, looking from the window shortly after, Mrs. Maderon saw
                  Vesta and Asia Phillips walking together in the garden!
               Since the day when Blanche and Vesta came home, but one great desire had taken
                  hold of Mrs. Maderon's mind. From the hour when Blanche and Gregorias stood in
                  their first meeting, speaking together, the aunt and the step-mother had been
                  conscious of one absorbing wish. She was proud of her talented nephew: his
                  abilities were such as would do honor to any name or office: he had fought his way
                  upward from a lowly station (Mr. Maderon had brought her up from hers—loving her
                  for her beauty, and wedding her for that eminent qualification): and because she
                  was proud of him, and because it was her purpose to advance his fortunes in every
                  possible way, did it perplex and trouble her to hear him ever speak the name of
                  Asia Phillips. When she did so hear him speak, and with words of admiration, a
                  purpose found its way into her brain. And now, when she saw Vesta walking, as with
                  a sister, through the garden-walks 
                  with Asia—when, above all, she espied Gregorias standing on the green beneath the
                  window whence she gazed, watching the motions of Asia and of Vesta—that purpose
                  came again before her, and she went out hastily from her room, to stroll also in
                  the garden.
               Vesta had said:—
               "Asia, would you not like to be a missionary?"
               Asia, after momentary reflection, had replied:—
               "On some accounts I should. It would be splendid to visit the islands of the seas;
                  to sail over the great oceans, and encounter storms, perhaps shipwrecks; to go
                  where nature is the grand and liberal purveyor; to look on new, and strange, and
                  gorgeously-beautiful things: I think it would be glorious."
               "But those are not quite the motives that should actuate the missionary, I
                  suppose."
               "Oh, as to doing good—I find more of that sort of work before me every day, than I
                  can possibly accomplish. You are not going abroad in search of work,
                  Vesta?"
               "I'm tired of reading, and tired to death of embroidery; and one can not be for
                  ever praising the work of another. I even weary watching Blanche and her
                  interminable, exquisite painting. I want something to do myself. Come, Asia,
                  enlighten me."
               "Can you be put down with a laugh?" asked Asia.
               "I shall need to make an experiment before I answer that—I do not quite know
                  whether I am invulnerable," said Vesta frankly.
               "Would you like to be a missionary? I wonder if every girl don't have
                  some such idea in her head at one time or another."
               "Blanche had."
               "Blanche?"
               "Yes. Sometimes I really think that I should like to go."
               "You can 'go,' but it need not be far. You can go and tell Abby Weed to hope
                  on—that a better day is coming for her. Poor little creature! I like her so
                  much—because I can pity her, probably. It makes one feel so satisfied, if there be
                  only some one he can pity! Abby and I are somewhat alike, I sometimes think; it
                  would puzzle you to learn why. You ought to see how the family live. You might do
                  a good service for her. Or—if that seems work too small—I saw in a paper, to-day,
                  that a missionary station is established in that very city where you were at
                  school; there is a work there as great to do as can be done in any far-off island
                  of the Pacific. Go! go among the outcasts and exiles—deliver them from their
                  bonds. You will be canonized!"
               Asia spoke seriously. But, as Vesta turned  upon her quite an astonished look, she smiled and
                  said:—
               "How people would talk! how you would be ridiculed and censured by some folks! But
                  there are those at work in that way who will not be put down with a laugh, or a
                  sneer, I think. How weak we are! we are so afraid of real things and earnest
                  lives—so contented with shams and shows—so willing to put up with this intolerable
                  cant and sloth of scribes, pharisees, hypocrites!—this for ever wishing, and
                  never, by any mistake, doing!—this unutterable selfishness!"
               "I know it, and it makes me ashamed to think of it. We do nothing as we should. We
                  are nothing, when I know we might be so much. I wish sometimes, almost, that I
                  were a preacher like Mr. Franklin."
               "Why do you want to be a preacher like Mr. Franklin? That is his business, not
                  yours. There is enough for us all to do. Missionaries should have a knowledge of
                  human nature, Vesta, such as would inform them concerning the springs of human
                  action. Have you not thought, that perhaps not quite the right impulse led you to
                  wish this wish? For Heaven's sake, do something on your own responsibility, so
                  that no man shall have the face to say that you are trenching on his prerogatives!
                  Do something that shall make every woman that is guilty of a thought, or doubt, or
                  hope, proud of you—you can, I know, for you have the heart. There is no danger
                  that you will turn out a poor, paltry butterfly of fashion. You do n't belong to
                  the insect tribe. You must be the last to deck yourself with such kind of wings.
                  I, for one, would rather see you dead, and think of you as an angel. I used to
                  covet man his manhood; but I discovered that there was no great wisdom in that. It
                  is bad enough to live in any way—at least, it's no joke: still, if the good Lord
                  will only deliver me always from 'envy, hatred, and malice,' from folly and
                  vanity—which are the worst sins, because the most contemptible and mean—I shall be
                  willing to 'bide my time.'"
               Mrs. Maderon approached; and the purpose with which she had entered the garden was
                  not softened, or subdued, as she observed the free and energetic manner in which
                  Asia was speaking.
               "Vesta," she said, "Blanche has a headache and can not go, and I am occupied—will
                  you oblige me by accompanying Aaron in his drive to-day?"
               Vesta obeyed Mrs. Maderon; and, after she had gone, Asia continued standing
                  silently, as if under some spell; it seemed to her impossible to move away, as she
                  felt inclined to do, when she perceived as she at once did, Mrs. Maderon's design
                  in interrupting their conversation.
               "You find the garden looking well," said the bland voice of the lady.
               
               Asia bowed, but her words of reply were quite unintelligible.
               "Do you leave your uncle and aunt often alone? I suppose you call them so? are you
                  not afraid to leave them?"
               "I do not often leave them, ma'am. To-day I came up here at Vesta's request; she
                  wished me to walk with her in the garden," said Asia, civilly.
               "Your uncle, as you call him, never told you anything about yourself, I suppose.
                  If he had, I know you would decline a friendship which Miss Vesta seems to force
                  upon you, and which must, on some accounts, be disagreeable to you. It would
                  strike you as improper, as I tried in all kindness and consideration for your own
                  best good, to make you believe, when we first returned here. I am truly sorry, for
                  your own sake, that you have not felt disposed to accept my counsel; that you have
                  compelled me to allude, as I have, to things so disagreeable."
               "I do n't understand you, Mrs. Maderon," said Asia, trembling from head to foot;
                  "to what do you refer? I hope I never forget that which you have so often
                  endeavored to impress upon me; but that Vesta sometimes cares to speak with me,
                  does not seem derogatory even to her dignity; nor does it seem presumption, to me,
                  when I listen to her."
               "You are angry, as usual, when I venture to counsel you. If you knew a little more
                  than you do, you would see what I have presented, in precisely the light that I
                  view it; your good sense would be compelled to so perceive it. As a true friend, I
                  would advise you to be more prayerful, and more meek, for meekness becomes a
                  woman. Your temper does not speak well for the cultivation of Christian graces in
                  your soul."
               Before Asia could reply, Mrs. Maderon had walked away, and every word so gently,
                  yet so coldly uttered, had told upon the living soul of Asia. Had she yielded to
                  the momentary impulse, she would have hurried on after Mrs. Maderon, and extorted
                  from her an explanation of her strange words. Had she yielded to the impulse that
                  immediately followed that, she would have thrown herself upon the ground, and
                  given vent to her passion in an agony of tears; but she did neither. Ay! she
                  yielded, poor Asia! to no "woman-weakness," but after that first pause of
                  hesitation, she went from the garden, endeavoring to pray that she might be
                  delivered from the temptation that beset her; but a dull and heavy ache was in her
                  heart, and a distracting thought had found lodgment in her brain.
               Mrs. Maderon was certain, when she went away from Asia, that she should not need
                  to warn, or to reprove the girl again, so bowed, and crushed, and humbled, seemed
                  she by the mysterious words that  had
                  been spoken. Yet hardly had Asia passed beyond the garden-gate, when she stood
                  erect and strong in her own human strength again, and she said to herself, "This
                  woman is little better than the evil-one—she so constantly tempts me to be and do
                  my worst. She has tried now to frighten me by some falsehood. I see through it;
                  and I am not a child. She shall find that out." So that when Vesta, in the pure
                  charity of her soul, went that same day to say some kindly word Asia might perhaps
                  need to hear, she saw no trace or token of the morning's vexation in her; and
                  when, in reply to Asia's questioning, Vesta declared, and truly, her ignorance of
                  that to which Mrs. Maderon had alluded, Asia said to herself once more—"I am not a
                  child; she has stooped to a base fabrication, and I am now quite beyond her."
            
            
               XIV. NATHAN'S GHOST.
               NEVER had the elm-walk seemed more beautiful to Aunt Milly, than on the warm
                  sunshiny afternoon when she wandered along through it, repeating to her poor old
                  self snatches of a hymn that she and Nathan had sung together, many and many a
                  time before he ever went away to sea.
               She was going down to the lake-side, as she often did, to gather water-lilies for
                  her dear brother King. Sometimes she led the blind man with her in her walks; but
                  to-day she went alone, happier, calmer, than she had been in many days. Happier,
                  calmer, but her shattered mind was not restored, nor ever would, or could be, in
                  its mortal tenement.
               She was happy as a child to-day. Not once had she referred in thought to that
                  calamity which had  left her in her
                  youth a helpless, useless burden on the world.
               She went down with the careless steps of girlhood through the walk, and passing
                  along the beach, seated herself upon a stone that projected far into the
                  water.
               The lake was waveless; calm as though never a breath had ruffled the surface;
                  motionless, beautiful it lay in the quiet of that summer afternoon. The shadows of
                  the trees along the southern shore fell far up the lake, and the reflection given
                  was perfect, and unbroken. The lilies opened broadly to the light; they seemed
                  floating, like fairy-skiffs, upon the water. Many of these grew just about the
                  rock whereon Milly had seated herself; and, as she had proposed, she gathered them
                  for Jacob, who, though his eyes were closed to them, loved the flowers so
                  dearly.
               It was a touching sight to see the simple creature delighting as she did, as every
                  look and motion attested that she did, in the mild splendor of that summer-day; to
                  see her alone there in the midst of the loneliness of nature, where the birds went
                  flying to and fro, where the squirrel leaped from branch to branch, and from tree
                  to tree; where the serpent darted along the smooth grass to its hiding-place,
                  where the waters lay so still, where the pure white flowers lifted their heads
                  from the bosom of the lake, and looked up into the face of the cloudless less sky,
                  which for them could have no manner of reproach, which never shone before them as
                  the barrier beyond which they possibly might not pass, to another and better
                  state, a fuller and brighter expanding.
               What was it that suddenly brought from the gentle and harmless creature the wild
                  shriek of sorrow that burst like a profanation on the quiet of the place? Like a
                  spirit of terror and despair, fascinated that she can not fly, she raises herself
                  and stands upright upon the rock.
               What is the strange light that gleams from her eye as she gazes afar on the
                  motionless water? Is it dull idiocy? is it wild insanity? is it joyful
                  recognition? Ay! it is recognition! and that voice which has so often bewailed
                  "the seas and the waves roaring, and men's hearts failing them for fear," which
                  but now went forth in that sharp, quick cry of terror, is heard again in the
                  gladness of the recognition, crying, "Nathan! Nathan!"
               The ocean far away, in which the fated ship went down at midnight—it is here, in
                  this little, tranquil lake; and the beloved form which so long ago, so many years
                  ago, went down under the great waves to sleep beneath them till the sea shall give
                  up its dead, that form! lo! before her eyes, it is here—disturbed from its
                  slumbers by her faithful love. It is at hand! floating nearer, and nearer, and
                  nearer; she thought it was within her reach!
               
               In what breathless quiet she sustains herself while the thing of horror comes by!
                  She has no sight for seeing that it is the wasted skeleton of the child that
                  vanished long ago, none knew whither; the child no search availed to find. It is
                  the form that could never have belonged to any heart but his, she thinks, the
                  heart she loves so dearly. It is Nathan! but it floats away, and afar, the
                  restless skeleton! it goes from her, of its will she thinks, and that he never did
                  ... it eludes the eager clutching of her hand ... She moves on to the very edge of
                  the rock, for again the form is floating near, but again it passes away among the
                  water lilies, and then it sinks beneath the waves, and it is out of sight!
               The last glimpse she caught of the ghastly face alarmed her. Was that the face of
                  Nathan, the handsome, noble sailor? could her loving heart believe that this was
                  he? The thought began to vex her when the body sunk from sight, and then the
                  unquestioning grief awakened a new, and a terrible, even an unwonted confusion, in
                  her brain.
               She was so faint, poor Milly! that when she attempted to go forward from the rock
                  to the shore, she nearly fell from it into the water. Then she sat down; she
                  bathed her withered, pallid face, as a saner being would have done. The lilies
                  gathered for Jacob had fallen from her grasp, and as she at last arose again, and
                  took the homeward path, she had quite forgotten them. So there they lay, wilting
                  in the sunlight, dead as Nathan, and no memorial left of them in the world that
                  could compare with the remembrance living in the heart of Milly.
               They were all the memorial she could anywhere leave behind her, poor, loving
                  Milly; and there was no one to gather them up, and treasure them after she was
                  gone, as she had treasured the remembrance of the sailor-boy who had perished at
                  sea so long ago.
               In the shaded verandah walks Asia, in a tranquil mood, that is perfectly in
                  keeping with the quiet of the summer afternoon. It is no time for labor, but the
                  hour for repose. The air is heavy with fragrance; it is an enervating luxury to
                  breathe it. Through the vines that twine and 
                     interwine
                     intertwine
                   about the columns of the verandah, innumerable humming-birds are darting
                  to and fro, with the speed of a thought, draining the honey-cups, and dazzling the
                  eye that beholds them. They are feasting this afternoon, and so is Asia. She paces
                  idly, yet directly; there is a certain method in her walk, though her mood is so
                  delightfully indifferent. And there is a purpose that reigns omnipotent within
                  her, observable even in the steady, certain pressure of her foot upon the floor,
                  in the directness with which she passes back and forth.
               
               She has changed much, even in the few days that have passed since we saw her last.
                  Thrown wholly back upon herself, as she feels that she is, though Vesta would
                  persuade her that this is not true, but rather an exaggeration of her fancy, the
                  effect is obvious; a more remarkable dignity is observable in her bearing; she
                  carries her head, perhaps more proudly, certainly more erectly, and
                  consciously—not defiantly, nor boldly, but in perfect self-possession. She is now,
                  as she is always, busy with her thoughts, but not with angry, or unhappy thoughts,
                  as too frequently of late. It has been to her throughout, a happy day. She
                  awakened in deep calm, and the calm has prevailed. She is beautiful to-day; not a
                  furrow on the brow, not a sign of unrest in the glorious eye; the dark and
                  speaking face is lustrous with noble thought. O Asia! if a strong nature might
                  only lead you a little farther in the quiet paths of peace, what strength and
                  wisdom would be garnered in your heart; and truth would reign there, and all
                  generous emotions, if only a wiser might lead you on while this day's brightness
                  lasts, a very little farther, into the quiet paths of peace!
               Unnoticed, unheard, poor Milly, half-fainting with exhaustion and affright, passes
                  through the house in quest of Asia. Unseen she approaches her, and lays her bony
                  hand upon the young girl's uncovered arm; and Asia, startled by the touch, turns
                  quickly to face the intruder. What a contrast, the regal expression of that proud
                  face, and the fright and imbecility that appear on the pale and wasted countenance
                  of the older woman!
               "Oh, it is you, Aunt Milly," said Asia, kindly; and she drew the poor creature's
                  arm within her own. "You have been running away from me. Did you have a pleasant
                  walk, aunty?"
               In no other tone or manner than this of gentlest kindness does Asia Phillips ever
                  speak to that forlorn old creature.
               The voice of her niece, and this manner of protection immediately manifested,
                  seemed to quiet Milly's fear. Yet the assurance of safety led her to give vent to
                  her terror. She began to groan, and to cry, as she had never done before; and Asia
                  made no attempt to pacify her, saying merely in a quiet way that contrasted with
                  the uneasy glancing of her eye, for she perceived that a change, and for the
                  worse, had taken place in Milly—
               "Well! what is it, aunty?"
               And Milly cried—
               "I have seen him! Asia, I've seen him—I've seen him!"
               Asia was silent. She waited for the story to be told without her questioning,
                  knowing that thus it would be told more readily.
               "Oh! oh! I've seen his ghost, Asia!"
               
               She was evidently getting so wild with the thought, that Asia, alarmed for the
                  result, said—
               "Well, don't tell me a word about it now, aunty—not a single word. Wait, and tell
                  it after I get you a cup of tea: we will have it in the parlor, it will be so cool
                  there this afternoon, and so pleasant."
               But Milly clung to Asia, and would not let her go.
               "Stay! stay now!" she entreated. "Oh, 'twas dreadful!" and she looked
                  up anxiously into Asia's face, and grasped her arm convulsively, as if she feared
                  the girl would run away and leave her.
               "I won't go, aunty; don't be afraid. See—we will sit here—you and I—and you shall
                  tell me all about it, when you like. Take your own time; I have nothing to do but
                  to listen."
               And tenderly, as she spoke, she guided Milly away to a seat. They sat down
                  together, and soon Milly began to say—
               "I thought I'd just go and see how the beech-nuts come on—the beech-nuts, you
                  know—and get some lilies for Jacob: he's your uncle, you know?"
               She looked inquiringly at Asia, who said, in reply: "Yes, aunty, I know it; he is
                  my uncle."
               "And girl! I saw a ghost! Oh, a ghost .... it came up straight out of the
                  water—and—and I thought then of the sea, and the waves roaring. Poor Nathan! poor
                  Nat!—and that was his ghost, come to see what I was doing there! That
                  was his spirit I've seen so many times when I was alone in the nights. It's my
                  warning: I'm going to him pretty quick, I am!"
               "Oh no; we won't spare you, aunty. You've only had a kind of dream. It is so hot
                  to-day, no wonder. I've been fancying all sorts of strange things too."
               "Oh, tell me that!" exclaimed Milly in extreme disgust; "no you can't make me
                  believe that, Asia Phillips. It was a shadow, now I tell you, plain to see as you.
                  And it went round and round in the water—then 'twas a ghost. Don't you ever go
                  down there, don't you, don't you! will you, Asia?" she sobbed.
               "Aunty, what was it like? Tell me exactly."
               "Like? Like nothing. Shadow! horror! floating round and round, and then diving
                  down like a fish!"
               The story made Asia shudder, and the effect it had on the narrator made Asia
                  shudder also. And she exerted herself to lead the poor, weak mind from one thing
                  to another, until Milly, worn out with fatigue and excitement, fell asleep.
               Then Asia resumed her walk. But the charm which had held her spirit in bonds all
                  the day, was broken. Had an equal in pride, or in strength, walked beside her
                  then, some bitter words would surely have escaped her; but no such words said she
                  when Uncle King came in. Kind speech and  dutiful action failed not now, and never had they failed, to mark her dealings
                  with him and Milly; and though a foreboding thought, and more exacting servitude
                  than had yet been rendered, was about to be required of her, from the change one
                  hour of fright had wrought in Milly, she had still the courage of a brave and
                  loyal heart, and words or deeds to pain or trouble them would never be allowed of
                  herself, impatient though she was.
            
            
               XV. ASIA'S TEACHER.
               AT twilight, Asia herself went off through the path Aunt Milly had taken that
                  day—not to gather water-lilies, nor to gather beech-nuts, nor yet led by a
                  listless curiosity concerning the "ghost" the poor unfortunate had seen. She went
                  there, to rest?—to think? No, rather to recite aloud the passages she had been
                  studying that day.
               Something very remarkable there must have been in her manner of recitation, for a
                  person who chanced to be wandering through the grove, heard her, and watched her
                  in breathless amazement and admiration.
               It was as if a veil had dropped from before his eyes; and marvelling at what he
                  thought his own  stupidity, and that of
                  all in Maderon house, he came out from the grove, hardly thinking what he did, and
                  standing before her, said gravely, and with somewhat of real reverence—
               "Miss Asia Phillips, is this you?"
               Asia started, and at first he thought that she would run away, she looked so
                  bewildered, and then so annoyed.
               "I believe that is my name, sir," she finally managed to say, endeavoring to laugh
                  off her embarrassment.
               So many days had passed since she had seen Gregorias, so many new thoughts had
                  been born within her soul, springing up there into vigorous life, that the
                  recollection of him had been nearly crowded from her mind.
               But it was not so with him. She had been so frequently the topic of conversation
                  among the ladies of the house, that, had he cared to do so, Gregorias had not
                  found it possible to quite forget her. Now his interest was so completely aroused,
                  his admiration so excited, that, if he had wished, he could not have spoken to her
                  as to a stranger; the opportunity she might not, if she would, dispute: he had
                  come upon her privacy unawares, and that he stayed to listen to her speech, why
                  should that offend her?—at least, why should it surprise her? Gregorias was not
                  noted for his diffidence; and he said, yet with a respectful gesture and
                  intonation—
               "Miss Phillips, I beg you will not consider my question impertinent. I am
                  seriously in earnest in my desire to know—have you marked out for yourself any
                  specific course in life?"
               Asia hesitated for an instant, and then she replied with apparent frankness—
               "I do not trouble myself about the future; I assure you I do not."
               She was persuaded that he had guessed her secret, by the manner of expression his
                  face had assumed. Alas that he should have been so discerning! Heaven help her!
                  what could she reply when he asserted—
               "I had hoped you would be more ingenuous, for indeed I had no idle curiosity to
                  gratify when I asked you the question. I do not need to hear you reply when I say
                  you have resolved to go upon the stage."
               "Mr. Gregorias!" burst from her lips. He knew that he had guessed aright; but
                  quickly she added, "I have resolved to go into the house." And she walked away
                  rapidly.
               He followed her, and said: "No, you are not going; because, I assure you, I must
                  speak to you"—and, taking her arm, he detained her. "Young lady, why should I
                  compel you to remain, were it not for your interest? I wish to do you a service.
                  Will you believe me, or will you not?"
               He spoke decidedly, and with such apparent sincerity, that Asia replied:—
               
               "If you please, say what you wish to say at once. Be brief; I have no time to stay
                  here, nor is this a fitting hour."
               As he declared, Gregorias was suddenly and seriously in earnest. A new idea was
                  within these few seconds as domesticated in his brain as though it had found
                  lodgment there for years.
               "As to this being a fit hour, I venture to say you are no cowardly creature; and
                  your ideas of propriety, I dare affirm, have a solid basis of good common sense. I
                  see no reason, and I think your judgment tells you that you see no reason, why
                  this is not a suitable hour for two persons to converse on a subject that
                  interests both. It is quiet here; we shall not be interrupted. What I exceedingly
                  wish to know is, the idea you have formed about this actress-life."
               Ah, subtly-reasoning Mrs. Maderon! idly dreaming Blanche! could you have seen him
                  then! What text would you have chosen? what vision had you cherished?
               Ah, Asia, quailing at the grave, subduing glance, such as never another mortal had
                  seen proceeding from those eyes; trembling, notwithstanding all the courage in
                  your heart, trembling because the dear secret of your life is brought to
                  light—wherefore should you quail?
               Suddenly, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, a conflict had begun.
               Colly she said—
               "Mr. Gregorias, I assure you I have formed no idea on any subject worth the
                  communicating."
               "Do you expect me to believe this? You are not so skilled in subterfuge as I
                  predict you will be; for that is an accomplishment acquired only through a more
                  intimate knowledge of the world, and the laws which regulate society, than you
                  probably yet have. But your contradiction, I will say, is too transparent. I see
                  directly beneath it to your destiny."
               It was Vesta's cousin who was speaking in this frank and friendly way—no, it was
                  Mrs. Maderon's nephew. Asia had forgotten that. His last words, spoken as one
                  having indeed "the second sight," occasioned the impetuous exclamation—
               "Read it for me!" and the intensity of interest his words had awakened, she no
                  longer made an effort to conceal.
               Gregorias began walking up and down the beach before her. He took counsel of
                  himself, and then commenced speaking, hurriedly at first, but gradually quite at
                  his ease, as one sure of his audience—yet so absorbed in his own thought as to be
                  apparently unconscious of the manner of her listening.
               "When the time comes, and you go away from Maderon," he began.
               "I shall not go away from Maderon," she interposed.
               
               He continued, regardless of the interruption: "When the time comes, quite likely
                  you will go alone—a wilful seeker of your own fortunes. You may fly away at night.
                  And none will know what has become of you, until, from some unimagined quarter, an
                  extraordinary revelation concerning you may come. Those left behind you will most
                  likely slander and malign you, since that is the way of the world. Assuredly they
                  will do so if the remotest conception of your plan is formed. But this you will
                  brave and dare. You will not hear the idle talk; and if you do, it can not much
                  affect you. The gossip of those who have capacity for nothing beyond gossip, will
                  never trouble you. Through fiery trial and sore tribulation you will pass. All do,
                  who enter upon the study or practice of such professions. Critics will consider
                  your capacities in a light through which you are not wont to regard them. And
                  then, as to the reality of success. What is it? what measure of that which is
                  called success would content you? It is a hazardous and a dangerous undertaking.
                  Have you thought how dangerous? You will do well to keep that fact always in
                  mind..... You may fail entirely, and as it may seem to you terribly,
                  irrevocably, in your first effort. You may have to learn what a world of influence
                  and power there is even in a hiss, though that hiss escape the lip of a human
                  serpent—too abominable for even your heel to tread upon! Circumstances stances may
                  so conspire against you as to leave no hope in your mind of an ultimate triumph.
                  You may find out by the bitterest experience that you have mistaken yourself, your
                  power, your calling! Others have done so. Fatal discovery! Die, Asia, as soon as
                  possible, after you come to such discovery. Beyond doubt, temptations and
                  difficulties will lie in your way, such as the courageous hero alone can overcome.
                  Sickness, intolerable weariness, self-mistrust, self-distrust, successful rivalry,
                  such as you may not always be strong enough to hear of, and to know; for jealousy
                  is a great monster. Be aware of jealousy!"
               Gregorias paused, and looked upon Asia, when he had spoken thus. Drearily he had
                  spoken: drearily she had listened. Every particle of color had vanished from her
                  face; she could scarcely breathe—much less speak. She made no effort to speak. One
                  look satisfied Gregorias. All "woman weaknesses" she might defy; but, as Vesta had
                  said oftentimes, a woman's heart was the great secret spring of that proud
                  life.
               He resumed his walk, and began again to speak:
               "You have the very figure for the stage; that I have many times observed, and you
                  proved my belief was true for me when I saw you; it was the best of opportunities,
                  for you thought you were alone. It is a figure that will appear splendidly when
                  arrayed in the robes meet for an empress, for  of course you will act no other part than the
                  highest. You have the very spirit of a tragedienne, if I know what that spirit is.
                  And every gift and grace requisite, you have. Strength; and you know how to work.
                  Your whole experience has been thus far in the highest degree favorable. You have
                  the courage that makes one glory to endure much, when much is to be achieved. You
                  will go! when? I know not. How? I know not. The way will open for you; it always
                  opens for such as you. There will be a departure from this place; for you will
                  find it needful. You will rush like a comet into the heaven of life. You will
                  blaze like a meteor across the path of the world. You will shine as a fixed star
                  of matchless magnitude, at the last. Rivals! all rival stars will pale before you!
                  In your strength, in your beauty, in your grace, you have weapons of defence. Your
                  memory is amazing; your power of adaptation is amazing. You will reign, Asia! you
                  will carry men's hearts away captive. They will pay their tribute of gold, and
                  silver, and of precious stones, their treasures of the heart into your coffers, as
                  though you were a queen of nations. You shall reign, you shall conquer! The dream
                  that fills your imagination night and day, which already gives you a foretaste of
                  imperishable joy, will have a fulfilment such as words of mine would fail to
                  express. The triumph I foretell will shame these words I'm saying. They are weak
                  and tame, they can not adequately speak of what shall be. But all this will not
                  happen to-night, nor will it come to pass on the morrow. You will not wear the
                  crown in early youth. Should you rush away into life from the quiet that surrounds
                  you at this hour, and delve and toil, you might throw yourself into a premature
                  grave—you would not hasten the triumph..... Be patient. Be content to wait. You
                  are no infant prodigy. I am merely foreseeing what must happen, what will be
                  developed in you. What I say, I know. By the agony your spirit continually
                  suffers, notwithstanding your moments of exulting pride, I can understand this
                  suffering—perhaps not in its height and depth, yet in a measure, assuredly—or I
                  would not have perceived it. I should have remained as blind as all around you
                  are. The future will give you all that I have prophesied. What have you for the
                  present?"
               He asked the question, as if, having unveiled the future for her, he had a right
                  to ask it. And Asia was in no condition then to stop and argue as to the
                  right.
               The glorious eyes flashed; her arms were folded upon her breast; a rich glow was
                  on her cheek: she was now, by preconception, here and now, rejoicing in that far
                  triumph.
               A moment she stood thus, Gregorias as thoroughly aroused as she, yet watching
                  every slightest  change of look or
                  motion. Then she flung herself upon the ground before him, exclaiming:—
               "I have life, and youth, and love, and patience—yes, patience too! I have all that
                  the young heart has—the burden of premature age has fallen from me! and for
                  you—for you, I have unutterable thanks! everlasting gratitude."
               Deeply moved, he answered: "I have somewhat more to say. Stand up beside me, Asia.
                  It is unseemly in you to kneel. And to me! ... I have only ventured to prophesy of
                  what your beauty, and pride, and passion, and genius, assure me. I have done
                  nothing to deserve such thanks. Would that I had! But now, do you know, I am so
                  glad to hear you say that you have patience, for you have to work diligently—to
                  prepare—to study—to study much."
               "Yes," she said composedly; and looking upon him with that perfect confidence
                  which she felt he had earned, "I understand that, Mr. Gregorias."
               "And under whom will you study?"
               "Under whom?" she repeated. The manner of reply he was anticipating flashed upon
                  her, but she said no more.
               "Under myself, Asia. For I have a sort of knowledge, such as no mere inspiration
                  of genius can make good to you. You must look upon yourself as an artist. An
                  artist has his masters, or, his models. You have never seen an actress, nor
                  watched a play as represented on the stage. I can give you many a hint that will
                  aid you; but the work must all be yours, as the sublime result will be."
               "You would unfold my talent, my power for me, Mr. Gregorias?" she asked.
               "I would help you to unfold it for yourself. I have not the power to do more."
               Asia leaned her head against the great trunk of a tree, and kept silence. She
                  seemed lost to both the hour and the place, in the great thought that now entirely
                  possessed her.
               Gregorias said:—
               "You were but now exceedingly eager to be rid of me, Miss Asia. Are you not aware
                  that the night is deepening?"
               She began to move forward; but, as she did so, she murmured: "I have been
                  unconscious of time, and I think I have lost myself in an eternity of joy!"—an
                  extravagant exclamation, but not an exaggeration of her feeling at the moment. It
                  did not strike Gregorias as extravagant; nor was it with the desire to take
                  advantage of her excitement, but rather to obtain a fuller understanding of the
                  nature of the extraordinary girl beside him, that he asked:—
               "You said that you had life, and youth, and love, and patience—why will you not
                  tell me something concerning yourself? I have thought much upon  that particular self, I assure you; and, until
                  tonight, it was a mystery to me."
               "All that concerns me appears. I am what you behold—no more, no less. There is no
                  mystery to explain away."
               Gregorias laughed slightly; there was music in his laugh; and Asia, when she heard
                  it, knew that he was thinking of her as an equal then, for in that way had he
                  laughed when Blanche and Vesta jested with him. He said:—
               "Do you suppose that any of the stupid souls in Maderon have the most remote idea
                  that there is an undercurrent to the life you lead? a current which, afar in time
                  and space, shall come up magnificently, with such force as shall break away every
                  opposing force before it? But you said that you had life, and youth, and love, and
                  patience," he repeated.—"What use shall you make of the life at present, if I may
                  ask?"
               "I shall study Mr. Gregorias, as you suggested."
               "And where shall our schoolroom be? shall I teach you publicly?"
               "Why not?"
               He smiled again as he said: "Are you willing to be known here in this village
                  through a dozen years to come, as a student preparing for the stage?"
               "A dozen years? No, I am not willing."
               "Let it be here that you recite. It is a quiet place, and I will come when you
                  command me. I shall have a pride in my pupil. And youth you have. You are content
                  to spend it thus?"
               "Mr. Gregorias, my youth has been a youth of toil, unsanctified by a single great
                  hope until of late. Could it have been a contented, happy youth without that hope,
                  when such alone had power to satisfy it? I am content to toil now in the humble
                  way I have done. And my labor will be, more than ever, one of love. I shall never
                  again seek to escape my duty, however humble it may seem; for, from this hour,
                     all duty will seem mightily significant."
               "And love—you said that you had love! You have that great power, that rare
                  capacity, the loving heart. Your nature overflows with the richness, the wine of
                  life, love! To what will you consecrate that? for whom, or what, pour out the
                  glorious libation?"
               "MY ART!" she said, strongly and bravely, sensible of the relief afforded by this
                  opportunity he gave for such a declaration. "You have discovered my ambition, and
                  what you are pleased to call my power. It absorbs the world; my art is, of itself,
                  my world!"
               "It is the voice of true genius," said Gregorias in a gratulatory tone his heart,
                  at that moment, truly could echo. "And you speak in no foreign language. Even I
                  can comprehend you. I have heard genius that was mightily triumphant speak  in that way before. It is the feeling
                  expressed by you that brings calm philosophers to speech from the depths of their
                  own experience; which brings poets to utterance, warriors to action, arts to
                  perfection, books into life. It is the daring you betray, the determination, that
                  brings out from the depths of obscurity those precious things, which the sharp
                  friction of the world shall polish into dazzling brightness. If the triumph to
                  which you aspire were secured, and you were this night rejoicing in it, you would
                  be aware that you had awakened some very diverse opinions and emotions in the
                  hearts of others. Listening then intently"—thus intently listened Asia to him even
                  then—"you would find that the strange harmony of the voices of your praisers was
                  occasioned by the union of three very different tones. You would awaken a
                  reverence for your art—a passionate, personal devotion, and a hope among the good
                  and the true, that you might prove an angel on a mission of goodness and truth!
                  Tell me, reasoning from that which you know you now are, to what tribute would
                  your ear most readily incline?"
               Asia moved on more rapidly:—
               "Have you only been reading a fragment of wild fiction?" she asked; "remember, if
                  it is only a fiction to you, I receive it as a true prophecy. Tell me, what have
                  you meant?"
               "To encourage a noble girl who needed encouragement agement—as I would encourage a
                  sister, or Angelo Franklin, or any other friend who might need my encouragement.
                  To bring Asia Phillips to herself."
               "You have done that, and may God bless you for it!" she said hastily.
               "How will all these great thoughts you take home with you affect you in your daily
                  duties? Will they not make a tumult where there was peace?"
               "Where may that have been?"
               "In your walk of life."
               "It will excite me to vigilance. Shall not one learn self-conquest as well in that
                  way as in any other?"
               "Yes! I think so. And self-conquest is the first lesson you design to learn? It is
                  very needful. There have been many illustrious characters who wrought brilliant
                  achievements, but not that; they failed in that. How shall you proceed in that
                  work?"
               "By compelling myself to prize what I have always disliked. By toiling at tasks
                  for which I have no grace or fancy."
               "What will support you in the work?"
               "Knowledge that my reward, though away out of sight, is great, and surely
                  attainable."
               "You may well say that; it is surely attainable. My first counsel is,
                  do not allow yourself to dream. Act; and prepare to carry out your present
                     intentions tions: but never yield to
                  the enticements of visions. That would be fatal. Resolve, and do!—not hastily, but
                  deliberately. I believe that impassioned natures are often, also, in reality the
                  calmest, and the most clearly conscious of a secret strength that does not appear
                  to those who only listen to some wild word spoken, or behold some strange,
                  eccentric deed done. The world was not fashioned in a day. You are to be, as it
                  were, a creator. Train yourself in every possible way; when the crown comes, you
                  will be prepared to receive it. Do not seek to attract the crown, or the
                  crown-bearer, until the head is in readiness for the honor that awaits it. Good
                  night."
               Pacing so calmly in the shaded verandah, that sunny afternoon, Asia Phillips, I
                  said, but needed that one should lead her a little farther on in the pleasant
                  paths of peace, and she would find safety and contentment there.
               Lo, far other service had been rendered! From the paths of a quiet obscurity she
                  had moved away, to enter them nevermore. Unexpectedly to himself as to her,
                  Gregorias had sounded the depths of her soul—had spoken to her words a brother,
                  appreciative, discerning, and devoted, might have spoken. He had warned her
                  against dreaming; yet every word that he had spoken, and himself included, gave to
                  her, whose outward life was so barren of materiel, splendid stuff for dreams. He
                  had bidden her not dream: had he seen her when she left him, he had thought her
                  whole self had resolved into a fantasy, that she would nevermore live but in
                  dreams.
               Resolved to keep his counsel, but to aid her in as far as was possible, Gregorias
                  went his way when he had left her at the cottage, marvelling to himself concerning
                  the almost incredible event of the evening, as it really seemed to him.
            
            
               
               XVI. STATUES OF MEMNON.
               THEODORE BORLAND went down from the mountain-heights, from the burial-place of
                  Margaret: his plan of travel was abandoned. Strengthened by such faith as he had,
                  he endeavored to console himself; yet the gazers who assisted him during the rite
                  of burial, said to themselves, "This man's heart is broken."
               But, though he did go shrinking—yet not, even to himself confessedly—from the
                  thought of encountering any face or friend that he had ever known before, the
                  heart of Borland was not broken, nor was the real game of life concluded; nor were
                  the projects of ambition all forgotten.
               Had the mountain-land he traversed been enchanted—had the spirits who allowed his
                  entrance questioned him, on his exit from their dominion, concerning the change
                  wrought in him, and for him, there—his bewildered state of mind would have given
                  testimony, of itself, to their power, though to what end exercised he might not
                  have told. It was as though some petrifying influence had been operating within
                  and upon him, during these days of the storm's continuance, in which he remained a
                  watcher over the body of Margaret, waiting there, in uncomplaining patience, till
                  an hour for her burial should come.
               A grave but happy man, a dreamer—yet an awakened man, so to speak, delighting in
                  the beauty of the day to which his visioned eyes were opened—Borland ascended the
                  highlands to the point which had proved, as Margaret well said, the mountain of
                  her transfiguration.
               Not brighter was the day of their ascent, than the heart and hope he bore with him
                  upon that journey; for the brightness of the young life in his care—of the soul
                  long sought for, found at last, and made his own—enveloped him.
               He had secured the soul with an exultant joy. He had bound it unto his, speedily,
                  as an amulet, a preservative, a blessing; conscious, as he did so, that the desire
                  of his heart, and the solution of all longing, was attained, and that, henceforth,
                  each  passing day of life would
                  comprehend all the future's possible.
               And, at the very moment of his triumph, as if to mock him, or to bring him up to a
                  higher purpose, to the recognition of another law than that which he had—ay,
                  notwithstanding all the show of his bold and grand philosophy—recognised—even in
                  the hour of his glorying, she was taken away!
               It was a fact concerning which his head might reason with his heart—he might lay
                  whatever of consolation reason should suggest upon that bleeding heart—there was
                  fact before him, Margaret motionless, dead. And would the grieved heart be
                  comforted? Did he, after all, find himself in need of consolation? Had Sorrow come
                  so near to him that he could look upon her features, and distinguish them, and
                  know of a surety that she was a commissioned messenger, and not a scarecrow for
                  the fancy of the weak? What then should comfort him, if indeed he had arrived at
                  this strange pass? what should help him? Providence, or the world? Neither.
               A stern, impregnable, impassive front, was that presented by him when he went down
                  from the mountain. Looking on him, you had never guessed he had but now closed the
                  book wherein a chapter concerning the beautiful romance of love had, for a day,
                  absorbed him.
               Heretofore it had been with Borland as with the miner. Around his heart rose the
                  high, dark, impenetrable walls of fate. Suddenly a ray of light had penetrated
                  even to the depths of that great heart. Clouds of darkness now again rolled above
                  and around him; the ray of light had gone; and, behold, he was once more a
                  convulsive element of the nineteenth century, whose influence the weak and the
                  faint-hearted (whose tower of faith was built upon the sand) could only fear, and
                  therefore they did fear it, railing against him as they might. The truly great
                  mistrusted and opposed him: but even among those were some who saw sublimest
                  truths lying within the fanciful adornments in which his ideas were arrayed, as
                  they came forth to face the undiscerning multitude. A few disciples understood and
                  idolized him, and they accepted him as the latest teacher of the truth, the
                  teacher of the age ... But none, of all the world, so loved him as had Margaret—as
                  did Angelo Franklin. And Borland knew this well: and, as he went down from the
                  mountain-heights, his soul yearned after "the boy Angelo," for so he always named
                  him.
               It was with him as with the miner, I said. Looking up from the darkness and
                  silence of the subterranean depths, in compliance with that law of his being which
                  impelled him to aspire, he saw, at noonday, the stars of heaven; his seeing eye
                  beheld  them, when they were
                  imperceptible to the duller eyes of those who walked in the broad blaze of
                  sunlight.
               Have you stood in the grim, awful presence of the Memnon statues? With the
                  traveller's dust-worn feet, have you rested upon the borders of the stream from
                  which, in the glare of the sultry eastern sky, they lift their majestic fronts in
                  the awful solemnity of an eternal silence, from the bosom of obscurity, from the
                  mystery of the past? Or, amid the gay sounds and sights of a living city of the
                  living, have you looked on the artistic semblances of these remnants of another
                  age, hushed, spell-bound, subdued, and tranquillized? As you gazed upon them,
                  something of the sublime nature of the silence of those dread statues passed into
                  your soul; you have learned somewhat concerning the spirit which bows the heathen
                  before his idol—the creature before death—the Christian before God. A transcendent
                  impulse has influenced you—to no impulsive action; it has bound you—to no law of
                  sense, or of animal subjection. You have been made aware of a conquest, even in
                  the presence of those broken piles of stone.
               As an image of the spirit of these Memnonian statues, might one have looked on
                  Borland as he went from the mountain-heights—dumb to all expression of his
                  calamity, deaf to every consolatory voice of memory, or of the future. He had not
                  received sorrow with recognition, as a heavenly messenger.
               To some minds, Borland's intellect was the power of a god; and something very
                  godlike those minds might have perceived in the spirit that led him to acquiesce
                  in Margaret's belief; something godlike, too, they would have perceived, in this
                  manner of application that he made of his conviction, that such and all beliefs
                  tend but to one final issue; that, projected from the diverse mind, as testimony
                  of the varied beauty and power of the one immaculate Mind that filleth heaven and
                  earth, they must, of their necessity, when they leave their human form, returning
                  again to the Original Essence, be what they were in the beginning—parts of the
                  Sovereign Divinity, Nature.
               What the multitude believed was of no real consequence. One event awaited all.
                  They might have the faith of Margaret—they might, if they chose, call themselves
                  His disciples. It made no difference, Nature was the same for all the disputation,
                  and every created thing was being gradually absorbed by that IDEA.
               He had made her happy by giving her the thought, that his eyes were also fixed
                  upon that point of truth which had attracted her. But when he buried her, no
                  thought of a new, ultimate resurrection, such as she had fancied, no dream of
                  spiritual guardianship, or of spiritual companionship,  beguiled him. To him, as a man in need of tender
                  recollections, of loving sympathies, she was dead for ever—and by no exorcism
                  could he make her alive. She had gone on in the universe; she was become a part of
                  it. He could have said of her in regard to himself—as a man, or as a soul—"Thou
                  art nothing now."
               For a moment, the disappointment he had suffered mastered him. He had discovered,
                  as he thought, the object of long searching—a soul that was alive to the same
                  perception of truth which had isolated him from the mass of minds; he believed
                  that a word from him—and that word he would have spoken another day, had she but
                  lived another day—would have enlightened her mind with the same light that was in
                  his. Yes! and for a moment the godlike had been a mortal, to mourn over this
                  frustration of his plan,—to weep!
               There are many ways in which grief manifests itself. There is a spirit of moaning
                  and lamentation, that expends itself in sound. It is a windy tempest. The clouds
                  that threaten, fly before the wind, and scarcely a drop has fallen. There are
                  tempests of another order. The rain descends, the floods come; there is a red and
                  fiery glow, an accompanying thunder-crash; and then some giant oak, or "feathery
                  palm," or glorious elm, is riven, blighted—a wreck, and a mark for ever: a
                  memorial of the fury of the storm. Oh human heart! the blighted hope, the wrecked
                  design, the broken promise, standing for ever in token of the terror of the
                  tempest! I need not make for thee an application.
               There is a storm of grief, than these more fearful. No cloud appears: there is no
                  foreboding wailing of a tempest; no man's heart trembles with fear. There is gay
                  sunshine; it is a day of blooming flowers; it is a still and starlit night. But
                  suddenly, from the shaken depths, a cloud of fire and smoke goes up, and over the
                  fertile valley tumultuously rushes the scorching flood of fire—and blasted, and
                  black, and barren, the mountain lifts its head. Firm in its ancient place it still
                  remains: but the gazer stands afar off and looks upon it; to him it is as an
                  apparition of dread.
               There is another and more dreadful symbol yet than these. The foundations, the
                  pillars of earth, are shaken. There is a sudden rending and disclosure, and a
                  sudden sealing up again. Within that impenetrable surface, within that dark,
                  fathomless, and awful depth, lie all the joy, the hope, the beauty, the promise,
                  the excellence, that but now lived in the sunshine—the dispenser and the recipient
                  of joy and glory, light, and life, and love.
               The stern, smooth surface—smoothed in a moment, or a day, or a century—tells
                  thenceforth no tales to him that treads upon it, passes by it, lives near it,
                  about the ruin beneath that which appears. But must a truth, that it may be a
                  truth, or a fact,  that it may be a
                  fact, establish itself through a voice that the human ear can hear?
               Beneath the tranquil exterior with which Borland went back into the world, was a
                  ruin; and there was no intellect, no heart, that could justly form an estimate
                  concerning that buried Herculaneum—no worldly power could prevail to the
                  excavation of the glories of that Pompeii. If, from the unguessed depths, his soul
                  should not proclaim itself among the living .... but that was an
                  impossibility!
            
            
               XVII. SOME NINETEENTH-CENTURY THOUGHTS.
               IT was of Angelo that Borland thought when he resolved to abandon his design of
                  travel; but to Angelo he did not at once return: he went apart from all the
                  living, who could in the least degree be looked upon as companions, and for months
                  lived by himself, in utter solitude. Still, in his solitude, it was of Angelo he
                  thought, and him he knew he loved.
               And all who had ever been in any way associated with Franklin, had proved how easy
                  a task it was to learn to love him—so upright, so earnest, so noble, so pure in
                  heart, so spiritual, and so innocent of all offence against his fellow-men, was
                  Angelo.
               
               Margaret had watched over the uncertain years of his frail boyhood and youth, with
                  all a mother's care and anxiety. In the first years of their orphanage she had
                  labored with her own hands for their support; and, until Providence had raised up
                  for them, among strangers, friends who were ready to cherish, educate, and
                  maintain them, she unremittingly continued these labors.
               Borland chanced to be Angelo's first tutor when he went away from Margaret to a
                  public school; and in him the loving heart of the boy found a friend, who, after
                  the relation of master and pupil was broken, could not forget him. It was in
                  compliance with a slight suggestion this man made, that Angelo resolved to become
                  a student of theology.
               But shortly after he had given this counsel—the best that any mortal could have
                  given a boy like Angelo Franklin—a mighty change took place in Borland, in
                  himself, and in his circumstances. To use his own expression, the slave became
                  emancipated: emancipated from his labors as a teacher of youth, by the fortune to
                  which he unexpectedly became heir; and emancipated in a still higher sense, as he
                  conceived, from the bondage of error and darkness, to a free reception of light
                  and liberty. If Angelo had, for the first time, then fallen in his way, to study
                  for the ministry would have been the last counsel to issue from the lips of
                  Borland. But the counsel once given, Borland, always consistent, would not retract
                  it.
               With his release from the bonds of superstition and of need, an ambition or
                  purpose, such as none about him could understand, became evident in the conduct of
                  the man. He was not content to subside into the mere holder of wealth, to
                  influence by weight of his purse alone; and this he confessed. Nor was he content
                  to labor in the old, honorable way: this much his conduct proclaimed. He must
                  still exercise his influence over mind—must educate intellects, must continue to
                  rule—not in church, nor in state, but in the world of the intellect. And
                  therefore, as Margaret had written of him, he became a speaker to the people—a
                  reformer—an apostle of the age.
               Of the mental excitements occasioned in some obscure portions of the world by
                  those first announcements which he made from time to time, deliberately, as though
                  eternity were assured him on earth for the evolution and promulgation of his
                  thought, Angelo had scarcely heard, in any definite manner, previous to his
                  admission to the ministry, and his subsequent removal to Maderon. He had been
                  occupied with other thoughts; his confidence in the tutor who had so wisely
                  counselled him was unshaken. Borland, whenever they were together, gave him no
                  reason for believing that it was his purpose to wage any sort of war against the
                     strongholds holds of the common
                  faith. Angelo had heard that Borland was called an infidel, as had Margaret, but
                  he never could prevail upon himself to insult his old tutor by asking him if this
                  were the truth. Indeed, Angelo had, with Margaret, smiled at what they considered
                  atrocious scandal, which could only harm the poor, pitiable originators of it. No
                  doubt of any sort could he ever entertain in respect to a man whose genius he so
                  reverenced and idolized, whose friendship he so prized, whose self he loved, as he
                  did that of Theodore Borland.
               Maderon house was, I have already said, as a home to Angelo. He looked upon it as
                  such: quickly he learned to think upon its inmates as if he were also of the
                  household. To him the glorious place, with its surrounding and overshadowing
                  beauty—with its gay and happy inmates, its treasures of art, its order and
                  harmony—was indeed as 
                     —"an island of delight."
                  
               
               He went there to find refreshment, and elevation of his wearied spirit, when the
                  cares and toils of his profession weighed heavily upon him. He also went sometimes
                  for counsel, and a wise, sagacious counsellor he found in Mrs, Maderon: she looked
                  upon him as her protege; as a mother in Israel, she thought upon this priestly
                  son; it was her pride and glory to mark out his course, and tell him where he
                  failed, and when he was in error, and how he was to win the prize of his people's
                  approval and love. Her advice was sound, godlike worldliness; and, acting on it,
                  Angelo Franklin could make not one misstep in pursuance of a worldly ministerial
                  course.
               And oftener than for counsel, though it was never unwelcome from the lips of Mrs.
                  Maderon, Angelo went seeking the sympathy of friendly souls.
               In his professional labors, and in his devoted, generous manner of performing
                  them, none took a greater interest than did Vesta Maderon. So frail and young he
                  looked, when he first came among them—he was then but twenty-two years old—that
                  she felt disposed to act toward him the part of an elder sister, as had Margaret;
                  but his piety, and ardor, and habit of reflection, and his many sterling virtues,
                  his mental and manly dignity, speedily convinced her that her part was not to
                  teach, but rather to learn of him. And she was learning of him—many lessons.
               When he told her of the misery and guilt that abounded, even within the narrow
                  confines of that village, of the heroic bearing of the weak and patient poor, of
                  the distresses among the sick, of the vices prevalent among those apparently
                  forgotten by every righteous person, he told the tale to one who had, thank God!
                  no power to say: 'Go thy way for this time—when I have a more convenient season, I
                  will hear thee;' or, 'I pray thee have me excused.' To deeds, and words, and
                     looks of charity ity,
                  his eloquence aroused her. He called her to a work that well might prove to her
                  engrossing, for it was large and varied. If she was in earnest when she asked of
                  Asia Phillips "what she should do," she had occasion for thankfulness when this
                  youth pointed out a worthy work to her. And she was in earnest; and therefore it
                  followed that more than Asia Phillips learned to bless the name of Vesta Maderon.
                  Youth, and grace, and beauty, are attractive to the eyes of youth: there was that
                  in Vesta which won for her the confidence of some who never ventured even a
                  recognising bow with the elder sister. And Angelo also was one of those who were
                  speedily won by her truthfulness and sincerity; and, before he was aware, she had
                  almost filled that place made vacant by his sister's death. For the young heart
                  and active life can not for ever, deeply though death may wound, array itself in
                  funereal thoughts; tears must cease to fall when the sun shines out gloriously;
                  and sighs must be lost in happy speech, when duty, and privilege, and friendship,
                  and power, and ambition, claim the days and the moments, as they come and go. And
                  Angelo's heart was young—his life was active.
               One evening Vesta was watching the play of the fountain from a distant part of the
                  lawn. Mrs. Maderon and Blanche had gone into the village; and Franklin, after a
                  vain search for the family through the house, at length espied Vesta, and joined
                  her.
               Almost his first salutation was—
               "Have you been yet to see that wonderful family I spoke of, Miss Vesta?"
               "Yes, Reverend Angelo," was her reply.
               "And what have you to say to me about them? That they distress me overmuch?"
               "That there is certainly 'no place like home.' It was my first thought when I
                  entered, and I fear my last, as I left the house."
               "'No place like home,' indeed, Miss Vesta. I don't wonder the line occurred to you
                  as you thought of the contrast between that house of Weed's and this charming
                  place it is your privilege to call home."
               "I think," said Vesta, "that these people might sing the song with a good deal of
                  'expression."'
               "Yes, their home is so superlatively bad. I suppose we should not exaggerate if we
                  spoke always of a home being in the superlative degree a bad or a good place—the
                  abode of comfort, or of all evil—an Eden or a Sahara—in short, Miss Vesta, a
                  heaven or a hell."
               "Very true, Angelo. How strange to think of the millions who have sung, and
                  listened to that song!"
               "Ay; and doubtless it has wakened and purified the hearts of myriads who have
                  heard it! Soft voices have sung it, and many tears have fallen in joy, or hope, or
                  pure determination. It is never more touching than when sung by childhood. I think
                      the man or woman who set on foot
                  that glorious charity, the Home for the Destitute Children, must have heard a
                  child's voice uttering that song. How many holy emotions and good resolutions have
                  attended it! We know very well that love has often been kindled by the picture
                  suggested by the song. But there have been besides, the loving, unappreciated, and
                  neglected wives, the abused and miserable husbands, and lonely-hearted children,
                  who, bound together by law, have proved that there are ties which connect those
                  who would mock and scoff at the idea of unity, or the holy bond of peace! And of
                  this sort is the family which I am glad you have visited—a family after the letter
                  of the law of God and man—hearers of the word, but forgetful hearers, and not
                  doers of the same. Their oneness is an enigma past unfolding: I can not discover
                  if it is of thought or purpose, of faith, or hope, or love. Yet they call their
                  house a home! If that word is a sacred one, I should rather call the place
                  Pandemonium."
               "And those young children! It seems wrong to leave Abby to follow the example set
                  her—such an example of strife, and selfishness, and every folly. Mr. Weed and his
                  wife are so perfectly ridiculous, one hardly knows whether to laugh or weep seeing
                  them. I never before encountered such people."
               "Abby is a girl of remarkably good sense. The way she sustains herself in the
                  house is surprising. I do not think she will be hurt by the example; we must see
                  to it that she is not. And they call that house a home! I fear it is instead a
                  place in which the daylight never finds, and the night never leaves, a particle of
                  that sympathy which helps to make the peace and blessedness of a true home. There
                  is hope for Abby; but as for the rest!—they are all in the hands of One mighty to
                  save. It is our consolation."
               "Abby tells me that the baby is nearly well again. I was glad to hear it, though I
                  thought at first it would be a mercy if it were taken away; but his sister seems
                  to worship him; and she has such an affectionate heart, she would be wretched if
                  there were not something for her to love..... Do you see how the light falls
                  against the west side of the house? Come up immediately, and I will show you a
                  picture that you have not seen. It was beautiful last night when that same sort of
                  light came in at the parlor-windows."
               The expressions of admiration to which Angelo gave utterance as they stood a
                  moment after, looking upon the newly-finished work of Blanche, were interrupted by
                  the entrance of the elder sister, who, before she observed the presence of
                  Franklin, exclaimed:—
               "Vesta! only think of it! Cousin Aaron has heard to-night from Mr. Borland, and we
                  are to have him here!"
               
               "Miss Maderon!" burst involuntarily from the lips of Angelo; and he added, more
                  quietly, "when does he come?"
               Blanche, who never lost her self-possession, perceiving his agitation, replied
                  briefly to his question, and left him to recover from the shock occasioned by her
                  unanticipated news.
               Addressing Vesta, she said:—
               "Dear sister, I have some other intelligence that I know will interest you. Your
                  Abby's mother is a convert to the preachers in the tent."
               "That does not at all surprise me. I was almost sure that she would pass through
                  this delusion also."
               "Angelo, you have a very favorable position for overlooking that portion of your
                  flock. You said they are very unhappy, did you not, Vesta? What a world this is!
                  My reverend friend, or, Cousin Aaron," she said, as Gregorias came in, "do you
                  suppose it is a simple unhappiness at home that leads this Mrs. Weed on so
                  strangely? She is a remarkably well-informed woman I am told."
               "Prithee, fair cousin, question me not on so delicate a point. The office of
                  referee in the case I do not covet. Being a woman, you should know best. Mere
                  instinct, I am sure, can inform you."
               "No, it does not. I was looking over a queer sort of thing this morning—something
                  to the effect that these 'monster-women of the age' (so the writer called them)
                     are so, because of some monstrous individual wrong that has made
                  them wretched, despairing, and then rebellious, driving them from their 'sphere,'
                  and making them the moral horror of the time. Men cry out loudly against the
                  dishonor brought thus upon the ideal woman; but I would like really to know if
                  Milton put a true, rational, womanly thought upon the lips of Eve, when she says,
                  'God is thy law, thou mine'?—or, could he have written it down with a vindictive
                  energy, thinking with a smile, as he did so, of his youth, and poor Mary
                  Powell?"
               "And if you do not know already," said Gregorias, "I wonder, with a wonder passing
                  yours, if you are willing to become yourself a wretched sufferer, in order that
                  you may be afterward a publisher of the real truth of the case?"
               "No, indeed! You need not entertain any manner of doubt on the subject. And if I
                  might further allude to so humble an individual as myself," continued Blanche, "I
                  should say that very probably each one of you considers me a dreamer. But
                     you are students of human nature! have communicated with Mr.
                  Borland the philosopher! You should certainly be prepared to answer when I ask if
                  the author of what I read wrote the truth. If— 
                     
                        'I've lived with visions for my company,
                        Instead of men and women'—
                     
                   I think I had better return to them. They do not fail me."
               
               "You ask of them no difficult questions."
               "Blanche, you might have at once directed yourself to me: these gentlemen can give
                  you no information. You asked a question which none but a woman has a right to
                  answer."
               "This is no dreamer, at least. Vesta, how surprising and refreshing!" exclaimed
                  Gregorias.
               "Well!" said Blanche; and Angelo Franklin looked at Vesta with an inquiring
                  interest.
               "You will acknowledge that idle persons are, of all, most miserable?"
               "Yes," they said.
               "And that many happy people have discovered, in some moment of reflection, that
                  they have a talent or capacity for some work that they were not before aware
                  of?"
               "Yes," said Angelo alone.
               "And that, for all we know to the contrary, but for the advancing of Columbus over
                  a path untrodden, this new world might to-day have been the dwelling-place of
                  savages?"
               "Perhaps," said Gregorias, "some future generation will declare it to have been
                  indeed at this day the dwelling-place of savages. Civilization and
                  refinement are taking enormous strides toward an unimagined climax, probably
                  perfection."
               "And you will also acknowledge," continued Vesta, "that if any of these happy
                  women, with unused talents in their keeping, see a work to the one side or the
                  other of the path they happen to be in, it is their duty to do that work,
                  provided, as a certain poet has said, 'they have the grace and skill'—I am sure
                  you will admit this?
               "Yes," said Angelo, again alone, and this time he spoke with emphasis. "A woman to
                  whom the great Creator has given good common sense, has a clear right and title to
                  do any lawful thing that she sees fit to do."
               "There! you have given the very largest liberty! Cousins, you have the sanction of
                  the pulpit!"
               "But the woman of good sense," said Blanche. "What do you call Mrs. Weed—she is in
                  full possession of her faculties, I believe?"
               "It is the duty of some persons to make themselves
                  ridiculous—warnings, guideboards, etc.," said Gregorias.
               "As men at a time of fire," returned Blanche.
               "Yes," added Vesta, "when they dash from the windows and housetops—the higher they
                  can ascend for the purpose the better—every breakable thing!"
               "Vesta, you are a woman of the nineteenth century!" cried Gregorias, with a dismal
                  intonation. "Yes, I am sure of it; and, alas! how long will it be ere you discover
                  that your superabundant sympathies can not find a proper field in Maderon? A
                  missionary to the Fejee islands! a nominee for some great office in the gift of
                  the free people! What, in  the name of
                  the common sense you glorify, will you do and be?"
               "I've not been speaking of myself," answered Vesta, a little proudly.
               "A great mistake—the greatest mistake! When a woman talks of Woman, she has
                  herself in view; she represents the race."
               "I ought to be ashamed, perhaps, to confess to the contrary. There may be more in
                  your words than you imagine! Even so great a poet as Shakspere is said to have
                  been unaware of the sublime magnificence of his plays. You declare that affection
                  and sympathy are sufficient to satisfy woman, if she receives it. I acknowledge
                  that! I believe it heartily, as you, perhaps, do not. I believe that happy mortals
                  are exactly the persons to perceive the woes and wants of others, Cousin Aaron. I
                  believe that this happiness impels them to work for that of others. And I do n't
                  believe that the unhappy are the persons who see anything in a true light."
               "Entirely to the point! How well you have argued for me! And these miserable ones,
                  three times and four times miserable sinners! they are the very ones who turn this
                  century upside down, inside out, topsy-turvy!—and while they are in the world,
                  nothing can remain in a natural, dignified position, as before they became such
                  atrocious meddlers. They ought to be banished from the nations by some higher law
                  than any government has recognised yet."
               "Another thing, Blanche," continued Vesta, as though Gregorias had not spoken, "I
                  do not believe that if this Mrs. Weed has ever so much genius, and of her talents
                  I know nothing whatever, I do not believe I should take that as a reason why she
                  should lead an unhappy life. It is absurd to say that genius is necessarily
                  miserable in the wedded state. We only hear of the distresses of such persons
                  because they are in a prominent position."
               "Since I proposed the subject, it is my part to close the discussion," said
                  Blanche, scarcely concealing the weariness with which she had listened. "I promise
                  to ask no more questions of persons who pretend to be awake. Angelo, is your
                  charge proving a docile one? Your somnolency leads me to anticipate a luminous
                  answer."
               "A very docile charge, Miss Maderon."
               "The most direct answer received on this occasion—decidedly so," said Gregorias.
                  "There will be no disturbance in the flock of our faithful shepherd until Borland
                  comes."
               "And then—must there be then?" asked Vesta, with a serious interest she honestly
                  and unawares betrayed.
               "Wait until you see what the old ladies of the congregation can do!" cried Cousin
                  Aaron. "Let them once discover that our Rev. Angelo Franklin's lin's heart has its 'first love'! that Mr. Borland
                  stands, even before the parish, in the affections of the clergyman! Alas for that
                  day! And when they learn all the horrible truths concerning Theodore, O Franklin!
                  I see clearly the upshot of the whole business. We shall have to look out for
                  another pastor, Blanche. Set not your affections on any church on earth, Angelo.
                  You are doomed to be a rolling stone all your days. As truly as you are a living
                  man, you will have to give up your 'docile' charge, if Borland comes to
                  Maderon."
               "Hush, Cousin Aaron!" whispered Vesta.
               "I do not like this jesting, Mr. Gregorias," said the minister. His face was
                  flushed, and his voice not altogether calm; it was evident the pastor did not like
                  such jesting.
               But his mild rebuke could not reach Gregorias, who went on talking gayly with
                  Blanche; and when, a few minutes after, Franklin was about to leave, he started up
                  and joined the minister in his walk to the village.
               "I have such a desire to see this Theodore Borland!" said Blanche, when they were
                  alone. "In the first place, because he married Margaret, and then because he is a
                  philosopher, and Angelo and Aaron seem to think him so remarkable. He must really
                  be remarkable, for Cousin Aaron says his cure of Angelo's lameness is a fact as
                  well established as any fact in history."
               "Some facts of history are worse than worthless; they have no title to place in a
                  printed page. But let me tell you of that cure. Angelo himself is my informant. He
                  says that Margaret always believed he would outgrow the lameness, and that one day
                  when Mr. Borland told him to walk uprightly, and gave him his cane to assist him,
                  Angelo immediately did so. He says that if any other person had bidden him do the
                  same thing, there would have been the same result. It was no miracle, nor anything
                  of the kind. He had merely outgrown the lameness, and did not know it."
               "And that is all! Then it is no worker of miracles, after all, we are to see! How
                  disappointed I am!"
               "For my part, Blanche, I had rather Mr. Borland would not come. If there is any
                  occasion, as Cousin Aaron predicts, we shall have more than we can do, I think, to
                  manage the congregation."
               "Manage the people, do you say, Vesta? I want to know if you have the slightest
                  idea of undertaking that work?"
               "Would not you, for Angelo's sake?"
               "No! nor for the best friend living, I believe. Manage the congregation, indeed!
                  There are ways enough in which we can always serve Angelo; and I am
                  certain that if there is a person in this village  whom I would endeavor to conciliate, I have yet to
                  learn of that individual. They are a wretched set. And I am getting so tired of
                  Maderon! Where is Asia lately? You seem to have forgotten her in your multitudious
                  new charities. I don't know when I have heard you mention her name; though, after
                  all, I believe I prohibited the mention of it—did I not? There is one thing I
                  thought I would not tell you; but it is too good. They are talking about you in
                  the village as a—hear me, Vesta Maderon—a Woman's-Rights Woman, and all that sort
                  of thing! But come, I hear the fountains playing; let us go to the window, and I
                  will read you a new poem of Tennyson's I have. It is the very thing to read to
                  such music. Come!"
               "I don't like to hear you speak so of the people. You surely remember how fond
                  they all were of father. He had a great many friends among them. And I believe he
                  liked every soul in the village."
               "Of course he had, and did. This is the place; we will sit here. Is n't it
                  charming? Now keep very quiet, and I will read you the poem."
               "Blanche, see how clearly the light seems to fall through the branches in your
                  picture. I can almost hear the gnats that ought to be humming in that sunlight you
                  painted. Angelo thought the whole conception so fine—the shepherd, and the lamb,
                  and the green pastures, and still waters! Blanche, I wish that I were gifted
                  too."
               "Hush, child, or I shall have no time for the poem before mother comes. You have a
                  bad habit of delaying people who are hurried to death, as I am."
               They laughed, and they read the poem, and they listened together, the loving and
                  beautiful sisters, to the musical dash of the fountain, not a care in their gentle
                  hearts that hour.
            
            
               
               XVIII. THE LITTLE HOME MISSIONARY.
               ABOUT little Abby Weed, the girl of whom Asia spoke with a pity that was almost
                  lost in her admiration; the girl of whom Gregorias might have told a touching and
                  grievous story; the girl of whom Angelo and Vesta spoke, and of whom they oftener
                  thought, and spoke not.
               About the little, reedlike creature, that, in its slender, frail arms carried the
                  pining baby, and watched over it, and cared for it, and loved it, and prayed for
                  it, with the passionate love of a child who concentrates all its affection and its
                  interest in one living object. About the little Abby who labored in the kitchen
                  with thoughtful and careful head, and hands, and feet; that worked in the nursery
                  sery with all the ambitious determination of a too-early-awakened childhood! that
                  studied with aching eyes, and a brain overtasked, the lessons daily appointed.
               Childhood! is she passing through childhood? You look to youth for the shining
                  hair, and the glowing cheek and lip, for the laughing brightness of the eye, for
                  the swift, light step, and the eager heart, and the voice of joy. A faded, wasted,
                  pallid girl is here—and yet, a child. Yes! for the child-heart it is that loves
                  the hapless baby with a childlike love. A child-heart it is, that, proud of what
                  it can accomplish, struggles on, and will not be dismayed; and a brave child-heart
                  it is that looks unweariedly for the time—that reason might have told her would
                  never, never come—when the old bundle of worthlessness, poor, miserable Weed,
                  shall again take his proper place as the head of his family; when there shall be
                  order in reality where she, with hands whose impotence she sometimes vaguely
                  fears, so vainly endeavors to make order now; for the blessed time when there
                  shall be comfort where only discomfort abounds. It is the patient, hopeful, loyal
                  heart of childhood, that has not yet come to despise where it once yielded all
                  dutiful respect; that has not begun to contemn where once it was swift to render
                  all submission.
               In the quarter where dust and confusion most  abound in Maderon, there, in the very midst of
                  crowded habitations, almost close upon the sidewalk, stands the little whitewashed
                  house, mocked by the shadow of shade cast by two spindling evergreens. It is in
                  this place that Abby lives; coveting not the beauty and quiet surrounding a
                  hundred other residences in Maderon; content to abide there, never dreaming,
                  indeed, to murmur at that necessity; content, if she can only do and be all that
                  her heart tells her she may.
               Daily she comes from that close, uncomfortable quarter, dragging the carriage, the
                  poor baby within, away into quieter places. Daily she sits at the table, and toils
                  at the work that Mr. Franklin procured for her of Gregorias—the papers which,
                  child though she is, she copies with such care, and skill, and readiness; working,
                  working, till the slender arm wearies, and the frail body can bear no more. Daily
                  she pores over the lessons on no account to be suspended, for Mrs. Weed will have
                  her daughter an enlightened and learned woman. Daily she strives to make really a
                  home of that place called home, it would seem, in mockery, And daily Angelo
                  Franklin, when he looks on the cheerless dwelling, and thinks of its manner of
                  inmates, remembers to pity, and to admire, and to pray for the heroic child—with
                  the care-worn face, warm heart, and well-stored brain—that lives there.
               Angelo "knows to pity well;" and in many ways has he proven this—perhaps in no way
                  more effectively than in his goings to that house, and in his doings there.
               She was a child so frail, so pale, so patient—you knew she was patient by the
                  expression of her face—that she could excite but one emotion in a stranger's
                  heart, that of a pitying sympathy. Angelo had often seen her in the streets, but
                  never with other children in their walks and games; and he had noticed how rarely
                  she went unaccompanied by the old carriage and the miserable infant. From his
                  study-window he had watched her going to and from the comfortless place of
                  shelter, her home; he had heard of Mrs. Weed; he had encountered the old man; and,
                  at last, one day he spoke to the child—to Abby.
               He spoke to her, and it was to discover that a more spiritual being never grew up
                  amid the tribulations of the world, perfecting in the furnace of those "light" but
                  dire "afflictions," which wear out the lives of mortals so speedily, when mortals
                  have the grace to endure, and yet the will to battle with them.
               Angelo himself was young; and at Maderon house he met, when he would, with that
                  which is so attractive to the eyes of youth, with the beauty, and grace, and
                  refinement, of young and polished women. Much to admire there he saw, and much to
                  love. A different class of emotions was called  forth when he went sometimes, in fulfilment of his
                  ministerial duty, to the little whitewashed house over the way: or, when he walked
                  sometimes by Abby's side, drawing the carriage after him through some of the green
                  lanes of Maderon. From the day when she spoke with him as simple, natural,
                  untroubled childhood never speaks, or knows to speak, his interest deepened, and
                  unconsciously he talked with her not as with a child. From the day when she smiled
                  upon him, as she told him of the plans that she had formed, and those 
                     wierd-like
                     weird-like
                   eyes opened full upon him in an honest confidence, he never thought of
                  calling her ugly, or a fright. The glancing of those eyes made their own
                  revelation; and that no sophisticated thought, no manner of worldliness, polished
                  into beauty, or unpolished and unsightly, had found place within the soul of that
                  poor child, he knew. He thought upon her when he was alone; he talked of her when
                  with others; sometimes he counselled her, oftentimes he prayed for her; much he
                  marvelled as he thought of her. He could not look to her for counsel, as to Mrs.
                  Maderon; he could not go to her for such a sympathy and friendship as it was now
                  his habit to go and seek of Vesta. She had a different sort of interest in his
                  eyes.
               The influence unconsciously exerted by Abby was most strange. He saw her treading
                  in the path that leads to martyrdom: her every deed, all that Vesta told him
                  concerning her, all that he himself learned, had the effect of bringing her into
                  his heart: tenderly he cherished the thought of her there. The graces of her meek
                  and quiet spirit surrounded the thought of her as with a halo; purer and holier
                  than all others, she seemed to him, because she was a holy child for whom had been
                  no childhood. Angelo loved her as a brother might a sister.
               Not as he had loved Margaret: for here he felt that he was rather the protector
                  than the protected.
               Not at once, but gradually, it came into his thought to compare this girl with
                  those of larger growth; with Blanche and Vesta Maderon; with others young, and
                  fair, and gay; with the youth under his pastoral charge: and his heart and his
                  reason united in assigning to her a place above them all... It was because he
                  entered into a full understanding of all that she did, of all that she endured. He
                  also had grappled with poverty, hoped against hope, and labored and wept. He knew
                  the heroism that made her so victorious. And he was not of those careless souls,
                  who, conquering misfortune themselves, look with indifference, as upon a drama
                  enacted for amusement, on the struggles of the unfortunate. Rarely—never until he
                  had questioned her and won her confidence by his kindliness—did she speak to him
                  unreservedly as other people, older, do, when in a strait they seek for pastoral
                      advice. But when she did so speak,
                  he both saw, and understood, and needed not that Gregorias, who was so given to
                  prophetic utterances, should declare, the kind of womanhood to which, if life were
                  spared her, this girl would attain. He knew what this womanhood would be, if the
                  quiet spirit only could endure through coming years the contention, disorder,
                  mental corruption, and confusion, which reigned as a plague in her home. He beheld
                  her as a mild angel of peace, subject indeed to her unworthy parents, yet their
                  teacher by right, if they had only the wisdom to learn of her. By the process of
                  education which the mother had adopted, Abby's frame had been subjected to a
                  shock, from the effects of which, one, gazing upon her, might well wonder if she
                  would ever recover. It was a marvel to him when Angelo thought of the brain so
                  developed, the mind which already bore such precious fruits. It was a marvel that
                  induced a longing, to remove her from that toilsome scene of life—to transfer her
                  to a better soil—to bring before her the things she loved so much, shapes, and
                  sounds, and sights of beauty. But she was the maintenance of her father's
                  house—the support, the nurse, the servant; and even if he had a right to remove
                  her from that Pandemonium, whom could he interest in her that would give her a
                  home elsewhere? who would do for her as Mr. Lynn had done for Margaret and
                  himself? The minister did not imagine that it was with anything like the love with
                  which he would have approached a woman who had won his heart, that he thought on
                  little Abby Weed!
               And, certainly, it never entered Abby's mind to conceive a thought like this. Any
                  voice she would have listened to, that could give intelligible answers to the many
                  urgent questions that the circumstance of her daily life proposed to her, as she
                  went on her way. Any one who listened to her, with such manifest intent to serve
                  her, as did this minister, she would have loved with childlike earnestness and
                  sincerity—with a higher love, and yet of the same order of affection with which,
                  while she wondered at his course, she loved her father; with the same faculty of
                  soul, yet more intensely put forth, with which she loved the little child that was
                  almost wholly in her care.
               Angelo's career as a preacher, as we know, bade fair to be a very prosperous one;
                  for weeks after his first appearance in Maderon, he was the one theme for talk
                  with the villagers. But the Weeds never went to church; and Abby, with whom her
                  mother's opinions were gospel and law, thought with her, that the discourse of a
                  boy was hardly worth the hearing; and therefore she heard him not, until one
                  Sabbath, as she was strolling by the church, the sound of the organ lured her
                  within the opened door. With Willie in her arms, she stood  at the foot of the aisle, listening to Angelo, and
                  looking around with curiosity on the congregation, until the baby began to cry,
                  when she went out again, and resumed her walk.
               But not till Angelo had recognised the spectral face and the puny infant. He saw
                  her again that evening, still bearing the fretful child, and he gave her the
                  flowers which Vesta Maderon had just gathered for him. That was the beginning of
                  their acquaintance—and a worthy beginning—a gift of flowers from a servant of God,
                  to a toiling child of earth.
               Afterward Angelo went to the little whitewashed house, beyond the formidable outer
                  door, impelled by a curiosity which Christian charity made excusable.
               It was a curious household. And the pastor's interest was assuredly not lessened,
                  when he beheld, with his own eyes, the order of arrangements, and the distribution
                  of forces there. A problem was before him, which the father's senselessness, the
                  mother's fondness for disputation, and Abby's unchildlike intelligence, did not
                  help to solve. With the older members of the family, he certainly went not far in
                  his capacity of instructor. Weed, disgusted with all the shows of life, and
                  regarding Angelo's profession among not the least of the catalogue of shows,
                  lived, a model of silence, deaf and dumb—a wreck, as his wife would not have
                  hesitated tated to say, of what was never else than, NOTHING! Deaf and dumb, not
                  alone to whatever the preacher might have to say—except in corporeal substance, he
                  was indeed nothing, and the wonder was if he had ever been. Twenty years older
                  than his wife (poor wretch), he sat there in the corner, always there, as
                  senseless and inanimate as if he had indeed given over to his partner all the
                  mental faculty he might ever have possessed. He was fed, he was clothed; but was
                  he in his right mind? It was, with Angelo, a supposable case that he had once had
                  a mind, and, if Mrs. Weed had not taken possession, what had become of it?
               That was no doubt that, had fortune but favored her, this Weed's wife might have
                  made a position for herself in the world, and asserted and maintained there for
                  herself a right to influence. There is no such thing as fate or fortune, it is
                  said: in that case, possessed of many superior faculties, this unfortunate woman
                  was not possessed of that one faculty which transmutes dreams into realities, and
                  fancies into things. A workman skilful, worthy of his craft, might have wrought
                  the unwrought, 
                     unrerefined
                     unrefined
                   gold, into fine vessels for great service; but left to herself, aware of
                  her powers, disappointed at heart, mated, nay, united, with a man who distrusted
                  her, misunderstood her, and attempted vainly to control her by mere "brute-blind
                  force," she was, indeed, a wreck—just what the multitude  would call a "silly woman" to be led captive by
                  every strange device, and every new thing.
               Angelo Franklin did not half understand her, and at first she disgusted, then
                  amused, then silenced him; her conscious superiority when she addressed him, her
                  wit, and mental force, taught him that all the arguments into which he was at
                  first beguiled, were to no manner of purpose—she was not the person who could
                  affect him in his persuasions, and as idle as the wind were the truths that he
                  could offer her in these combats of the tongue.
               It was only the daughter that this "very good young man," as Mrs. Weed designated
                  him, could hope to influence, or instruct, or encourage. To her he was, in very
                  truth, a deliverer; from the "slough of Despond," where she wandered, bewildered,
                  and cast down, he led her: he told her gracious truths, which appealed to her
                  troubled heart with a greater power than did the mother's reasoning to her
                  prematurely-developed brain. He showed her the cross she was to bear, and while he
                  told her of it, his words strengthened the shrinking soul—satisfied the
                  questioning intellect—gave her new courage and strength to endure. Blest was the
                  work he did for her, and a day was to come when he should know it to his joy.
               No! it never entered into Abby's head that she, to the minister, was anything more
                  than a comfortless child to be comforted. And yet, in extent and variety of
                  information, she was not far behind him; for with Abby's education the mother had,
                  until of late, taken the utmost pains. Angelo perceived this, and it was only as a
                  believer in gospel truths that he endeavored to instruct her; for the rest, she
                  was a companion as intelligent and appreciative as any that he knew. But, though
                  she knew it not, and he was far from suspecting the real nature and extent of the
                  interest that he felt in Abby Weed, she was dearer to the young shepherd than any
                  other soul within his pastoral charge. She was the tender, shorn lamb—a meet
                  object for pity, and protection, and love.
            
            
               
               XIX. LOVE: AN ARGUMENT.
               ASIA, the student, happier than any other mortal in Maderon, sat by the bedside of
                  Milly, who, since that day when she saw, as she believed, the ghost of her Nathan,
                  had lain prostrate in continually-increasing weakness and imbecility. Asia, the
                  student, was studying there, and thinking at times of her teacher.
               Gregorias, at the same hour, sate in the minister's sanctum, thinking now upon
                  Asia and now of Blanche Maderon—of travel, adventure, and Borland. He was in his
                  own peculiar mood that evening, changeful, restless, impatient—for what, no man
                  could have told; he could not himself have told.
               Franklin and Gregorias had each seated himself before an open window; it was quite
                  dark in the study. Aaron looked up into the starlit heavens: Angelo's eyes were
                  fixed on a light that gleamed from one of the windows of the little white house
                  over the way. They were waiting together there for the hour of the evening train,
                  which they expected would bring Borland to Maderon.
               In silence they sat, until Gregorias, flinging the remnant of his cigar from the
                  window, said, as if musing aloud, "That was an interesting conversation we had the
                  other day at Aunt Agatha's. It is worth one's while to excite Vesta Maderon. She's
                  a fine girl—knows too much about the spirit of the time, though. If she became a
                  moralizing woman, which is only the next remove from these revolutionizing
                  heroines of the day, I should hate her. By-the-by, Reverend Doctor, to give you
                  your inevitable title in advance, allow me to ask if you know what a man means
                  when he confesses to have been in love?"
               Quietly responded Angelo: "I understand it very well."
               "Make a clean breast of it! confess your indiscretions. I want confoundedly to
                  hear something to excite me. Thank Heaven, Borland is coming! I shall die of ennui
                  here, as Cousin Blanche is continually saying. I've half a mind to invite her to
                  go abroad with me—a lovely creature!—But confess."
               "The ladies of my love were—my mother and my sister."
               
               Gregorias was silent—the mild seriousness of Angelo's reply checked the light
                  words that were upon his lip.
               "Do you think my love has been of so tranquil a character that I have really not a
                  proper comprehension of your meaning? My whole life, Gregorias, until just before
                  I came here, was made beautiful and happy by love. I know, by experience, how love
                  can lighten the burden of poverty. It may be hard to live merely upon a
                  recollection. It would, however, in my case, I think, be as selfish as unwise, to
                  ask for the development of affections that would prove more engrossing than those
                  I have known. I can't say that I have thought much about it since I came to
                  Maderon."
               "O, good Heavens, what an innocent!—rather, what a monstrous heathen! Content to
                  drag out life in these mean lodgings! a preacher to the gossip-loving people of a
                  country-village. I believe I've had at least a score of slander-suits since I came
                  here. What, man! have you never a single wish to reign absolute monarch over some
                  dear little human heart?"
               "My work engrosses me."
               "Strange to think how such a quiet man as YOU might find his ideas completely
                  upset, turned upside down, and rolled up in such inextricable confusion, that, for
                  the life of you, you could not find your way into the good, old, familiar tracks
                  of thought again. Ay! did but a face exactly to your mind, or a heart that you
                  entirely believed in, appear before you! Gad, man, what a loathing for study, what
                  remorseless dealing out of old sermons would follow! Faith, I envy you the day
                  that will surely come to you."
               "You, then, have nothing more to learn of this sort of 'legal process'?"
               "Ho, by the gods! Franklin, I've been the slave of eyes of every description, from
                  my youth up. But—this present moment beholds me—hum! ... A pair of blue eyes, and
                  a pair of black eyes—which? Think of a life's fate depending on the choice of an
                  eye! Now, if a black eye has fire, candor, intensity, you may be sure I'm done for
                  at once. Asia Phillips has such an eye, I believe, if my memory isn't treacherous.
                  You've seen Asia, my boy? A remarkable girl. I think she said you left a tract at
                  the cottage, the other day, by mistake—ha! ha! I rather thought, when she said it,
                  that Aunt Agatha had been giving you instructions! ... And then, there is the
                  spiritual, gentle, dreaming, tranquil eye, pure as a crystal, with no mysterious
                  depths; quite a bewitching eye—"
               "Like Miss Maderon's."
               "Ay," said Gregorias, slowly, musingly.
               "Tell me about your new clerk, Gregorias," said Angelo, abruptly changing the
                  subject. "How do you like her?"
               
               Gregorias lowered his eyes to the things of earth; the white house over the way
                  was a mass of darkness—its one light was withdrawn. "I went over there to-day," he
                  said. "The door of the room in which she was, stood open, as I entered. I wish you
                  could have seen her! You think she is so calm when she speaks; but her eyes were
                  flashing; she looked as if in the greatest excitement, and her pen was flying like
                  mad. I never saw a person so absorbed. I had to speak several times before she
                  deigned to notice that I was waiting there to see her."
               "She is all their support just now," said Franklin. "You know the father don't
                  pretend to exert himself in the least; and as for Mrs. Weed, she has all that she
                  can do to prepare for the days of advent."
               "What? the deuce!"
               "She is an example, Gregorias, this child. With her might she does what her hands
                  find to do. If the mother is a warning, the child is an assurance."
               "Never been to school a day in her life, I believe. No? I thought not. To hear her
                  talk, one would think she had been fed on books altogether."
               "And digested the food thoroughly. She has astonishingly clear views of things, as
                  Miss Vesta will tell you; and a wonderful stock of information. We think of
                  getting up a school for her, Miss Vesta and I; she will kill herself over that
                  writing."
               "A very good plan. I never saw one drive a quill in such style before. Get up the
                  school, by all means, Franklin. Jove! I should like to have my life insured to me
                  for a few hundred years to come. I want greatly to know what is to come of all
                  this— 
                     
                        "'Tumult and excess
                        Of act and passion under sun.'
                     
                   I want greatly to know, besides, what interpretation the generations to be,
                  will put upon such word as, 'love,' for instance, from the contemplation of which
                  you broke away with such unclerical impetuosity, to talk about your neighbor Abby
                  Weed; a very suspicious act, by-the-way."
               "What is it to love, Gregorias, according to your notion at this
                  present hour? I don't know that I ever heard any but a dictionary definition."
               "High time you heard, then," said Gregorias. "My notion, sir, is such as would do
                  no discredit to the dream of a girl ... By-the-by, what are called girls' dreams
                  are very beautiful, unselfish, pure, and all that. What is with us too often only
                  a pastime, is with women their life."
               "That man is not to be envied," said the minister, "who is so unfortunate as to
                  break the dream. It ought not to be called a dream. Somebody has, as truly, as
                  eloquently, said, 'The subject of woman is so splendid, so terrible, so
                  enchanting, so vast, so 'catholic,' that no imaginable treatment of it would  ever seem quite satisfactory.' The
                  power to love truly, and to endure much for love's sake, seems almost peculiar to
                  woman. So the subject of love seems to me about as 'splendid,' 'terrible,' and
                  'vast,' as that of woman."
               "Mrs. Weed, a lover, for example, Franklin!"
               "Her daughter for example, Gregorias! Hide your diminished head! For
                  me, verily I could bow down to the dust before such lovers as the world may number
                  by the thousand among women. It is too weak in you to point out individual proof
                  to support the contrary of what I aver. And for the wife's insane conduct in this
                  instance, I believe the husband entirely to blame. From all I can learn of them, I
                  judge that Weed has to thank himself for the unhappy, unsettled state of the
                  wife's mind. Something quite as unchristian as contempt and disgust possesses me,
                  I fear, Gregorias, when I hear of people being in love, in the manner these people
                  must have been, for example. I suppose this old Weed, this abominable, stupified
                  bundle of opium and tobacco, really talked once to that deluded wife of his, about
                  love! She is a keen, smart woman; I believe she might have been a great woman.
                  That only makes the whole thing more wonderful. From my inmost soul I pity her.
                  Now, a mutual love is not the thing for people in their position to contemplate;
                  it is quite out of the question. But if they had a small amount of self-respect,
                  they might get on quite comfortably together, even though their tastes and
                  opinions are not the same; in other words, though they have no mutual sympathy,
                  and though they have not one particle of what you would call 'love' for each
                  other."
               "Ah, Franklin, this same self-respect! It is in human nature to bicker, and
                  contend, and strive after victory in argument. There is a certain sort of
                  satisfaction in having the last word, to knowledge of which we must all plead
                  guilty. I agree with the man who calls the last word 'the most dangerous of
                  infernal machines;' and, I contend, you will not often find such self-respect in
                  people, married people of all others, as will lead them in their differences to
                  maintain a dignified, yet affectionate silence. No! one should be a sovereign lord
                  over his household. Most heartily do I admire and approve the course of Ahasuerus.
                  If Vashti were my wife, I would make an example of her."
               "The very idea with which this loathsome Weed set out in life, you may depend,"
                  exclaimed Angelo. "He was a tyrant till she conquered him."
               "Through love, not fear, I mean. The allegiance must not be demanded: it must be
                  rendered freely. Never held back for a second thought. That is my idea of love,
                  Franklin."
               "Unsound in every part. Until men are more than men, or women less than dolts, it
                  must remain the most unreasonable of all ideas. This is a disturbing turbing, disquieting world to live in!
                  Why is one justified more than another in laying that 'flattering unction to his
                  soul,' that, because he is man, he is ever in the right?"
               "I would be the sun of my domestic world—nothing less. My wife, to use a poet's
                  comparison, should be the moon, whose light must reflect from me."
               "What sort of reflector would this Miss Phillips prove of whom you speak? Rather
                  dazzling and eclipsing, would she not? But apart from jesting, Gregorias, if I
                  understand you, your doctrine would 'by degrees, but more and more,' make you the
                  usurper of religion, society, the world, even of the eternal God! Good friend,
                  probably no school-girl ever dreamed such stuff as that concerning mortal
                  man."
               "Nonsense, revered sir! sheer nonsense! It is want of tact on the part of the
                  lords of creation that makes the mischief."
               "That is not so, Gregorias. You will find it is not true; that some other than
                  these 'dynastic reasons of larger bones and stronger sinews' must be given for
                  right to rule. Against everything that looks like tyranny, human nature will
                  always rebel. You are human as your wife; prove her tyrant, and you will find
                  that, according to her belief, the time for such sort of rule has gone by. I have
                  had an opportunity for proving the love and devotion of which a woman's heart is
                  capable, in the life of my sister Margaret; and I tell you, sir, a courageous,
                  reverent, and loving woman, is Nature's triumphant work. Such a life we should
                  never insult by such weak words as we think to address to her, when we would talk
                  to her of our devotion. A 'weak, characterless woman' is a thing of man's
                  devising, not of our Creator's. A girl"—tenderly he said her name—"even like this
                  poor little Abby, who never murmurs, and apparently never wearies, when anything
                  is to be done in that miserable household, though frail and insignificant, is the
                  last who should be called weak: and yet a coward ruffian, who at the approach of
                  care, or grief, or trouble, would fly before it to drunkenness, or any bestiality,
                  for escape, could crush her to death with a motion, in the twinkling of an eye.
                  That the sex is not intellectually Lilliputian proves to my mind very clearly that
                  God has cared for her when 'the sun' of which you speak has, through ages,
                  forgotten to illuminate! Look at the fictions, not within book-covers, but outside
                  of them, on which they have been fed! Poor diet, indeed! and yet there have been
                  comparatively few cases of starvation!"
               "Defender of woman, that will do! No more, no more, I beg. You have been reading
                  Horace Smith, whose essay should be subject to the fire-ordeal, if I had my way—a
                  mischievous, incendiary, absurd affair! Preach a sermon or two after this  sort, and you will make a sensation, I
                  predict.—No, come away, boy! Keep your place, and maintain your dignity, like a
                  sensible fellow, or you'll have all the women of Maderon out in battle array, Mrs.
                  Weed at the head of them, marching under your banner! What a covetable notoriety!
                  Beware, beware!—But, now, if you please, we will be off. I hear the car-whistle,
                  and Borland has probably come. I trust he will manage so as to make you forget for
                  a season that remarkable little bit of Weed, called Abby! Even the eyes I spoke
                  of, if I were directly under their influence—those of Asia, or Blanche, as you
                  please—could never have inspired me with such eloquence as you have poured forth
                  on her account."
               —And Borland had arrived. He had come, another element of life, to
                  mingle with the elements already working in Maderon.
            
            
               XX. THE DOOM OF GENIUS.
               ASIA the student sat at Aunt Milly's bedside, and studied, I said, while
                  Gregorias, through the conversation with Franklin, was thinking of her and
                  Blanche. Had they known, those women, how much he reflected upon them, they had,
                  each of them, revolted in pride from such a conjunction. But with a very different
                  sort of pride they would have revolted: Blanche in a regal indignation, not that
                  his mind dared to trifle with a thought of her, but that he should ever compare
                  herself and Asia Phillips, or associate them as women, equally as friends, in his
                  meditation. The striving, ambitious, defiant, determined conqueror, Asia, would
                  have scoffed with a more than maiden pride, had she  known that it was less as an element of power, less
                  as a creature whose destiny was glory, than as a woman whose affections were worth
                  testing, that he inclined to think of her.
               She had continued her studies, and they were her life: and as she continued them,
                  the tasks and works of duty became mechanical; she performed them with her might;
                  she was faithful over few things; but the objects of these cares became secondary
                  in her thought, primary though they might appear in her action. She had continued
                  her studies, and Gregorias was, as he had promised to be, her master. Once, and
                  again, and yet again, she had gone to the place of their appointment. He thought,
                  as he observed her persevering industry, as he listened to her vigorous recital,
                  as he saw the fire of determination and of hope flashing from her eyes, that she
                  never was disheartened—that she was dauntless, invulnerable, unconquerable by
                  opposition or any obstacle. He did not know the truth. He did not bear in mind the
                  effect the first words of his prophecy had made upon her. When he looked upon her,
                  he forgot that she could ever be cast down, dismayed, disheartened. When he was
                  not in her presence, it oftentimes occurred to him to make a trial of that
                  courage, to experiment upon her bold determinations, but he did not think to do it
                  when his mind and eyes came into actual contact with hers.
               There were times when she was dismayed, there were times when she became mightily
                  disheartened. She relied upon his encouragements to an extent she would not have
                  believed, had he or any other mortal declared it.
               Gregorias went to these recitations as willingly, certainly, as she, and with
                  vastly more of curiosity. And he kept the secret of his tutorship. He ceased to
                  make mention of her name at Maderon house, and gradually elsewhere.
               Perhaps, because he began to think her name significant of too much nobleness to
                  be brought down into the dust of his aunt's contemptuous recognition and comment;
                  or, he may have had other reason. Vesta, also, though she knew far less of Asia's
                  self than did even Gregorias, who knew so little, yet so much!—Vesta also wisely
                  ceased to make of Asia a subject for discussion with her mother; indeed, for such
                  discussions she seemed to have herself but little time: what with the projects she
                  was forming with Angelo Franklin, and the interest with which she exerted herself
                  in getting up the afternoon school for Abby Weed, she was fully occupied. And as
                  to Mrs. Maderon, engrossed with the young pastor, and the church, and a hundred
                  other absorbing things under her supervision, she almost forgot the existence of
                  the perverse, incorrigible creature!
               But Asia had not forgotten Mrs. Maderon, or Blanche: nor was it possible that she
                  should ever  do so; too often by light
                  words, harsh words, and meaning looks—glances that did not mar the beauty of their
                  faces, but which told upon the hidden life of her who met them—had they wantonly
                  trodden upon her spirit, rebuked her aspirations, mocked her pride, shamed her
                  woman-nature. Even the worm will turn when it is trodden under foot; and Asia
                  could not forget the indignities she had so many times endured. The 
                     encourgement
                     encouragement
                   that Gregorias extended was something new and strange in her experience.
                  Vesta's kindliness was the natural expression of a good heart; it was interest,
                  sympathy, affection, such as was, Asia knew, equally bestowed on Abby Weed, and on
                  many persons needy in one way or another. The remembrance of these was not
                  powerful to make her forget Mrs. Maderon or Blanche; and it was the recollection
                  of them, and of the mighty class they represented, that made her at times
                  desponding to a degree that would have excited Gregorias to wonder, had he known
                  of it; despairing to a degree that would have led Mrs. Maderon to believe, and to
                  say, that there was really hope for her! So far beyond her understanding was the
                  nature, and the spirit, and the power of this girl, that the pride of Asia seemed
                  to her but folly and madness, inherited and blameworthy. Her strange beauty she
                  saw not; her passion, the love and the joy, the despair and the torments of which
                  such a spirit was capable, she knew not; the heights to which she might aspire she
                  guessed not: only the depths that she might sound, which it was probably her
                  destiny to sound, would she imagine, and one might be sure she would not fail to
                  imagine them. There are insects that can sting a giant to madness and death; there
                  are words, and looks, and smiles, that can rob one of every earthly joy: and of
                  these Asia knew, and was not strong to pity the unpunishable robbers!
               But Vesta and Gregorias, they were also daily in her thought; and how could it be
                  otherwise? It was not possible that she should forget the handsome teacher who had
                  done, and who was doing, so much for her; who had given her self-enlightenment,
                  encouragement, and spoken for her words of glorious prophecy! A soul less resolute
                  and strong, less assured of its own power, less lonely, less ambitious, had
                  perhaps feared and failed to do what she was doing. A stronger soul, a more
                  womanly spirit, some reader will assert, had scorned to do it. But she was Asia
                  Phillips, and not a stronger nor a weaker woman. With the unshrinking, perhaps
                  thoughtless, courage, of one bent on fulfilment of a project, careless of the
                  means that offered for its furtherance, so they were only means of power, she
                  pored over the studies which were her delight, and went happy and satisfied to her
                  recitation.
               It had been hard indeed for Asia to lose sight in thought of Vesta Maderon, who so
                  often went,  though but for a moment,
                  to ask after Milly, to sit sometimes by her bedside, and thus release Asia from
                  the almost constant watching required of her; and again to cheer Uncle King with
                  her bright and happy words, or again and again to talk with Asia of the work that
                  she was doing in the village, and of all she hoped to do. Ah, Vesta Maderon could
                  never be lost sight of! When she came down to the cottage, it was as though a
                  sunbeam darted through a place too shaded and dim; and when she went away, Asia
                  and her uncle might always have said from their hearts: "She has blest us— 
                     'As a priest or queen were she.'"
                  
               
               Mrs. Maderon! Would the time ever come when Asia should be delivered from the
                  recollection of that face and voice as they last appeared before her, that day
                  when the lady spoke those strange, mysterious words which, Vesta said, could have
                  no meaning? whose solution Asia never dared to ask of him who could give it, if
                  solution there were? They were words that haunted many an else-tranquil hour—words
                  that came suddenly and startlingly upon her in quiet times and places, making her
                  heart to stand still and her brain to reel with dizziness, before the
                  possibilities it conjured up. And why? Because, though she would fain persuade
                  herself that Mrs. Maderon had been guilty of a falsehood, the words she had spoken
                  had brought forward, to her recollection, shadows of things which no effort of
                  hers could define. Dark and terrific shadows they seemed, when sometimes she
                  allowed herself to look upon them, for she knew not from what horrid truth they
                  might be cast.
               It was only in study, impassioned, intense, that Asia could find relief from a
                  torment like this. Only in the approving words Gregorias could not withhold, did
                  she find such encouragement as made her to live above the shadows and trials of
                  the present. Happy in this, poor Asia, she blest the name of him who enlightened
                  by his teaching, upheld her by his cordial, honest praise—supported her by his
                  encouragement.
               And as to Gregorias himself: how was it that he in reality conducted his
                  peripatetic school? With what manner of interest did he go from the business of
                  the courtroom, or from other genial companionship, from intercourse with polished
                  minds and well-schooled hearts, from the presence of Blanche and Vesta, from the
                  presence of Mrs. Maderon, to meet in the solitary place this singularly-gifted
                  girl?
               He was acted upon so easily, so inevitably by outward influences, did he, in this
                  association of master and pupil, exert all the influence, and Asia none whatever?
                  Had the dreaming eye of Blanche charmed him so entirely, that he was insensible to
                  the resolute fire that glowed in the dark and splendid eyes of Asia? He kept her
                  secret well; he  judged her with the
                  critic's sense, he counselled her with wisdom, he pointed out her failures, he was
                  her teacher truly, and he served her faithfully. He formed an accurate judgment of
                  her powers and her spirit: he saw when she had need of reassurance; he knew that,
                  sometimes daring as Prometheus, in the reaction of that power, she was in
                  despondency, and helplessness, and hopelessness, as a child; he saw that the brave
                  soul was tabernacled in the inevitable clay; and yet he never
                  shuddered in view of the mighty work he had here the opportunity to do;
                     he never said: 'I am vain and impotent; go to one mightier than I;
                  depend not on me.' No, though he saw and understood, better than she, all that
                  striving in her of the immortal with the human! no, though in the capacity of an
                  enlightened worldling he had so many dangerous advantages.
               He was merely a human teacher, and he quailed not in view of his task! But, if his
                  influence was great with her, not less than mighty was her influence with him.
                  When he listened, when he gazed, he was oblivious to all beyond the margin of that
                  wood. And she saw not his weakness, understood not his frailty: the scholar had
                  confidence in the teacher. Had this ceased to be so, Asia Phillips would have
                  paused not a moment longer to ask his counsel, or listen to his words; she would
                  have gone back to the cottage—she would have labored there by herself. For it was
                  not love of which she then felt in need—not of the love of which he was capable,
                  that she had thought, when she became his pupil.
               He counted too much on his own strength of purpose, on his consistent principles,
                  on his individual, personal pride of character; he counted too much on purposes
                  which he believed to exist, but which had no existence, when he essayed to teach
                  Asia Phillips. It had been happier for him perhaps had he guessed at the fact; his
                  restless spirit had not been made so restless—the disturbance occasioned by the
                  entrance of a new thought in his brain, and the excitement of its entertainment,
                  might then have been spared him! But for Asia! We will make no question that it
                  had been happier for her! For Asia in no ordinary manner was alone—alone in her
                  youth, and her heart was warm, and her art was not as she believed, how could it
                  be? as she had said, her world. Nature as well as art, a heart as well as a head,
                  affections as well as an intellect, devotion as well as aspiration—these were
                  hers, were her. Else had she not been the woman that she was, the patient, pitying
                  woman that she proved herself at home; else had she not been the genius that
                  Gregorias in his soul acknowledged her to be, when he saw herself, for the first
                  time, in the grove beside the lake.
               She had recited to him again and again, and now she went once more to the place
                  where he  usually heard her. But not
                  with the thought of meeting him there; he had told her that he should be away from
                  the village that day. Neither did she go to speak aloud for her own edification.
                  In bitter sadness, pondering on the strange words Mrs. Maderon had said—ready to
                  abjure the profession she had chosen, disheartened, dismayed, she strolled away
                  from the cottage, involuntarily treading to their "schoolroom."
               And Gregorias was there. She did not know it until, when she had seated herself
                  upon a fallen oak, he came and stood before her; and when he asked her to repeat
                  the task he had given her, she seemed to forget the resolution she had made.
               Rising from her seat, she said—
               "The passages were from 'Fazio,' you remember?" The tone of her voice was
                  uncommon; she spoke as if in hopeless sadness. To reassure her, Gregorias
                  said—
               "I hurried through my business, and came back to Maderon purposely, that I should
                  not lose tonight's recitation. I should have gone to the cottage for you, had not
                  a presentiment assured me that you would come. You did not think I had
                  returned?"
               "No—you said it was impossible, Mr. Gregorias."
               "I find that a resolute will takes one very readily through impossibilities, and
                  over them. I do not intend to ever miss an opportunity of hearing you recite, and
                  hereafter I think I shall make myself a mere travelling audience for the sake of
                  the intellectual treat you are to give to your public. Have you seen Mr.
                  Borland?"
               "No."
               "I wish he might see you. If I had an Aladdin's lamp, he should be here
                  to-night."
               "No, indeed!" Asia replied quickly. A sudden flush overspread her face; but,
                  recovering from the momentary confusion, she said honestly, "You remember I am at
                  present to have no audience whatever." Then the spirit with which she spoke died
                  entirely away; she seemed about to utter a very different sentiment; but her
                  purpose again changed, and in a mechanical manner of recitation she began the
                  lines— 
                     
                        "Take heed, we are passionate: our milk of love
                        Doth turn to wormwood, and that's bitter drinking.
                        The fondest are most frenetic: when the fire
                        Burneth intensest, there the inmate pale
                        Doth dread the broad and beaconing conflagration.
                        If that ye cast us to the winds, the winds
                        Will give us their unruly, restless nature;
                        We whirl, and whirl; and where we settle, Fazio,
                        But He that ruleth the mad winds can know.
                        If ye do drive the love out of my soul,
                        That is its motion, being, and its life,
                        There'll be a conflict strange and horrible,
                        Among all fearful and ill-visaged fiends,
                        For their blank void; and their mad revel there
                        Will make me, oh, I know not what, hate thee!
                        
                        Oh, no! I could not hate thee, Fazio.
                        Nay, nay, my Fazio, 'tis not come to that
                        Mine arms, mine arms, shall say that next 'shall not.'
                        I'll never startle more my peevish ears,
                        But I'll speak to thee with my positive lips."
                     
                  
               
               Before Gregorias had time to pass judgment on her speech, which, in the last
                  lines, was marvellous in its sweetness, and on her manner, which became grand in
                  its impassioned majesty, Asia began to repeat another passage from the same play:— 
                     
                        "Oh, what regards it, if a blind man lie
                        On a green lawn, or on a steamy moor!
                        What heeds it to the dead and withered heart,
                        Whose faculty of rapture is grown sere,
                        Hath lost distinction between foul and fair,
                        Whether it house in gorgeous palaces,
                        Or 'mid wan graves, and haggard signs of care!
                        Oh, there's a grief, so with the threads of being
                        Ravelled and twined, it sickens every sense:
                        Then is the swinging and monotonous bell
                        Musical as the rich harp heard by moonlight;
                        Then are the limbs insensible if they rest
                        On the coarse pallet, or the pulpy down."
                     
                  
               
               Gregorias seemed lost in thought when she concluded. When he began to speak, it
                  was as though he could find no adequate words; his manner was strange as hers had
                  been; he hesitated, and then spoke rapidly, and with an excitement quite
                  unusual:—
               "You will immortalize your name. I have said it time and again; but I never felt
                  the truth of the prophecy as I do just now. I have no words to praise you! I am
                  breathless with amazement, as you see. Nothing can impede you. You will be
                  immortal: the surety is that voice which has spoken those words—the genius which
                  makes even those words sound magnificent."
               "Shall I, do you think?"
               She was as tranquil now as she had been aroused during the recitation. He looked
                  upon her with surprise, so indifferent, so dispirited, so careless of his praise,
                  he had never, before this evening, seen her. He asked:—
               "Has it come to be a matter of no moment to you, Asia?"
               "I have abandoned my design of yesterday and of all the past," she replied; the
                  words had a sharp and desperate sound.
               "You have said the same thing before. Only, at present, you seem vastly more
                  determined. You must desist from such a fancy: you know you have not abandoned the
                  design."
               "I have, Mr. Gregorias, I do assure you."
               Never was Asia more in earnest than at that moment. Yet Gregorias laughed—not
                  lightly, nor carelessly, but as if to shame her weakness.
               "When I was younger," he said, "I was for a short time laboring under a
                  hallucination—bent on distinguishing myself as a poet! Oh, long before youth was
                  over, I would be a light of the world—I would give to my time truer poetry than
                  had yet  been given. You see, I am as
                  much of a poet as I shall ever be. I have let my ambition ooze away, without the
                  least compunction. You declare the same thing. But can the Ethiopian change his
                  skin, or the leopard his spots? When that happens, Asia, I shall look to see you
                  unambitious, ceasing to toil against the fetters which you have said are binding
                  you, concealing your power from the world! content to hide your light under a
                  bushel!—not one instant before."
               "False prophet!" she exclaimed vehemently— "help me rather to forget my madness.
                  Bring no more that scene of triumph and glory before me."
               "It is your obvious destiny. No other life on this earth can you lead." He spoke
                  calmly now, and something in this calmness had the effect to subdue her tone.
               "I know it," she quietly replied, "and therefore I shall lead no life at all."
               Was he talking at random? Did Gregorias now speak only to reassure Asia?
               "I suppose this is the real crisis of your destiny. To the most of
                  people—you differ, in this as in every other respect, from them—the crisis occurs
                  while the great experiment is being made before an audience. The trial is made in
                  your case, long before acclamation of delight, or hissing, or reviling, can meet
                  you. You have but to proceed on your way, deaf to each voice that makes tumult
                  within yourself, and your conquest can no more be prevented than the purposes
                  of any other sovereign power."
               "I had resolved, when I came here, to never listen to such words again," she began
                  to say.
               "Then you must for ever escape me. And that you are not to do. As surely as you
                  have accepted me as your teacher, this shall be the burden of my speech to you. Do
                  you not understand that I feel unbounded pride when I think of your career, and
                  that I almost rival you in the thought with which you estimate its successes?"
               Try as he might, Gregorias could not guess at the nature of her reflections as she
                  stood and pondered. He also stood and pondered; and then he kept not back this
                  question, though he knew well what would come of it: it leaped from his heart; he
                  made no effort to stay it; and, at that same instant, an accusing angel bore it
                  away "to the court of Heaven's high chancery:"—
               "Have you never, never in the girl's life you have led, thought of other triumph
                  than that which secures fame and glory?"
               "You mean love?" she asked at once, in that same sad and dreary tone in which she
                  had spoken before.
               "Love!" he repeated; "yes, that is what I mean: have you had nothing to do with
                  this dream, Asia?"
               "Do you call it a dream?"
               
               "Ay."
               "I have not had the dream."
               "You will not allow that it is a dream in the first place?"
               "Does it fade away and perish, as a vision of the night?"
               "I fancied so."
               "Does it?" she said impatiently.
               "Yes," he answered, his eyes fixed upon her as though now to read her most secret
                  thought.
               "No"—she answered his look—"I know nothing about it."
               "Save what you have read?"
               "Save what I have read."
               "And what did you gather from the reading?"
               "That love was indestructible."
               "The people of the world will not believe it. They can not be induced to believe
                  it. They may be in the right. What is it, Asia? .... There is a passage in
                  Fazio—one that you repeated the last time—"
               He hesitated. She said: "I remember the passage;" and she went on to repeat it:— 
                     
                        "Untold love—
                        Nay, Fazio, gaze not on me so; my tongue
                        Can scarcely move for the fire within my cheeks—
                        It cankereth, it consumeth,—untold love.
                        But if it burst its secret prison-house,
                        And venture on the broad and public air,
                        It leagueth with the busy fiend called 'Shame,'
                        And they both dog their game, till misery
                        Fastens upon it with the viper's fang,
                        And wings its being with its venomous coil."
                     
                  
               
               "Is that love, Asia?" he asked as she finished the recitation. A look expressive
                  of thorough contempt for the quoted sentiment which had escaped her lips, was the
                  answer, as she went on to cite another poet's thought:— 
                     
                        "I am renewed.
                        My eyes grow with the light which is in thine;
                        The silence of my heart is full of sound.
                        Hold me up—so! because I comprehend
                        This human love, I shall not be afraid
                        Of any human death; and yet because
                        I know this strength to love, I seem to know
                        Death's strength by that same sign."
                     
                  
               
               "You quote from the 'Drama of Exile,' eh?—And that is your idea of love ... by the
                  way, you have said the lines."
               "Do you think so?"
               "Yes, and that the mortal is to be envied for whom such a heart is in store."
               Briefly she replied—very coldly she said it:—
               "I was humbled already."
               "You gave no evidence of that. Pray, what can it mean to be humbled?"
               "To be brought down to a condition where you loathe yourself."
               "A strange mood you indulge in. What do I  see? A young and beautiful woman, gifted,
                  resolute—she talks of self-loathing."
               "If she merely talked of it! But if the intensity of her feeling brought her to
                  declare it—that, you would call absurd, reckless?"
               "I think you must have met with some great loss to come to such a speech. What is
                  it you deplore?"
               "A loss of faith."
               "In what?"
               "Myself."
               "How?"
               "By foul robbery."
               "I will issue a proclamation for the apprehension of the thief."
               "I wish to Heaven you would."
               "Will it never find its own way back, this poor estray?"
               "Never, I think."
               "This is too unfortunate!"
               "The bird is unfortunate that lies with a broken wing, disabled on the ground, his
                  eyes fixed on the far-distant heights which seemed but now so near. It is useless
                  to waste pity on him."
               Gregorias spoke not recklessly, but solemnly—from his heart; for the moment, if no
                  longer, the words, he said, had with him a meaning.
               "Perhaps a human love would support you bravely in these seasons of depression to
                  which you seem too subject. It is a sort of depression I can well understand, dear
                  Asia. Such a love—would you accept from me?"
               Words she had never hoped to hear from his lips! which she had never thought that
                  he could speak to her! Yet, with what an instantaneous intelligence did her heart
                  receive and acknowledge them! Still, with a stoic's calmness, she replied:—
               "No. You do not believe in love! What can it mean to offer to others what you can
                  not give, because you have it not?"
               "You do not believe I love you—you will not receive my love? You think I am
                  worldly, and therefore false. You are afraid that—"'
               "Now you prophecy truly. But I am afraid of nothing."
               "Pupil! you shall learn a lesson," he exclaimed.
               "Master! I will not!" she answered, with a clear, strong voice; but her face was
                  pale—she trembled.
               There was matter for study and reflection in her pronunciation of these words. So
                  singular, so complicated was it, that Gregorias for a moment, even there and then,
                  tried to analyze it. Was there no passion in the tone? Was there fear? was there
                  pride? Was not as full an admission uttered in the passionate, "I will not!" as in
                  that word, "Master?" He fancied that her heart had sent forth an acknowledgment, a
                  beseeching, a bewailing. When  she
                  broke his meditation by some other word, and went away, he merely bowed his head;
                  he made no effort to detain her. * * * *
               * * * Another new, exciting thought was lodged in the brain of Aaron
                  Gregorias.
               An altogether new thought added glory to the glorious dreams of Asia Phillips.
            
            
               XXI. THE NEW CHURCH—AN APOSTLE.
               HAD any one questioned Gregorias concerning the manner of faith that was in him,
                  he would at once have acknowledged himself to be of that church which he affirmed
                  Borland was silently establishing, the articles of whose creed the "Reformer" had
                  appeared from time to time, previously to his wife's death, to establish.
               Gregorias' exercise of faith was much after the manner of his exercise of
                  professional abilities. As to that professional career, there was that within him
                  which would enable him brilliantly to succeed; but, as a whole, his life must
                  prove a failure. If he ever attained a high position, he would not maintain
                  it.
               
               As to that faith: conjectures, speculations, dreamings—these satisfied him. He had
                  not—as had Borland, who was now living in Maderon—the intellectual and moral
                  sanctity, that would enable him to live in accordance with the stern purity of
                  high and splendid dreams. Beautiful ideas they were which he took into his heart,
                  and cherished for their beauty's sake. But they were not, with him, the fixed laws
                  of inner life, immutable rules for the regulation of his ways. Nature was all in
                  all to each. But while the one, acknowledging this, lived a life of stainless
                  purity, irreproachable in personal action—the other, like an insect that follows
                  its own wayward fancy, went gathering the sweets of life wherever he could find
                  them. He was a lawyer, who yielded allegiance to no higher law than that of his
                  own impulse—a practitioner who assigned unto himself the right of all mental and
                  moral lawlessness.
               In the case of Borland, "the ungovernable thoughts within" vented themselves on
                  subjects subtle, and all-engrossing to his intellect. Gregorias, his
                  disciple—though he, perhaps, might soar to a height of vision beyond that which
                  Borland had attained—must still come down to earth, his element. The ethereal
                  atmosphere was much too rare for him. He must descend to where the red glow of the
                  setting sun fell over the flower-clad earth: it was not for him to dwell afar amid
                  the stars; the spirit might wrestle with the animal; it was not spirit that would
                  conquer in Gregorias. A spiritual sensualist may seem a strange anomaly: yet that
                  was he.
               Borland had come to live in Maderon—at least he said so when he held Angelo in his
                  arms, and looked upon "the boy," and felt his great heart warming anew, with
                  tenderest love, toward him. He said so, and that his work was done, when Gregorias
                  asked him of his mission, aim, and progress.
               But if he had really taken that resolve, and retired in this manner to hide
                  himself from all who sought for more of such illumination as his mind could give,
                  he should have closed his lips, and hidden himself in the depths of the
                  wilderness. He assigned to himself a purpose; that was well: but he sought to
                  perform it in a manner that was simply impossible.
               He was in Maderon. The grave, calm, philosophic Borland, was moving in that little
                  circle of life made up of Vesta, Blanche, and Mrs. Maderon, Gregorias, and
                  Franklin!
               Why was he there? He said his work was done. Then it was merely to listen to the
                  idle chat that went on between Gregorias and Blanche, beings "made for each
                  other," as the village gossips said whenever they saw them together; it was merely
                  to escort Mrs. Maderon to the village-church where  Angelo preached; it was to lose his own
                  self-consciousness in an observance of the lives of others; or, to mourn over his
                  sad bereavement? Not for that, certainly. Even Angelo never heard him, more than
                  once, allude to the death of his Margaret as a loss.
               Was it to enlighten Angelo? Gregorias had said that Borland would not lift a
                  finger to bring another to his own belief.
               Was it to enlighten Vesta? Borland's present life was simply purposeless. And thus
                  was he carrying out one of his own dogmas.
               Most perplexing to Vesta—to whom Gregorias had often propounded Borland's
                  beautiful and new ideas, because he fancied that her mind was opened to receive
                  them, or that he believed it probable that she would one day fill the place of
                  Margaret, or some such idle thing—most perplexing to her did his course seem, when
                  the worker and thinker of the Age, week after week, remained in that stupid
                  village, occupying himself with "trifles light as air"—announcing, in divers ways,
                  that his career was over.
               And because, one gloomy autumn-day, she could think of no better occupation, when
                  she wished to forget some unkind words that Asia Phillips had thoughtlessly or
                  recklessly said to her, Vesta addressed to Mr. Borland a question, in the hope
                  that he would be induced by it to speak of himself. He was in the very mood; a
                  better opportunity could she not have chosen. When she spoke, he looked not up
                  from the book he had been reading, but said quietly:—
               "I looked upon my Luna as the Angel of the world. I thought that not another woman
                  lived altogether capacitated as she. But you remind me of her forcibly, Miss
                  Maderon, so that it has sometimes seemed to me that there must be some manner of
                  connection between you, spiritually. I wonder if you are the same being that you
                  were before she died? You will say, 'Yes.' I do not believe it. And the same work
                  that she wrought, it may be your destiny to do: to redeem one person thoroughly
                  from the error of his ways; to enable him, I trust, by your life, instead, as she,
                  by her death, to live in harmony with Nature .... in unity of spirit with the
                  great idea; to enable him to cultivate a calmness that shall equal the calmness of
                  Nature—so that his soul shall be a reflex of Nature."
               "Is it true, Mr. Borland," ventured Vesta, "that, as some have suggested, one can
                  maintain life, not only the soul, but the whole life, in an entire, perpetual
                  calmness, which no outward influence can vex, arouse, or trouble? Can one so live;
                  is this to live above the world?"
               "It is true; because the soul is all the life that is in man. Let it possess
                  itself in peace, and give one look to the ultimates of progress—  it will know to what all this tumult of to-day is
                  tending."
               At once they were come to the point. Vesta congratulated herself on his marvellous
                  directness, unconscious that Borland, more discerning than Gregorias, had
                  immediately and altogether divined her purpose; that he had seen the anxiety with
                  which she had of late been thinking of Angelo; that he had been also somewhat
                  annoyed by the distrust in him implied thus. And, congratulating herself, when in
                  truth she had little cause for such congratulation, Vesta asked—
               "To what is it tending, Mr. Borland?"
               "To the immaculate idea, Nature. That I have already explained in my 'VISIONS.' If
                  you have read the work, you will understand me. Live in an entire unity with
                  Nature, and you will comprehend all things. Addressing yourself to the great idea,
                  you will find an employment for every power of your intellect. Of memory: for you
                  will go back through it to that point whence you emerged, from the Life, into this
                  present manner of visible being; you will see the great idea, as it was then to
                  you, and the defaced image will come forth in its original purity and perfectness.
                  Of imagination: for the brightest and most radiant creation that you can present
                  to your mind, that is to you the Supreme. Of purpose: for in prayer,
                     by that purpose, you can bring yourself up from the dust of this
                  vain worldliness, into immediate companionship with the Highest. Thought, desire:
                  for in the exercise of each will you find infinite gratification."
               Vesta looked upon him; he was now looking also steadfastly on her, and she met the
                  penetrating gaze with an attempt at penetration that failed: and she asked—
               "But the progress of this age, Mr. Borland: is it significant of nothing?"
               "Yes! it tends all to one ultimate idea. That idea is the perfection of harmony,
                  in other words of Nature, as I said. In strifes, in confusion, fanatics would
                  hasten the issues. But the issues they strive after are inevitable; how strange
                  that they do not know it! Why should they strive? Nature will perform the work of
                  Nature; why should they interfere? A spiritual apprehension of this fact would
                  induce men—yes, and women—to 'lay down their arms and disperse.' They would go
                  back to their homes and workshops, and leave the 'progress' to Nature. Children
                  have before now cried for the sun and the moon, unsatisfied with the toys with
                  which they were already furnished. But neither the sun nor the moon, that I ever
                  heard, paid heed to their crying. And the children grew to manhood and womanhood,
                  and saw then that they would fain have made toys of the POWERS OF THE WORLD! and
                  they were ashamed, and they laughed at their folly. It is so with the criers of
                  the age. They ride their  hobby-horses,
                  and may do so to the death: they will affect nothing. Water will run down hill, in
                  spite of them, with greater velocity than it will across a level plain. The people
                  of Northland will live half the year in natural darkness, enlightened by the oil
                  which must be furnished by their labor and industry: husbandmen, the world over,
                  must plant and reap, or they will starve. The world shall go on in its own way;
                  Nature shall have its own course: and no one need attempt to push the world, or to
                  conquer Nature. Day will be added to day, and night to night, until a year is
                  accomplished—and year will follow year, until Time is a century older. The winds
                  will come, and they will go. The birds will fly from the south to the north, and
                  back again; the trees will bud and bear; the earth will put on its green, and
                  throw it off again. Just so, in a perfect harmony with this Nature, should be the
                  work of man. Everything shall harmonize with it, for it must. Meanwhile"—still
                  more scrutinizingly he looked upon Vesta—"may I venture to speak plainly?—surely I
                  may—I have sometimes thought, Miss Maderon, that you had, influenced in some way,
                  allowed yourself to fall into the ranks of that unfortunate company who are
                  demanding of the world what they shall DO. Now, if I knew this for a fact, I would
                  make bold to address you thus, dear young lady: 'Go out into the fields, and say
                  to some child you shall find gathering flowers, 'Make yourself fit, little one,
                  fit and worthy, to inhale the fragrance of these blossoms; be as bright, as
                  lovely, as calm, as these flowers' .... It would be proper work to do! The secret
                  of all lies in calmness. Go: when you are dissatisfied, restless, impatient,
                  remain alone with Nature—among the mountains, beside the river, or the lake. Look
                  up into the blue and the infinite abysses..... What it is to live, what it is to
                  die, you shall altogether know.'"
               "Then," said Vesta—not a little vexed by a portion of this discourse, yet well
                  concealing her vexation—"if a finger had never been lifted for the accomplishment
                  of any purpose by man's will, the world at this period would have stood in
                  precisely the same position that it holds at present? You attribute no potency
                  whatever to man's intellect?"
               Borland was silent for a moment.
               "That is what I mean," he answered her; "if a striving intellect had never
                  striven, every revelation that is made, had been made. By intuition, had man held
                  himself at peace, he would have learned those great secrets which from time to
                  time evolve, to the amazement of the vulgar. Now they are proclaimed
                  with a great flourish of trumpets, and the 'discoverer' stands possessed of the
                  insane fancy that he has accomplished some wonderful thing. A halo appears to
                  encircle his name; his envious brother covets it, and then he works,
                     desperately perately, to come to
                  like distinction. Wretched folly! All real knowledge that men have is spontaneous:
                  the universe of books is but a stupendous monument that proclaims the stupendous
                  ignorance and folly of the race. In the distractions we permit, nothing is seen,
                  nothing is heard. The man who is as a child in sincerity, and in meekness, is the
                  wise man—is the man who is in nearest relationship to Nature. In crowds no
                  inspiration will come. No deep insight is possible to him around whom rises the
                  suffocating dust of earth. Have the sense to walk away beyond the dust—be clear of
                  it! Go, live with Nature! Hold yourself aloof from every disturbing influence for
                  one day: you will learn more than I can tell you in a twelvemonth. The world, the
                  sane portion of it, is beholding this truth; when it is seen through all the
                  nations, such words as sorrow, pain, distress, want, hunger, fear, will become
                  obsolete—no man will understand them. When the glass-doors of the cupola of this
                  house are closed, you look on the sky, and a great storm seems gathering; the
                  earth lies under a dreadful anticipation of the tempest. But look forth through no
                  colored medium, with your own eyes, there is no longer that prospect! Who shall
                  know of sorrow when the infinite consolations of Nature pervade the soul to the
                  utter extinction of the phantom of sorrow, in which phantom lies all the power
                  thereof? who shall be cognizant of pain, when the balm of Nature is poured through
                  the being, making it healthful altogether? who shall have recollection of distress
                  and want, when the infinite resources of Nature are open, and may be appropriated
                  by all, and yet remain a reservation for all? who shall abide in fear, when the
                  promise of Nature is at the heart, when it speaks from every blade of grass, from
                  every leaf, and flower, and brook, and mountain—ay, from every grave? If you are
                  seeking to learn of me, because some have called me a teacher, Miss
                  Maderon, let me counsel you rather to listen to no human voice. I should be really
                  glad to learn that you were leading the life of a hermit, for a season: for, as I
                  said before, these are things of which none but Nature can teach you."
               Again he said: "You must go to Nature in tranquillity, in simplicity, disclaiming
                  the adverse teachings you have received, breaking allegiance with the customs
                  which have enslaved; a free woman, not a bondwoman.
               "What it is to walk in such royal company I know. I know—and a thousand, if you
                  questioned them, would say the same thing. I know what 
                     it it
                     it
                   is to ask great questions which come involuntarily to the lip—questions
                  on whose answer all high issues hang. I know what it is to ask concerning the love
                  of the human heart, and to receive in answer to that question illumination, not
                  only in regard to that, but to many another mystery: to ask,  as you have asked of me, in regard to human
                  progress, and to hear in reply, as you will also hear, more luminous exposition
                  than the most sanguine progressive has dreamed of. Ask and ye shall find, and your
                  joy also shall be full."
               He had begun now to speak with an impassioned earnestness, and Vesta was listening
                  as earnestly. She asked—
               "Is no 'pang paid down' for the great knowledge—for such as you say you have
                  received?"
               "Yes! a sense of alienation from Nature, of which we must be conscious when we are
                  seeking for a union with Nature! But the soul that would come to such union,
                  without doubt, shall effect it. Among the operators of to-day, who are they that
                  work at the heart of what they call evil, to remove that? Not the noisy
                  declaimers, who might as well beat the air, as strive in the way they do! You
                  know, by the fruit, if the tree is worthy; by the branch, if the root is sound; by
                  society, if mankind is in communion with Nature!
               "The carnal mind, the sensual mind, the selfish soul, the proud, ambitious soul,
                  what a lesson has each to learn; what a purging, as by fire, has each to undergo!
                  The carnal mind, if it would emerge from its ignorance and enslavement, has to see
                  that the individual is but a part of the great and complete whole. The sensual
                  mind has to learn, in a profound repentance that is in self-abnegation, its
                  wretched misconception of the principles even of enjoyment, when it has sought for
                  gratification in ways which enforced their penalty in such manner that a fool
                  might see that what is called a pleasure, is a poison instead. The selfish soul,
                  disgorging ITSELF, must fill the yawning vacuum with the satisfying, unselfish
                  ideal, and not go heaping treasure for its own purse, or lore for its own poor
                  brain, in forgetfulness of every other good or duty. The ambitious soul must be
                  content to fulfil the behests of Nature, and not go following after its own wild
                  courses. Thus shall there be successful associations, new advents, recognitions of
                  rights, millenniums—in such manner as the noisy declaimers of the present time can
                  not comprehend, until the noise is hushed, and the convulsed souls are subdued.
                  There is a 'better time' coming; but those who are laboring for it can no more
                  comprehend what it is to be, or how it is to appear, than can the Hindu heathen
                  tell concerning the history of Messiah, who is the present object of adoration
                  among those who call themselves Christians. The time will come when men,
                  rejuvenated, regenerated, will no longer worship that ideal MAN, but instead, the
                  Truth, NATURE."
               "You spoke of a hermit-life," said Vesta.
               "Is it not a matter of necessity, when one would solve any mighty problem, that he
                  study in loneliness? To pray aright, would you not choose to  withdraw from the confusion of the multitude? To
                  see the distant star, must not your individual eye be applied to the telescope,
                  rather than your ear to the jargon of astronomers and astrologers? Possibly you
                  might hear the voice of Nature, clearly and distinctly, in the midst of tumult;
                  but, to solve her mysteries, will the tumult aid? to discern the depth of her
                  revelations, must you not be with her, alone? The lover proclaims not
                     his secret to his chosen from the housetop, as she passes along
                  beneath in the crowded thoroughfare.... A convulsion is what any man of genius, or
                  of great enthusiasm, can bring to pass. It is what I deplore, that any should aim
                  at convulsion; this foolish, comet-like rushing forward at the suggestion of some
                  extraneous power; this desperate, mad purpose to accomplish something, which
                  always proves to be, NOTHING."
               "You would prove man to be less than nothing."
               "Can I forgive you for that mistake? Less than nothing? He is everything,
                  everything, as soon as he is possessed of Nature! And of that he is possessed when
                  his false self is put away, and his true self, in the unity of Nature, is allowed
                  to take its place. In bondage, he is 'a worm and no man;' but when he delivers
                  himself from the leading-strings of whatever is false in custom, and throws aside
                  the fictions of society, conscious of a deeper want and craving, then takes place
                  the inevitable union! A wretched sentimentalism will turn from one human creature
                  to another, and ask and expect that which the unregenerated can not
                  give. If that sentimentalism gives place to a profound and solemnly-felt want, it
                  will at last (happy day, when that comes to pass!) turn from the misapprehension
                  and dull comprehension of that which it foolishly besought, to the calmness and
                  fulness of Nature. There it shall find satisfaction. Nature shall give up its
                  mysteries to the spirit that shall say to every device of society, and the
                  worldly, 'I want you not—let me go and seek where there is something to
                  find.'"
               "If this theory of life be all, you conceive that man has no duty to perform, but
                  to strive after harmony with Nature, and to live in such unity. There is no duty
                  beside this—no work?"
               "Every word of Nature's creed rebukes the idea. The progressive must merely come
                  to such a study and conception of truth as shall capacitate for labor. Society
                  must be remoulded; old abuses must be done away. How? Not by noisy and windy
                  declamations, and the botchwork of clumsy workmen who are ignorant of the very
                  first laws of building. Society is not a huge concern which a few may monopolize,
                  and reconstruct, for the benefit of the many, with a sharp outlook for individual
                  profit! It is no joint-stock affair after that fashion. We have each our position
                  to occupy, our part to execute, in the great harmonious scale. The horrible  confusion is occasioned by inattention,
                  or want of skill, on the part of those whose duty it is to watch ceaselessly that
                  they may strike the right note at the proper time—not an instant after or before,
                  or they may as well sound it a century after. It is this readiness, this
                  watchfulness, that must be maintained. 'But how,' your eyes are questioning, 'how
                  are the old abuses to be made things of a forgotten day? By knowing and executing
                  our proper part in the great SPIRITUAL, NATURAL HARMONIA. How shall I
                  know what you, as an individual, are to do? how can I know? I confess
                  I know not any more than if you were the queen of some foreign dominion, of whose
                  climate, language, and people, I am in profound ignorance. You best know yourself.
                  I will not believe that you do not, even now, entirely know. Yet how can I tell
                  the words, or the truth, wherewith Nature has chosen to address you? "We stand in
                  complete isolation; we are veiled from each other. I have found myself, in my
                  dealings with others, at fault: I profess to no knowledge of another."
               He said again: "If we took these common-sense views of things more frequently and
                  readily, such ridiculous, absurd questions as of 'rights' in regard to the sexes
                  would not occur; we should not be guilty of confounding dissimilarity and
                  superiority. We should hear no humiliating talk of 'supernumeraries' in such a
                  connection. One star differs from another star in glory. Unfortunately, men
                  misinterpret the word 'glory.' Nature does not esteem the lesser lights less
                  honorable, less precious. The fault, Miss Maderon is not in the stars, but in the
                  world that it does thus compute. Mediocrity in a high place speaks for itself. It
                  will effect what it can—no more. There is dissimilarity. If we were gods, like
                  those of mythology, it would be my place to conquer the kingdom, yours to refine,
                  to exalt, to remodel, and remould—because Nature would impel us to act in these
                  directions. I should see my path; it would lead me to the stronghold of the enemy:
                  and by stratagem and skilful manœuvre, by courage, and speed, and energy, I should
                  make myself master of the land. You would see your path: it would lead you where
                  mighty foes, in another form, must be met. I should, as I said, be the conqueror,
                  and you the civilizer. Not because education impelled you thus, nor because
                  society had taught you: NATURE would need you; you were appointed her
                  prime-minister of cultivation. Idle is the mind that questions with the eternal
                  'if,' whether this or that be not a right, when Nature is continually setting
                  forth the privilege!—idle, because that to which it gives itself must for ever
                  prove a bootless inquiry.—There are earthquakes which change the appearance of a
                  whole region of country: the verdant plain may be submerged, and a rocky surface,
                  hideous and uncouth couth, may take its
                  place. The builder may rejoice thereat, if previously there was a paucity of stone
                  in that neighborhood; but only he who adds to his own fortunes thereby, could
                  rejoice at the change. For, in that meadow, children played; they searched for
                  fruits, and gathered flowers there; rare herbs for healing grew there, which the
                  housewife prized; a pure stream from a living fountain flowed there, of which the
                  traveller might drink to his refreshment. All these are gone. But the mason finds
                  abundance of stone in their place, and he is satisfied. Let the children, and the
                  leach, and the wearied traveller, go farther, look elsewhere for flowers, herbs,
                  and water! ... The talk of 'rights,' so fiercely carried on, Miss Maderon, is
                  merely absurd. It were better if the wronged looked to Nature for a proper
                  adjustment of affairs and powers, rather than to individuals, and a so-called
                  justice."
               As he finished speaking, Borland arose, walked somewhat hastily through the
                  apartment toward the door, and went forth coolly and indifferently, as from the
                  presence of a larger audience than that for which he had spoken. And if, as
                  Gregorias had fancied, it was ever for an instant in his thought to "enlighten"
                  Vesta Maderon, and give to her the place that Margaret for a moment occupied, it
                  was, as he went from this interview, no longer in his thought. He could not love
                  or teach her; for she was not one that could ever be absorbed in the individuality
                  viduality of another! And in the progress of the recorded conversation, he had
                  perceived this fact.
               Long after he had gone, Vesta Maderon remained, seated as he had left her,
                  reflecting on the idea he had left behind him for her contemplation. At last it
                  was with a smile that she said to herself: "He would bid me go into the field, and
                  say to some child I should find there gathering flowers, 'Make yourself worthy to
                  inhale their fragrance, be bright, and calm, and lovely!' Now, what, in the first
                  place, if I happened to find no child engaged in that charming occupation? and
                  what, in the second, if, on my way to the field, I should pass by a dozen little
                  ones that never saw a field-flower, ignorant, filthy frights of sin? I wonder if
                  it would be wise to go on in search of the fairy child, and to leave these to
                  their fate! But lurking under all this strange superstructure is what looks like a
                  good foundation. Mr. Borland might prove a benefit to Abby's mother; his ideas are
                  certainly obscure enough to satisfy even her. He might prove a real evangel to
                  that woman. But what is he going to do with Angelo?" A sudden flush overspread
                  Vesta's face as this thought occurred to her. She looked from the windows; she
                  walked through the room; she opened and shut the library-doors: but not a thought
                  followed that of Angelo, until she heard a step in the gallery. Then she said to
                  herself: "How ill Asia did look when I saw her!  and she spoke so strangely of Blanche—she looked as
                  if she did not believe me when I told her how many times I had been to see her
                  when she was out."
               Blanche entered the room, and Vesta said:—
               "I have formed an opinion: I wish Mr. Borland were a few thousand miles from
                  here."
               "That's no opinion," replied Blanche.
               "The opinion is to follow. I think the great philosopher borders dementation, if
                  he has not indeed gone beyond the border. He has been preaching for my
                  edification, and I am mystified."
               "I think the whole village in a critical state," said Blanche; "look here."
               She held before Vesta a sketch of Asia Phillips.
               "I began this head, and Cousin Aaron took away my pencils, and finished it, you
                  see how. When I laughed at him, he—what do you think he said? That the girl's face
                  fairly haunted him! No wonder—she is such a fright."
               "You can not have seen her of late."
               "That's very true—but why?"
               "She is changed so remarkably; she is a very handsome girl."
               "She paints, I suppose, and curls her hair, and arrays herself gorgeously; she has
                  such a gaudy taste." Blanche laughed, and somewhat nervously.
               "You're absurd—and—not altogether amiable to—day—not altogether in unity with
                  nature, as Mr. Borland might put it. Do you know what he is doing, Blanche? living
                  in entire harmony with nature! If he will only let Angelo alone, I, for one will
                  thank him—on my knees, if he seems to wish it. And he may play his part in the
                  grand harmonia to his heart's content. By-the-way, after all his assertion and
                  declaration, I verily believe he would not object if the universe were prostrate
                  before him, recognising him as the sovereign representative of that sovereign
                  idea, Nature."
               "It seems to me," Blanche began, and then she paused—and then she said: "Vesta, it
                  is getting to be a serious consideration with me, how are we ever to endure this
                  winter at Maderon? I almost wish we were back at school again. Why have none of
                  our friends the politeness to invite us out for the season?"
               "You would really like to be at school again! I can not conceive why. Whenever I
                  want amusement, I take a look at my diploma—such a farcical performance as that of
                  our graduating! And that nonsensical certificate, that we had exhausted all
                  sciences, and philosophies, and languages—oh, it's quite too much! Ha, ha! Poor
                  Judy! you recollect how we trembled lest, in her examination, she should bring
                  eternal disgrace on the whole class. But she has her diploma, too; and so, all's
                  well that ends well. Her part, though—what a comedy of errors it was, from
                  beginning to end! No, I'm  very certain
                  I don't want to graduate again; neither do you. It is n't in my conscience to
                  humbug a community in that way twice."
               "Vesta, Cousin Aaron proposed, last night, that he and I should really go abroad
                  this winter."
               "Cousin Aaron! Hum. Well, and what did you say? I fear, if you don't go, you will
                  become a monomaniac."
               "I believe I declined the gracious invitation—I don't remember. Vesta, what more
                  have you to say of your Abby?"
               "The noblest little creature in the world! Old Weed is a hopeless, irresponsible
                  heathen, or she would have converted him long ago."
               "How can you endure the set? A blessed thing that the baby died. Do you know I
                  think it would be a quite pretty romance if Angelo married that child?"
               "Heavens!" was Vesta's emphatic ejaculation.
               "He talks of her in a very affectionate, lover-like way," responded Blanche: "and,
                  now I think of it, notwithstanding your surprise, my wise one, I believe it would
                  be an excellent thing. If I only could bring myself to it, or had time, I would
                  prove to you how good I can be at match-making; though I think they will manage
                  the affair very well for themselves."
               Vesta was wholly silent; and Blanche said presently:—
               "What is it that you think and won't say?"
               "That I hope and pray the day will some time come, when men and women, boys and
                  girls, may look at each other, and help one another, without being liable to
                  suspicion of matrimonial design."
               "Poh! dear innocent! It never will come—till the day when Mr. Borland's church, as
                  Cousin Aaron calls it, spreads from sea to sea. I believe I shall talk with Angelo
                  about Abby—what a blessed thought! I have been altogether at a loss in
                  conversation with him, when he has been here of late. Now I shall have something
                  to say. He seems to have lost his senses along with the rest of the worthies. And
                  I am getting to be a monomaniac, too, you say? If Gregorias repeats his
                  invitation, I believe I shall accept it."
               "You'll do no such thing—he and Asia, or even he and I, would make a
                  better match!—and I .... Let me see that sketch again, Blanche, if
                  you please. I wish you would give it to me."
               "Only too happy to be rid of it. I'm going now to ride. Take good care of Asia's
                  portrait!"
            
            
               
               XXII. LOVER, OR NOT? ANATHEMA MARANATHA.
               I SAID there was another new thought in the brain of Gregorias. Many new thoughts,
                  in truth, were finding place there. But this which he received when Asia stood
                  before him, referred to her alone.
               She was wasting, as he began to believe, the years of her glorious youth in
                  attendance on a blind old man, and an almost idiotic woman: a new sense of her
                  privations had evidently come to her with overpowering weight: this was the
                  interpretation that he put upon her words. He pitied her sincerely. He had never
                  before come in contact with a character like hers; he had never seen such intense
                  and peculiar pride in any other being. It was a sort of pride that had, for him,
                  an extraordinary charm. It was not the result of conscious or flattered beauty: it
                  sprung from the conviction that she stood, really and truly, by herself—that
                  alone, unaided, it was in her power to leave her name upon the earth—that it was
                  in her power to control and master others—that the sort of influence she would
                  command, was dependent on no such ignoble power as that of gold, or position, but
                  on herself alone. He had more than pity for her, therefore, as well he might have.
                  For her chosen profession, Nature had endowed her. Her career he had prophesied,
                  and he firmly believed his magnificent prophecy. She satisfied his eye: she
                  pleased him in a way that even Blanche, the peerless Blanche, did not: she
                  gratified his ear; her voice was as a well-tuned instrument, to which it was a
                  luxury to listen: so wholly was it under his control, that, on her lips, language
                  seemed to have an entirely new significance. She had touched his heart, if heart
                  he had: he loved her—yea, as he could love, as he might have loved, and as,
                  perhaps, he did love, another and yet another woman, in that same instant. That
                  marvellous voice of hers, that marvellous power of language! Tenderness, passion,
                  pride, meekness, resolution—the spirit of every high emotional power—revealed
                  itself in her words. She was, of all women, the very one who, had she known her
                  power, could have entirely enslaved
                  slaved Aaron Gregorias: she could have made him what she would; but—she knew it
                  not.
               He, at first, had fancied her engrossed by her ART. He identified her with it when
                  he thought upon her: he imagined her intensely absorbed by that alone. But the
                  last interview with his pupil had discovered to him a secret of her heart—he was,
                  alas! the first to discover it for himself and for her. And then that new thought
                  entered his brain; and, after that, he merely believed that he loved
                  her!
               And of that glorious new thought with Asia!
               "Full statured in an hour"—in that hour of his speaking—it leaped the barriers of
                  the heart, and stood clear and full before her. She went from him, but not to a
                  speedy forgetfulness: she had put away the sustaining love that was proffered, but
                  that was only a proud and idle piece of acting. Alone, by herself, at times she
                  leaned upon a thought of that love as it had been a steadfast rock. If she would,
                  in spite of all the Maderons, she might stand out in sight of the people, as his
                  chosen!
               She knew she loved him, when the weary days went by in which she saw him not—when
                  the belief that she had grieved him, in turn began to grieve her. She knew she
                  loved him when even the pages, which had once absorbed her thought, lay as a blank
                  before her, and she dreamed hour after hour, though he had charged her to never
                  dream. She knew she loved him, when she gratefully remembered that he had, as he
                  declared, married her to herself. She knew she loved him, and the shrinking dread
                  that knowledge at first occasioned, gave place to a rapturous gladness, that drove
                  away every recollection, but of him, from her mind. And when she wandered again to
                  the long-deserted schoolroom, no lesson was in her memory, no recollection of
                  sorrow she had known aforetime of slight, or wrong, or trouble. Thinking not of
                  fame or glory, but of him, she went.
               Gregorias had brought an important suit triumphantly to a close. For a time he had
                  worked day and night to effect this triumph, and the speech that he made when the
                  trial came on, won him more than applause in the village, and even far beyond the
                  borders of Maderon. Wherever he went, honor and gratulation met him. While making
                  this great effort, he had almost forgotten his pupil, and the event of their last
                  interview. But, as he went on his way to Maderon house, he saw Asia down beyond
                  the meadow-lands: and then he forgot all about Blanche, and Vesta, and Aunt
                  Agatha. With a thought which the "recording angel" should not blot out for ever
                  from the records of transgression, he followed after her.
               She would be sure not to offer him such praise as had Blanche, who had manifested
                  an interest so unusual in his success. But, he should look upon  those dark and dazzling eyes—and he should speak
                  with Asia: he should see if she had conquered now, after so many days were past,
                  the love she had denied: or, he should see how she would look upon him—if love,
                  still unknown to her, were betraying itself in ways she knew not of. Oh, it was
                  not an unaccountable move when he followed on to overtake her! It was a most
                  natural move for him to make. The lady of fashion must eclipse the splendor of her
                  fashionable rival; the man of ambition must aspire to a height his compeers have
                  not even attempted; the loving heart must make the entire self-sacrifice; the
                  human animal must drain the cup of enjoyment—and what dregs is it content to
                  swallow! so all be exhausted.
               Gregorias walked rapidly, and he soon reached the place where Asia was. When he
                  looked upon her he fancied that he saw traces of recent tears on her face; and he
                  never guessed they might have been happy tears, if she indeed had wept. When he
                  spoke, it was as though their last momentous conversation had never taken
                  place.
               "This will not do," he said; "it will not do at all! How continually you are
                  alone! You have no society whatever."
               "Oh yes, I have society always at home, Mr. Gregorias."
               After a solitude occupied with one thought—of him, since she saw him last—his
                  address struck her as most strange. Immediately she believed that she had been
                  idly walking in a most vain shadow.
               As she spoke, her eyes were averted, and her voice constrained. Gregorias was not
                  yet the master of her moods, and she puzzled him now. He could not tell if she
                  spoke in a hopeless sarcasm, or in measureless content.
               "You are a host in yourself. You are not like others. A most fortunate woman."
               "You think so."
               "I do not think about it—I know it instinctively."
               "You have a marvellous penetration, sir."
               Yes—it was indeed a vain shadow. He had quite forgotten those other words over
                  which she had pondered so long! Asia hated herself at that instant.
               "Concentrated in your life are the lives of a hundred such women as I have seen in
                  fashionable life."
               "Indeed!"
               "Verily and indeed. There is something about you that reminds me of my aunt
                  Agatha." What could his purpose be?
               "That can not be the case," quickly answered she. "I am not naturally cruel and
                  bitter, though I may seem to be so at times. Prosperity could never have the
                  effect on me that it has had on her."
               
               "Nevertheless, you resemble her, as you do also Blanche." She looked
                  up at the naming of that name; but her eyes fell again speedily before the gaze
                  that met them.
               "If I at all know Miss Maderon, I am not in the least like her. I wonder you
                  should think so," she said; then she added abruptly—"for that Heaven be praised! I
                  do not resemble Blanche Maderon."
               "You have said many times that she is proud. If she be indeed so—if she be proud
                  as Lucifer—I know not to what power of the air I should compare you."
               "To none. I am not proud. I am only myself. I am not proud: you have no right to
                  say it."
               "Good! YOURSELF! that is really magnificent! You will come to yourself presently,
                  then, I trust, Asia. Just now you are some stranger with whom I have not the
                  slightest acquaintance. And I have thought sometimes, besides, that you
                  are—are—that you resemble Vesta—Cousin Vesta Maderon."
               "It is unaccountable, this humor you indulge in, Mr. Gregorias. No, no! least of
                  all am I like her. She is an angel, and her life is angelic; and I—I despise
                  myself, and shall for ever, for speaking to her as I have done. I wonder that I
                  did it—that I could; she is so kind and generous. I like her? Do not even compare
                  me with her, Mr. Gregorias, unless you indeed wish to shame me."
               "Are you not 'generous' and 'kind,' and loving, and all-enduring?"
                  Now his voice changed suddenly, and she began dimly to comprehend his speech. "Do
                  you not live the tenderest, most patient, most womanly life, content to do your
                  duty as you do, with all a woman's constancy and love? You, with your grand and
                  mighty soul, that might claim, and make good the claim, to be a leader of
                  intellectual forces in the dramatic world! you, day after day devoting the vigor
                  of your youth to drudging toils, that you may make the happiness of those who have
                  fallen to your care!—if you call Vesta Maderon angelic, as she is now, do you
                  think that, placed in your position, she would have proved a ministering
                  angel?"
               "An infinitely better woman. She would never, for a moment, have rebelled against
                  such fate. She would have been cheerful, and patient, and thankful to God."
               Gregorias passed on from this idle argument to a thought of himself. And again the
                  words of love were on his lips—he spoke to her again of love! Once more he was
                  under a spell, his passion mastered him, and earnestly again he prayed that he
                  might in this great lesson also be her master—that he might teach her heart of
                  that which, he said, alone makes life desirable. And when to all his arguments she
                  replied, actuated by a sudden purpose of her own, "Gregorias, of this you must not
                  teach me"—he groaned—he wept!
               
               Then, to strengthen herself in the new and high resolution she had taken, to
                  convince him that his hope (for now she could not doubt that he did hope)—to
                  convince him that it was to no purpose, she added—
               "I am glad, I do confess, that you find anything to weep for."
               "Is this also the voice of that marvellous pride, cruel, trifling woman?" he
                  replied.
               "My tears have outlasted the night," she said. "The gloom of my heart
                  has come up exultant in the light of the morning. Days, and months, and years,
                  have not exhausted my griefs, and time will not exhaust them. You, Mr. Gregorias,
                  in spite of all you say, are not for an hour dependent on my answer for your joy
                  or your sorrow." A wail as of despair rang through her words.
               "You will have none of my sympathy—you spurn my love. You find your loneliness so
                  full of satisfaction, so very trifling a thing as love is beneath your
                  consideration altogether!" There was something almost sardonic in his tone of
                  voice.
               Asia's face, as he now looked upon it, was dreary in its sadness. There was no
                  fire in the black eyes—the lids were pressed together as with a mighty resolution;
                  the cheek was pale—how careworn did it look, unenlivened by any spirit or
                  emotion!
               "I do not understand you when you speak in this strange way. If—no, I do not
                  understand! You might, possibly, be glad of my dulness. I have told you, time and
                  again, that I am not now looking forward as to the certainty of any future career.
                  Brighter hopes than mine have been crushed in the bud. A cloud overshadows me
                  which I can not penetrate. I am not despondent, I am not in any way given to
                  melancholy; but it is madness to fight against fate, against constant premonitions
                  of evil—and I may not always."
               He was completely reassured. He must not speak of love to her as he had done to
                  others.
               "I could almost wish that I had no knowledge of words with which to comfort you,"
                  said Gregorias; "then I might incline you to think again of a love that you treat
                  so disdainfully. Your gloomy hours of darkness, your sense of profound loneliness
                  and wrongful isolation, the sense of doom which you say hangs over you, is but the
                  natural, inevitable accompaniment, the heritage of genius. How often must I tell
                  you this? Yours is an eminently tragic nature; but the sunniest soul among the
                  gifted has a like provision. It is that which holds the soul in abeyance to higher
                  nature. It will come uncalled, this dark cloud upon the spirit—of its own will it
                  will come—and an explanation will not always follow. This, whether you would have
                  it so or not, is what you are to anticipate. It will accompany you, coming and
                  going as it lists, like the winds of heaven."
               
               "It is not of this I spoke," she almost said, and yet she said it not. She had no
                  need: he read it in her face.
               "Exactly as you treat this mood of mind, you will prove yourself. If it overcomes
                  you, lunacy will follow. If you allow it to be an element of all your thought and
                  doing, you will become a character too sombre, and greatly lose in power and
                  influence thereby. Others may be awed for a time by gloom and despondency; but you
                  must, occasionally, stand from out the shadow. Control it: let it, if you choose,
                  at times seem to master you, yet let it only seem, and you will find a great
                  source of good in what appears now an engulfing evil."
               "You do not understand me," Asia almost said, and yet she said it not. Alas, there
                  was no need!
               "For all that you can say to the contrary, you are fearless when you look to the
                  future. And you are content to look on yourself as alone! You can endure,
                  strong-hearted, glorious girl, to think upon the nights of weeping, the
                  overshadowing cloud, and the days of unshared toil! And yet—human love might
                  mitigate the harshness of all these experiences. You might be so happy, as well as
                  so grand! yes, though you are unwilling to recognise such need, or to confess such
                  possibility!"
               Why failed she then to answer? why did she not answer then? Before the
                  protestations of an idle, purposeless power, that was unsanctified by truth, or
                  charity, or anything approaching to an honest, upright, holy love, poor Asia's
                  heart surrendered!
               Why bent that noble head at length, as if in homage due the honor he had done to
                  speak of love to her? Why, when with a sudden manifestation of his boldness,
                  though he had feigned fear, his arm wound round her, and he drew her toward him,
                  exultant in his victory—and now merely, merely because it
                     was a victory!—why, when he uttered words which involuntarily came
                  forth in whispered tones, because he dared not utter them aloud, why did she not
                  fly away, as if for life? Why, from a consideration of all that concerned the
                  future, was she content to turn and build a house upon the sand, which one wave
                  could make foundationless? Charmed with a fiction of his fancy's creation, why did
                  she remain to hear, when one glance into the future, one look for which she had
                  ample strength of vision, had told her the full sequence—why did she remain to
                  listen to the false renderings he should give?
               Passing strange and powerful art thou, love of the human heart!
               She suffered his vain words, and his arm to sustain her, until the storm of
                  feeling had swept by. Then, indeed, she looked up again, and the face of Nature,
                  humanity, was changed. And Asia read anew the mystery, and fancied that she
                  grasped its  perfect meaning: and on
                  her face was written a story, of her weakness and love alone—not of her pride, or
                  defiance, or intellect, or ambition, but of her human weakness, of her woman-love
                  alone!
               Gregorias had conquered when he cleared monstrous guilt, and found for it a right
                  to go on again into the crowded paths of life, unshackled, unfettered—glorying in
                  victory, and that triumph of his tact, and skill, and eloquence, had won applause
                  for him. Here was a new, sudden triumph: and what would it secure to him? Not
                  dishonor, nor abhorrence, nor contumely—oh, nothing of the kind. It could not
                  blight the prospect of his life! it could not hurl him from the companionship of
                  the pure, or the good, or the innocent! The world's ANATHEMA might be
                     pronounced—but not on him!
               
            
            
               XXIII. ASIA—THE BELOVED.—MILLY.
               THE red leaves of October lay upon the ground; a full October moon was in the sky;
                  a soft October breeze carried the fragrance of the last October flowers past Asia
                  and Gregorias, as, side by side, they went slowly through the Elm-walk, back to
                  the cottage-door. That calm October moonlight was the witness of his vow; it
                  beheld his plighting kiss. Perchance to some regretful and grieved spirit that
                  soft October breeze bore the story of the love, that, now revealed unto itself,
                  stood fair and lustrous in its glory before the conscious heart of Asia. But not
                  of this guessed she.
               Compensated were all the doubts and sorrows of the past. Gregorias indeed loved
                  her! It was not Blanche, it was not Vesta, it was no village-belle in  Maderon, it was herself that he had
                  sought—herself he loved. Ah, that was glorious; but it was her heart, not her
                  pride, that rejoiced for the love's sake!
               And he—oh, he listened very graciously, with wonder and delight, to the words of
                  love called forth from the secret chambers of her soul; he saw the splendid crown
                  love set upon her genius, and even then was fearless; and he dared to lay a kiss
                  upon her forehead with the lips that spoke the vow.
               At the cottage-door he left her. And as an empress, the ruler of a man's destiny,
                  went she in. He had told her that she reigned within his soul: she believed him.
                  He had said words which satisfied the most passionate demand her heart could ever
                  make; and she believed them! She had no reason for disbelief; she had no cause for
                  doubting. She had forgotten now Mrs. Maderon's dark words—they haunted her no
                  longer: had she remembered them, she would have said in answer to her soul— 
                     "I am worthy, for I love him—I am worthy as a queen!"
                  
               
               As Asia stepped across the verandah, her uncle King was standing in the centre of
                  the little parlor. He had been waiting with anxious impatience for her coming; she
                  knew it, by the tone of his voice, when he cried out—
               "O Asia, are you there? have you come?"
               "Yes, uncle. Were you wanting me?"
               Even her voice seemed changed—seemed richer, tenderer, more melodious. But he, so
                  swift to notice every slightest variation in that wondrous voice, had now no
                  thought for it.
               "Asia," he said, "I'm afeared. Is your aunt Milly asleep? Look quick, and tell me.
                  She stopped talking of a sudden, and I was afeared she had got faint, or
                  something."
               Asia went up quickly to the bedside, and for an instant after there was a dead
                  silence in the room. Then Jacob heard her say, "Aunty! aunty!" in a quick and
                  frightened manner. He made his way up to the bedside, and, grasping Asia's arm,
                  cried out—
               "What is it, Asia? Asia! what is the matter?"
               "She has fainted, as you thought, uncle. Wait here a minute, while I bring some
                  water."
               She bathed the death-pale face; she raised the poor old body in her arms; she
                  called aloud, but Milly paid no heed. Still, she was alive, for the heart was
                  beating, but so very, very faintly!—and, bending closely over her, Asia heard her
                  breathe.
               "I wish I could go for the doctor. Shall I leave her, uncle? I fear that aunty is
                  very ill. What shall I do, uncle?"
               "Stay just where you are, Asia. Do what you can; no one can do more than you. The
                  doctor couldn't help her if he was here. He told me what to look for, Wilson did,
                  long ago; after she saw that ghost, it was, at the lake."
               
               The old man stretched forth his arm as he spoke. His hand fell on Milly's head; he
                  pressed it against the worn and pallid cheek; he gently smoothed the gray hair,
                  and felt the closed eyelids of his dying sister.
               "Milly!" he said: his voice was faint and low. So long had his blinded life been
                  bound to that of his poor, weak sister, that he seemed to be losing a portion of
                  himself with her now, when he felt assured that she was dying.
               "Milly!" he repeated in a stronger tone. His aged head bent forward to catch the
                  faintest sound in reply. The affectionate voice found its way into the heart of
                  the poor old soul; love did the work of reviving that Asia could not effect.
               "Is that you, Nathan—no—Jacob? Oh—the waves ain't a roaring
                  now—they're still, and smooth as glass—and there ain't no quailing of
                  the heart for fear!"
               Her eyelids drooped again. Old Jacob supported her in his arms, as he sat upon the
                  bedside. He could not see if she were gazing upon him—if the love wherewith she
                  had loved him for so many years, ever since they had played as children together,
                  were, in this dying hour, beaming from her eyes; he knew not if, in this last
                  extremity, the look of a sane mortal were upon her face. He only felt the faint
                  beating, the convulsive throb of her heart, and then—he knew that she had died.
                  Gently tly he laid her back upon the bed; and, before Asia was aware that all was
                  over, he went groping his way back to the great chair, beside which hers was
                  placed; and, as he dropped into it, he said:—
               "Well, Asia, I'm alone. You've got one miserable old body to look after yet. Poor
                  Milly's gone to her sailor-boy—and her brain is cleared up by this time, I know.
                  Asia, I thank you now, I thank you from my heart, for all your goodness to her. My
                  girl, God will bless you for what you have done—you may depend on that."
               * * * When, after a night's watching, Asia went up to her room, she did not think
                  to lift her eyes to that picture of the MARTYR, which Vesta had given her, when it
                  was removed from the gallery to make room for newer paintings of greater value. In
                  many an hour of despondency and darkness she had gazed upon it. But such was not
                  the necessity of this hour. For the life which she had seen pass away so quietly,
                  she uttered no grievous lamentation: she was not conscious of bereavement. Her
                  duty had been well performed toward that poor creature: there was no reason why
                  she should regret when the lamp of Milly's life had waned, and she had gone to the
                  home which needs no light of sun or candle for ever. It was not a time for grief.
                  The mighty love that was in Asia's heart left no room for any other abiding
                  emotion, or feeling, or thought.
               
               Gently her hands had smoothed the limbs, and covered the lifeless form of Milly,
                  and, through the night, she had kept watch beside her. She had striven then to
                  silence the voice that would make itself heard in her heart—to put away the
                  engrossing idea Gregorias had left there. In the presence of death, she endeavored
                  to subdue the pride of her human hope. But that she might not do. Her endeavor was
                  vain. The dreadful fact of death could not hide the bright vision, nor hush the
                  voice, nor break the charm that bound her.
               Poor Milly, as she lay there stiff and cold, so worn with years and sorrow, seemed
                  glorified to Asia, as she gazed upon her, thinking that it was love that had
                  wrought this work in her; glorified, ay, though the work of love had proved to be
                  a work of desolation.
               She never looked upon the Martyr, nor thought of him that morning; and at night,
                  when she went to her rest, she thought not upon the picture, she looked not upon
                  it. There was another picture in her memory, and a fairer face: the crowned head
                  that the artist had depicted, and the wreath of his prophecy. Yet, for her
                  teacher's love, she thought, as she closed her eyes in slumber, she would even
                  forego that crowning—she would strive not for the wreath. And she slept, and
                  dreamed, and it was still of love: and in that dream she lived when she
                  awakened.
            
            
               XXIV. MADERON'S VISITATION.
               BORLAND was living in Maderon! He was living in a sympathy with Nature so profound
                  that it never could be broken! He would not lift a finger to make a convert to his
                  own belief!—and still, he walked and talked with Angelo, and loved and counselled
                  him! Now, what might all this signify?
               It was not at all needful that he should argue with Angelo; and, if he had any
                  knowledge of human nature, Borland knew this; it was not necessary that he should
                  violently tear away the strongholds of Angelo's faith, and thus "emancipate" him.
                  And this was not Borland's attempt or design: it was not even his wish. When he
                  considered Angelo's profession, and his belief, he said  to himself: "So long as what the boy has accepted
                  suffices him, he is a happy man." But was it probable that the youth, however
                  strong and well-grounded his faith might be, should love another as he loved this
                  man—should be bound to him as he was bound, by ties of gratitude, of pleasant
                  memories, of friendship, and then of brotherly interest; that he should know his
                  intellectual power, his faculty of thought, his sincerity, and his
                  philanthropy—and yet be never conscious of a question in his soul, as to which of
                  them looked with profoundest vision, or clearest judgment, at those things in
                  regard to which "the children of this world" are "wise in their generation"? It
                  was not only improbable—it was with Franklin clearly impossible. As, when he was a
                  boy at school, he went to his tutor with trustful assurance, should he not, must
                  he not, go now? In curiosity he may have inquired of him at first: between two
                  thoughtful minds, in daily communion, things of the deepest moment could but be
                  discussed; and wherein they differed, though Borland never made one effort to
                  enforce his own convictions, what effect could they have, when he left them
                  immovable, as points which could not be disturbed or overthrown—which were because
                  they were, whether the eyes of men beheld, or whether they beheld not? As one
                  fascinated beyond power of escape, Angelo kept no silence; as infatuated as any
                  professed disciple, he could forget his toils, and cares, and duties, as he
                  listened to his teacher. He gave himself up to questionings: his people, his
                  friends, were forgotten in the interest which became more and more absorbing—that
                  surprised him by night, and held him captive by day. He seemed lost in thought
                  when in the society of others: but alone with Borland, he was aroused intensely:
                  with him he could and must speak, and wonder, and question; then he must argue
                  with himself—he must be disturbed and doubtful, and unhappy.
               Except Blanche, who did not forget to rally him in regard to Abby Weed,
                  endeavoring thus to rouse him from the mental stupor which seemed to possess him
                  when he went to Maderon house, none of the family there wished, or dared, to
                  question Angelo about the change that was so manifest in him. Vesta Maderon, when
                  she, for the first and last time, spoke with Mr. Borland at any length, had—with
                  the discerning eyes, not of mere friendship alone—perceived that truth was in
                  Gregorias' words, jestingly said though they were, in regard to the probable
                  effects of Borland's advent in Maderon. What the result would be, of the influence
                  which, so evidently to her mind, he was exerting over Angelo, she dared not think.
                  And Vesta was not the only person who looked with trembling and fear to the result
                  of the struggle that was going on in the mind of the young minister: there was  Mrs. Maderon—and there was little
                  Abby—and these were all!
               It was a day of marvellous things that had fallen upon Maderon.
               Here dwelt the thwarted prophets, who had survived all the "last days" of their
                  appointment, still in the maintenance of their belief—still setting forth a surety
                  of His speedy coming, who, releasing his chosen from the bonds of flesh and sense,
                  should receive them into his glory. Here dwelt their disciples, and among them, as
                  Blanche had said, was the mother of Abby Weed.
               Here, also, had of late arisen those marvellous medial powers, the interpreters of
                  the mysteries of spirit-world to the living of the earth.
               And here now was living Borland, the century's growth—the world's prophet of a new
                  and better covenant!
               With no little indignation had Gregorias declared from time to time, when occasion
                  seemed to demand such speech of him, that Theodore Borland would never strive for
                  influence; that he would never grasp at power; that individual glory, or profit,
                  he despised; that he was not the ambitious or vain-glorious man who would raise
                  even a finger to secure his reward from things of sense and time, though converts
                  to himself might thus be multiplied the world over.
               If this were true that Gregorias said—and true it could not be, though he did
                  himself so believe, and Borland did so declare, and may, also, have believed—still
                  the reformer was a living man, and he was holding fast to his own faith and
                  purpose; and, if to no other mortal, his example was to Angelo as potent as a
                  thousand words could be.
               The thoughtless, the trifling, the ignorant, scouted, many of them, at the
                  wondrous revelations of the wondrous Maderon mediums—at their revelations from the
                  living to the dead! and more especially when Mrs. Weed, whose name was become a
                  by-word among the people, was known to be of the first of the medial
                  operators.
               Borland, in the position he assumed, stood quite alone. In this respect, perhaps,
                  the most thoughtful and wisest man of that village, an earnest watcher of all that
                  was done, a patient and curious listener to the deep things declared; far from
                  proclaiming his belief, and yet slow to confess his disbelief concerning the
                  strange mystery. If it were an evolution of nature, or of empiricism, he would not
                  say. What he thought was unrevealed. He reposed in his observation, while the
                  tumult raged around him, studying the mystery, waiting the event.
               His example here had a mighty influence. And do you call Angelo Franklin the
                  weakest, and vainest, and idlest of men, because he felt the influence of
                     that example? No man had ever thought to call him weak, or vain,
                  or trifling. He was a  youth of
                  undisputed promise, a good and righteous man.
               It seemed to him that he had a right—nay, that it was his duty—to look into the
                  mystery which evidently had confounded Borland: it might be his to explain it
                  away, and bring his people thus back to sanity. The facts had a foundation beyond
                  his ken or penetration; and Franklin was the last who could look with impunity on
                  a mystery like this. It finished the work for him.
               His excitable nervous temperament, his imagination, even his faith was not
                  unshaken, when he listened, and beheld the effects produced by the revelations
                  made for others. But when to himself Margaret and his mother spoke!....
               Gregorias might trifle and laugh at the whole affair; he might quote upon the
                  wondering:— 
                     
                        "Oftentimes, to win us to our harm,
                        The instruments of darkness tell us truths;
                        Win us with honest trifles to betray us
                        In deepest sequence;"
                     
                   he might conclude his quotations by saying that the work was devilish, and "a
                  modern ecstasy,"—but he could not laugh away the marvellous dread and doubt from
                  Franklin's contemplation.
               It was strange that Borland, with all his foresight, did not foresee a result
                  inevitable in Angelo. It was strange that, in his own contemplations of this new
                  development, he lost sight of all its tendencies. And, if he took not an extended
                  view of the subject, it was still marvellous that he should misconstrue the dire
                  influence under which this youth was laboring. It was strange that a mere idea
                  should have so entirely absorbed him, that he had no thought for that sad fact to
                  which two loving hearts in Maderon, if no more, were thoroughly alive.
               It was strange that while Vesta Maderon in her luxurious boudoir prayed that
                  Angelo might not be led into temptation, that he might be delivered from all evil,
                  and asked it as for herself, knowing full well that as her life, so was he to her;
                  it was passing strange that while Abby Weed, the child of sorrow, tears, and
                  prayers, and toil, should observe the mighty change that, day by day, to her eyes
                  became more evident—that, while she (striving to live in accordance with the
                  truths that he had taught her, endeavoring to be in daily life what he had bidden
                  her) beheld this change, this shrinking back from duty, this groaning under the
                  cross he bore, this quailing of his heart, this ugly doubt darkening and deepening
                  in his brain—that while she saw, and likewise did beseech for him as she went
                  about her daily tasks, as she lay down at night, as she dreamed in her sleep, as
                  she wakened at morning, never, never losing sight of him, whatever the presence of
                  trouble or care—it was passing strange that while these loving hearts were so
                  apprehensive of some dire calamity, Borland land, who also loved Angelo well—with a love that
                  he had for no other being—should have been, with all his marvellous vision, so
                  exceeding blind—with all his wondrous wisdom, so exceeding dull!
               Gradually, yet surely, though almost altogether unobserved, save in the manner
                  mentioned, the event came to its issue—its lawful, and, with Angelo, its
                  inevitable issue.
               Borland was living in entire harmony with Nature, he had said! He knew the results
                  of all these works of progress; so he said! His work was done, he said!
               He might have suspected the truth of these assertions: there was ground for such
                  suspicion, assuredly, when once more, as at the death of Margaret, all his plans
                  and purposes changed suddenly.
               He had come to Maderon to do no work; solemnly he would have declared, had need
                  been, he had wrought no work there!
               He had, indeed, refrained from argument; he had never with irreverence battled
                  with, or made light of, Angelo's faith. Yet he had needed to be spiritually blind
                  in order to remain in ignorance of the revolution which, almost from the day of
                  his coming to Maderon, had gone forward in Angelo's soul: and Borland was not
                  blind!
               He knew the elements of life were warring there. He knew, though Angelo said it
                  not, as perfectly as if he had confessed it, that anguish, and agony, and dreadful
                  fear, were there. He watched the progress toward emancipation: he was certain that
                  the sovereign idea, Nature, would soon make for him a revelation; that Angelo
                  would take an extraordinary step, and then for ever be at peace He had no fear for
                  Angelo!
               It was while the tumult still lasted, before that anticipated LIGHT OF NATURE had
                  triumphed over the LIGHT OF REVELATION, that the message came which called Borland
                  from his solitude to the charge of the Spiritual Church of Nature, whose
                  foundation he had laid. At last the time was ready for its prophet, its evangel.
                  How came that call to him?..... It rang through his being like the blast of a
                  trumpet! it took him, wrapped away though he was in his tranquillity, as by storm;
                  and then he was prepared to go, and, in obedience to the call, to labor—he, whose
                  work was done!
               How did he reconcile the irreconcilable points of his career, and belief? The time
                  was come for him to strike his note in the great Harmonia: not a moment was to be
                  lost. He had done his first-appointed work; but Nature had commissioned him to a
                  double task! Therefore he went swiftly from the place of his sojourning out into
                  the world—back into the world.
               But where he went—or what became of him—that another time and record must
                  declare.
               We have done with him, for he had done his work in Maderon.
            
            
               
               XXV. ANGELO AND ABBY.
               THOUGH wretched, and doubting, and tempest-tossed, while Borland remained with
                  him, Angelo felt that, while he did remain, there was a strong human arm on which
                  to lean.
               But when his brother had departed; when such support was withdrawn as might be
                  derived from contemplations of the strong man in the glory of his strength; when
                  the deep, tranquil, passionless voice sounded no more in his ear; when the
                  glancing of Borland's watchful eye, removed, held him no longer in
                  abeyance—conscious of utter helplessness, Angelo fled away from himself, even in
                  the formation of the new resolution taken immediately on Borland's departure; he
                  fled away from Maderon house, from all that could have counselled, even
                  there—throwing himself, as if for safety and protection, at the feet of Abby Weed!
                  Now, will you unwisely say that he was himself a child?
               In regard to his new resolution, Angelo had made a confidant of none: he dared
                  not. Though firm in his purpose, he felt he was not strong to combat with the
                  loving, prayerful, astonished, and perhaps angry arguments, which would, in every
                  direction, meet him. Though it was his purpose to at once act on that resolution,
                  he communicated it to no human being. Even Borland was unaware of it—unaware, if
                  he indeed had not guessed what the result of the convulsion to which
                  Angelo had been subjected, would be. Do you think he had not guessed?
               He who had guided and instructed Abby in the ways of truth, brought her to a
                  knowledge of sustaining grace, delivered her from error, superstition, or a too
                  weak reliance on the judgments and perversities of human intellects; he whose
                  words and deeds had been to her, when she walked in desolate places, as a lamp to
                  her feet, a light to her path, and a staff to uphold her—went, in the hour of his
                  own great calamity, to listen to such words as she might find to say!
               Abby was living now alone with her father—alone, as she had done since the little
                  baby died—and her mother had departed on her mission from  Maderon. She was laboring for him, and unawares she
                  was also laboring with him; for he had been worse than even the
                  "bundle of worthlessness" which Angelo had named him, if a sense of his
                  infirmities, a loathing of his weaknesses, had not aroused him, and shamed him,
                  before the devotion and exertion of his child. In the daytime she had her little
                  school, and the writing with which Gregorias continued to supply her; and in the
                  evening she rarely left her father's side. Sometimes she read to him, sometimes
                  she talked to him, and he began to arouse under these influences, from his wicked
                  and disgraceful stupefaction. Oftentimes Angelo would spend an hour with them in
                  the lowly parlor of the quiet, whitewashed house. It had been his custom to do so
                  often while the mother was at home; and even after distractions came upon his
                  mind, and wrestled with him as an armed man, he did not forget these pastoral, or
                  rather brotherly, or, perhaps still more to the point, these loverly visits.
                  Though no lover-conversation, at least not such as is put down for beguilement of
                  the unwary in romances, ever went on between the young preacher and the childly
                  Abby.
               When, burdened with his momentous determination, Angelo went, as he said in his
                  heart, for the last time to the humble dwelling-place over the way, he found that
                  Weed was sleeping, and Abby reading to him. He entered the house without an
                  admonitory knock at the door; he heard her reading in the dreamy monotone, the
                  dreary monotone of a weary and distracted heart, and he spoke out with a startling
                  abruptness that frightened her—
               "Come out into the open air; I want you."
               Abby arose at once to obey him; but as she brought her bonnet and shawl, she
                  said—
               "I must not go far, Mr. Franklin, for father may wake up, and I do n't want him to
                  think I would leave him. I do not often."
               He seemed not to hear what she said. Taking her shawl from her hands, he laid it
                  hurriedly over Abby, and exclaimed—
               "Come! we will make haste! What I say to you I must say quickly. I have no time to
                  lose—come on!"
               He had taken her hand; he led her rapidly away. Surprised and troubled—for she
                  feared that some great calamity, which she had thought might come upon him, had
                  come—Abby went on silently with Angelo.
               "I'm in great haste," he said again; "I told you that I was: I only want you with
                  me for a minute. What I wish to say to you now is, that... that I have a great
                  respect, a very great respect for you, little Abby.... child, you must have
                  noticed that, since my first acquaintance with you, I have had a great respect for
                  you."
               It may have been the rapid pace at which they  walked that made little Abby breathless: she gave
                  no reply whatever.
               "Abby, if you were to go to-morrow, and do something that was very strange indeed,
                  unaccountable—which no one could account for—what do you think I
                  should say about it?"
               "Oh.... I don't know," she stammered, for he waited her reply; and while she
                  hesitated, he slackened his pace.
               "I will tell you: I should say that I had never known any evil thing of you, and
                  that there was probably nothing about your conduct so very mysterious—nothing that
                  you could not, by a single word, make clear. I should know that, for some reason,
                  you thought it best to not say that word. And I should be sure to say so to
                  others, who do not understand you as well as I do. Now, if to-morrow, or next
                  week, or at any time, you should hear anything of me that seemed
                  strange, unaccountable, and all the people in the village should become, on
                  account of it, exceedingly mad against me—what should you think and say, dear
                  Abby?"
               He had appealed to her beseechingly, and with all the intensity of devotion. As he
                  spoke, he hurried her on at the same speed as before.
               "I should say the same thing that you would of me, Mr. Franklin; I should know
                  that in a little while all would be straight and plain. I should believe nothing
                  wrong of you, sir."
               She spoke it frankly, with a simple earnestness that mightily assured him; and he
                  went on to say—
               "O Abby, would it grieve you to hear them speaking evil and slanderous things
                  against your brother? would it really grieve you in your heart? would it make you
                  weep?"
               Impatiently he waited her reply; but the little creature, clinging to his arm,
                  replied not with words. A sob broke from the heart that was trying to be so
                  courageous and brave for his sake: when she would have spoken very valiantly, the
                  child-fear and sorrow had conquered, and she could only sob!—it was his answer. He
                  stood still then, and looked upon her; and he exclaimed—
               "My dear little sister, you are weeping! and it is I who have made you weep! It is
                  true, then, that there are those in this world, that there is one, whom I can make
                  miserable. O great Heaven!—Abby, my hasty words have made you weep, when I have
                  thought so many times how glad I should be if I could sometime wipe away all your
                  tears, and make you very happy! Abby, little Abby, I have made up my mind to do a
                  great thing; and if I had not resolved to do it, I would say to you here to-night,
                  young as you are—for you are wise, and not a child, only in years—that I have
                  loved you better than as a sister; that I have carried you in my heart day and
                  night, and strengthened myself with the thought of you! I would tell you  that it was once my desire to say
                  something to you about this great love, and to beseech you, if need be, upon my
                  knees, to listen to me with a kind and favorable ear. But now, oh, I must not say
                  it to you—I must ask nothing of you; because, when men revile and upbraid me, you
                  would feel it was your duty to stand among them, rather than with me! You would be
                  vexed, and grieved, and troubled, more than you ever shall be by word or act of
                  mine. No! of my doings let them say what they will—none shall blame me for
                  beguiling you, poor child!—they shall not say that I have trifled with a heart
                  like yours, dear Abby. So ..... all that I have brought you here to say to you
                  to-night is this I'm going to say now: Good-bye! It is not likely that you will
                  ever hear me speaking to you again. But remember, Abby—oh, remember, that—"
               As if struck down by a mortal blow, she shrank from his side to the ground. She
                  hid her face in her hands; and the reedlike form swaying to and fro, the gush of
                  bitter tears, the sobs she could not smother, told—what no words could say—that,
                  of all that she had borne, this last grief was the most terrible of all.
               Angelo, too, was overpowered for an instant by this unanticipated effect of his
                  words: twice he attempted to speak—in vain; then by a great effort he
                  exclaimed—
               "In the name of Heaven, stand up, and let me look upon your face again, Abby!
                  Abby!"
               At first she made no sign that the words had reached her heart; but presently she
                  stood up, and tried mightily to look upon, and listen to him, calmly.
               "Could you, for my sake, bear one sorrow, one trial, one privation?" he asked with
                  solemn distinctness, as though propounding some fateful question at the altar of
                  God. She was silent, and he spoke again:—
               "Could you, could you believe that I was a true and a good man, when
                  others called me false and evil?"
               "Oh, Mr. Franklin, let me go back home! I do not know what to say. I am
                  afraid!"
               "Child—dear little Abby, precious child, I do not wonder: I have no right to
                  frighten you in this way, or to seek from you now one assurance of affection. I
                  will lead you back, and leave you in a safe place, your own home, where you can be
                  with your father; he can care for you better than I."
               He took her hand—he had fought a fearful battle, and he thought it was now all
                  over—he stepped forward, but then he paused again: it was a hard thing that he
                  demanded of his heart. He looked down upon her, and she met his glance, and said
                  with sudden energy—
               "Mr. Franklin, I do trust you—and I should,  whatever happened—I know I should. I know I always
                  shall." And then she added, solemnly, in sacred words: "'Thou hast instructed
                  many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands; thy words have upholden many,
                  thou hast strengthened the feeble: but now it is come upon thee, and thou
                  faintest! it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled!' It ought not to be so."
               It was enough; he understood her; and subdued was the voice that asked then—
               "Abby, perhaps there may come a time when I should be happy if I could only show
                  the world my deathless love for you. If I might ask you then, as a good man, to do
                  so, would you dare to prove your faith in me?"
               "Yes."
               It was only a whispered, faltering word, but a clarion-note had not sounded more
                  clearly in Angelo's ear.
               "You will certainly be at the church to-morrow, my little Abby—my wife—my darling,
                  darling wife?" he exclaimed.
               "Yes."
               It was still but a whispered word, yet it was as an oath to both of them. Then
                  Angelo walked on quietly and in perfect silence with her, until they came back to
                  the little whitewashed house on the border of the street; and there he left her,
                  as Gregorias had left Asia, his kiss upon her lip.... Poor children! weary were
                  the long, dark hours of the night that followed that strange interview; no
                  gorgeous dreams awaited them, for neither of them slept. In anguish
                  that was almost remorse, Angelo brooded over the declaration he had made; and to
                  Abby love had come as every other revelation that life had made for her—even love
                  shone only as faint starlight through the gathering storm-clouds of heaven!
               And the next day was the Sabbath—a bright, clear, wintry day—a silent, winter
                  Sabbath.
               With the first stroke of the church-bell, little Abby left her father's house, and
                  went up through the frozen path to the house of God. A heavy weight of fear lay on
                  her heart, for with strange words, that aroused a dark foreboding, he had bidden
                  her go there; still she went steadily, rapidly on, and entered the church, in
                  which but few as yet were gathered, and took her accustomed place there, in a
                  distant corner, among the seats that were ranged about the stove for the benefit
                  of the poor and the old.
               The farmers, who came earlier than the village-folk, stood, many of them, warming
                  themselves in that corner of the church when Abby went in, talking of their
                  preacher, of the weather, and of their families, in a subdued and reverent way,
                  until the people began to gather in greater numbers, when they dispersed to their
                  several pews; and the bell  began to
                  toll, and then the lingerers, one by one, strolled in. Asia
                  Phillips was there, in a seat not far from Abby; and nearer the pulpit sat the
                  great family of Maderon, the friends of Angelo, and Aaron Gregorias. To Abby it
                  seemed as if all the village and country were there that day. It troubled and
                  excited her to see so many assembling together; for she knew that something
                  strange, and she feared that something awful, was about to happen. And what sort
                  of verdict would this crowd render to the happening?
               Only three old men sat with Abby by the stove. Once or twice when the people went
                  from the warm place to their seats, she looked up and around anxiously, as if
                  longing to see a woman near, beside her. But there was none, and again she covered
                  her face with her hands; and while the organist played the voluntary, whether she
                  prayed, or if she only strove to hide the sadness of her face from curious eyes, I
                  can not tell.
               But when at last she heard him coming, when Angelo the minister came in, she
                  looked up once more, though it was only for an instant; but her heart had learned
                  in that swift glance that the storm was indeed about to fall. At first, when she
                  saw him thus, pale, excited, and that strange glare in his eye, she started to her
                  feet. What wild thing would she do? Oh, she would do nothing: she was well
                  schooled in trouble; it was not her privilege to fly wildly from the
                  face of grief, as though it were an apparition. But, half fainting, she sat again;
                  and if the three old men noticed her motion, they thought it was a child's
                  testimony of respect for the young preacher they all loved so well.
               The minister went up the church-aisle; he passed into the chancel. But he went no
                  farther. Not into the pulpit, as was his custom—but at the table he paused; and
                  the eyes of the congregation were fixed upon their pastor. They said, some of
                  them, in their kindly hearts, "He is ill, and will not preach to-day."
               He looked paler than usual, but determined, and firm of purpose, as he stood
                  there, one hand resting on the unopened hymn-book, and the other raised toward the
                  congregation. He strove to speak, at first in vain, but then the words burst
                  forth, the stronger and clearer for the impediment they had met; and where his
                  prayers were wont to go forth to God, a petition, though he meant it not as such,
                  broke on the ear of the people:—
               "This is the Sabbath-day," he said, "and you are come here to worship. If I were a
                  base coward, I would conduct these services to-day, as I have done heretofore. But
                  I am not a coward, and I will not deceive you. And, therefore, I do conjure you,
                  choose you another man to come in and go out before you, and be your minister, to
                  counsel, and entreat, and warn you, to supplicate your God for you,  for I can do it no more. Here, in
                  presence of you all, I renounce my profession, and resign my charge!"
               At the first sound of his voice, Abby Weed had looked up, and, while he spoke, her
                  eyes were fixed upon him. In the dead silence that followed his words, Angelo
                  moved from the chancel, walked down the church-aisle, passed from the sanctuary.
                  For a moment not another sound was heard; then Abby Weed arose, and she too went
                  forth, and joined him!
               He saw her not, he heard her not, until she grasped his hand, and whispered—
               "I am here, Mr. Franklin."
               As though he were a drowning man, and that little hand his only hope of life, he
                  held it in his own, repeating to himself, "It is over," many times.
               "Is it mine? is it mine?" he cried, doubtingly, wonderingly, as she continued to
                  walk steadily and quietly beside him.
               And she answered him, "For ever!"
            
            
               XXVI. ASIA AND HER MOTHER.
               TEMPTED—fallen—"lost"!.... Happy, trustful, and by her trust defiant, and through
                  her love made glorious!.... Cast down, tormented, destroyed!—A worm in the dust at
                  last! Poor Asia!—
               "Uncle, tell me of my mother."
               The snow had vanished from the earth; the rain poured down in torrents, as it had
                  done nearly all the day, and through its later hours the bereaved old Jacob had
                  dozed quietly, Asia sitting with him, but forgetful of him. How often had she been
                  forgetful of him, of all except Gregorias, since she had learned to love! But it
                  was not love that had made her forgetful to-day.
               Ten tranquil years could not have imparted to  her face a look of care and weariness like that it
                  wore this even. Early in the week, and earlier in that very day, a milder story
                  had been traced there; but the hours that succeeded the morning had not been
                  vainly employed; and she, sitting there, listening to the ticking of the clock,
                  the falling of the rain, had become thus calm, and the forgetfulness had
                  passed.
               Poor Asia, whom we left so happy and exultant in the beautiful time of October! It
                  is more than mid-winter now!
               "Uncle tell me of my mother."
               The demand seemed completely to arouse the old man from his dozing.
               "Why, my girl," he said, "I have told you of her at least a hundred times."
               "Ah, but dear uncle, you know that you have only told me the first words of the
                  story—the introduction. Why, why, why did you never let me call you
                  grandfather, instead of uncle?"
               There she remained, quietly seated beside the table, speaking with only a slight
                  emphasis, and her voice was firm. He could not see her for his blindness; he only
                  heard the words she spoke.
               Ah, only! He only knew she had discovered that which through more than fifteen
                  years he had prayed she might never know!
               He saw not how the knowledge had affected her. He could not judge by the
                  intonations of her voice. But she could see. And she beheld his
                  sudden start when she spoke, the convulsive leap in his chair, and the pallor that
                  came over his face, as he lifted his hand, and pushed back the gray hair from his
                  forehead: all this she saw—not a movement on his part, not a change in his
                  appearance, escaped her.
               "Come here," he said: "come here, Asia."
               She obeyed—not entirely without alarm, for he spoke so quickly and so strangely,
                  that she feared some evil had come upon him. He drew her toward him; he passed his
                  fingers rapidly across her face, and said, leaning back in his chair again—
               "Sit down, Asia—sit down, child. Your eyes are dry, your cheek is cool; you speak
                  calm— 'cause you feel so, don't you? Tell me how you heard about it, and tell me
                  what you heard, Asia."
               "All! hum. Grandpa', all? It's a long story."
               "Long!" he ejaculated; "so 'tis. Would you be able to tell it to me? Have you got
                  the strength?"
               "Have you the strength to hear me?"
               "I hain't thought on't for days; years, I was going to say. Not many times, at any
                  rate, since you grew up to be a woman. Well, yes, tell it, Asia. Very like you
                  haven't got the truth." He tried to console himself thinking this; yet a most
                  anxious expression was that which shadowed the old face turned toward her.
               "No, dear grandfather. I am not going to tell it  to you. We both know it all—near enough to the
                  truth, I dare say. I only wanted to let you know what I know, so that
                  you might be sure to understand all about how grateful I am to you. You lost your
                  sight for me. You would never have had that cruel sickness but for me. Oh,
                  grandpa'! I must be better eyes for you. Would to God I might, by some sacrifice,
                  bring back your sight! Oh, if I might only die for you!"
               He knew it not, but if she could have died that instant—for her own sake, not for
                  his—Asia Phillips would have done so.
               "Asia dear," he said very tenderly, "you have always been the sight of my eyes—you
                  have been eyes to me—just as good—every bit and grain as good. A brighter pair, a
                  prettier pair, I'm sure, than I owned afore I got blind. But you mustn't say, my
                  dear, that I lost the sight for you. That is clear agin the truth. It was God's
                  will that I should lose it, or I shouldn't."
               "If you hadn't taken that awful journey, and gone, and gone, and gone, never
                  taking rest for the sole of your foot, till your purpose was accomplished—oh, you
                  would have had a different old age from this!"
               "Asia, I shouldn't have had you!" he exclaimed, in a
                  half-reproachful, half-triumphant way.
               "You wouldn't have been left here to see through my eyes, that have been so often
                  shut when you wanted them to see—so many times away when you wanted them
                  here."
               "How did you find it out?" he asked quietly, after a little hesitation.
               "I read it, grandfather.
               "But how did you know it?"
               "By the way it read, grandfather."
               "Was it in an old paper, the Intelligencer?" He named the year, the
                  volume, and the number of the volume.
               "Yes, it was all so."
               Very faintly did she speak. Had the old man looked on his heroic Asia then!
               Never but once, in his long life, had he seen a picture of such
                     misery—but once, and then it was a sense of guilt that made the
                  scene far more harrowing. Now it was despair, instead of guilt; and well for
                  him—the good and kind old creature—was it, that he could not see the counterpart
                  of that dreadful picture, which had been for years the saddest of his
                  recollections, in this young life before him, so blasted, so struck down by the
                  confirmation of her worst fear and dread.
               A week ago she had read this wretched memorial, which was laid carefully away with
                  the most precious of the old man's goods. She had brought it to light without a
                  suspicion that its contents could possibly affect her. She had read it, and she
                  remembered Mrs. Maderon's evil words! and,  from the moment of that reading, a belief had been
                  tormenting her, driving her to the verge of insanity. And, on this night, it was
                  quite beyond her power to combat with the desire to know the truth.
               Bitter and blasting had the knowledge proved. And now, given over, as it would
                  seem, to the most evil of the powers of darkness, Asia Phillips thought upon
                  Gregorias! And with loathing and disgust she contemplated the idea that had seemed
                  so divine, the aspiration she had thought so noble.
               She had fallen, as another had before her!.... so was she lost—lost to love and
                  hope!
               And what, after all, had that idea and aspiration proved to be? A base, inherited
                  passion, her curse and her disgrace. And for this she had thought, and dreamed,
                  and labored—only to cherish in her heart and brain a viper of the seed of that
                  fell evil which had stung her mother to death!......
               "Visiting the iniquity of the parents upon the children, even unto the third and
                  fourth generation."......
               Awful is that hour, in the history of human trial, when a high hope stands abashed
                  in the presence of its debased originator, to the marvel and the horror of the
                  hopeful. Awful that hour when a brave soul is left impotent and helpless as a
                  child, looking with a contempt, so pitiful, on all that is acknowledged great and
                  good.
               When Jacob spoke again to Asia, she had become come outwardly calm, and, as it
                  seemed, indifferent, to that of which they had spoken. She could now, once more,
                  readily reply to him, and not betray the anguish to which, unknown to him, she had
                  for a moment given way.
               "Asia," he said, "I have often thought that you were like your dear mother. Your
                  voice is like hers—I think you must look like her. But you are different. You are
                  much stronger: I know that, for I've been on the look-out to learn it. Oh, it has
                  made me glad to learn it, you may depend. You are, besides, older than she was
                  when she went away. My child, how I've loved you! I'm a foolish old man; but you
                  are the light of my eyes. God bless you for that!"
               "Grandfather ... is it so easy to forgive?"
               "To forgive? What is that you mean, child? I have nothing to forgive.
                  Maybe I was troubled a bit. Maybe, when I took vengeance into my own hands, I did
                  what wasn't pleasant in the sight of the Lord. But he has forgive me for it. He
                  did that at the very time of my offending. I know he did, for I've never felt as
                  if I was a living under his displeasure. He corrected me. Yes, I believe
                     that. He reproved me, taking away my sight. But then he made you
                  to be the light of my eyes, as I said before—he did not suffer my foolish heart to
                  be darkened. That has allers seen the light, and you've grown up such a good,
                  noble girl! Sometimes times blind
                  folks' eyes are opened, and their sight comes again, just as death is at hand.
                  Maybe this will be my case. I hope so: then I shall see you near me; for that, I
                  do pray my heavenly Father. Yet I am willing that it should all be as seems best
                  to him. Asia .... do you ever—ever feel as if it might have been better, after
                  all, if I had been sent to the asylum when Mrs. Maderon spoke of it, and you
                  wouldn't let me go! I've been an awful bother and care: oh yes, I know I have.
                  You'd 'a' had a better time if you had gone to live up there to the house, when he
                  so kindly wanted you."
               "Never! never! Grandpa', I have never thought it—I take Heaven to witness that I
                  never have! What a wretch if I did!"
               "That is just you, dear Asia, my little, dear girl!"
               "Not little, grandpa'; I am a tall woman, now; and a woman can love better than a
                  child can."
               But, as she said the words, a chilling weight fell on the heart of Asia; another
                  word she could not speak; and, in desperate haste, she arose and went away from
                  him.
               To know that what had seemed a noble aspiration might be traced to a most ignoble
                  source; to bear dishonor from which there was no possible escape; to writhe under
                  a sense of incapacity, such as she had not known when Gregorias had cheered and
                  upheld her; to stop suddenly at the outset of a race for which strength had been
                  garnered, and hopes renewed; to lie prostrate in humiliation, hidden, in the hour
                  of that humiliation, from him who might have soothed, and her who would have
                  strengthened, knowing that now, indeed, all was forfeited; to wrestle blindly with
                  nature, mistaking that for the weakness of a womanhood which she would so gladly
                  have forgone, and disowned, had it been possible; to battle with the love of her
                  human heart; to stifle it, that she might think of confession and of death,—was it
                  for this, the pining and lamentation, the weariness and sinfulness, that Asia
                  Phillips went henceforth, in her fancy, plodding through her daily tasks, the
                  slave of daily toil, rather than its conqueror, as hitherto?
               Well was it for her and for him, in the days of darkness and temptation succeeding
                  this discovery, she had made, that the old man saw her not. Well for him that her
                  voice was still strong to conceal her inmost thoughts from him.
               The discovery which he had trusted might never be made, was made. No gossiping
                  villager had made it for her, she had made it for herself. She had learned it with
                  heroic fortitude, he thought—had received the knowledge calmly, and still kept a
                  thought of gratitude for him. This was Jacob King's happy belief. He saw not Asia
                  when she read the atrocious story over and over, till every  word was impressed upon her memory, as with hot
                  iron.
               Assisted by that newspaper tale, she thought upon her mother .. Her mother! A
                  woman yet so young, dead and in her grave before her eighteenth summer; her
                  mother, the daughter of a gardener—a cheerful, gay, and pretty girl, whose black
                  eye was like an Andalusian's in its lustrous fulness—a girl, lovely in form as in
                  feature, who had stood at the garden-gate—that very garden-gate!—watching, as the
                  gay cavalcade of the travelling amphitheatre went by ... Of the wanton eyes that
                  looked, and beheld her beauty—of the wretched, sordid heart that rested not, day
                  and night, until, lured away from the home of safety and affection, she joined the
                  strolling company!
               For what? To attire herself in the spangled and gaudy garments; to array her
                  maiden beauty in the mask of paint and of shamelessness: to dance on the flying
                  horse; to smile on, and jest with, the gathered rabble; to exhaust herself for the
                  winning of their applause; to parodize grace and fashion; to sing in the noisome
                  tent at night, with the same sweet voice that had oftentimes echoed through this
                  cottage-home; to live, in the hours of retirement from such public
                  life, amid those lost companions! Oh, thought of horror and of desperation! This
                  had been the career of her mother—of her who had slept in that quiet chamber, and
                  dreamed her maiden dreams there—of her to whose eyes each path and view in Maderon
                  was as familiar as to the eyes of her child—of the girl who had been the darling
                  of the old gardener's heart!
               Often, as she read the infamous tale, would Asia turn to the succeeding noble
                  passages which narrated how the father of the poor girl, the glorious old man,
                  went out on the dreary search that was continued, but with no success, through
                  many and many a day. How at last, when the months of travel might be divided into
                  years, he had gone one night with a crowd to see the famous and beautiful
                  horsewoman, actuated still by the hope that had survived so many disappointments.
                  How, when the applause rang high, the stillness of death seemed to settle down
                  upon his soul. How, through every disguise, he saw and knew his child. How, in the
                  fury of an ungovernable passion, he had brought to sudden death the keeper who
                  lured and bound her to a fate like this. How he had borne away the rescued pride
                  and glory of the ring, and, with her in his arms, had gone instantly and given
                  himself into the hands of justice.
               How justice did protect him. How the hapless mother died. How the old man's
                  blindness fell upon him ... She read it all—she who was the heir of that wild
                  history!
               And then she thought again upon the words of Mrs. Maderon—no doubt remaining of
                  their meaning ing now! And then, again
                  and again, she thought upon Gregorias: and she asked of herself, with agonized
                  anxiety, knew he all that history? must the mystery of his conduct—if, indeed, it
                  was mysterious, rather than uncommon—find solution here and thus? Then—poor,
                  deluded creature!—all was, indeed, over for her.
               God help the struggling, agonizing woman! what right had she to dream? What right
                  had she to now build up one hope of the future's triumphs? What right had she to
                  be the pupil, the beloved of Gregorias? God help her, as she looks upon the wreck
                  dashing suddenly before her eyes, at the moment when she fearlessly thought to
                  venture her own little bark upon the shining, the treacherous waters!
            
            
               XXVII. THE WISE SERPENT IN THE WHITED SEPULCHRE.
               NOT many days after this discovery Asia had made, while Mrs Maderon was passing by
                  the cottage, a storm, which she was hurrying homeward to avoid, burst suddenly
                  upon her with the force of a torrent; and, to escape what bade fair to be a flood,
                  the lady was compelled to do a thing she had not done in years: she ascended the
                  steps of the verandah to take shelter in Asia's home; and Asia, who was, at the
                  time, alone in the parlor, arose to receive the lady of the great house.
               When the slight commotion occasioned by her entrance was over, and Mrs. Maderon
                  had duly congratulated herself on the shelter she had found, and questioned Asia
                  concerning Mr. King, she proceeded
                  ceeded to make good an opportunity which she had long desired, yet had not the
                  courage to seek, for speaking to Asia Phillips concerning herself. And thus she
                  begun:—
               "What, my dear, can you find to do here? You are alone by yourself so much, I
                  suppose. You are alone a great deal of your time, are you not?"
               "I never find myself at a loss for occupation," said Asia. She was courageous now;
                  she was bearing in mind, while she spoke, the words Gregorias had said to her only
                  the evening before—words which had taken remorse and every fear from her heart;
                  for she had told him all that wretched story, and he had answered that she was
                  his, and that he loved her, for herself alone, because she had no equal! She was
                  brave, and herself again: there was no reason why she should quail in the presence
                  of his Aunt Agatha.
               "You are fortunate—more fortunate than the most of people. How is your uncle now,
                  did you say?"
               "He is the same as ever, in regard to his blindness; but I fear, Mrs. Maderon,
                  that he is not as strong as he was."
               "Pity. Yet he must be a very great care. You must feel as if you were chained
                  here, having such a care on your hands. But you were always patient."
               "Patient!" Asia compelled herself to pause with this exclamation, till she could
                  speak without emotion. "You are too kind," she continued. "But Mr. King, my
                  grandfather"—great emphasis she laid upon those words—"is no tax on me: I don't
                  feel that he is a burden. No. Mrs. Maderon, that bird on the locust-branch is not
                  more free than I."
               "It seems a prisoner just now, and in danger, the storm is so wild," said Mrs.
                  Maderon; and then, for she saw that it were better to at once come to the point,
                  than spend the opportunity she had in bickering with the girl, she added:—
               "Do you see much of our nephew, Asia?"
               "Our nephew!" involuntarily repeated Asia, for an instant at a loss.
               "Mr. Gregorias."
               "Oh, I beg pardon ... I have had the honor of seeing him."
               "Where?"
               "Where? Everywhere, almost! Walking about your place, in the village, at church,
                  riding with the Misses Maderon. Even here I have seen him, Mrs. Maderon," said
                  Asia quickly.
               "That will do," said the lady, waving her hand as if so to quell the spirit she
                  had roused. "As a friend, of course I do not mean that, poor Asia; but have you an
                  acquaintance with him?"
               "I have the honor of Mr. Gregorias' acquaintance, madam. Please to not call me
                  'poor Asia.'"
               "You think he is a man of genius, do you not?"
               
               "I believe that it is allowed he has superior talents."
               "What is your opinion?"
               "I have not thought about it; but if Mrs. Maderon considers him a genius, a genius
                  he assuredly is."
               "You are Asia Phillips still! I would leave you to your fate, and every one knows
                  what that will be, unless you condescend to stand in a more womanly awe of the
                  speech of people; but—I too am a woman, and I remember my duty: that I must
                  perform. I wish to warn you, Asia."
               "To warn me, Mrs. Maderon?"
               "Yes—that was what I said."
               "Against what, Mrs. Maderon, if you please?"
               "Pursuing the strange course that I hear from every quarter, you have been
                  pursuing. Your conduct, it is said, is not calculated to win either the respect or
                  confidence of your friends."
               "What is it that you mean? Who are my friends? I demand that you speak still more
                  intelligibly. What do you mean?" Asia arose as she asked this, and approached Mrs.
                  Maderon.
               "You should not give way to such bursts of passion. They do not become a woman.
                  Certainly they do not; and I deplore—"
               "What is it that you mean?" repeated Asia.
               "That you have been seen at strange hours, in lonely places, declaiming in the
                  most extraordinary and unseeming manner, for the benefit of Mr. Gregorias. What my
                  nephew thinks of such proceedings I do not know. If the story is true, I am not
                  certain—I merely wish you to know what the world is saying—if it be
                  true, I think such doings exceedingly improper, if not worse than improper.
                  Character should not only be stainless, it should be above suspicion. The idle and
                  the evil-minded are but too ready to make ugly use of gossip. I beg you will
                  remember this—for the sake of your friends, if—"
               Asia thought of him who was now her counsellor and friend, and she said
                  quietly—
               "Mrs. Maderon, perhaps there have been times when I had need of your counsel: if
                  so, they are of the past."
               "Oh! then I have been misinformed."
               "Perhaps it might have been well had you discovered that before you had need to
                  ask of me."
               "The same insufferable pride!" said Mrs. Maderon, and she turned away from the
                  "incorrigible girl," as she called her in her heart.
               "Insufferable, because I will not be trampled on as a worm! You will acknowledge
                  that in all my dealings with you, Mrs. Maderon—you must
                  acknowledge—that I have had no other defence than this same pride you speak of so
                  disparagingly. It is my friend—almost my only one. Yes, I dare make answer to you
                  in my own house! You will  say I have
                  been doubly insulting. But, humble as it is, this house is my castle, and I will
                  keep it as I may. I remember that it was given to my uncle by the excellent man
                  who gave your home to you; and therefore I say, and I feel, that you are welcome
                  to its shelter in a rainstorm. But you have no right to make use of
                  the hospitality as you do. You may remain here, and I will relieve you of my
                  presence, which you have hated since I was a child!"
               Confounded by the audacity of her speech, Mrs. Maderon made no attempt to detain
                  Asia as she went; she let her go in silence, but she said to herself, "There is no
                  innocence in that girl's heart"—and with no Christian sorrow did she ponder on the
                  thought. She believed the story she had heard, and her compassion was but for one
                  of the offending: and the reader may be sure that this compassion was rather for
                  the Tempter than the Tempted.
               And, from the window of her chamber, Asia Phillips watched for the going forth of
                  Mrs. Maderon. Firm in the faith of her loving and passionate heart, how strong she
                  felt, as she went from that conflict, to defy the gossiping talk of the villagers,
                  among whom she had never sought for a friend!—how strong to defy all the cold
                  looks of suspicion, and all the poisoned words that Mrs. Maderon could think to
                  say! Ay, strong, for the vow of Gregorias was ever sounding in her ear. The step
                  she had taken was not irretrievable: she never thought once of the possibility of
                  the failing, or the breaking, or the annulling, of that vow! The generous,
                  eloquent words he said, she never could forget: her strength sprang from those
                  words!
               This was their last collision, for it was the last interview between the mistress
                  of the mansion and the mistress of the cottage.
               Asia thought she had gained a victory in this conflict. She had no knowledge of
                  that superhuman power engendered, as a great author has said, of female
                  prejudices. She did not know how sharp, and polished, and efficient, are the
                  weapons of a Woman of the World.
            
            
               
               XXVIII. DEATH AND BURIAL.
               THE weary winter was at last over; it was spring again in Maderon.
               Spring-time in Maderon! .... And what were all the people doing there? There was
                  the lady of the great house busy with her plans, carrying them forward, according
                  to her custom, in silence, rarely taking counsel with another; guiding, when none
                  thought to look upon her as a guide—controlling, and designing, and ruling, as a
                  Jesuit might do. She never failed in carrying out her projects, she never
                  misjudged, never miscalculated; and it was hardly possible that she should fail in
                  the conduct of these spring-time plans of hers, for she had fairly estimated the
                  forces with which she dealt, the motives tives to urge, the chords to touch, the
                  influence to use: wise as a serpent was she in the employment of all these
                  instruments.
               And there was Blanche, perfecting in beauty, dreaming gloriously, painting
                  wonderfully, expanding naturally—a woman of the world. Wearying still of Maderon,
                  chatting with Gregorias, and arousing now-and-then to declare her intention to
                  immediately go abroad; living after the suggestions of her own sweet will, the
                  "pride of all the Maderons," and yet led gently on, and unawares, by the silken
                  thread that Mrs. Maderon held; no rash, blind victim, hurrying headlong to
                  captivity—nevertheless a victim, and destined to be captured, by her own
                  thoughtlessness, or selfishness, or sin, I say not by which—let the reader
                  judge.
               And there was Vesta Maderon—Vesta, who had sorrowed, who had prayed, who had wept,
                  when never a soul in Maderon imagined that grief had dared come nigh to her;
                  Vesta, who sat quietly in the midst of the congregation when Angelo's words fell
                  like hot coals of fire on her heart—who moved not when Abby went forth after the
                  minister, to be to him what she might never be; Vesta, who had
                  besought for his deliverance from error, and from harm; Vesta, the friend of Asia
                  through all evil, and dread report; Vesta, the aid of Abby, the self-forgetful,
                  hopeful, and courageous Child of Light.
               She had stepped beyond the cloud that for a moment ment hung dark as the cloud of doom above
                  her—beyond it to the aid of a younger, and weaker, and less-fortunate sister, poor
                  little Abby Weed. When Angelo, also under shadow of a cloud, a fearful
                  "madness-cloud," would enter no home but hers, would suffer no nurse but Abby to
                  approach him, and no voice but hers to address him, Vesta stood by that nurse and
                  watcher—invisible to him, but the comforter and the support of Abby and himself,
                  "to warn, and comfort, and command."
               And there was Angelo, stricken down in his youth, "by frenzy desolated"—a tenant
                  of the humble, whitewashed dwelling into which he had gone with Abby on that
                  Sabbath of renunciation—bearing this cross of the Father's correction in his
                  youth, and none, except the loving, dared to hope the cross would ever be
                  removed.
               And there was the old Weed, a miracle of reviving power, coming out from his
                  beastliness—truly a man again.
               And there was old Jacob King, dying.
               And there was Asia—and there was Gregorias!
               What a spring-time in Maderon! what a year to think of had that been since the
                  return of the great family to their house! And yet such a quiet, long, eventless
                  year to beautiful, fairy-like Blanche Maderon! She almost wished, as many times
                  she said, that she were back at school again. No wish like that had Vesta. Many
                  lessons the twelvemonth of liberty had taught her! She, indeed, had no need to go
                  back and study under any human guidance.
               It was not till many days after Mrs. Maderon's last interview with Asia Phillips,
                  that the lady mentioned to another the annoyance which the recollection of the
                  interview occasioned. She made allusion to it finally, when she and Blanche were
                  alone together, but merely as an introduction to a more important topic.
               "I really believe," she said, "that girl would make a quite respectable actress,
                  she is so passionate, and has so much force about her. I declare I don't think,
                  Blanche, that even to escape a storm like that we had Monday week, when I took
                  shelter in the cottage, that I would encounter Asia Phillips again. One can no
                  more advise her than one can do any other impossible thing. I never will undertake
                  the thankless task again. She seems to be so spiteful, so unwomanly! I believe
                  that now she has nothing to say to Vesta, and I'm not sorry. She quite took airs
                  upon herself about Vesta, for something the child said, in the most ridiculous,
                  vulgar way. I regret that your father ever made such a fool of the girl. Of course
                  he could not foresee how she would turn out—such a shocking, desperate creature! I
                  wish I could get her out of my mind; he only erred through kindness: but if such
                  people are not taught to keep their places, they  will all come to some such horrid end as this girl
                  bids fair to reach. Pity poor Angelo, when he was doing so much real good in the
                  village, had not taken her case in hand! A missionary might have done her some
                  service. I don't see what will become of Asia, unless she goes upon the
                  stage."
               "Cousin Aaron told me," answered Blanche, "that he thought it was her intention to
                  sometime become an actress. I suppose she is waiting till old Jacob dies, and they
                  say he can not possibly last through another winter. Cousin Aaron thinks as you
                  do, that she seems fitted for no other sphere, and that probably she will succeed
                  very well. I meant to tell you of it several days ago, but forgot. It is, as you
                  say, so disagreeable to think of her!"
               "What Vesta could ever find to like in her, is more than I can profess to
                  discover. I wish she would leave these people to themselves; she might spend her
                  time to better advantage: but she is a dear, sweet girl. I am sorry that Aaron
                  should have taken even so little notice of Asia as he has. Vesta, of course, can
                  speak to with her impunity, but it appears he could not—for the most absurd,
                  abominable gossip is going the rounds of the village. He himself told me the
                  scandal. I think I know my nephew better than to suspect him even of
                  an intent to marry with Asia Phillips, or anybody like her! Even if she occupied a
                  proper position, what training could ever make a lady of her? As far as I can
                  discover, her chief ambition is to address insolent speeches to persons whom she
                  has no manner of right to address in that way. I was right glad when Aaron himself
                  told me of the scandalous report. 'Twas noble of him! He feared I would first hear
                  such vile stuff elsewhere!"
               "He has told me of the gossip too, mother," said Blanche, in a low voice.
               A smile of triumph lit the dull eyes of Mrs. Maderon, and it spoke also in the
                  manner of her question—
               "Have you seen him of late? Did he tell you that his physician had ordered him off
                  on a sea-voyage?"
               "Yes, mother—and I am going with Aaron!" said the low, sweet voice, in answer.
               "Blanche, I congratulate you! Aaron Gregorias has aspired loftily, but he had a
                  right to aspire—and I congratulate you both!"
               For what?—in the name of faithful, and high-hearted, and honorable Love, in the
                  name of sacred Truth, in the name of Righteousness, in the name of WOMAN—for
                  what?
               Going with him!
               Not a question, after all the "scandal" she had heard, whether she had a right to
                  go with him! Not one passing, condescending wonder, even, if the girl who in the
                  hour of such congratulation was 
                  pondering over the dear words he uttered for her hearing, had not a better right
                  to be with him in sickness, and in health—forsaking all others, ay, as she
                     had forsaken them—cleaving only to him so long as he should live!
                  Not a question if the gossip had foundation! Not a question if a young life would
                  fall in ruins at the taking place of that departure! Not a question in the
                  thought—or, if a question, verily it was not worth an answer—if he had played the
                  part, in the eye of God, of hypocrite, and bigamist, and perjurer!
               Soft, and beautiful, and spiritual, the words that he had spoken in the willing
                  ear of fair Blanche Maderon! No passionate declamation had issued from his lips
                  when he sued for that white hand, unsoiled by labor and service of necessity, or
                  of love; he had occasioned no rise of marvellous hopes in the horizon of her
                  future; he had brought before her gaze no gorgeous visions. She was living in the
                  present; no need had he to prophesy. "All things richly to enjoy" were hers
                  already; he had no need to tamper with her ambition, hope, or pride. To
                     her the proffer of his love came naturally, as one of a thousand
                  blessings. She wakened not from a bitter, grievous sense of
                  isolation, misapprehension, misrepresentation, as did Asia Phillips—from a barren
                  life, to possession of all the world! No! one other friend, who came offering a
                  novel and attractive kind of friendship, was speaking novel words to her; and with
                  charmed ear, and charmed heart, she listened. Not with the wild, overwhelming
                  gladness that impelled her to her knees, to pour forth such a strain of
                  thanksgiving as burst from the heart of Asia, did Blanche bow, and name Gregorias
                  in her nightly prayers.
               To the one, a crown had been given, that brought her up from the dust of
                  loneliness, to place and power; to the other, a fragrant flower was offered of
                  rarer beauty, and of richer perfume, it may be, than she had known before. To the
                  one, the love which he had proffered was more than life; to the other, it was one
                  among the many pleasant things of life. The gorgeous coloring of the dreams of one
                  were made up of the thought of him: a recollection of his words added a pleasant
                  sweetness to the day-dreams of the other.
               Had death at that time fallen on Gregorias, "a wound, that only death could heal,"
                  would have pierced through the strong heart of Asia .... Days of mourning, solemn
                  weeds of mourning, would have told the sorrow of Blanche Maderon ... For the
                  bereaved, heart-broken, ruined Asia, there would, there could, have been no second
                  love, no renewal of temptation: for Blanche Maderon there would have been a second
                  love, and a full consolation; and she would have manifested a submission in view
                  of the bereavement, such as, many might have said, illustrated well the Christian
                  graces of her heart.
               
               He was ordered by his physician—whom he had, by advice of his aunt, gone away from
                  Maderon to consult!—to leave the north at once, to go forth on a sea-voyage; and
                  swiftly and noiselessly, that the order might be obeyed to the letter, went on the
                  needful preparations for the departure of a bride from Maderon house.
               And while these preparations were being made; while Asia, unaware of them, and of
                  the calamity in store for her, watched alone over the waning strength of the dear,
                  blind old man; and, that she might do this duty, refrained from study and from her
                  lonely walks, happy in the doing of the duty, because she was still firm in her
                  trustful, loving faith,—did no dismal, dreary thought oppress the mind of Aaron
                  Gregorias? Did he never think with regret, never with tears, upon the life that he
                  knew was bound up in his? Did he never, when he looked on the lovely bride whom he
                  was to bear away with him into the "far and foreign lands," think also of the girl
                  whom he should leave behind, desolate, deceived?
               I do not know—I do not care to guess: I am thinking, rather, of poor, misguided,
                  sinning Asia. Of the woman's broken heart, and blasted life, and stricken soul,
                  and ruined reputation ... Of her whom judgment had overtaken .... I ponder on her
                  thought and fate, and not on his. I know not if one light regret, one pang of
                  remorse or shame, proved troublesome to him when he went forth from Maderon.
               I know not, if, when Gregorias stood at God's altar, and vowed to love Blanche
                  Maderon only, if, in the pride of that proud hour, he had a recollection of far
                  other vows, already binding him. I know not, if, as he drew her hand so tenderly
                  and reverently—as in a loyal homage to Woman, offered through that
                     woman—within his supporting arm; if, as he walked from the place of
                  prayer, when the pastoral blessing had been said, on that moonlit, bridal evening,
                  if even for an instant he felt that "the sword of heaven, if in haste to smite,"
                  would have riven those twain, and driven them far asunder. I know not if, as they
                  entered the carriage that bore them away from Maderon, when he had parted with
                  Vesta, he thought of that other who was watching in loneliness by an old man's
                  deathbed. I know not if he wondered how the sound of the church-bell ringing so
                  merrily, borne to the travellers on the mild air of spring, long after they had
                  passed the village bounds, would break upon the ear of wronged, forsaken Asia
                  Phillips. Or, if he wondered, in that hour, whether she were keeping a sweet
                  remembrance of his troth, calling his words to mind, rejoicing in them, jealous of
                  the tedious business of his profession that kept him so much away from her, I know
                  not. And neither do I know if Nemesis watched over his slumbers.
               
               But for Asia! When Vesta Maderon, impelled by her own good heart, went again with
                  proffers of a friendship which had been ungraciously repelled of late—when she
                  went again into the humble parlor of the cottage, after old Jacob's death—when
                  Asia stood beside her, thinking no more, "Now he will come!" but in the blasting
                  light of the knowledge that he had deserted her!—shall I not dare to speak of the
                  crushed young heart, which, in knowledge of its desolateness, had borne up, with
                  the heroic strength of her womanhood, under that sense of desolation, until the
                  mortal breath had left the mortal body of the dying man, for whom alone she now
                  lived? I dare think of the soul in which appalling knowledge took the place of a
                  proud and happy vision—of the ravages grief made, which so changed the face of
                  Asia, that Vesta, when she came, started back in terror, as if, where she had
                  looked to see some token of a brave, tranquil life, she only gazed upon the change
                  and work of death.
               I hear her, as she stands beside that bed of death, questioning Vesta concerning
                  the marriage of Blanche Maderon.
               I behold the pale, expressionless face, that turns to see, rather than hear the
                  answer.
               I behold her again, when she has thrown herself 
                     unconscionsly
                     unconsciously
                   before the pictured martyr—alas! no martyr she, according to the
                  judgment of the world—I hear the appalling cry of her despair! I see her as she
                  stands again, gazing upon the placid countenance of the old man who rescued her
                  from the hands of a dreadful fate, for a fate so horrible as this!
               I behold her smiling, as she looks on the face of the dead—smiling! for she is
                  glad that he can not wake, that he never will know the doom of his "little, dear
                  Asia." Glad that his eyes were not opened, as he had hoped they would be before he
                  died, so that he might see the face that bent above him, that gave so sad a
                  contradiction to the calm and peaceful, ay, the holy words she whispered in the
                  ear of the departing saint, when she caressed him in the hour of his death.
               I see her as, when she has ordered from the cottage, and dismissed from her
                  presence, those whose aid she needs not, whose sympathy she will not have, she
                  looks her last upon the body in the coffin, which Vesta had ordered for the
                  burial; as she looks once more, and yet once more, upon him; and then, with the
                  spring flowers she has gathered, and the cross her hands have fashioned, she
                  treads hastily away to mark the place of which her grandfather spoke so often in
                  his last sickness—the place on the edge of the glen by the lake-side; a favorite
                  spot in his youth, which he distinctly remembered in his age. There it was that he
                  wished to be buried. There other burials had taken place; there  she had buried childhood's fairy-faith; there she
                  had buried innocence, and the crown of womanhood; and there was yet to be another
                  burial!
               I know that nothing, save the knowledge that for her there is no home or heart on
                  earth—that for her there is no more to do, and be, and suffer—is in her brain, as
                  she goes alone once more through the path so often trodden by lighter, happier
                  feet, where he had walked beside her, where she had walked alone,
                  triumphing in the thought of him. I know, that as she thinks upon the future, and
                  gazes on the knowledge of her sin, and hears the harsh judgment of a pitiless
                  multitude, and knows the justice of their judgment—and yet its fell
                     injustice, for upon her head alone will the vials of their righteous wrath be
                     poured—I know, that as she thinks upon him, careless, honored, courted,
                  and herself cast out to bear the cross that is intolerable, and still deserved—I
                  know, that as she sees, through no vain light of fancy, but in the knowledge of
                  all that has been Heretofore, the terror of her doom,—she smiles once more: for
                  before her lie the waters of the lake, and death comes as a thought of ecstasy to
                  her. I know what madness fills her heart and brain, as she stands alone, stricken,
                  desolate, undone, beside the lake, remembering who has stood beside her there. I
                  know the anguish of the present has blinded her to consideration of any future,
                  save the dreadful future that the world will give to her. I know that hell and
                  heaven are not things of which she has now one thought; that as she looks upon the
                  lovely valley, and the distant village, or Maderon house and its gardens, on the
                  cottage where the dead old man lies, she knows that there is not a place in this
                  village—no, nor in all the world—for her! That she sees only the darkness of a
                  curse over all things; that she hears no voice of hope, or consolation, or
                  forgiveness, in that dead silence which surrounds her—only the echo of her own
                  heart's voice, stealing over the water, plain, and wood:—
               "MY GOD! I AM FORSAKEN!"
            
            
               
               XXIX. ASIA'S BAPTISM.
               THEY carried a senseless body up to the great house of Maderon. And the bearers'
                  feet never rested, nor stayed, until they reached the door of Vesta's chamber!
               No Mrs. Maderon stood in the way to expostulate, or hinder, or to take exception
                  to this act of desecration.
               Blanche, Gregorias, neither was there to impede the bearers' progress, or Vesta's
                  noble will.
               And there, on Vesta's bed, they laid the precious burden. Precious! for there was
                  life in the poor body, and the heart of a true woman beat in the breast of that
                  protecting daughter of the house of Maderon.
               Precious! for the arm of Providence had saved Asia Phillips. Thank God! she was no
                  suicide.
               The funeral of Jacob King took place at the very hour he had desired; and in the
                  very place that Asia had marked by the wooden cross, and the flowery crown, they
                  laid him. And, meanwhile, the girl he blessed with his dying lips, lay sleeping a
                  fever-sleep, in Vesta Maderon's chamber. The villagers wondered at her absence
                  from the funeral: that Vesta Maderon and the servants of the house were the only
                  mourners there. But, when they heard that Asia was very ill, there were some
                  gentle souls that wept for her, and almost disbelieved the gossip they had told,
                  and some who said she was faithful and good as a daughter, in the care she had
                  taken of old Milly and Jacob.
               He had blest her with his dying lips, and the old man had also prayed for her
                  then—and "the prayer of the righteous availeth much." Therefore, those who cared
                  for her, did well to hope.
               Day and night, for many a weary, almost hopeless week, the watchers had possession
                  of that room. Tender and loving watchers they were, who seemed to know the value
                  of the life in their keeping; who seemed to feel, that for other than ordinary
                  reasons, that life was worth preserving. And at last the power of disease was
                  broken. At last came peaceful slumbers, an abating of the fever, a rallying of the
                  mental faculties.
               
               Asia had passed through the dark waters; they had not been divided for her feet;
                  the flood had gone over her; and the Lord had preserved her!
               Shortly after this good change was observable in the patient, Vesta sat in the
                  chamber, late one night, reading, by the shaded lamp-light, a letter which
                  Gregorias, and Blanche, and Mrs. Maderon, had written from a foreign city.
                  Observing the lateness of the hour as she folded the letter, Vesta arose to look
                  at Asia, intending to call in the nurse for the night; but, as she did so, Asia
                  said, in a quite sane way, "Come and sit near me—it is you, Vesta,
                  isn't it? And let me hold your hand. I want to tell you something beautiful ... I
                  wanted to hear that great singer so much, when you went away to the city, where
                  she was singing, to hear her. I thought if I could see her, and hear her, I should
                  be willing to give up many a year of life. But we can't buy pleasures in that way
                  ... I was so unhappy—and they said she looked so tenderhearted. They called me
                  wild, and brave, and rough; but I was weak instead. Haven't I been unhappy,
                  Vesta?"
               "Yes," said Vesta, in doubt still, as to whether Asia spoke knowing what she
                  said.
               "When you were sitting there reading, I was trying to think—I forget so! But I
                  certainly saw that singer in the room, and she came and sat—there—where you are,
                  and I told her my troubles— though she was a woman, and it is hard to tell your
                  trouble to women! And the singer, she had my hand, holding it; and, while I was
                  speaking, she began to sing, 'Come unto me, ye weary and
                  heavy-laden—I will give you rest.' Are you smiling, Vesta? It certainly happened.
                  And she kissed me, and I almost felt glad I had suffered, when she did that. She
                  would never have kissed me if I had been happy.
               "Dream or not, Asia, it was a beautiful thought," answered Vesta, "and I wish I
                  might have as beautiful when I go to sleep. But I shall not; I never dream—though
                  you say this was not a dream. You are getting so much better, dear; how glad I am!
                  I will lie down beside you, and then I shall not need to call a nurse to-night.
                  How glad I am that you are getting better, Asia. Perhaps by to-morrow you will be
                  able to be up; and then, very soon, you will go walking down the stairs, leaning
                  on my arm—and you have no idea how many roses are in blossom in the greenhouse—and
                  then .... out of doors!" And Vesta Maderon kissed the brow of Asia Phillips as she
                  laid herself down beside her.
               "Vesta! Vesta!" repeated Asia, softly—"I have done nothing but say that name over
                  and over for two or three days. I was not sleeping, or senseless, as you thought:
                  you did think so, didn't you? though I believe—I have been—so long a
                  time!  It is a blessed name, it means
                  so much, and it fits you so well!"
               She paused, and Vesta averted her face, though there was no need: Asia could not,
                  for the shadows in the chamber, see the tears that gushed into her eyes, when she
                  said of her what Vesta well remembered Gregorias had said of Asia, and
                     her name, only a year ago.
               "I have been trying to think, but I can not remember—Vesta, can you tell me whose
                  lines these are?— 
                     
                        "'That was wrong, perhaps; but then,
                        Such things be, and will again!
                        Women can not judge for men!'"
                     
                  
               
               "Oh yes! I was reading that very poem hardly an hour ago. There must be some great
                  sympathy between you and I, Asia, that we should both think of it the same night."
                  Vesta tried cheerfully to say, though she feared to think whether every old
                  recollection had yet returned to Asia's mind:—
               "It is in 'Bertha in the Lane'—you know Miss Barret's
                     'Bertha.' You remember it all now, don't you, Asia?"
               "I believe ... I forget ... Can you tell me what it is?—the story, I mean. It was
                  a love-story, was n't it?"
               "Yes," answered Vesta, endeavoring to speak as though the story of the poem were
                     but a story, whose counterpart could never, by any possibility, be
                  known among living beings. "It was all about two sisters and a lover. The eldest
                  sister was betrothed to Robert; and, after that betrothal, he saw the younger
                  sister, and he loved her better than the elder, and he told her so, and of course
                  the elder lady heard it all; and then, very foolishly, she died, and on her
                  death-bed revealed how she knew the fickleness of Robert's heart; but she would
                  not condemn him. She was noble. She loved truly. It is just after the
                  manner of a thousand romances; only, this one poem is worth them all."
               "I 
                     remembor
                     remember
                   it now," said Asia quietly.
               And Vesta, of self so forgetful that she made no question in her own mind, if the
                  story had for her a shadow of application, thought only, "Alas! what is it that
                  Asia remembers?"
               For a long time Asia now remained in perfect quiet; then again she started, raised
                  herself on her arm, and looked around the room, and into Vesta's face with careful
                  scrutiny. And Vesta, fearing, yet knowing well what was to follow, looked up, and
                  met the gaze that fastened on her.
               "Vesta Maderon, this is your room," said Asia: "I remember it well. I used to come
                  here a great while—oh, a great while ago. I wept with you here when your father
                  was dead. I felt that my loss was almost as great as yours: now, I know it was
                  greater! But Mrs. Maderon changed our relation. And I never came here, though you
                      wished me, since you came from
                  school; did I, Vesta?"
               "No, and you vexed me; I wanted you here so many times when you wouldn't
                  come."
               "And I never presumed on Miss Blanche—I never put myself in the way of Mrs.
                  Maderon; did I, Vesta?"
               "No, never! never, Asia—dear Asia! You know your own self better than all others
                  have known you. Let me have your arm around me, Asia, so. I want to be sure that
                  you are here; that you are not going to vanish as a vision. You look ghost-like;
                  you have been so ill: but now you are so much better again."
               "Therefore, tell me, Vesta Maderon—you need not be afraid—why you have me here—you
                  need have no fear, I say—only tell me why you have me in this place, when I would
                  never come here of my will. Who brought me? what am I doing?"
               "You were very ill, indeed, and there was no one to take care of you at the
                  cottage. Don't you understand? That is all it means. But if I thought you had
                  rather go down to the cottage than stay here, in my own room, I don't know but I'd
                  carry you in my arms, although it rains so fast! Do you hear it against the
                  window-blinds? If it seems such a hateful place here to you, I think I should be
                  vexed enough to let you go, and to help you off on your way."
               "Vesta, what became of grandfather?" asked Asia. Not a smile crossed her face
                  while Vesta had been speaking: the memories to which she was recurring were not
                  memories to occasion smiles.
               "Of whom, Asia?" and it was with relief that Vesta thought Asia's mind was
                  wandering again.
               "Of grandfather, poor old man!"
               "Oh, Uncle King, you mean," said Vesta, though not at all certain that Asia did
                  mean him. "You remember, Asia, that our dear uncle has gone where Milly and my own
                  dear father and mother are. It was a beautiful day that we buried him in a quiet,
                  sweet place, by the lake-side, where there was a cross and a wreath of flowers
                  placed, as if on purpose for him; the flowers we buried with him, and the cross is
                  at the foot of his grave."
               Vesta's heart trembled with every word she uttered; still she spoke distinctly and
                  calmly, as if no tragic thought could accompany the recollections.
               With sudden vehemence Asia asked next—
               "Why are you here beside me? why did you not leave me to the fate I sought, when I
                  went away from him?"
               "Because I love you so dearly, and can not do without you; because it was God's
                  will that you should live.... There are other rooms in this house, I know, beside
                  my own; but I am lonely, and I had rather be with you, unless you choose to have
                  me go."
               
               "I choose—go!"
               "You command as a queen might. But I am old, and so stubborn," said Vesta,
                  smiling—a forced smile, in truth—"that I find it difficult to obey orders, unless
                  I have reason for thinking that some good is to come of obedience. Why must I go
                  from my room at midnight? I am afraid to go through the gallery in such a
                  storm."
               "O Vesta Maderon! I went out in a night more horrible than this, to hear the
                  wretchedest story that was ever told to woman! Vesta Maderon, all that you have
                  disdained to believe, because you are a woman and an angel, is true. Your sister
                  is his wife—and I—what am I? Go, leave me, I beseech you!"
               "You see—I am not going. I shall never go from you in such a way as you suppose I
                  will by that command; never, Asia, so long as it shall seem best for me to stay.
                  If he is worthy, and my brother, you are also my sister!—and I have loved you
                  since we were children. Say no more about my going: I shall not go."
               "You will not continue to think so. And I shall not need you, or any, long—thank
                  Heaven, not long!"
               "Will you, indeed, be glad to do without me? Does no one on this earth need
                  me?"
               Asia heard that question, and she pondered it in her soul. Was there sorrow in the
                  heart of Vesta Maderon, that she should speak so sadly? had grief and tribulation
                  also fallen upon her?
               "I shall go swiftly to judgment, I hope and believe, Vesta," she said; "and then I
                  shall plead for a mercy I would not ask of any mortal; for who beside you, of all
                  the men and women who know my fate, would do what you have done? Oh, yes! I need
                  to plead for mercy, and I will, There. And He will hear me who knows what is in
                  the heart. He knows what is in mine."
               "Believe me, Asia, you will remain here. The earth is His footstool; and if
                  anywhere you plead, it must be here. That is what we all must do; and then at
                  last, when all these our supplications are made, and our work is
                  done, our Father will receive us into that other house, where so many we
                  love await us."
               "Work?" repeated Asia; "work? I told you once what you could do far
                  away, and you have found the opportunity for that very work here!"
               "Dear Asia, He gives us strength, and it is surely that we may do him service....
                  Do you remember little Abby?" Firm was the voice, and solemn in its gentle
                  cadence, as she spoke that name. "How we laughed, we idle creatures, when she came
                  dragging the forlorn little carriage, with the sick baby, down the lane that day!
                  But I believe that she will yet be the means of saving our minister, and the
                  doctor believes it too. Only think 
                  what the poor girl has done! Oh, I wish that you and I, Asia, might do
                     our work as well and as nobly as she. I am ashamed when I think of
                  her. The widow's mite outweighed all the silver and gold the rich men threw into
                  the treasury."
               "Ashamed! you, who helped to make this girl the courageous creature she is!
                  Ashamed ... go away—I am passionate and wild, and I have sometimes said and done
                  that which—"
               "But it is so fortunate when we know what to do," was Vesta's sole reply.
               "Do you remember the picture that we hung above my mantel, where I could see it
                  from my bed? Do you remember my telling you that it made me strong to look upon
                  it, and that it always had that effect from the time that I was a child, when we
                  used to stay in the gallery so much?"
               "Yes, I remember, Asia—I remember it well."
               "When I went down to the lake that night, and left the dear old man in his
                  coffin—before I went, I looked on the picture. I thought how gladly I would go, if
                  it were possible, out from my room, down those narrow stairs, to appear before a
                  crowded multitude, and suffer the madmen to murder me as they had
                  him. If anything good could follow! If I could only perish for some
                  great and noble purpose! Yet I was going to die—for what? because I was a
                  'miserable sinner!' unfit to live. All Christians call themselves so: if they
                     believe they are so, why are they hard, and uncharitable, and
                  unforgiving? They would have no mercy on me. They would not kill me! I could not
                  be a martyr. Not that I feared the speech and the scorn of the living! Believe me,
                  it was from myself that I wished to escape! I dared not live! And you brought me
                  back!"
               "No—it was God that saved you; it was he that brought you back to yourself in his
                  mercy. Now, remember that, Asia—it was God. You had not done the work he gave you.
                  You said a mad thing to your heart. You doubted the truth. Asia, listen to me, and
                  do not answer; only think of my words. Show me that you love me, and that you do
                  not doubt me at all, and then I know that all will still be well. To-morrow, or as
                  soon after as may be, I will help you to that great easy chair you see, and you
                  shall sit by the window, and look out, and know 'how beautiful the world is' once
                  more. You shall see that the sun shines for something besides making gloomy nooks
                  for 'Grief to hide in.' Only with the weak, and such you never were, can "themes
                  of grief outlast the morn.' The wounded hero, Asia, can still do battle
                  gloriously—generously—victoriously. And then, when you are stronger, I will read
                  to you from some charming books: written for summer reading. Afterward we will
                  walk about the house; and in the gallery there are a great many new pictures,
                  better  than those dear old ones we
                  thought were so fine. Then we will look at the roses in the greenhouse I told you
                  about. And some day, if you wish, we will go down to the cottage; and then, if you
                  had rather stay there than remain up here, why, I shall stay with you. You are to
                  grow stronger and stronger, until you are perfectly well; then you are all the
                  while to be making plans, which you will carry into action some day. You are to do
                  that work for which you were created. When you are quite well again, I am going to
                  take you to a place where you are to study under a great master, who has promised
                  to receive you. And then ... then, Asia Phillips, you must go on, and
                  labor while God spares your life, for Him: and you shall be an honor to woman, to
                  your country, and to your art."
               "Hush! hush! You know not what you do! be still! What know you of my
                  art? I never told you—I never—no! Oh, just Heaven! I never told any but
                     him I'll hear no more of this. It is madness! It is worse—it is
                  infamy. I! oh, Vesta Maderon, I will be no poor, vain, worthless puppet for the
                  stage! a thing for gods and men to scout at, and for women to spurn and condemn,
                  except in that hour when I can amuse them! a refugee from Humanity to the only
                  station for which I am fit! Never, never, never! I would have gone," she continued
                  in a more subdued tone—"I would have gone, gladly and proudly; for I know it is
                  the work for which I was in the beginning fitted and destined. But now! ....
                  Vesta, it was once my hope, and my resolution, to live a grand life as an actress,
                  just as that singer does, who sang for me to-night ... I thought I would go and
                  labor for the good of those who find in such places their only amusement and
                  recreation. That was truly one of my first thoughts. Though I was proud, and
                  though I had heard some say such cruel things about women who labor in conspicuous
                  places, I knew my own gift, and I was sure it was, as you say, given me for some
                  purpose. But now, they would not say of me, 'She is lowering her woman nature,' if
                  I went upon the stage. No! they would say, 'It is the only place among the living
                  fit for her.' So I will never appear there. It would not be to elevate that
                  glorious profession; it would be to lower it. They shall not say, from my being
                  there, that it is the refuse of human life that finds its way to such places to
                  labor for bread. Though I believe I could preach from the stage a moral truth
                  which might avail with some. But I am only a weak, lost, mad woman, who attempted
                  to destroy herself!"
               "Oh, Asia, that was a grievous, dreadful sin!" said Vesta; "a dreadful sin,
                  indeed—and the longer you live, the more clearly, I know, it will show before you
                  in its own awful light—to take your own life into your hand in that way: it was
                     terrible rible! But you are here
                  now, to live. And you shall fulfil your destiny. And I firmly believe now, as you
                  did once, that it will prove a glorious destiny. Your profession is chosen, you
                  are eminently endowed for that calling. Elevate it as you thought to do: it is
                  your privilege and duty. It shall be yours to preach from the stage as you
                  intended. Let your heart furnish you with the texts; and the people will rejoice
                  at your appearing. I shall act upon my plan, for I know that I am commissioned to
                  act—to constrain you. You were not once disheartened by such cruel words and
                  strictures as you speak of. It did not trouble you when the vain and weak
                  triflers, who have not begun to guess even, at the true dignity of human
                  creatures—when they made a jest of truths which are God's truths
                  proclaimed in the hearts of women! You were strong once for your vocation—I know
                  you are still. You shall not be dismayed; you shall not be disheartened. Asia, let
                  me tell you a story that I have been reading."
               Asia was silent: she could not speak when she looked into the pitying, hopeful,
                  loving eyes that were fixed upon her. But Vesta waited for her to speak; and at
                  last she said:—
               "I have always loved you dearly. It seems to me just now that I have no love for
                  anything but you. Alas! why should I have? Who needs me? But you—you are more than
                  I dared to think a woman could be. I despised the whole race for its weakness, and
                  I was weakest of all. But I loved you always. Go on, Vesta: tell me the story you
                  read. No one that hears of what you have done, will say you lack for
                  courage. Go on."
               "It is hardly a line long, Asia; but how few seem able to learn it, or to
                  comprehend it! Once, when a crowd of sinners, passionate, evil-minded human
                  beings, condemned one of their kind, a sinful woman, He who was without sin, our
                  blessed Savior, said to her, when at his rebuke they had all gone away ashamed:
                  'NEITHER DO I CONDEMN THEE.'"
               Asia turned her face silently toward the wall, and, until morning, neither she nor
                  Vesta spoke again. They communed with their own hearts, and were still. They
                  entertained an angel—unawares?......
               When the sun was shining in heaven, and the voices of a hundred birds made melody
                  for the inmates of Maderon house, Asia Phillips sat, motionless as a statue, by
                  the window-side, and Vesta Maderon knelt before her; and looking up into the wan,
                  emaciated face, and holding Asia's hand in hers, she said, breaking thus the long
                  silence in which they had remained together:—
               "You have something to say to me: I can read it in your eyes. But I had rather
                  hear you say it aloud, dear Asia; for I know it is something that the angels would
                  rejoice to hear."
               
               And Asia answered her; and, as she spoke, a new and splendid light was flashing in
                  her eyes, and on her brow reappeared the crown of a regal womanhood.
               "You may take me when you will, and where you will: I will work, and do as you
                  would have me; for I know that you are not one to counsel lightly. I understand
                  you, if I have never understood another human being. Your words inspire me with a
                  great courage. You—young, rich, beautiful, AND A WOMAN—have been the one, the only
                  one, to say: 'Neither do I condemn thee. Go—sin no more.' You have done an
                  angel's—no, a woman's work for woman. You trembled, thinking of the
                  sin; yet, when others would have trampled on me, you had mercy. Vesta .... YOU
                  HAVE SAVED A SOUL ALIVE!"
               —And, laying her clasped hands upon the head of Vesta Maderon, she blessed her in
                  the name of Him who of old stooped and wrote upon the sand, as though he heard not
                  the accusation, and saw not the madness of the people! 
                     
                        "So, in the tumult and excess
                        Of act and passion under sun,
                        We sometimes hear—oh, soft and far,
                        As silver star did touch with star,
                        The kiss of Peace and Righteousness
                        Through all things that are done."

                  the sweetest and simplest strains of Wordsworth and Tennyson. The author is one of

               "We need not say that these volumes will be found rich in intellectual
                  excitements, and abounding in remarkable specimens of vigorous, beautiful, and
                  highly suggestive composition; they are all that remain to us of a man whose
                  uncommon genius it would be folly to deny."—N. Y. Tribune.
               
               "Mr. Poe's intellectual character—his genius—is stamped upon all his productions,
                  and we shall place these his works in the library among those books not to be
                  parted with."—N Y. Commercial Advertiser.
               
               "These productions will live. They bear the stamp of true genius; and if their
                  reputation begins with a 'fit audience though few,' the circle will be constantly
                  widening, and they will retain a prominent place in our literature."—Rev.

               "But so clearly are its principles developed in the beautiful letter-press, and so
                  exquisitely are they illustrated by the engravings, that the pupil's way is opened
                  most invitingly to a thorough knowledge of both the elements and
                     application."—Home Journal.

               "It is evidently compiled with great care and labor, and every possible means
                  seems to have been used to secure the highest degree of correctness. It contains a
                  great deal of valuable information, and is admirable as a book of

                  compilation was a 'labor of care and responsibility' We believe him, and we give

               "A book of reference unequalled in either value or interest. It is indeed a grand
                  supplement and appendix to the modern histories, to the reviews, to the daily
                  newspapers—a book which a man anxious to be regarded as intelligent and
                  well-informed, can no more do without than a churchman can do without his prayer

                  philanthropist, as well as the scholar and business man, it will be found of great
                  convenience as a reference book, and must soon be considered as indispensable to a
