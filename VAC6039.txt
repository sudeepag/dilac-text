               I.
               THINK of a child shut up in the dark room of the universe, with the gods for her company.
               Of young eyes gazing out upon the sea, watching, in the earnestness of faith, for the coming up of Aphrodite, crowned and clad in her immortal garments. Of Imagination treading toward the Orient with all the faith and reverence of a soul that has not learned to scoff at either, along a path made bright and clear by the memory of the tenderest of voices: treading backward from the white barrenness of sea-shore sands, and the roar of mighty waters, to the quiet of the mountain and the valley-land—to the country! sanctuary of broad shadows, forest trees, and lovely cottages—green grass, gardens, hills, and plains, and streams, and torrents,—of the robin and the blue bird.
               And more—of a young untutored mind, a lonely, longing human heart, lifting itself, tired of its long watching for the long-delaying Aphrodite, from the midst of foam and surf, to discern elsewhere the ideal of life and home—bound by circumstance to solitude and a prospect made of sky and rock, sand and ocean! To begin with, was not here a Battle ground, and a Battle cry, sufficient for incitement of infant energies?
            
            
               
               II.
               TIME was, when, in the midst of that barren prospect, the child' nestled, full of contentedness and joy. For the home of her infancy was a happy one; and illusion upon illusion, gorgeous with rainbow hues, and as full of promise, spread round about her, and beneath her and above, beyond her depth of dreaming.
               It was in point of fact but a lowly place where she was born—this life with the vision of God. A little brown frame house, storm beaten, but always in good repair—unornamented without or within. The blinds screening the two windows of the front room were heavy boarded ones, made for defence against the blast of storms. The entrance to the house was by a single wooden step, around which was a small grass plat; for, after an infinite deal of coaxing, the sod brought from the back country had consented to live in this ungenial neighborhood. There were no flowers near. There had been once, but now none. Two children during the last autumn removed the vine that had overshadowed the door, to a holier spot. They left a small portion of the root in its old place, but it was languishing in loneliness, and gave only slight tokens of recognition to the gay greeting of the summer sun.
               The front door of the cabin, studded with great iron nails, and hung on heavy hinges, looked strong to guard the treasure of a mine; but it opened, instead, into the narrowest of passages, which again was intersected, with no great deference to architectural rules, by other doors, one leading into a sitting room, as they called it, the other into the kitchen. Back of these closets were the lodging rooms, Old Walter Dillon's, and Susan's; there was, beside these, yet another, but since Susan was able to be about the house again that room was closed.
               The walls of the house were whitewashed, the floors uncarpeted, as in all cabins along the sea-board. But the furniture, the marriage portion of Dillon's wife was of a better order than is usually to be found in the cabins of fishermen.
               Here, in this unpretending home, had the fisherman Dillon and his wife borne all the joy and sorrow of their wedded lot. Here mortal and immortal life had been brought forth—here heirs of heaven and heirs of earth had entered on their several heritage. And now Susan and her father were alone.
            
            
               III.
               SUSAN had so far recovered from the fever, and its effects, that the nurse-woman Mr. Baldwin sent from St. John's to take care of her had been gone from the beach nearly a week, at the time when this tale opens, Today Mr. Baldwin has himself come down to visit his old friend Walter, and to inquire after his invalid daughter.
               Early in the day, before he arrived, Susan wandered away, almost for the first time since her recovery, from the house;—she had just returned from her solitary walk when the two men came in from their fishing.
               Mr. Baldwin, in whom the reader is to see a tall, thin figure, more full of energy than grace, whose hair is whitening fast, and his eyes growing more sharp, his impatience more notable, and his voice a little louder, every day—a person not so used to the fashion of the world as to appear quite at ease or in place as a holder of fortunes, and a dispenser of the graces and 
                     amenites
                     amenities
                   of life,—I trust the reader sees him, diamond pin, seal ring, gold fob chain, quick twinkling eyes, kindly smile, and all,—he, I say, seeing Susan, who stood in the cabin door, watching, as her father drew the boat upon the strand and left it there, came up to speak with her.
               He had but a moment to spare; his carriage was in waiting to convey him back to St. John's, and there was barely time for him to accomplish the ten miles before his dinner hour. When he came up from the shore, therefore, he had but a moment for Susan. But the kindness of heart found in that moment ample time for expressing itself. To say how glad he was—and who, watching him, could doubt it? that she was up and out again, and that the child must take good care of herself or—he would send back the nurse.
               No disagreeable impression surely could this talk and threat have left on her mind; what could he have said in the following second when he bent down and kissed her cheek, that troubled her long after? Why, only that, now she was recovering so fast, he should soon be claiming of her the long-promised visit at St. John's; and that he was going to bring his son and daughter down with him the next time he came to the coast! His son he said, not sons,—and so he must have meant David, not poor Clarence.
               She stood in the door-way, I said, while he spoke; she was watching the swift flight of a sea-gull, and envying, in her miserable languor and weakness, the flight of the strong winged bird—the use that it was making of its free and powerful energies. The prancing gray horses, poor child, suggested the same thought. Something of their spirit she had felt earlier in the day, but she had exaggerated its extent, and the long walk had exhausted her. Drooping she went into the house.
            
            
               IV.
               NATURALLY, in the walk she had taken, her feet had first turned to the oasis in the midst of the waste of sand—to the enclosure hedged about with roses which a loving mother's hand had planted there years ago, when a little one, named Joseph, was buried. The bushes had grown into trees since that day, the saplings had great branches, in whose shadow, under the newly-opened leaves and roses, were four graves. One of these was longer than the others. Over that grave, Thomas and Susan last autumn planted the ivy: Tom promised that when spring came he would build a cross at the head of their mother's grave for the vine to run upon, but the cross was not erected; the vine was trailing upon the grass, and only one was there to see it.
               They turned with slow steps from the burial-place, Span and Susan; would Susan have believed you, had you told her that Span understood not her thought, and that there was no sympathy in his quiet gravity that day? They climbed the cliff together, and went on a rough way among the rocks, until they came to the old windmill. On the broken door-step Susan sat down, the dog lying in the sunshine at her feet. There, too, as indeed everywhere, but there especially, she thought of poor Tom in his "wandering grave," who, lost on his first voyage, had left her, the youngest-born of the house, her father's only child.
               So incorporated had this brother and sister been, each in the life of the other, that separation was like mangling their life. Neither of them would have so missed the loss of the right eye, or the right hand, as of each other's daily presence.
               Mr. Baldwin had been chiefly instrumental in this separation aration. He had said it was a pity that so fine a fellow as Tom should be left to live an oyster life upon the beach, when "the world was all before him where to choose." And so often had he repeated this assertion, that it began to take the form of gospel truth in the mind of Walter the father, and then presently there was a conclusion of the matter in the way of argument.
               Mr. Baldwin had himself been so successful in life, that Dillon deferred to him, in his opinion as to the best disposition that could be made of his only son. Thomas, therefore, was fitted out, and sent to sea, with assurances that if he fulfilled the hopes formed of him, he should, when of age, be put in command of as fine a vessel as sailed the Atlantic. That was, to be sure, a prospect for the young son of the fisherman! But to the child who must remain behind, this was the very abomination of desolation. Were they not in losing him thus, losing him forever? Good for nothing to her was the promise, that, if it were possible, he would come home every year to visit. What myriad chances were there against, instead of in favor of, that very point around which gathered every ray of brightness belonging to the future?
               They had lost him; and Susan, refusing to beguile herself, knew it as well then, when it was decided that he should go, as after he was gone.
               
               But they had lost him in another way than that on which they laid such stress when they three, the hero and father and daughter, sat together counting and reckoning the chances, penalties, and gains. They had lost him forever.
               
               Forever—so they said. The bereft are not swift to lay to their hearts consolation. They are not eager to look through the long dark corridors of silence and solitude, for the ray beyond that streams, the token of a better land, the surety of a spiritual union. In the present consciousness is the sore bereavement. It is the present, the tangible loss, that overwhelms—it is the sense of it that rebukes and repels, as impertinent, the voices that essay consolation.
               Here, once more, sat this child upon the broken step of the old red mill whose sails hung uselessly, as they had for many a long year, flapping in the wind, against the north side of the tower, its tattered canvass fluttering in decay. In that very place, the very night before he went away, Tom and Susan held their last long talk together. Sorrowing children that they were, they were looking the parting of to-morrow in the face, and striving, for each other's sake, to make the best they could of the prospect. They had come up to the mill with a purpose, grave and sad, for the treasures of childhood are sacred and precious to the child-heart—there were the dried sea-weed, the shells, and the pebbles, to be taken into consideration on the eve of parting, to be looked at, and talked over, and vowed over.
               For more than one reason this mill, and more particularly its upper room, was hallowed to them. The last time their mother walked out with them they had gone to this very place. Up in the tower, as they looked over the pebbles, one by one, and the shells, they recalled her words as she examined their store, and stood with them, before the little windows, looking out upon the sea.
               And in whispers Tom and Susan had talked of her as they went down the tottering stairway. How much, as their circle grew smaller and smaller, how infinitely much had she been to them, and they to her!
               And with glistening eyes Tom said,
               "If she could only have lived till I had done something to please her."
               "You always pleased her," said Susan, clearing her voice, and endeavoring to speak the comforting words without trembling; but she could not.
               "But some great thing to make her proud," mused Tom.
               "She said she was satisfied with us;" and more and more Susan's voice faltered as she recalled the precious word.
               "Satisfied—so she did. But then to have seen me a commander! it would have pleased her so! But Susy, do you think I will be, ever?"
               "Not a step should you stir, if I did n't." Susan's face flushed when she said that, with the effort she had made to control herself, and also with the proud hopes she had for Tom.
               Nothing was too good or too great for him; and so she believed, with the faith of a loving heart, that the visible reward would surely be with him!
               "When that comes to pass you shall go with me on long voyages, and we will visit all the strange countries together. But we'll go in search of Stella first; do you remember how we used to talk about such things?". . . He stopped, and Susan took up the recollection.
               "And how she was to be your wife; wasn't she beautiful Tom? and we were to walk up and down the decks, and watch the storms rise, and see everything in the world! Oh, Tom, that was different from this." But that she must sustain his spirits by her own, these words had ended in a flood of tears.
               "I'd give anything on earth if she were here a moment!" exclaimed the lad, with flushed face and tremulous voice. . . . His words, his looks, her own thoughts her own emotions, Susan recalled, as she sat now alone thinking of him. And how he had gone the next morning, weeping as bitterly as she, when he kissed her for the last time, and left her in his little room where they had packed his trunk together; how he went out, doing his best to make a valiant show of self-control as he appeared among the little group of neighbors, the fishermen of the coast, who had gathered around the door to shake hands with him and wish him "good luck," for Thomas was a favorite with them all. Well she remembered how the succeeding days went on in their monotony, and how, from their dreariness, hope, when she was not looking for it, rose again, and the comfort that had come to her through the books which Thomas had bought for her before he went away, with his own money, at an auction in Harlem.
               And of other things than these. Of that day when Mr. Baldwin came down to the beach with the tidings that the vessel in which Thomas sailed was a wreck, and its crew lost.
               Susan and her father were on the beach when he alighted from his horse and came slowly, leading him, towards them.
               He told the story to those listeners. He made it doubly sure—he took a paper from his pocket, he read the printed news of "the terrible disaster at sea."
               The old man heard it, but said nothing—quietly he went on with the mending of his net.
               His daughter looked at him, and learned her lesson. She also was silent. But at length, when she could brook such control no longer, for she was but a child, and the grief was stronger than her will, she rose and walked along the beach, unmindful of her steps and path, until she came even to the mill and sat again in the place where they had held that last talk together.
               It was a common, hardly indeed a noticeable event. And he was only one among many. A little one among more powerful and perhaps more important lives—only a common sailor boy. Only poor Tom Dillon; his friends, as you know, were obscure people—there were but two poor souls to weep for him, and they lived away off, nobody could tell where, on some unknown beach: it was not much; the stars of that night no doubt looked on events far more momentous—but to them it was enough.
               When, thinking of her poor old father, Susan went at last back to the cabin, not intending to comfort him, nor even to speak, only to sit down beside him and show him, if it were possible for him to draw comfort from the knowledge, that he was not alone, that she was left, she found him still there, in the same place on the beach, still working at the nets, weaving the cord in and out, fastening the knots, clipping them busily, and with a hand firm and strong. But it was a mechanical work—he knew not what he was doing. He did not look up when his child drew near, nor when she paused a moment by his side; and instead of speaking or remaining, how should she comfort him! she went on up to the house and set herself to work; she made the tea ready at the usual hour, and Mr. Baldwin shared the meal with them, for he had decided to remain all night. After tea Susan prepared his bed in her own room, and laid herself at night in the place where Tom had dreamed away his early youth. It was weeks before she again left it.
            
            
               V.
               AND it was now more than three months since that time. The fever had run its course, and left her; but Susan had barely escaped with her life.
               In walking this morning as far as the mill she had overtasked her strength; but not content with that achievement, led on by a desire to visit the play-room, and with her own eyes see if all the old-time treasures remained there undisturbed, where she and Tom had agreed they should remain always, she had gone up.
               Slowly, and with difficulty, she made the ascent; but on reaching the threshold of the round room at the top, instead of advancing further she stood there, spell-bound, as if on the borders of the enchanted circle.
               A change had taken place there, where of all places in the world she had least expected, and could least quietly endure to find it. She stood looking about her, the poor child, as if unable to believe, or comprehend that which met her sight. It was indeed the same little circular room with the broad shelf running around it midway between ceiling and floor—the round windows, the discolored plaster of the walls, these familiar points assured her of the place that she was in, and still on the shelf were the treasures made sacred by her memories. There; but crowded now within a small compass in a corner, not spread out as they had left them, for ready examination, in a poor little pomp of display.
               But what meant those piles of books, and the table underneath one of the windows, and the open trunk, and the articles of dress hanging about the wall? and of all the wonders of the world, what meant that figure of a man seated before the table, arrayed in cap, and gown, and slippers? Such a strange looking stranger!
               When Susan opened the door and stood spell-bound by the sight that met her eyes, he looked up, this figure, and revealed his face by the movement, for she stood directly fronting him—it was a grave, stern face, the gravest and the sternest that ever had appeared before her eyes.
               He did not rise, nor at first speak, nor in any way seem disconcerted by the suddenness of this intrusion, though when the man looked up his face was full of thought and care, these powers had too firm a hold upon his mind to be readily shaken off. He was not unmindful of her, however, to an extent that proved him quite out of her sphere, for his eyes followed Susan's as she fixed them with a look of recognition on THAT corner of the shelf.
               "Something more than you expected to find," said he at length, in a deep, fine, even tone of voice, more suggestive of massive strength than human tenderness. "I began to think I should not see you at all."
               To this address Susan made no answer; for though the stranger spoke pleasantly, and seemed to know well enough what he was talking about, she was in no favorable mood for ready understanding.
               Then he said, with the strange patience of a master who does not believe in crowding his pupil, speaking slowly as he laid down the proposition.
               "This is your play-ground, is it not, Miss Susan?"
               It was a voice that some sort of heart was endeavoring, but with no great success, to make agreeable in its address to a poor, sick, miserable child. In its intonation a strange variation from the untutored style of utterance to which her ear had been accustomed. She could but answer him, though sententiously,
               "Once."
               "Then you are the little lady with whom I am to make my peace. Will you come in?"
               The child shook her head. He had his answer. But she did not immediately act on the alternative, which would also have been in obedience to her first impulse, and go down the stairs quickly as her feet could perform the office. She preferred to stand there in the vague hope that finally some explanation of what her eyes beheld would appear.
               "If you will not ask me about it," said the stranger, still holding open in one hand, as he spoke, a book, and with the other poising the pen with which he had been writing when she broke in upon his labor, "If you will not ask me about it—wonderful forbearance—I must tell you. But I would like first to see a trifle more of curiosity in those eyes. You can find me guilty of trespass in a minute, if you will take the trouble, eh; wont you?" He might as well have talked in any other foreign tongue as that strange English, not one word of which she seemed to understand. But by no means dismayed by the reception his words met, he went on, with increasing interest, it really seemed. "I will plead guilty, I like this round room; but I suppose that fact is not quiet pertinent. It is so quiet and pleasant for a study that I hope you will not seriously object to my staying here. If you will come and count over your shells and pebbles you will find them all safe, none missing: perhaps I may add something to your stock. Come in, Susan, and rest you, and look at the things; you'll find what I say all true. You look pale and ill."
               There was no such thing as making a question of his last observation; the shaven head and fever-wasted face did tell their own story. But ghostly as she looked, there was sufficient of vitality yet left in Susan to make no light impression on her questioner—she was not to him quite the little mule she might have seemed to less penetrating eyes. He, however, said nothing more to her when his words met no response, but turned indifferently towards the dog standing by her side, and whistled to him. Span understood the call, and leaped towards the outstretched hand, rubbed his shaggy hide against the student's chair, and ended his investigation of the stranger by returning the intended caress with a rude growl so unmistakable that for it no apology could be made.
               Span, in short, seemed as little pleased by the intrusion and the intruder, as his mistress, who, when the dog came leaping again to her side, turned silently from the threshold and went down the stairs. The stranger let her go; no voice called her back, no foot followed, no hand stayed her. He let her have her way. He had possession of the room, and that was all he wanted; let the peevish child go. No—that was not quite his mood, for long after the sound of her descending footsteps was heard, he sat with open book and suspended pen, lost in a reverie.
            
            
               VI.
               IT happened the next morning that these two persons, the man and the child, met again.
               Susan, whom the walk yesterday had, on the whole, refreshed and invigorated, though its first effect was weariness and languor, went again up to the grave-yard to clip the grass which in former times had been kept so shaven that it was like a lawn; no one had attended to it during the spring, and the black and matted leaves of the last autumn were lying in unsightly heaps upon the mounds, and the grass was long and rank.
               While she was at work there, Mr. Leighton, the student, came near—he passed not by, but stopped to speak with her. He may have seen her from his window, for from those mill windows the little green spot lay full in sight, and when she went into the enclosure he was standing looking out upon the shore and sea.
               Leaning over the fence he attempted again to talk with her. He asked her about those graves, who was buried there—did she remember the dead?
               Either the topic, or the freedom of the unwalled, unroofed place, where she was standing, opened the child's lips and her heart; or it may have been that the information her father, old Walter, had given her last night concerning the student who had applied to him for a lodging while she was ill, and the fact that the old man had spoken of him with respect and indeed reverence, as the wisest of men, that made her now fear to offend him.
               From whatever reason he did not question her at this time in vain. While she continued at work Susan told him of her brothers who had died long ago—and of the long sickness and the death of her mother—and yes, not even the latest, saddest stroke that had torn her heart, was hidden from him; of Tom she also told him. It relieved her to talk of them; as she did so, the rake she held rested idly in her hand, and from evading the eyes of the student she found herself standing gazing back, full in his face, while she spoke.
               "You have learned it early," he remarked, when at length there came a full pause.
               "What is it that I have learned?" she asked.
               "Life," said he.
               "I do not think so," she replied, resuming her work— "this is not life."
               "What is it then?" he asked, with a by no means decreasing interest.
               "Death—sorrow."
               "And are these not life?"
               "No, surely."
               "Is there a school-house about here, Susan?"
               "Not short of two miles, sir."
               "You can read?"
               "Oh yes, our mother taught us, Tom and me."
               "What do you read?"
               "The books Tom bought for me before he went away."
               "And what are they?"
               "A voyage round the world with maps in it, and pictures of ships sailing to different countries, and another book of fairy stories."
               
               "Of which you are very fond, of course."
               "Oh yes."
               "But then you would like living companions far better. You cannot live in books. Come! let us have a little chat. I am lonely to-day, I want company. If you could now, tell me, would you not choose to hunt for shells when the tide was out, or play in the surf, or swim your spaniel, and go to bed tired out with fun and romping, rather than live shut up with books in such a dull way as you found me yesterday? Is not that you? If you had other companions would you love your books so much?" It was all true that he had spoken; how should he know it? Susan did not answer.
               "Have you no friends hereabouts—none of your own age?" Again she hesitated—so unaccustomed was she to his way of talking about herself, that though the answers she should make were clear to her mind, and simple for utterance, still she could not readily deliver them.
               No, she had no friends thereabouts, none of her own age. But before she could say as much, there was Stella Cammon to be thought of, and Isidore Baldwin, and the children of the fishermen who lived along the beach. Stella had come, and gone; and for years had lived, for her and Tom, only as a bright flashing memory. Isidore! Susan made an effort to get away from the thought of her as speedily as might be—(but the wasp of a thought had stung her in passing—there was that dreaded visit of the people from St. John's yet to be made;) and as to the fishermen's children, there had never been anything in common between them and the children of Walter Dillon.
               "No," at length she answered him, "I have no friends."
               "You look stronger than you did last night," he went on to say; "how quickly one can recover under such a sky, and surrounded by such a prospect as this, from any stroke! Every breath you draw with increasing strength and pleasure. Happy are you to have had such a birthplace. The inspiration will prove pervasive your life long. Are you going back to your books, the fairy tales and travels again, now that you are getting well? Tell me about your plan."
               Plan! now this seemed really too absurd; still the child did not laugh at the absurdity, nor even smile, though much the reader may; and as to the man who was questioning her, he was certainly in earnest, endeavoring to get at the fact of that life before him, or determined on sounding its depth.
               And strange, too, as it may appear, the child had been puzzling her brain with some new thoughts in the last hours. Last night she had wondered what she should do with herself now that her strength was coming back, and she was proving that it was not for her to die of grief. The new phase of activity revealed in her old play-room, that silent and studious labor so unlike the physical exertion to which she had been inured, and infidelity to which she acted according to her knowledge, of which, before her illness, the shining whiteness of the floors and all the well-kept house was ample evidence—for this man was a worker, his tired, jaded look and air assured her of it, though his hands were far whiter and softer, and hardly larger than her own; he was a brain worker. . . . the labor in which she saw him engaged had suggested the question what she should do with herself now? what was there she could do? and therefore, when he asked her to tell him her "plan," she said plainly that she did not know it; he understood by that answer the question she in her heart asked of him—what plan might she, should she have? "Come and walk with me, the walk will do you good." She left the rake and the shears at his invitation, and joined him, the spaniel following quietly.
               She showed him while they walked, the nests of sea, birds which perforated the rock, like bullet holes—showed him the jutting points from which, in former times, they had gathered sea-weed which she had prepared in great quantities for the ladies at the boarding-house, three miles up the beach—the house where Stella had lodged. And still the conversation continued, as if of necessity, to turn upon herself.
               At every point they made in the conversation his mind paused and dwelt thoughtfully upon it. Much of what he said was like a foreign tongue to her who listened with more and more of interest. A foreign, not a dead tongue. Somewhere, she felt assured, it was intelligible and current; there were other heights, from which even his thoughts might be looked down upon. But, though the girl was so frequently at a loss, and though he seemed oftener to be talking to himself than to her, and would come with a startling abruptness back from his conclusions, speculations, and deductions, to her, by a remark or a question calling directly for reply, all that he said, understood or not, incited in Susan a continual wonder, a restless impatient desire to know what it was all about, why she seemed to herself so bewildered, so at a loss, so anxious, and so eager.
               
                  Why did she like the sea best in commotion, as she had acknowledged that she did?
               She could not answer.
               Was it because she loved to see the glittering waves, rising higher and higher, one after another rising in triumph above its predecessor? Because they were, those mighty, stern, irresistible waves, so wild in their roaring, so terrific in their power?
               Instinctively she saw that a yes to such questioning would seem the merest 
                     peurility
                     puerility
                  ; those were not the reasons, not more than, even if as much as, the symbol of them.
               And it was noticeable that in exact correspondence with the difficulty the poor child found in answering his questions, was the patient persistence with which the stranger urged them anew. This question which he had now proposed, remaining unanswered, was sufficient to arouse him still further. He, this anatomist, this dissector of souls, would not let the bare fact go, until he had torn it limb, from limb, learned its origination, and determined the issue.
               "Is it because you have always found the prettiest shells in the sand after the wildest storms?" asked he.
               That was all true, and Susan had oftentimes proved it; there was never such a time for hunting shells as after a great storm! But—this was not the reason, she blushed to think he could suppose so. When her soul had leaped up, as in answer, to the roar of ocean strife as the blast of the tempest rung wild along the waves, and deep answered to deep! . . "I should be ashamed to say yes," she said, her eyes italicized the words, and wrote them with fire.
               "Perhaps, then, because you are susceptible to what philosophers call magnetic storms. And you, too, would like, if you knew it, to go off in an exhibition of aurora borealis." He was beyond her again, out of sight; and she waited in silence till he should come back again and lead her on another inch, if he only would. He did come back. "You love to hear the waves dash and the winds howl, if you are safe; and even if they endangered you a little, it would be all the same, I dare say. The storm wind is a living power with which you sympathize. Are you like your mother, Susan?"
               "She had a lovely face," was the slow, sad answer; to her who made it, it seemed an all-sufficiently reply.
               
               "How was she beautiful?"
               "Every way."
               "But I do not see her. Wont you paint her for me?"
               Of all things he had asked of her, this did most please, and, at the same time, most distract her.
               Yet in spite of the difficulties any other than Susan, the most used to speech, would have felt in fulfilling such a task as he had now given her to perform, the bringing out from the heart's secresy and silence, the richest of its treasures for the gaze of another, yet, the sudden keen desire that he should both see and know, even according to his wish, gave her words. Why, since she of whom he questioned had passed away from earth, why felt she this great desire?
               Perhaps merely for the better indication of Susan's present self, whose deficiencies were, every moment, becoming more apparent to her inward sight. Perhaps because of the admiring pride that Susan felt in her as, day by day, she grew into a better knowledge of that mother's manifold perfections—perhaps for an expression of the gratitude that was deepening constantly, as event after event showed to the child's-eyes, in the strength of contrast, how wonderfully well the departed had filled the little sphere allotted to her when, with as good a grace, she might have occupied a more conspicuous and wider one—making her home so happy by the peaceful and contented occupation of its varied offices.
               For whatever reason, no sooner had he asked the question than the attempt to answer it was made.
               "Her hair was dark and glossy, and it waved along her forehead: it was easy to curl if you rolled it over your fingers so"—she raised her hands, but the shaven head afforded but a poor chance for illustration, and Susan went on with no little confusion, though the calm face turned towards her never changed its expression as it witnessed her blunder. "Her eyes were blue—she was not brown and freckled like me, but fair; and she was tall and slender, and her voice was sweet! She used to sing a great deal, till she lost her health, and her voice along with it. She was more like the beautiful ladies who used to come down in the summer, than—than I."
               "Was her father a fisherman too?"
               "Oh no—far back in the country, she was born there."
               The child's face flushed and glowed, and her eyes were full of visions when she said this. Before her imagination was rising, fair and sweet, that distant valley-land of which her mother talked so often, and always with the tremulous voice of an abounding love.
               She was the daughter of a clergyman. She came down to the beach when she was sixteen in search of health—one day she was out bathing, and lost her footing, and the undertow carried her far out on the waves. She could not swim; she must have been lost, but for the young fisherman who saw her from a distance, and, rowing with all his might, picked her up-she was senseless. Afterwards they loved each other, and were married. This was the story of the marriage of Susan's father and mother.
               From her mind to that of her questioner, immeasurable distance! these facts travelled. There was but a difficult communication between them—she at least found it so. But he listened patiently and attentively through all the hesitation, and broken and obscure expression, and at length said,
               "I see her perfectly, I think. Thank you. She liked the ocean best when it was calm."
               How strangely wise for him to know it! for it was so true! how could he have discovered it? mused the wondering child.
               "Yes," and now the words came readily, "she, my mother, was never so happy in a storm."
               
               "Not even when you were all around her, your good father and all," said he.
               "She would often ask my father, at night, to read the prayer for those who were gone to sea."
               "Ay, and would still be thinking of the tossing ships, and of other hearts that were troubled because of the storm; for she knew in how many homes there must be anxiety and alarm. It shortened her life, living here by the sea. This fine healthful breeze could not annul the effect of that constant anxiety of her tender heart. Storms she never could get used to. When she was happiest she talked much of the old home, the parsonage in the valley. . . Did she never go back to it?"
               "Never but once. I was with her, and so was Thomas. Father says I do not remember about it, for I was only two years old. So it must be because Thomas talked so much about it. But I know it seems as if I could see it too; the cottage I mean, with the vine over it—it was from there we brought the ivy—and the mountain and all. It seems to me that I can see it yet."
               "And verily it were not too much to credit whatsoever those eyes might aver. . . . You were a happy family. How did you spend your time, though?"
               She told him further of the old, old days. Again of the children of the household who had died; and he who hearkened was gravely patient of the trifling detail into which the novelty of her position, a speaker with a listener, and such a listener! lured the child.
               She told him further, and his courtesy betokened a deeper interest, of the house three miles away, where, in the summer time, the city ladies came, and of that wondrous fairy child, Stella, who had loved Tom so heartily; and of whom poor Tom had been so thoughtful and so fond. How she had lived with them days together, of the necklaces and bracelets they had made for her of shells—how gay she was, how full of wild spirits, how brave and passionate, and yet how easily led, how loving! And warmed by her recollections of the child, Susan went on attempting a description of the gay proud, handsome women, the many beautiful ladies who frequented that house during the season! Indiscriminately she dragged these reminiscences to light, emptying her soul as if at confessional; her enthusiasm of soul, had the better of the cold, sad exterior—it rushed along in the old track with all its pristine force, when she spoke of those fairy-land people, and of the beautiful child. "Oh it was such a lovely, lovely life that they led!" That told him the whole story. Leighton's features seemed to lose the kindly expression they had worn in this chat with the child.
               "Dolls! fit for a baby-house!" he said harshly. "You have some precious recollections—but I should not count those of the beautiful ladies you talk about, among them. Never mind."
               They were both watching Susan's father coming into shore, as Mr. Leighton spoke thus; and, as if actuated by one impulse, they both went down to the point where he would land. The student and the fisherman saw, each in the other, a man of few words, and much thought; and they had now, though on the best of terms, but little to say to each other. Mr. Leighton was the younger man of the two, by many a year, yet his hair was of a grayer hue, and his face sterner than that of the weatherworn fisherman. Old Walter could tell him nothing of the age that falls upon the heart, nor of the wisdom that is purchased at expense of days and nights of searching and discussing, of vigilant hard labor. They were thinking and grieving men, both of them—or they had been—and if the younger of the two had passed on beyond grief, it was not to patient resignation. The sources of their sorrows were obviously different. In Walter's case they were from without, he was bereaved: in Mr. Leighton's, the profound traces they left proved they were from within.
               Fortune had led them in different ways. Nature had given them an opposite development. The one was polished beyond comparison with the other; his intellect had found richer, more vigilant and various cultivation—but where was his heart? what trace of it is to be seen in that face, what proclamation does it make of itself in that voice?
               These men had both engaged in a hand to hand conflict with human trouble, but Walter's face gave no token that he had yielded to the defeat with a laugh of scorn; he had taken the glory from the conqueror who despoiled him, by the reverent submission with which he bowed to the power that had permitted the strokes that agonized him. His figure was still erect and sinewy, his hands, hard as iron with long toiling at the oar, were strong and nerved by purpose, his eyes were orbs that blenched not before the storm.
               They were, on the contrary, traces solely of mental conflict, that Mr. Leighton's face wore. His figure was slight and wasted, his face thin and pale; but looking at it, weakness, or languor, or deficiency of physical power, was what the gazer thought not of. His manner was full. of grace and ease, his address that of one accustomed to command, not easy to be entreated, neither patient, nor forgiving; yet, as it seemed, calm and invincible.
               After exchanging a few words with Dillon he turned away, apparently forgetful of Susan's presence, and of the conversation into which he had drawn her, and strolled slowly back towards the mill; while the child busied herself with removing from the boat the few fish her father had taken that morning, and went with him, when his preparations were all made, back home.
            
            
               VII.
               TWO days later Susan went again up to the mill with some small packages which her father had purchased for Mr. Leighton in Harlem.
               She found him sitting at his desk, pen in hand as when she first saw him, looking as if he had not moved from his place since she discovered him there. Having given him the bill sent up by her father, and laid the frugal store upon the shelf, she was going out again when he said, leaning back in his chair:
               "Are you so busy that you cannot stay and gossip a moment? what are you going to do?"
               "Going to read," said Susan, looking wishfully at the volumes that were piled around him, hoping, in her inmost heart, and her eyes betrayed her, that he would offer at least one of them to her.
               He interpreted the look, and shook his head.
               "You are better off, a great deal, than you would be if you had all these by heart. You have been studying a better book than I know of, for a good many years. These things are not for such students as you. Read and obey the commandments; there is wisdom enough for you in them."
               "Are they not wise books?"
               "Yes, the wisest of their kind. But the kind is not very profitable, you are only a child yet, and"—he came out with the thought that in speaking with her he seldom lost sight of—"and a girl."
               "Does that make a difference?"
               
               "Decidedly."
               "But I should be wise like—like you, if I read them, and I want to."
               "Wise like me!" he shook his head, closed his book, laid aside his pen. "Wherefore like me! and even if that might happen, what great good would it prove to you? Be content where you are, and as you are."
               There was something in the smile with which he spoke that the child's understanding could not fathom, and she said, with some perplexity and vexation, because when she had anticipated an open path she suddenly found the way quite blockaded,
               "I should like to know about the world, even if I am a girl."
               "Quite the best thing you can do when you feel a fresh attack of that disorder is to read over your book of travels; and after that be sure to take a dose of fairy tales. That's the best way for you. If you should read every book I own you would not have a whit better notion of the world than you have now. You don't believe it; of course not. I did not anticipate anything so remarkable. Well, for all that, you know enough to be a good girl, so you know enough for your own comfort. Every other sort of knowledge is superfluous. Save your strength and your eyesight, and you will be an excellent good-natured young woman seventy years from now."
               He did not smile, his voice was not jestful, his words had in their enunciation a finality that assured his listener it was vain for her to make a further appeal. She knew all this, but she was not prepared to bear the disappointment with philosophic composure; there she stood in her agitation, loosening her shawl, tying and untying her bonnet strings, standing now on one foot, then on another, and innocently taking an inventory of everything in the room in the most deliberate manner. In the course of all these shiftings and evolutions she dropped the volume which she carried under her arm.
               "Let me see it," said Mr. Leighton, extending his hand, and evincing no more surprise than if he had been waiting expectant for this thing to happen.
               "It is the fairy book," said Susan, going forward and laying the volume on his desk.
               "A fairy book! what do you mean by that I wonder?" looking over the pages.
               "Oh, made up by somebody—not true."
               "Not true! Why, there isn't a true book than this in the universe. Take it;" he gave it back to her; "take it and go and read it over again, and let us see what you can make of it. The ideas of that old book, very old it is I assure you, in spite of its fine red cover, were the seed from which sprung the most splendid monuments and temples in the world. Egypt, Greece, and Rome, were crowded with them in their day. In Judea the same seed grew into a cross. Climate and culture, I suppose, modified the growth, and it had a different harvest. Now just look at yourself! you had in your hands what wise men, as you call them, not I, set great value on. They deem the book a book of life, and you call it a book of fairy tales! You may be sure, for it is a fact, these ugly old volumes which I have around me, and over which so much good time has been wasted, are not for you. They could not comfort you in the least. Keep to your own path, don't be running away from yourself like all other women who are born into this world."
               There he checked himself, and gave the book back to her. Susan took it abashed, confused, and even a little alarmed at the sort of reception her hope had met; and with it she went from the study down to a sheltered place among the rocks, where, during the last summer, she had often sat for hours watching the waves, and the flight of birds, and sometimes reading. She was eager and curious—the secret of the volume in her hands must be sought out: how strange it was that she had not of herself discovered it! Perhaps now, firm as he seemed and determined, as if nothing could shake his will when it was once decided, it might happen, if she should prove herself less dull and stupid than he believed her to be, he would be induced to say yes, instead of no, about the books. With the happy and confiding sense of dependence and reliance which had prompted to performance of the tasks her mother once gave, Susan Dillon sat down once more to learn.
            
            
               VIII.
               BUT she had hardly begun to read, and to ponder anew the stories of the gods, when a drop of rain fell on the page, and looking upward, she saw that the sky was full of clouds. There was no help for it; she must go back to the silent house. Span had already started up and was running on before her, chasing the storm birds which went screaming to and fro.
               As he dashed wildly along the beach, a figure suddenly started up from the sand and followed him—then stopped short, retraced its steps, bending, and moving slowly as if in search of some lost thing.
               The figure, on near approach, proved to be that of a youth, a stranger on the beach, at least this portion of it, whom Susan had never seen before. In his hand he held a sharply-pointed stick—upon the sand were lines, many and varied; he had evidently been working there, and Span in his career had spoiled the tracery.
               Yet what was left of the drawings after the dog's heedless progress across them, was so clearly defined that Susan, having come near to them, and made a halt and an observation, seemed quite clearly to comprehend their drift.
               To her frankly uttered regret that Span should have shown so little appreciation of the work, the boy nodded with a satisfied, and not displeased, air, contemplating the girl as he did so with a smile not kept quite in reserve. His face indeed shortened when she broke in upon his silent meditation of the partial ruin, with her regrets.
               "It makes no manner of difference," said he, "I'm used to such things. But see if you can tell what they're meant for?"
               Whereupon Susan, who had already gone so far as to fancy that she detected in this manly looking fellow a stature and bearing like that to which her darling Tom might have attained, had all they dreamed of been fulfilled, said, turning from the youth to his work, that she knew very well what he had drawn. She had seen too many ships to be mistaken in the one picture, and the church spire of the other was perfect. This readiness on her part to perceive what he had done, pleased the workman; it was a recognition that he prized.
               But now, even in these few seconds of observation while these few words were passing between them, the rain was falling faster and faster—the cloud had broken directly above them. There was no other shelter near at hand in which he could find refuge than her father's cabin.
               "Come home with me," said Susan, "till the storm goes over."
               And as they go on rapidly together, the young fellow with the handsome eyes, and black waving hair, asks if she is not Mr. Dillon's daughter, who has been so very ill? And she tells him that it is she—Susan.
               "Dr. Hopper," he says, "was often down from Harlem. I am in his drug store."
               
               "And you brought me some oranges one day, thank you for it. Your name is Chilton?"
               "All right!" how like Thomas did that exclamation sound! "My sister was coming down with me that day, but something prevented. She has never been to this part of the beach: I mean to bring her some day. . . It is very pleasant here. Would you like to see her? She is the best girl in the world."
               Tom would have said as much of Susan at any time, and Susan is sure of it, and she asks with increasing interest—"Is your sister as old as you?"
               "Older—a year. Her name is Leah. The doctor said you had no sister. I must make you acquainted with Leah."
               They were now sitting in the tiny front room of the cabin. Horace Chilton beside the window looking out, and watchful of the progress of the storm; Susan in the back-ground, observant of his face, the jetty mass of hair pushed up into a pyramid from his smooth, well-shaped, though neither high nor broad forehead, admiring the rows of dazzling white teeth that glittered through his smiles.
               "You gave the doctor a good deal of trouble, did you know it?" said he, turning from the window towards her. "He nearly gave you up two or three times."
               "Are you a physician?"
               Unfortunate curiosity! But how should Susan rightly understand his silence? She was about to repeat the question when he burst out,
               "No; I was born for an architect. But what of that?"
               Here he paused; and so disconcerted was poor Susan by the vehemence of his exclamation, that she made no attempt to decide about his what of that? And there was no need of her speaking, for this was manifestly the theme of his day's and night's meditation; another as prolific could not have been broached in Horace Chilton's hearing.
               "What if I was? I must be a surgeon."
               "Why?"
               "Oh, because nature gave me considerable skill for putting things together; straight lines, and curved lines, and thoughts, and so on. Don't you think such things are pleasanter to work at than bones? I loathe the very thought. But of course I'm weak and foolish, and all that; people have told me so often enough, but I hate it."
               "Why don't you leave then?"
               "Because some folks think they have a call to beat nature out of a body. Do you understand?"
               "No."
               "Well, no matter. I am glad you can't. How should you? It's a hard thing to fight against the whole world. There are some folks who won't be shown a thing—you might as well try to coax water up a hill. You can't do it, and where's the sense of trying?"
               "Do you mean me?" asked Susan with a vague, disagreeable idea that he meant something, but for the life of her she could not guess what.
               "You! no. If you knew of any one who thought he was born to do any particular thing I guess you'd tell him to do it, would n't you?"
               "Yes indeed—I should be delighted."
               "Of course you would."
               "Is n't your sister on your side?"
               "She has enough of her own to attend to."
               "What?"
               "Her school, for instance."
               Here was a thought, and eagerly Susan seized it. If Mr. Leighton utterly refused to give her his books, or in any way to teach her, she could go up to Harlem; she had only to speak the word to her father; she knew he would be glad to have her go.
               "Does she like it?"
               "Yes, just as she would any work that brought pay."
               "But," he continued, "she is about as fit for that business as I am for selling pills and soda water, sixpence a box, three cents a glass! or as you would be for cutting out dresses or playing with dolls! I think I see you doing that! I'll wager you never had a doll in your life—if you had you never found out what to do with it. I shall be what my father was."
               "I hope you will!" said Susan, with all her heart. He seemed so in earnest and so unhappy, that she who had borne many sorrows could but sympathize with him in his trouble. Especially with his impatient spirit that fretted so against the obstacles that impeded its ambition.
               "But my mother don't," said he half angrily. "She has n't any faith. She says it was just so in my father's time. There were just such dreams and talk, she says. And that we all know what came of it."
               "I never heard," said Susan, innocently.
               "Did n't you? then I'll tell you—poverty! disgrace! and the preacher said, as if this was n't enough, 'the deep damnation of a drunken husband'—but the preacher was an idiot—they are all idiots, and my father was a great man, a noble man. Just so great a man, Miss Susan, that I never saw the person that knew enough to judge him. I know what people said—they could blame him—it don't require a very remarkable genius to do that, but they couldn't understand him. They never understood him; nobody did"—he began his speech in a loud, strong, impetuous voice, but it was trembling, broken, before he ended it.
               "Will you give up your place at the Doctor's, then?" asked Susan, wonderfully interested.
               "No! but I will"—he stopped short, and looked at Susan as if he wondered at himself that he should speak in such a strain to her. It was verily out of the abundance of his heart that his mouth had spoken, and his audience had not much to do with inciting the utterance. Yet he went on, even after he had recalled himself.
               "I'll just waste my best years in doing what I hate to do," said he, bitterly; "but after that's all over—all over you know—" he continued in a different spirit and an altered voice, "old and gray I may be, but I shall not forget the words my father said to me when he polished his tools the last time. I helped him do it. He said—" here he stopped, "nobody knows what he said, but me. . . . I think we shall be first rate friends, or else I've made a great fool of myself telling all this stuff to you, Miss Susan. . . . Never mind, wait till you see my sister. The storm is going over, I think."
               Figuratively, as well as otherwise, this was true; and the youth walked to the door of the cabin to make an observation of the heavens. He was gone longer than seemed quite needful for this; when he came back both storms were out of sight.
               "The rain will return soon," said he, composedly; looking in at the door of the little room. "Good night. I must go while I can." Hardly waiting for an answer he again went out, and Susan following him as far as the door looked, and saw him passing up among the rocks, away beyond her sight.
            
            
               IX.
               WE will betake ourselves from the sea-side. There is time for us before nightfall to make a brief excursion from Walter Dillon's lonely cabin, northward twelve miles, to St. John's, the town of the Baldwins, and a few thousand worthy people beside.
               It is drawing towards the close of this spring-day. The world at St. John's is like a beautiful, but only half-furnished house; heaven is bright and cloudless, earth green and fair, but many a tree-branch is yet barren of verdure, and the air is keen and cold.
               Towards the heart of the city, upon its verge, is a garden, not large nor elegant, kept up by its owner for practical rather than ornamental purposes. The market is supplied with some of its choicest fruits, and the flower-stands with their best treasures, from this spot. But beyond the great beds where these things are cultivated, are broad, smooth walks, well shaded by tall, majestic trees; and these paths are rarely frequented.
               The light of the declining sun gilds now only the highest tree-tops, and the path nearest the western wall lies in a deep shadow. Two persons only are walking there to-night; they accompany each other. One of them is shrouded in the heavy funereal garments of a nun,—is she mourning for the world that she has lost?—her home is the convent just beyond this wall; the other is a younger person, by her voice, and step, and manner—these are our sole sureties of the fact, for her face is hidden, as well as that of her companion, by a veil.
               Half an hour before they met upon this walk and began the conversation, and the elder of the two was now saying:
               "You are too young to believe such things; why do you say them?"
               "Because I do so deeply feel them. Am I to blame for my youth? Age brings wisdom they say. If I am believing just those things that the more experienced assort in their age as true, why am I not a fit subject for your congratulation?" This voice speaks hurriedly, almost with impatience, but the tone is qualified by the very sadness of its disquiet.
               "Because," returned her companion, "because it is so unnatural. Youth without the illusions common to the season, seems so almost monstrous. Time brings wisdom with it, usually—granted. Age reaches the conclusions you have drawn from life in your youth—true. I acknowledge, you are preserved thus from many a bitter disappointment; but it is such unnatural wisdom. Youth is surely the time for dreaming." Sweet and subdued, yet deeply earnest, was this voice.
               Somewhat colder, and yet stirred by emotion with difficulty controlled, was the tone of the answerer.
               "I do not conceive it so. Life, it seems to me, is too sublime to be tricked out in tawdry finery; forgive me, illusions, as you call them. I had rather look upon it face to face, not through transparencies, beautiful though they may be.
               It is Stella Cammon that says this. Poor Tom or Susan would hardly have recognized the voice; and the philosophy it spoke would have sorely perplexed them.
               "Then—then assuredly the convent is no place for you. I have told you so again and again. Every word you speak satisfies me of it. Bear with me; be not impatient;" gently the veiled figure laid her hand on Stella's arm; "would I say this, think you, if I had not your happiness at heart? You are the only one, the only human one who has so stirred its depths for years. Would I say it—I who have proved both the world and the church! I tell you, dear child, your place is in the world. You are not able to drink this cup. The blessed Jesu knows it; he will not give it you. Do not lament—"
               Abruptly the younger woman interrupted the soft pleading of the elder.
               
               "Lamentation is an insult to life. . . . I am not so ignorant. . . . Life I would honor."
               "And the world is very beautiful to you, I am sure—I am sure that it is."
               "Nature—unutterably."
               "And besides, activity is a positive law of your being."
               "And where shall a woman find a better sphere for activities than in that you have chosen? Religion and law both protect you. No one hinders you in your work—men look upon you as sacred, set apart."
               "There is a truth, a most precious truth in what you say. Jesu! master! blessed master, thanks! thanks!" Faint and troubled was the voice—one to remind of a bird with spent wing, struggling among dark waves. "But the truth does not apply to you" Stronger grew the utterance. "Your aspirations are so high and pure, your aim so—holy—oh, remain where they may prove contagious to others in your sphere. I entreat you, in the name of the blessed Virgin and her Son, be wise! attempt not that which you were never designed to do. There are other ways for you to sacrifice—this is not your appointed way, believe me."
               The Church opens her arms, yes, even for me! why will you stand in the way?" No very teachable spirit was it expostulating thus.
               "For the dear sake of Christ."
               "I am not worthy, then?"
               "No; none are worthy."
               "And yet, is worthiness the question, the point, holy mother?"
               The nun quickened her pace, and did not speak. The young girl followed after, but not so silently.
               "What does he require—our Divine Master, but utter self-abnegation—crucifixion of all within us that wars against him? If I have made some conquests in the way to this point, he, I know, regards them favorably. You, it seems, are the last obstacle."
               "Tell me then, be candid, not as to a confessor—you have not sought me as such, and of course that would not be admissible—does nothing but the love of Christ—oh search well your heart—impel you to this step? I do not ask you in my own name. I have nothing to do with it. But, if I might, I would help you to an exact knowledge of your position in reference to Him. We all need such helps. Are you not wronging yourself? Do not, do not be offended," she entreated, "it is only for your own sake."
               With a quick, impatient movement, the young girl drew her shawl more closely about her. Well for her the thick green veil she wore hid her flashing eyes and flushed face from observation. No meek saint for passing life before a shrine, and in humble deeds of charity, was she. In the swift walk along the shadowed and darkening path she took the lead—her purpose seemed to fly, yet suddenly she paused.
               "The Church is more cruel than the world," she said, bitterly, "if this is the manner of welcome she extends to those who would be her children."
               "Well you know it is not;" replied the nun, her voice expressing much grief but none of indignation. "At any moment you can find admission within these walls. But, I have read in your eyes, and in your voice, facts you may not even dream of. For you never dream? Changed circumstances, or even the passing of a brief season, would quite alter your determination, and your desire. All the world cannot retreat into convents; it were better for you to remain without and work among those who never so much as think of sacrificing in any way, either for God or man. . . The night is falling rapidly. It will be late for you to go home alone. Kiss me, dear child, and tell me that I have not offended you."
               The young girl, with an impetuous movement, threw aside her veil. The mournful entreaty of that voice was more than she could withstand. Her face, pale, but glorious, shone out like a sunbeam from a cloud—the eyes that gazed upon her from beneath the black veil filled with tears. "Remember, it is for Jesu's sake," she murmured, as for an instant she held Stella Cammon in her embrace, and then she turned away, and sought the gate that opened nearest to the convent portal.
            
            
               X.
               HALF an hour later, the figure that hurried from the garden, and up the street, a long way past the confused mass of people that thronged the business portion of the city, had found her way into a quiet house in a quiet street, and, prostrate on the floor of her bolted chamber, was lying before an ebony crucifix that hung upon the wall, almost its solitary ornament.
               Her shawl and bonnet were throne aside, upon the floor beside her;—it was a figure full of grace and dignity, and of passion too. The large blue eyes shaded by the long lashes did not look like eyes made for seeing life, as she had boasted, in its grandeur of barrenness, stripped of illusions—they were loving, and brave, and fiery, yet at times strangely, mournfully tender; the red full lips were not those of an ascetic, meant for lavishing kisses of devotion only on the sacred rosary! . . Vigor and strength were in every movement. The passion of this deep abasement of herself before that tranquil cross on which the Divine one was uplifted, was such passion, just such passion as might have swayed her in a wild rapture through the mazes of the most bewildering dance. And yet, she had spoken earnestly, spoken truly, when she declared her scorn for the delights with which the worldly, among whom her lot was cast, cheated themselves, and toyed with time, and made a mock and a lie of the religion they professed, by their heart's monstrous infidelity, as shown forth in their false, ungodly lives.
               The question which the nun had asked pierced and probed her heart. Why sought she the convent security? Whichever way her thoughts turned, they met that question—asked now not by another, but projecting itself from her own mind.
               In the silence of her chamber she reads the letter that has lain like an iron weight on her mind all day.
               It was crushed in her hand even now as bowed thus she silently prayed, and from prayer leaped to meditation, and struggled and battled as a soul that is contending for life must needs do, ere it comes to the quiet security of the heights of peace.
               She has thought, oftentimes, of the convent—thought of it as a place of retreat best fitted, of all places, for herself. But not of late; this morning this letter came and aroused anew perplexing questions which have already too much agitated her. If she were only assured of herself, if she had not already come to a disquieting distrust of that self; but it may be fear—yet no coward is she—is it devotion that impels her that way?
               A voice calls her from below, but she does not hear it; a step is on the stair, but it falls unheeded. She is reaping in a harvest, the seed of which her own hand planted; in expostulating anguish she cries out to God—but she has sown and must reap.
               There is now a tap at the door, to which also she at first seems deaf. But when it is repeated, she lifts up herself from supplication. Is this the same face? It is the face that last night shone conspicuous in a gay and brilliant company—this is Stella Cammon, whose destiny seems to be that of a ball-room belle.
               "Come in," she says carelessly; but no word that she can say falls idly on the ear that waits without to hear. It is the most musical, the richest voice the listener ever heard.
               "So I would," says the gay voice of the outsider; "of course I should be delighted to obey you, since I am here on purpose to come in. But, my darling, you will in the first place be compelled to open the door. I'm not spiritual enough to progress through a key-hole, though I can 'rap' to perfection. Hear me!" and there was a vigorous demonstration from the medium outside.
               Slowly Stella moves across the room, withdraws the bolt, and finds herself instantly caught by the waist, and whirled about the room in an insane dance, until the incomer is glad to drop with her unresisting burden to the floor.
               "I watched for you to come," said the visitor, almost breathless with her exploit; "and I wanted to see you; but don't get a light, I can see you just as well in the dark: better too, I guess," and so saying, she gently passed her hand, not the smallest, nor yet the whitest in the world, over Stella's face, like a child feeling for its mother in the dark.
               And while they sit there, side by side, upon the floor in the centre of the apartment, through the shade we must attempt to decipher the new face. It is not her figure that is most erect; the form that was bowed but now in the prostration of agony, the lonely and rent heart, is that which looks stateliest in the shadow; her face shines out whitest; her eyes are larger, more brilliant, their light is intense. Her voice, too, when she speaks, is stronger, deeper: it thrills you. At times it might command you. It might ring out defiant, or despairing, and either tone would be terrible; but it could not burst forth ever in such mirth as leaps in the utterance of the girl whose head is resting on her knee, who is looking up into her face so lovingly.
               Lucia, Stella calls her—Lucia Tree is a tall, slight figure, angular and awkward, one might think who only saw her in repose. But see the form in motion, that was a stupid guess to hazard, for she moves free and joyous, unconstrained, unconcerned, not with state or proud dignity, nor with overwhelming majesty, but to the time of a swift and merry tune.
               The abundant dark brown hair growing low upon the broad, smooth forehead, is tastelessly arranged; no mirror has ever lured her to a deliberate, critical examination of herself, one might think. She would have laughed at the story of Narcissus, and the flush upon her face, the glow of honest mirth, could not be mistaken for a consciousness that the story was capable of a modern rendering, and application. You can see that she is disposed to make the very least, or the very worst of herself; that is, if you cannot see that herself is the last thing that she ever thinks of. It is a sweet, pure face—the delicacy and refinement of the mouth and nostril, the "meek and tender eyes," brown and soft, full of all human sympathies, and betrayant of the insight of a genuine warm heart. That is all.
               "What sent you up into this dry and barren land tonight?" asked Stella.
               "To talk, to be sure, I've seen so much, and heard so much to-day—that—"
               "That you have become quite compassionate, and desire to share the good things. Well, spread the feast—I need refreshment."
               "Where's Aunt Judith?"
               
               "Is she not below?"
               "I did not see her."
               "Gone to prayers, probably. Has the bell rung?"
               "Yes, half an hour ago. Were you going out?"
               "No; what is it you have seen to-day?"
               "In the first place a man who has practiced two thousand one hundred and ninety hours, and proved what we used to believe in when we wrote in our copy-book, never since, I guess, if faith proves itself in acts, that practice makes perfect."
               "Well, you have succeeded in rousing my curiosity. What next? as the children say. Go on with your story."
               "Think first—you don't seem to appreciate—think of a man balancing an artificial tree two feet high on his nose! birds in the branches of that tree, and he shooting them down, one by one, with a pop-gun in his mouth."
               "Oh miracle of genius!"
               "Three hours every day for two years, and he said nothing about 'Sundays excepted.' He is the man! and wisdom will die with him. But I've seen somebody more wonderful yet, and you must guess for him."
               "Don't bother me."
               "I'm dumb."
               "No, no; go on—who have you seen?"
               "Layard, or his ghost. I thought he was in Naples. Aint you surprised now? Do say yes."
               "He left Naples in January," answered Stella with indifference, but, with a quick motion, her hand pressed close against her heart—the letter was secure in its hiding place.
               "Then it was he; you know everything, don't you, Stella? You knew he was coming?"
               "Not quite everything. If I did, I should understand you a little better."
               "Me!" True to herself, Lucia laughed to hear this.
               "Me!" she repeated more thoughtfully. "Am I so deep?"
               "You are very happy."
               "Happy! . . . Yes, I believe I am, Stella."
               "And what makes you, Lucia?"
               "Because I'm weak, foolish, you know. I might be happier I suppose, but I'm happy enough. Don't ask me anything more about it. I'm always afraid of you when you begin to be wise."
               "I feel unusually wise to-night, so perhaps you had better be off."
               "I came to tell you something," said Lucia, speaking low, and drawing yet nearer to her friend.
               "Did you?" in a whisper answered Stella.
               "And I don't know how to begin. But I must, for Will is n't coming for me yet awhile, and if I give you a chance to talk you will frighten me to death—and—and—I wish to goodness I had stayed at home. Stella Cammon, what sort of a body are you? I think of you from morning till night when I am at home. But the minute I come to you, I wish myself a thousand miles off."
               "Don't talk so, Lucia, if you love me."
               "If I love you! I love you better than I love everything in the world, or out of it. And yet you are so far above me—so—so—everything that I am not, I wonder at it."
               "There, on that wall," said Stella, pointing towards the place where the crucifix hung, "is a thought that rebukes you for saying such things. There is no such darkness between your soul and Him as—as this in the room. Do not love me so."
               "I will—for I must. He made you; why should I not see and love His work?"
               "I know not any other reason except the desperate foolishness of the venture."
               
               "But if we love not those we have seen, how shall we love Him whom we have not seen?" persisted the loving Lucia.
               "Do you love me that I am His?"
               "Don't ask me," said Lucia in momentary perplexity—but the difficulty dissolved. "Yes! it must be so! because you are so grand and noble. Yes, certainly, because you are His! If you were not His, you would be different; and if you were different, I should not love you so."
               Stella did not even smile at the readiness with which Lucia argued her way to this conclusion. She was on the track of another thought.
               "And I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men after me. . . Christ said that. Does it not imply that we for His sake must be crucified in our hearts? Oh, Christ! it is a hard saying, but it is worthy of all acceptation. If less hard it would be less worthy." Then turning quickly to Lucia, as if possessed of some fear that made her hasten to speak, she said, "You always go to confession, Lucia?"
               "Oh yes, always. And I have something to confess in good earnest next Sunday. But I am going to tell you of it first," said Lucia, hastening now to speak where she had hesitated before, for the strain in which Stella had indulged was not that to which she best liked to listen.
               "You may tell me, but do not forget the father. And I know not that I have any right to hear it—perhaps it were better to wait until after Sunday."
               "You may play deaf, if you can be so cruel. I'm going to begin," rejoined Lucia. . . . "We are having our house painted. I should like the city to know it, for it has stood in need long enough. But we have all lost our senses with the fuss and clatter. And the odor is most odious. Come over to-morrow if you want to see a small Babel—not so very small either. Now I have begun. . . This morning I was finishing a drawing. I wanted to get it done before the men came, for they were to work at the hall where I keep my things. And do you think, Stella,—it was exceedingly rude, and it surprised me so that I did n't take half as much delight in the man who had practiced the two thousand one hundred and ninety hours for our edification, as I should have done by good right,—while I was there at work, there was n't a soul stirring above the basement, up came the young man who has driven on so like a giant, the leader of that mob of painters—I neither saw nor heard him, for I was hard at work, till he came within a foot of my table. You should have been there to have given him a look! As for me, I did my best, but he was as immovable as rock—never retreated an inch, so I got up and began to collect my papers. I know, of course, I should have sat still, and very coolly asked him what he wanted, but it was n't my way; and what do you think the barbarian said? 'Young lady, it would afford me great pleasure to examine your work.'. . . Stella, what do you suppose induced me to put back my drawing on the table, and open my portfolio? And what under heaven was it that possessed me to tell him that I painted the little child's head hanging framed above the table? I don't think he said a word about them, praise or blame, but he talked about pictures as if he knew more about them than I ever dreamed of. . . But the worst of it is to come—there is not anything so very heinous in what I have told you, is there Stella?"
               "I am not so wise as to see it."
               "He said that he was once very fond of sketching, and he would bring up some of his drawings at noon to show me. I don't remember quite about that either, but suppose I must have said 'yes,' or something or other that meant the same thing, for he brought them up. And—and—I want you should see them, for I've got them yet. I promised—at least I said he might leave them, because he had no safe place for them, and I knew, at least I verily believe there never was such an absurdity in the world as I am, for it has troubled me to death ever since to think of. Do tell me if I have fallen into 'deadly error.'"
               "Does your mother know it?"
               "Not she."
               "Nor your father, Lucia?"
               "Father! no."
               "But Will does?"
               "Not a soul of them."
               "Then go home and tell them of it the first thing."
               "If you say I must, why I must."
               "I say so a hundred times over, if there's any danger of your forgetting it. There is no use of your making yourself miserable by keeping such a thing as that to yourself. It amounts to nothing, of course. But it might. Less sparks than that have made a great commotion. Betake yourself to your friends; you need not wait for our good father in God, Heaven bless his honest old soul! to tell you to do it, for it is just what he would bid you, and you yourself know it is what you ought to do. Don't go now immediately to fancying that you have committed an unpardonable sin, for you have not. But you might some day, how or why of course I cannot see, but you might wish you had saved yourself a world of vexation by doing such a simple thing as this. Shall we go down and visit aunt? I heard her come in just now."
               "Stella, you are the wisest woman in the world; I shall confess to you always."
               "No, no, I entreat. The priest is better—better for many reasons—I could fill a book with them. And besides THE CHURCH—says so; if you doubt me."
               "It's strange how much I love you though, when you always put me back so, saying such things, and keeping me at such a distance; you never kissed me except when you could n't help it. You are not at all like Violet. You are more like Miss Watson—and you are not the least like her. I wish you were poor. I wish you were terribly off in some way; ugly looking, for instance, so that everybody would hate you; and then!—"
               "Why then you would do as everybody else did, would you not?"
               "If I were very unhappy, would you let me into your heart then, I wonder?"
               "Those who love best, do they ask a return? are they not satisfied in giving their affection?"
               "No. Did you meet Miss Watson out last night?"
               "Yes."
               "That's Will's knock—he said I must be ready, for he cannot come in to-night," said Lucia, starting up. Stella followed her.
               "It s not Will," she said, as they descended the stairs, and the rap of the street door was repeated. For a moment she stopped irresolute; "but we will go down to aunt," she said with decision.
               As Stella and Lucia entered the drawing-room, the servant admitted into the hall the new-comer, who was immediately after announced in the presence of Miss Judith Mar and her young companions, as Mr. De Lisle Layard.
            
            
               XI.
               MISS JUDITH MAR, surprised from her habitual self-control so far as to rise hurriedly at this announcement, and perform half the distance between her sewing-table and the door through which Layard advances, suddenly finds herself at a stand still, looking up into the face of an elegant, exquisite personage, who, smiling his thanks at her surprise and manifest delight, stoops with the grace of a courtier, and the freedom of a son, to salute her.
               It is the boy she used to bribe into church-going, to whom she taught the catechism; it is no easy thing for her to take a survey of this prodigy of growth and grace, and receive him in her arms at once. She does better: she takes him to her heart, and stands back that she may the better see and admire him, a tribute the young gentleman seems all-willing to receive; and still his keen eyes are glancing in another direction, for as he entered the apartment he was quick to see that Miss Judith was not its sole occupant.
               Stella too has risen, and is smiling—and is withal somewhat surprised, notwithstanding the letter of announcement she that morning received. Is this Layard?
               He is bolder in his questioning, bolder too in his discerning glances. As he hastens up to her, he says, as if for her ear only, that he cannot mistake; but one, of all women, could wear the face she wears, and yet, is it Stella? It is his tribute, not his doubt, that speaks thus—and the tribute is an honest one—and Stella receives it; but how? not with the fluttering of a young girl's heart, but with the calm dignity of experience, somewhat too coldly, however, even for the mere courtesy of the occasion.
               Instructed by travel and extended intercourse with the world, De Lisle Layard is not the man idly to betray his thoughts and impulses. He has seen nothing in the glancing of the proud eyes turned towards him—heard nothing in the greeting of her voice—detected nothing in the carelessness with which, for an instant, the hand he had taken rested in his—in all these demonstrations perceived nothing less than a cordial welcome to him on his return from long travel. Because he chose not to do so.
               In busy talk the evening wears away. Descriptions of places, anecdote, adventure, these topics animate his discourse, and hour after hour the tide of his eloquent talk rolls on.
               Aunt Judith is responsive as an echo while she listens; her eyes and her hands come into the service. More animated listener, and more rejoicing, speaker never had.
               At rare intervals Stella, by some word or question, proves that she too is listening, though, as she bends over her work, her attention seems absorbed in it.
               At rare intervals De Lisle Layard turns toward her and addresses her by name; but so rarely, while his attention appears to be exclusively confined to the elder lady, that it seems merely a courteous recognition of Stella's presence that induces him to speak thus.
               The surprise in their meeting is with him, not with her; his stature and dignity does not astonish her, she has seen him thus in her imagination for years. But her grace and beauty startle him. He never looked for anything like this in her. In spite of his complimentary address, there is nothing in the woman of which the child had given token. The once passive face is alive now with intelligence and spirit; the features are the same, but the changed expression has wholly changed them. A pretty child transformed into a woman, whose full growth of womanhood is as yet unattained—this is what meets his eyes, and he feels the influence of her presence as he had not thought he should.
               During the evening, Miss Mar being called from the room for a moment, he said, somewhat curious to hear the answer,
               "I wrote to you, saying that I should soon be home, but I did not anticipate that I should have the pleasure of seeing you so soon. I have outrun my letter, I believe?"
               "No; I received it this morning," answered Stella with indifference.
               "It was pleasant to see Miss Mar's surprise. She evidently was not looking for her little boy!"
               "I had neglected to inform her of your letter, I believe." Careless and cold, in word, yet it was not rudely spoken, but courteously—the perfect melody of her voice, her slow utterance prolonging the delicious music, did not lessen the surprise with which Mr. Layard listened to her, and surveyed her.
               "You do not give me a cordial welcome, Stella. Who would think I had but just come home after a four years' absence? You make my heart ache—you chill me. I thought I should take you in my arms as I did the day that I went away. You suffer me to come no nearer than if you were a queen, and I the merest vassal."
               "Nay, that is your mistake, Layard," said Stella, quickly. "Aunt, am I not glad to have De Lisle back again?" Miss Mar was just re-entering the room.
               "You should be, my dear," said Miss Judith, pleasantly. It seemed as if the smile with which she had first greeted Layard was now fixed in her features, they had all caught the sunshine.
               "And you know, aunt, that I am invariably all that I should be."
               "You will stay with us De Lisle—you have come home," said Miss Mar, nodding and smiling, and then turning from Stella to Layard.
               "I have taken rooms at Pinckney's, dear aunt, but this is home, as you truly say, and as I was but just now saying to Miss Cammon. But my stay here may be but brief."
               "Brief, De Lisle, what do you mean? Father Francis told me that you were to be professor in the new college—professor of languages."
               "I have that plan in view, and yet have not quite decided."
               "If your other plan will take you away from us, I beseech you, no my son, I command you, put it away from your mind instantly."
               Now, reader, Miss Mar was a lady of large fortune, and no young man of expensive tastes and habits would be likely to hear a request issuing from her lips as friend and counsellor, and specially as one filling a maternal capacity, with perfect indifference. Certainly, Layard was not so disposed. He was well satisfied that she should speak her mind so freely.
               "I will come and lay my cause before you in the morning," said he, bowing, and preparing to withdraw.
               "But you remain," asked Miss Mar. "Did you not say so?"
               "In heart madam, dear aunt, always. But this body of mine, unfortunately, must play guard over innumerable packages, bandboxes, and bundles—many trophies of travel. I have, seriously, a large collection of curiosities, put up in every imaginable form, which I must look after. I was far too eager to greet you all to provide a safe place for them before I came to you, and now that I have seen you I must return to them; they have cost me great perplexities and trials by land and by sea."
               "If you can find no safer place for them, De Lisle, why you can use my house for store-house, or lumber-room, home besides, anything you will. 54 John street, recollect, is so far at your service."
               "I have as yet met none of my old friends. Coming up the street to-night, I felt quite the stranger in a strange land—more lonely than in any foreign town. You have made me happy—that seems to be your peculiar privilege— I remember it of you from a child. Wherever I am then, I may call this place my home."
               Miss Mar, herself too much affected by his words, too overjoyed by the improved and very handsome presence of the youth, who, from a child, had been the model of perfection to her mind, could not survey him, or his words, with the least approach to critical acumen. Stella could. Her faith in him had waned before he went abroad; it had continually declined; it did not revive nor strengthen now. In all this courtly speech she saw and heard other thoughts than was possible for Miss Judith; while she saw and heard, she doubted both the seeing and the hearing. What led her to judge thus? why not listen and take his words for honest utterances? why not give him welcome as once she would have done? Well she remembered the time when she would have welcomed joyously a return like this. But now it is different. She cross-examines herself, questions and re-questions herself, continually. Between the swiftness and the subtlety of her apprehensions, and the doubts of afterthought, Stella Cammon contrives to keep herself for the greater part of her time in a maze of bewilderment.
               That was true of her, we know, before De Lisle Layard returned from his travels, and now it seems doubly true of her.
            
            
               XII.
               MEANTIME Lucia Tree had appeared on the sidewalk, where she stood, waiting the advance of her brother, whose coming she descried from the window.
               "Will! bless you! is that you? Come on, I should have gone alone in a minute more. Mr. Layard has come, and I am escaped to tell thee. But I crept out in true coward fashion."
               "Are you going home?"
               "Yes, but I'm in no such hurry—don't you see what a lovely night it is? It is too pleasant to go in doors."
               "And especially when there is no more to go to than you and I have. If you ever hear that Mortimer Maurice,—the devil take his fine name, he took all the rest of the man long ago!—I say if you hear of his being tripped up in the street, and dirked one of these fine nights, you need never say that you heard me threaten anything of the kind."
               "Talk about something pleasanter, Will. Let's go and see Violet. Where is Mr. Silsey, now-a-days?"
               "In his study, I suppose."
               "Shall we go?"
               "Anything you say."
               "But you are too tired, perhaps?"
               "March on. If we went home I should go to bed, and consequently sleep ten hours on a stretch, which would be abhorrent to nature. But a bed is the only comfortable spot to be found in our house. Lucia, why was not Rose like you?"
               "Poor Rose!" sighed Lucia; "she has the kindest heart—and such a horrid fortune!"
               "Heart! She is no woman at all—fiddlesticks! heart! She's a beast!"
               "She is a woman, and your own sister, Will, at all events!" said Lucia, indignantly.
               "We won't talk about her. We are worse off than orphan beggars, you and I. We have nothing but each other."
               "Will, that painter, Vane, they called him, working for father, brought some sketches of his own drawing for me to look at to-day."
               "He is a prodigious fellow—all nerve and muscle. Did you ever see such a little grass-hopper? What sort of drawings?"
               "I will show them to you," said Lucia, now quite unburdened of her secret, and speaking freely, and quite gaily, she felt so relieved. "He looked at my work, he saw it in the hall."
               "And what did he say?" asked Will, trying to be interested.
               "Nothing. But he must have thought it pretty good, or he would not have offered to show me his."
               "I don't know about that; perhaps he meant to pull down your vanity about your ears, by showing you how much better he could do them than you."
               "I know better," answered Lucia; but Will's words had made an impression.
               Arm in arm the brother and sister went, slowly sauntering up the avenues of trees through the most retired portion of the city.
               There had been a heavy shower late in the afternoon, and the freshened foliage was heavy with rain-drops, which, here and there gathering under some moon-ray, glittered like diamonds. The moon and stars, seen through the purified atmosphere, seemed gazing down upon the streets through grand corridors of perfume. One might have fancied that it was the heavenly light that communicated the subtle delicacies and odors to the air.
               "A roof is a useless thing, such a night as this," said Lucia, softly, as if unwilling to break the silence of the street, which, notwithstanding groups of people strolling here and there, was almost noiseless;—the purity and exceeding beauty of the night acted like a spell upon them.
               "And a cursed thing, too, if nothing but hell is to be found under it," responded Will, with a savage sort of bitterness bursting free from the soothing spell.
               "Oh, why do you say such things, Will? They don't help us any when they are said; they only make us sadder—not a bit wiser. It is fearful to hear you say such things in an hour like this—it is so beautiful here."
               "That is the very reason why I say it; nature is so beautiful, and life, our life at least, such an empty, vile thing. It is the contrast. I don't like it; it's too sharp. We are in heaven out here—I know that as well as you; but in the house back there, we're in another place. This is Silsey's boarding-house; but shall we go in tonight?"
               "No, I think not; the house looks dark and warm," said Lucia, reading in Will's question his disinclination to go in.
               "Why did Mr. Silsey leave the office, Will? Can he live without work?"
               "There's not a man that works harder at this moment than he. He quit the office in disgust, I believe, on account of the practice, or the practitioners, that's my guess."
               "It is a disagreeable profession, is it not, Will?"
               "Wait till you see what I make of it," he answered, proudly, "Disagreeable!—well—yes, as you say, it may be on some accounts; but you must serve an apprenticeship in every trade, and to be in the service of Justice, a champion of truth, a defender and expounder of human rights,—there is nothing so very disagreeable in that, is there? And then, think what a man must do, and be, in himself, before he begins to do in order to insure success. Every noble mental quality and moral virtue must be trained and exercised. A. man who can sway a jury, and command men by his eloquence and powers to a strict administration, that man can't be a very small one, Lucia. Men are born lawyers as well as born poets. There's a class of mind, acute, far-reaching orderly, and comprehensive, which is peculiarly fitted for the service of the goddess of Justice. I have a career; and the honors and pleasures belonging to it are enough for me. Mr. Silsey did not like the profession. He studied it too late, I suppose; he can't submit to the detail, the drudgery. These things would not look so small to him, if he really liked the labor in its development any better than in its beginning. But I'm afraid his new enterprise won't pay. It is important, but it will take half a century at least to convince the world, or even this city, of it. He will have to live on his theories till the time comes up to him; and most likely when it comes, it will have the opportunity of halting a moment by his grave with its tribute. As for Violet and the baby, it will not be so easy for them to live on such fare as it is for him. Milk and meat have more nourishment in them for children and women than the east wind of a philosopher's theory. Have you seen Violet?"
               "Not in several days."
               "She is like a shadow. And people say she would be happier if Miss Watson were not in the house."
               "Why, Will?"
               "Why, Will?—why?" Will hesitated; "because she would feel a little more sure of a hold on Silsey's affections."
               A crimson, painful flush, that deepened and glowed in the face of Lucia, and more than this, the honest outbreak from her heart, told how she received this bit of boarding-house scandal.
               "It looks likely that there's a word of truth in that! Miss Watson is a prodigious smart woman, and knows everything. Violet says so, and Silsey likes to talk with her. I've heard him many a time; but he loves the look of Violet's eyes better than all Miss Watson's wisdom; and I saw him myself one night—though I've no right to tell it—crying over the baby. He admires Miss Watson, but he loves his wife. No one in that house, however, except the three people whose business it is, could know the difference between a man's admiring and respecting another woman's talents and his loving his wife. Will, I am ashamed of you."
               "Oh, pooh! Lucia, you talk like a dear young innocent, just as you are. Boarding-house people are—why, you may just consider the world a boarding-house—and the people in it who mind their own business are the exceptions. The people in this particular corner of the great concern are very wise people, no doubt, and they say that—"
               "You need not repeat it, if you please. I don't want to see you a scandal-monger, William Tree."
               "You know nothing about Silsey, Lucia."
               "But I know all about Violet."
               And evidently Lucia's instinctive faith in Violet's loving influence was greater than Will's in Miss Watson's intellectual supremacy, for he was content to drop the subject here, and to drop it with no intention of taking up another; but at a corner of the street, as they turned to retrace their steps, they met the painter Vane and Pucelli, the fawning Italian proprietor of the St. John's Gallery of Art, in whose schools Lucia Tree had studied. With whom we will leave them, and return ourselves to the beach.
            
            
               XIII.
               BUT a few days after Mr. Baldwin had left with Susan that unwelcome promise of a repetition of his visit with his children, while the fisherman in the shed back of his cabin worked at his net, mending the yesterday's rent, and his daughter standing by him gave such assistance as she might, there came suddenly the sound of carriage-wheels upon the silence.
               "Go out and see what that means," said the old man to Susan.
               With a foreboding of what it meant that hardly required proving, Susan obeyed, returning the next instant with the tidings that it was Mr. Baldwin's carriage.
               "Go then, and meet the folks," said her father, looking up in surprise, as he tied a knot, that she should need telling. But he met instead an anxious glance that he very well understood when he saw her going into the house, instead of doing his bidding. And so he left his work and went out himself, to greet his guests with that hearty welcome which invariably awaited. Mr. Baldwin when he appeared at the beach.
               Poor Susan, quite taken aback, now that the thing she most dreaded was actually come upon her, once safe within the house lost all self-possession, and instead of hastening away while there was yet time, to array herself in her black camlet dress, and better shoes, and cleaner cap, waited in the entry in all the poverty of her every-day apparelling, until her father, throwing open the house door, in a loud voice called his child to come and greet Miss Dora.
               Thus summoned, Susan went out, with many a misgiving, especially intensified by that prefix heralding the announcement of Isidore's name. Never till this day had she been other than plain Dora with old Walter. What transformation could have taken place in her during the five years that had passed since she had been down to the beach, that he should be calling her Miss Dora?
               Why, she was a pretty and wilful child in those days, wearing a child's short clothes, and flowing ringlets. In those times she had managed the fisherman and his children quite in a way to please herself. Masters, and governesses, and boarding school government, had since then had to do with her exclusively. The five years had been busy working wonders. It seemed wonderful to Susan when she came out from the cottage, that they had ever called her Dora; the girl was a Lady. The very Aphrodite she had watched and waited for so long.
               Where she had alighted from the carriage, there she still stood, and an innumerable company with her; so it seemed to Susan. We are looking now through her eyes. With her bonnet in her hand she stood, her light, glossy curls tossing in the breeze, or lying softly against her fair, but haughty face. Gazing about her in an indolent delight, smiling and chatting in the midst of the group of which she was at that moment the centre, she stood, imperious of speech, and as conscious of her manifold advantages as the cultivation to which she had been subjected could make her. Beside her stood her brother David, and at a little distance Clarence Baldwin, and a man of middle age whom they called Mr. Falcon.
               Let the five minutes following the first moment of that dread interview between Miss Baldwin and poor Susan, pass. Susan has answered Isidore's listless inquiries about her health, has stepped back in the vain hope of retiring beyond sight of the whole party; but Mr. Falcon, she knows not how that happened, is leading her by the hand, and Clarence is bowing low before her, and they are going towards the cabin. And while old Walter looks about on the party in the gladness of his honest heart, pleased as if he had brought into shore a net crowded with choice fish, she is thinking to herself in consternation, "Five people come to spend the day! and only Mr. Baldwin going out with her father in the boat! They to go into the cabin, and she to wait on them!" . . No such thoughts troubled the heart of honest old Dillon. Utterly incapable of such is he who cries, "Come in, come in, and take a glass all round; this occasion is worth it. Baldwin, it's a fair sight."
               He stood upon his door-step, the lord of the little cabin, and his eyes surveyed the young life before him with a cordial love and admiration of its varied beauty. It was all noble, all beautiful in his eyes; they may have lingered a moment longer, and with a deepened tenderness on his own solitary, motherless child; not less beautiful, not less full of promise was she than those surrounding heirs of wealth. She was the storehouse of his affections; his lost wife lived again in Susan by the merest resemblance which to his eyes was not occasional but constant; she had many of Tom's ways, his courage and promptness of action, and she used to have much of his mirth—she was a reminder of all his losses, but a tender, not a sad reminder. And so an instant longer than even on Isidore, his eyes rested on his child. "Come in!" he repeated. his house and his heart was large enough for them all. Old, weather-beaten, toil-bowed, gray-haired fisherman, who hast listened to the voice of God upon the waters more than sixty years, who in the uplifting of thine honest, upright soul hast held communion with the Spirit whose breath is the life of all things—unenvying, contented monarch of your dominion, do you see the smile that floats athwart the blooming lips of the young girl for whom, in behalf of her father, your best-loved friend, you said just now inaudibly, "thank God"? No; your eyes are somewhat dim with looking all these years on the resplendent glories of the ocean; those eyes of yours are slow to see, your mind is still more slow for the apprehension of the weak pride of the child who sat once on your knee, stained even then, though you held her in your arms and thought her pure as the little children growing round your hearth—pure of the taint of pride, that in those days could not understand, and in these days could not welcome, the fact that has bound you and her father in a close tie of brotherhood these many years.
               One by one the party defiled through the narrow doorway, into the little front room of the cabin, and Dillon brought out his wine, and Susan brought the quaint old glasses, and they drank each other's health, Clarence with the rest, though he refused twice a glass brought him by Mr. Falcon and his father; but the third time, Susan brought it, and sat down beside him where he had retreated into the corner of the room, and he did not refuse then. They called Clarence idiotic, and he sat in the shade, and was silent. These were the reasons why Susan could sit beside him, and speak with him. She was not afraid here. She could pity him!—the rest could pity her!
               Near Clarence, sipping his wine, and apparently engrossed in defining its merits to his own satisfaction, but in reality reading through and through the child who had succeeded in interesting his unfortunate charge, for Susan was now busy telling Clarence about her manifold experiences as fisherwoman and boatwoman, sat Mr. Falcon, by far the most notable person of the party in respect of personal advantages. He alone seems too large for the room, and the presence.
               David looks effeminate—as if he had grown "old before he was young—decrepit ere he was strong,"—he has arrived at his manhood weak with dissipations—it seems in his hands no great good, no honorable attainment. As he lounges in his chair before the window, and tastes the odorous sweet wine, and watches the rolling waves, and the sky, he has a worn and wearied look—he anticipates nothing from this day—he has come because his father has so frequently of late expressed the wish that he would do so. And so he has the wearied air of a man resigned to his fate. Standing, his raised hand might touch the ceiling of this mean little room, but it does not in spite of his exquisite mien seem too narrow or too low for him. He is not crowded there for space. His father, though not stunted in growth, is bent, and to-day, feeble—he has not a steady hand or foot. He almost totters when he walks, his hand trembles, his face is old and thin, his hair is very gray—excepting in his voice he gives slight indication of strength—that is loud, and clear, and strong, and his will is also vigorous, Isidore, arrayed in her "purple manners," listening to the reminiscences which old Dillon is bringing up from the past, when her father and he were boys together, to amuse her! gives one no intimation that she finds this breathing space contracted—you think merely that she is trifling and vain, as you observe the way she has of listening to the old man who speaks.
               But it is a royal stature to which Mr. Falcon attained in his youth, and with an exceeding majesty he bears it in his ripened manhood.
               He is a man not indifferent to the impression he shall make on others. As he rises with the rest, whom Dillon had bidden follow Baldwin and himself to the beach, he may not draw himself to his full height on account of the low ceiling, but, unobstructed, in the open air, he towers above the rest, head and shoulders above them; his voice is deep, and full of melody, such as you might listen for, having duly noted the breadth and depth of chest, and the genial benevolent expression habitual to his large and handsome features. His eyes, deep set, and dark-hued, relieve by their mildness the heaviness of the overhanging brow. He has thought much and intensely, and sometimes sadly, and sometimes bitterly; the sunken temples, the lines upon his forehead say so; but the mouth says more—it speaks of the constant loving of a faithful heart. Impulsive hopes, which he has mistaken for unfailing promises, have led him many times in paths and through labors which have disappointed him, but to this day he retains the hopes—they have misled him, but he clings to them still; they keep his heart warm, and the springs of life fresh and sweet.
               Many a silvery thread shines mid his dark locks—his spirits are so buoyant—he is so free from every other token of infirmity, or decay, that until you note those gray hairs you do not make a question of his age. He is not young, you know, but time has only mellowed and softened his wine of life. There is a repose of mein, you will be swift to observe, which, however, does not speak of sluggishness of blood, or a too subdued power of thought. Erratic, impulsive, ardent in his pursuit of enterprises which were to his mind full of promise of good, he has dealt Titanic blows at the degeneracies, and vices, and follies of his time. Exhaustive those blows have often proved of his own strength and resources: many a failure has he met, many a wrong has he endured—much slander has he borne, but all these weights and hinderances, though they have sometimes proved his own insufficiency, have never lessened his ardor in all good works, nor ever modified his faith in the ultimate triumph of causes whose inevitable issue he has labored to hasten.
               At the present time Mr. Falcon is an inmate of the Hall at St. John's and Clarence is his charge. Two months ago, if known at all there, it was solely as a man who had figured at times in the newspapers which libelled him without fear, because he had aimed so manfully to establish some of the laws which are in force in Utopia, among the people of his day—laws for the regulation of society, morals, and manners. Profligates had laughed at him, they were not fearful that the dreamer would succeed, and the indolent laughed too, though it had been difficult for them to tell precisely where, or what the joke was.
               Visiting a hospital where Clarence had been placed, hardly with a hope of his recovery from a lamentable state of dementia, idiocy they wrongly called it, Mr. Falcon, struck with the appearance of the poor fellow, had made inquiries concerning him. The answers he received had made him still more vigilant in his observations, and the result was a personal application to Mr. Baldwin, and request that Clarence, who was certainly not on the way to recovery in his present situation, should be placed under his guardianship for a time.
               The physicians of the hospital had themselves unwittingly prepared the way for a favorable response to this request, by their repeated assurances that the case was quite beyond their reach.
               Clarence, therefore, was removed from the hospital to the Hall, and since that time Mr. Falcon had been his constant attendant, but without any favorable result, at least so far as could be discovered by others and himself. None save this, the affection which Clarence manifested toward him, and the gentle submission the poor boy yielded to him.
            
            
               XIV.
               THE whole party left the cabin with Dillon, who, arm in arm with Mr. Baldwin, led the way down to the beach where the fishing-boat was waiting to receive the two old men.
               After they had put out to sea, for an hour or more, Mr. Falcon and the young people walked along the beach together, amusing themselves, and testing their powers of voice in bits of declamation and snatches of song. But by degrees the little restraint under which the various members of the party may have labored, gave way, and each one began to follow the bent of individual inclination. Mr. Falcon, with his eye on Clarence, examined the rock and the sand industriously, searched for shells and curious pebbles, and gathered sea-weed.
               David, seating himself on a projecting rock, took out a little French book, began to read, and soon seemed lost in its pages. Isidore wandered off along the beach beyond the mill, accompanied for some distance by Susan, who knew not in what other way to dispose of herself. But finding, by the impossibility of joining in a race, for the walk bade fair to terminate in one, so rapidly did Isidore walk, and so incapable was Susan of making such a progress, that her presence was not needed in this direction, Susan turned back, with the intention of going home to make some arrangements for the dinner, and some alterations in her dress.
               But, as she crossed the rock, David Baldwin, who had observed the child's vain attempt to join his sister in her walk, and had understood the failure, as Susan did not, called to her; she, hearing the call, and ever obedient, went towards him. Face to face together thus.
               There's not a drop of blood in Susan's veins that has likeness of hue and of properties to his; no more than his proud sister, with the languid eyes, floating curls, fair face, and carriage so exceeding graceful, no more than this rare image of beauty, is he like her.
               He looks at Susan whom he has called, but his look is not intelligible to her. She does not understand by it that he commiserates her on account of her strange appearance and situation; neither does she know that even so much sympathy as this pity implies has not in a long time been stirring in his breast in behalf of any human being.
               He knows, by her wan face and shaven head, as well as by that report the nurse took up to St. John's, that she has been at death's door; and looking at her still more narrowly, and reading her sorrows in her eyes, he thinks that had the door been quite opened for her exit, it had proved to her perhaps a mercy.
               But then, that's not his business. And he goes on with his meditation while he speaks some trifling things to Susan. 'Tis a strange face, and a strange manner, that he meets. There is nothing like it for unbroken ruggedness, and simple honesty, in any servant to be found about the Hall; yet, somehow, he cannot help looking at her as an equal. She is the daughter of his father's friend; she is their hostess of to-day. But he smiles to think of it.
               And besides, there is something about her that exceedingly interests him, as any other novel production of these rocks would be sure to do to-day.
               In spite of, or rather because of, her sallow face, and sunken eyes, and figure thin and bent as it never was in health, she interests him. Girls do not usually—he has arrived at a rather contemptuous estimate of girls, though in this he did not sympathize so thoroughly with Mr. Leighton as the reader might imagine.
               The world perceives a great difference between young Baldwin and the fisherman's daughter. David is an heir; his home is the Hall at St. John's. Everybody knows the place specified, when the Hall is mentioned. It is one of the grand residences of St. John's. One day the heir will be master of the house,—a man of mark and influence.
               He has been accustomed to view himself in this light for years, and now, as he looks at Susan, it is not as on an equal. There is something of pity, more of ill-disguised wonder and curiosity, than would have manifested itself in him had the girl before him not been Susan Dillon, the daughter of the fisherman.
               If she will sit down he will read to her. He must be thinking to test and strengthen his voice as others of the party have done to-day before him—and to give point to the performance he would have an audience. No, it is no Stentor that he has in mind, perched up in that wild height with the wild-looking sea-girl for a listener. His voice is mild and quiet, he is too indolent to strive—without a rival those great waves may break along the shore.
               Susan sits beside him—glad to listen, and well pleased is she. At her feet lies the spaniel,—she looks no longer into his intelligent eyes for the sympathy which they have given so many times according to her need. She sits and listens, with her brown hands crossed, looking out upon the waves, and as she harkens to the strange and magic tale, which he tells in his own language, the audience is shaken with some sort of emotion which her grave face cannot reveal.
               Less and less distracted by the novelty of her position, Susan's attention is by degrees absorbed in the reader. She turns herself wholly towards him; her eyes are bent on him with an excess of thought. Observant of this scrutiny, David, half closing the book, asks:
               "Do you never read?"
               "Not often," she replies.
               "Don't you like it?"
               "I guess so;" she is not thinking of her words.
               "Don't you know? you should—books make people wise"
               There was something in this word, or in his way of saying it, that Susan did not like.
               
               "I have no books to read, only one or two," she answered quickly.
               "Oh, that alters the case," said David, smiling at her warmth; "you should have said so in the first place." He returned to the story, and finished it.
               "Where did you get this spaniel?" said he, as he closed the book.
               Susan told him Span's brief history—how he had been picked up at sea by a fisherman down the coast. The dog had probably been lost off some boat by his owner. In his right paw he was wounded; Susan gently lifted the foot beautifully fringed with white silken hair.
               "He is very handsome. Do you like him?"
               "Do I like you, Span?" said Susan, stroking his long ears, and, with her arms around his neck, drawing him up closer to her side.
               "Will you sell him? I should vastly like to buy him of you."
               "No; you cannot," replied Susan, quickly.
               "Ten dollars are as much again as he is worth," continued David, as if he had not heard her peremptory refusal. "But I'd give that much, and more, if you ask it. He has had such an escape it would be quite worth one's while to own him." This he said in a cool, unconcerned, drawling manner, pleased with the commotion occasioned by his words.
               "Not for ten hundred," was the indignant response; and with that Susan rose as if to go on her way.
            
            
               XV.
               SHE rose to go, but something stayed her—Span's low, short, eager bark. And something strange, and terrible beside, that made her faint and sick at heart. Something flying from that beetling cliff, far out into the water—there, where the shallow waves rolled over the crags of the coast, merely hiding them from sight by their dashing foam, and continual commotion. In pursuit of the pebble that David had slung, poor Span had leaped from the height!
               "Well now," said he, "we shall see if the brave fellow is good for what he promises. What a noble dog it is!"
               Now, neither Tom nor Susan had ever, in their gayest frolic, so far forgotten Span's wounded foot as to put its strength to any test severe as this; and when the young mistress saw him darting at that wild rate into the midst of the waves, she was confounded with wrath and terror. The moment after his leap saw her down at the water's edge; her fear lent her wings as she ran down the rocky heights.
               She called to him—he heard her—she knew it; she knew that he saw her, that he was struggling, and struggling towards her. Again she called, and his course was directed towards her. But suddenly he sank from sight, and the white foam became red. Louder, louder rose her voice, and her cry, the rocks and the waves echoed it. He heard! and again, as if in answer to the despairing cry, his head shot above the waves. But he was wounded. He had struck against those hidden rocks,—those rocks hidden by the waves. He was wounded—she knew that he was lost.
               "Get a rope, or a plank," shouted David from above. "Quick! and I'll swim out for him."
               "No! no! Oh, Susan, don't let him!"
               Susan looked up at the sound of these voices. All that was speaking from that pale face they could not read; they only saw the anguish of her terror. With bitter thoughts she looked, scorning to speak in behalf of either of the bright beings who stood there so high above her, contending so uselessly. The dog was lost! why could they not leave her to think of that for a moment? The dog that Tom had loved so dearly—for his loss also she had to thank these Baldwins!
               "Get me a rope, and I'll swim out," cried David again.
               "No," said Susan, turning away, "'twould be the death of you."
               Nevertheless, there was now a sudden change in Susan's thoughts as she watched the struggle again apparent since Span came up once more above the water, and she ran as if for life, it was for her Span's life! in search of a boat, or a rope, or a plank, for—she knew not what.
               When presently she came back breathless with a broken oar, and some bits of cord, there was no saving use to which she could apply them.
               When Susan turned once more from the beach, she saw David and Isidore slowly descending from the cliff, and with them Mr. Falcon and Clarence, who had been drawn to the spot by the distressed voices they had heard.
               At the same time, from an opposite direction, came up Horace Chilton and his sister.
               Both parties advanced towards Susan, who stood like a wild antelope at bay, cut off from flight. She was striving to subdue the rising torrent of her tears to such good purpose, that, while her heart was deluged by them, her eyes were dry.
               Yet the stifled anguish gave some other token of itself, for Horace Chilton, who came up to her in advance of the others, asked instantly what had happened.
               "Span is drowned," answered Susan.
               "Drowned! drowned!—when?"
               "Just now'
               "I'll have him, though," exclaimed Horace, and he looked as though about to carry his purpose into execution.
               "No," said David Baldwin, laying his hand on the young fellow's arm. "I would have done that myself, but it was impossible to save him."
               "Susan, is it so?" asked Horace, turning abruptly from the stranger to her.
               "Have I not told you, sir? and I am the clown that killed him," said David, not well pleased with the doubt implied in Chilton's appeal to Susan. "Susan, I do not ask you to forgive me; for you would, and that's not what you should do."
               Susan did not say that she forgave him. She was not magnanimous enough for that; but she did say, and looking up she met Mr. Falcon's gaze, and meeting it felt strengthened to say it with a heartier grace:
               "I could not sell him, but I told you that maybe I'd give him away. I've given him to you. Don't say anything more about it, please."
               "Very well," said Mr. Falcon, with decided approval in his voice.
               His words, but more especially his manner, went soothingly into the child's troubled heart. She looked at him, and from him to the unimpassioned image ever beside him, and her gratitude betrayed itself.
               "I can show you some prettier than any you've found to-day," she said, looking at the sea-weed in his hand.
               To which intelligible remark, Mr. Falcon kindly responded:
               "Will you?—when?"
               "Now;" and courageous in her fear, lest she should betray her heart, eager to turn the thoughts of the party from herself, she started off towards the cabin, and by her side, hand in hand, went Leah Chilton
               
               "Horace has told me so much about you and Span," said Leah, as they went along, returning not wisely to the subject. "I am sorry for you, he was such a noble fellow."
               "No matter," said Susan, quickly; and then she tried to mend the matter, "Thank you—yes, he was."
               Beside David walked his sister, arrayed as in a garment in her symmetrical selfishness. She, too, had proffered her condolence for Susan's loss; but Susan somehow did not place the highest value on her assurances of sorrow and regret at what had happened. She stood on too high a pedestal; the poor child could not attain unto that shining image. Not so with Leah Chilton. Manifestly she was human; to be reached;—something beside herself—she was a part of the world—an arrangement of body and soul in sympathy with the rest of her kind—a watchful, wakeful, sorrowing, rejoicing mortal.
               They were nearly of the same age, and both of them, Isidore and Leah, had a development maturer than their years. Trial, care, necessity, had caused the rapid growth of one; the position of the other, as the sole daughter of her widowed father's house, had occasioned that of Isidore.
               Life had given Leah Chilton serious things to think of, and she, obediently, had thought of them. Themes that were not altogether happy in their nature, but they had not impaired the cheerful serenity of her temper. Griefs had conduced to a fair, not a tortured growth. A pure and patient soul had lodged in an untarnished habitation. The mortal had grown in unvarying compliance with the spiritual law of the immortal. There was no discrepance to explain away in her. The outward growth was, I repeat, harmonious with the inward life.
               Were I writing fiction, I should pause at this point to survey what I have just written, and no doubt should erase it. Aware of a mistake in first asserting the perfection of a character, would I, think you, expose my ideal to the mercy of a critic?
               Folks differ so much in their notions about all-perfection. Even if a Greenlander shall side with me, what if Chinamen and Russians, Kentuckians and Spaniards, read of Leah Chilton! Will they smile complacently, acquiescing in my judgment?
               Horace and his sister brought their visit to a speedy conclusion; inopportune they felt it to be, both they and Susan, for each of them had anticipated it with many a pleasant thought. They did not leave, however, without a promise that they would repeat the visit, which, having received, Susan was glad to have them gone.
               And while she spread the table, against the return of Mr. Baldwin and her father, with the rich and delicate contents of the baskets which the party brought down with them from St. John's, together with some original coarser elements drawn from the cabin cellar, Mr. Falcon and Clarence, who were alone together in the front room of the cabin, looked over the Algæ, and Isidore and David watched the boat as it came in from the distance towards the shore.
               When she had finished her work of preparation, Susan went in to Mr. Falcon.
               "Is this your work, Susan?" he asked, the moment she entered the room.
               She told him whose it was; not hers, her mother's.
               "I suspected as much," he said, looking with interest upon the child,—a genial interest, fatherly and cheerful, that could neither annoy nor frighten her.
               "I have been looking for an opportunity to speak with you since we came," he continued. "I have thought a great deal about your mother. Mr. Baldwin told me of her. She and I came from the same village. I remember her father, your grandfather that is, right well: his hair was the whitest I ever saw, and his face the mildest: the children all loved him, and he loved them all. He was a friend to me. I do not remember your mother, but I often heard her name. It was a sweet name, Mary Brooks. And all the people loved her too."
               To have seen the delight in the child's eyes as she heard this! While he spoke thus in his frank, pleasant way, she was changing her place and position continually, drawing with each move nearer and nearer to the table on which lay the books of Algæ which he was examining. But she was too much agitated to speak when finally she stood close beside him, leaning against the table.
               "Are you glad?" said Clarence, for the first time that day volunteering a remark, and looking himself much elated, for he had listened to every word that Mr. Falcon said.
               "Yes, I am so!" said Susan, returning the poor fellow's smile with interest.
               "I can understand very well," said Mr. Falcon, who at the same time made a careful note of the words Clarence had spoken, laying them up for future consideration; "I can understand very well what pleasure she must have taken in preserving these beautiful specimens. The first collection I ever saw was at your grandfather's house—she sent them to him, your mother did. These must have been done a long time ago. They make a valuable collection."
               Inwardly did Susan vow while he spoke, that if ever that collection passed out of her hands it should go only into his. He had won her heart already.
               He continued, "You bore your loss well to-day. I was glad to see it. If you will allow me to do it I shall take great pleasure in sending down, or bringing down myself another Spaniel for you, or perhaps a Newfoundland. If you would like it, I can get one very easily in Saint John's."
               "A Newfoundland," exclaimed Clarence, laying his hand on Susan's arm, and looking in her face earnestly; "a Newfoundland! there's a fellow who has a houseful."
               "Oh no, don't, please! Thank you—I'd rather not have any," said Susan hastily, half crying.
               "I don't wonder at that," remarked Mr. Falcon. "I had a great loss myself once, and the last thing that I wanted was that any one should replace it. I never presume to console any one who has met with a loss. A great sorrow can't be lightened that way. We must bear it, and grow strong—it is bitter food, but wholesome. And if we are too weak of ourselves, there's a Friend who always helps us, if we need Him, and tell Him that we do."
               He knew she understood him by the way she bowed her head, and presently he spoke again: "Our sufferings are our trial. They prove us. If we grow stronger, and at the same time better, gentler in our dealings towards others, and more exacting in the demand we make on ourselves; if we become more charitable and patient, then we shall have reason to bless God for every one of his dealings that gave us pain."
               He spoke of a great mystery; but how much more directly his words appealed to her, how much more easily understood were they, than the speech of the student in the tower!
            
            
               XVI.
               IT was late in the afternoon when Dillon and Mr. Baldwin came in to shore. There was no time to be lost, and immediately after their return to the cabin they all sat down to dinner.
               
               When they were gathered around the board, Dillon, by whose side at table the dog always stationed himself, missing Span, rose from his place, and going to the door looked up and down the beach, but said nothing.
               A few minutes after, he started up again, and whistled a shrill peculiar whistle for the dog.
               "Span won't dine to-day, father," said Susan quietly. She had prepared her answer, knowing what must come.
               She had hoped that none would hear her but he to whom she spoke.
               But David here conceived that he had something to say,—"No," he observed, "for I have been so unfortunate as to kill him," and he told the whole story.
               Mr. Baldwin thought he knew something about compensations—and besides he detected some emotion in the face and voice of his son—and was therefore swift to speak.
               "What a pity! What a great pity! David you'll have to make that up to Susan."
               This was precisely his view of it. The loss must be made up. Did he not know, had he not proved to his satisfaction in the affairs of lite, that a man can buy anything with money? Ah—but life, life! Even that of a dog is not that beyond his purchase? Can he buy it back from corruption and the worm? Honor, beauty, trinkets, love, faith—political, spiritual, and domestic—these things have a market value, and there be traders for them; but LIFE, even a dog's life! . . . nay, it is not a trifle like these.
               Honest his intentions and belief were, no one could dispute or doubt it; but what could money do towards making good that loss? One might well wonder to hear him, who did not know the foundation pillars of his universe. There were some ancient people whose world stood poised, they tell us, on a serpent's head. Thou, Nineteenth Century Speculator, tell us, on what does it stand?
               Susan had lost her treasure, all the treasure that she had, her companion and playfellow, the living link that bound her to the days when Tom and she, on the shore or on the sea, were ever together. She looked at Mr. Falcon, and thought of his words, so different. But though he saw and understood the look, he kept silence. His balm had, however, preceded the wound—she could herself apply it. Sorrow was not her peculiar portion. Even he who looked as though grief would never dare come near him, even he had known it. So he has said. And he had also said, that to one who can aright interpret the celestial language, Loss means Gain.
               "The loss can't be made up. She would n't have sold him at any price," said David, who did not seem disposed to make little of the matter.
               At this a nervous dread was exhibited by the company at large, lest there should be some further demonstration on the subject. Isidore began to talk noisily to Mr. Falcon about her adventure in the windmill; how she had climbed the crazy old staircase to have a door slammed suddenly in her face, which terrified her so much that she ran down the old staircase, pursued, she averred, by half a dozen ghosts. And Susan was now called upon to account for the marvellous affair, which she did in the most condensed style possible.
               And old Walter, actuated by the same impulse to change the current of thought in the minds of his guests, went into an elaborate account of his method of salting fish for the winter market.
               But in spite of the efforts made, it was a stupid party, to all save Clarence and Isidore. In the face of Susan, Clarence saw something that engrossed, absorbed, enlivened him. And as for Isidore, she took an inventory of the table, and scrutinized the house, and her host and hostess, and ran over in her mind the events of the day, and arranged the facts, which in case the tedious day should ever end, were to be brought out in brilliant review before the eyes of Colonel Wheaton at the Hall that evening.
               And at length, a second time that day, was the heart of Susan Dillon made to rejoice, after a very inhospitable fashion, at the departure of her guests.
               The sun had set when, taking her hand, one by one, in parting, the family re-entered the carriage and were borne away from the beach.
               Isidore had faintly echoed the invitation her father bade her give to Susan—to the effect that they should soon be looking for her at the Hall to make the long-promised visit. David had said "I really am sorry that I came to-day; I should have been very glad could I have got through the visit without bringing such a sorrow to you." Mr. Falcon had said, "Clarence and I are coming soon again on horseback to see you Susan"—and he and she had seen the sudden flashing and departing light in the youth's eyes, and he as well as Susan heard Clarence say, "Good-bye, Susy."
               None but poor Tom and their mother had ever called her by that name; who had instructed him to give her that name, she wondered—and so did Mr. Falcon.
            
            
               XVII.
               WITH the departure of the guests, Dillon at once took himself away to Harlem to make some purchases needful for the morrow's work; and Susan having brought the house into something like order again, strolled out in the twilight, and without any clear idea as to what she intended, walked away to the mill.
               Arrived there she went up the winding stairway, never pausing to think of what she was doing, or should do, until she reached the topmost landing; there she stood, asking herself if she should go in and tell Mr. Leighton of her loss, or go back home again. Thought of the loneliness of the cabin decided her.
               There was no sound of life in the room, and the very silence of the place strengthened her decision. She rapped on the door. He was there and heard her—he was at work, she heard the rustling of his papers, and the succeeding step across the floor proved both these points. He had recognized Susan's knock, by his smile when he opened the door; he would have been disappointed had he not seen her standing there.
               After she had gone into the room he still continued waiting, holding the door open. There was another guest whom he expected.
               "Nep! Span!"
               At this rose Susan, and with herself, her heart. Going back to the door she turned Mr. Leighton's hand from the latch.
               "There is no Nep," she presently said, in a hardly audible tone.
               At this Mr. Leighton returned to his chair by the table, and, from beneath his gray overhanging brows a light, inquisitive and sharp, fell upon her.
               "Come and sit down here, and tell me what you mean," said he, pointing to a wooden bench on which, until to-day, his books have been piled. He may have cleared it of them, thinking that Susan would come. I but make the suggestion.
               "Nep leaped from the cliff to-day, and was drowned," replied Susan in a low firm voice, obeying him.
               "An ambitious our! Not the first instance, by a great many, of vaulting ambition overleaping itself! How did you come to agree to it? I supposed you never allowed him to sport. I really took Nep to be a pattern dog."
               To which Susan made no reply, unless the bewildered, and not well pleased look, even the disappointment with which she regarded Mr. Leighton while he spoke, might be taken for an answer.
               "You have had the Baldwins from St. John's visiting you to-day: the boy, or some one of them, did you the honor to make way with Nep, I suppose. If I had been there I would have sent him over in search of the dog. He should have dived for him into the depths of Charybdis."
               This was something like what she had expected to hear; and, hearing it, the child was not ashamed to dash her hand across her eyes, and look Mr. Leighton again in the face. What a smile lurked in the singular shadows of that face when she said,
               "Boy! David Baldwin is not a boy, he is a man."
               "Oh! ay! he is? Well, now tell me if the pleasure of the visit you've had compensates for the loss you've met."
               This question startled Susan, it perplexed her; at first she could make nothing of it. It meant nothing; what pleasure that she had derived from the visit was to be named in the same breath with the loss that she had sustained?
               Yet, as she pondered the question, and the questioner patiently waited her conclusion, it seemed as if by magic to assume a more familiar shape. Already she had agitated that point, though under a quite different from—a form so different, indeed, that she could not recognize it as identical with his on the first instant of proposition. He had brought out the latent idea over which her thoughts hovered in perplexity. He perceived that it was so, and said encouragingly:
               "You will know more about that when you think it over, by-and-bye. I believe I must order a cart-load of fairy-tales for your use, and then we shall have a pretty bird of prey; but you must not, at least, feed on carrion."
               David, Mr. Baldwin, she observed, with charming candor, had said the same thing, that she must read.
               "Then," said Mr. Leighton, indulging in a short, harsh laugh, for he was sure now of the ground on which he was treading, and he spoke with a glance that made the poor child feel vastly uncomfortable; "Then it certainly must be true. He should have brought you a supply of light literature such as he has himself proved to be easy of digestion. I would like to see the choice he would make for you. I dare say he has heaps of dainty books in red, blue, and gilt; such as ladies read; did he tell you about them?"
               Mr. Leighton seemed to be talking in earnest; his voice was earnest, so was his face; and yet something there was about it that impelled the child to say,
               "I don't know anything about red, blue, and gilt books. I have n't seen him before in years. You said yourself that I ought to read,—you said so the very last time I was here, when I looked at your books and wanted them so much."
               "Did I? . . . Very well; I don't say now that you may. I seriously assure you that you must. You look delighted—you are very much delighted, I suppose."
               "Not a bit;" but she was, and the student knew it. He had dissected humming-birds and butterflies before now, enough of them; but here was something that seemed capable of sporting in a winter atmosphere.
               "Not a bit;" and then her face became joyously radiant, and her innocent satisfaction revealed itself in an exclamation by which she stood thoroughly self-exposed;
               "Such a story as he read me to-day!"
               
               "Story!" he repeated—he began to speak in a relentless tone, but he softened with an after-thought; "what was it about?" he added, assuming an encouraging interest.
               "I never heard anything like it before—never in my life."
               "Tell me about it; I should like to be pleased too."
               "Not to-night, Mr. Leighton."
               But Susan, while she made this little opposition to his will, was quite sure in her heart that in a moment she should yield. Still for that moment she stood firm. A little box was lying on the table; she drew it towards her; a seal-ring was lying in it uppermost, she took it up, and read aloud the motto, "Ora et labora."
               "You translate also," said Mr. Leighton, quietly.
               Now she had offended him; hastily she said, stammering, "I know I was rude, but I did not mean to be."
               "Tell me the story that pleased you so much; I want to be pleased. It would be something quite novel in my experience. I want you to please me, Susan."
               As she looked at the student's care-worn face, and heard him speaking, the child had but one desire, and that was to please him; and so she told, in her own way, the story of the unfortunate tapestry workers.
               "Are they stories like these he is going to bring you?" was the listener's remark, when she had finished.
               "He did not say that he would bring me any," replied Susan, frankly looking up into his face, and somewhat disappointed, for he did not seem to have derived any particular pleasure from her story after all.
               "But you told him that you had no books."
               — How surprised she looked!
               "And you certainly knew that he had quantities of them."
               — Her confusion was his only answer.
               "And you said that you wanted them as you wanted no other thing in the word! But the hermit was so 'miserly with his old volumes that he would not allow you to touch one of them."'
               "No, I did n't speak of you, Mr. Leighton, . . . more than I could help," she added, correcting her first assertion. "I said no such thing."
               "So you could not help speaking of me! Of course not. No matter, don't bother me about that, or yourself either. Only remember I am not going to allow people to ransack my castle while I hold it. You may tell everybody so, if you think it worth while. I know you do want books above all things, and you will have trash enough, no doubt, to work all the harm needful. But to poison yourself the first thing, that would, indeed, be unfortunate. There are two books on that chair yonder; bring them to me."
               Susan obeyed him. He opened one and gave it to her, bidding her look at it. In silence she did so, and silently returned it to him. Nothing could she make of it.
               "What does the motto on the ring mean?"
               "Pray and labor," she replied instantly.
               "Who told you so?"
               "David Baldwin—it was in the story."
               "He may have deceived you about that."
               "No;" said Susan quickly. But she added thoughtfully, "Perhaps he did, but I don't see why he should."
               "Nor I. The translation is correct. But why did it make such an impression on you, idler that you are, you know?"
               "I was not thinking of myself, Mr. Leighton."
               "I am well 
                     pursuaded
                     persuaded
                   of that; of whom, then? of me?"
               "No," she answered with surprise and hesitation.
               "Well, of whom, then?"
               "Horace Chilton."
               
               "And why of him?"
               "He has such an awful hard time of it."
               "So you pity him. That's very kind of you. Now, I dare say when young Mr. Baldwin talked Latin to you, you wished that you might understand what it was all about without his telling you. Be honest, was it not so?"
               "I never even thought of it, Mr. Leighton."
               "But you think now. This book is written in Latin. Will you study it? Its author was a poet. When he was an infant a swarm of bees alighted on his lips. Such sweetness they saw was hived in his soul! You must read it. And you must not undervalue all this grand nature that enfolds you—it understands you better, and ministers to you more kindly than . . . you must read this poet."
               "Will you teach me, Mr. Leighton?" Susan's eyes were brimful of delight.
               "No; you must teach yourself. Here is the book—you may keep it. It is yours if you will make the best use of it that you can. Here is the dictionary; its a large book for you to manage—you can hardly carry it in your hands—won't you be top-heavy, think you, if you succeed in crowding it into your head? . . I studied it when I was of your age. I had no one to teach me—no one had the time. You are in about the same position in that respect. Well then, will you teach yourself, as I did? You shall have my best wishes; may you study to a better purpose than I have ever done. And then this other work, will you take this too?"
               "Anything," answered the child, but not in childish rapture at the prospect of a largely-fulfilled wish; she said it almost with a sigh.
               "Very well," said Mr. Leighton, neither blind nor deaf to this. "You see what it is." He spoke with indifference. That may have made her suspicious of the boon he was conferring. Why was she not more delighted now when precisely that which she most coveted was in her hands?
               It was a work on Geometry that he gave her.
               "You will like this, I believe," he said, turning over the pages. "It will give you an abundance of food for reflection! To me the study is infinitely beautiful. If you do not find it so, I shall . . . be disappointed. Now, when you go back home, I think you will call this day the most eventful of your life."
               "I am so glad to have the books," exclaimed Susan, and there was no room for a doubt of that.
               "But if Nep were with you, and you were talking to me as you used to talk about that 'fairy book,' I would not give them to you. You were in prosperity then; but now you are bankrupt; and out of sympathy I must help you as I best can. You have been living above the world, but now you are in it; and you must needs have our waymarks, the mile-stones and guide-boards, to prevent your being lost. You were flying about on wings a few hours ago, but now you must go on crutches. I do not congratulate you. I pity you from my heart. But do the best you can; you will make a very good foot-passenger, I think."
            
            
               XVIII.
               NOW Susan Dillon could by no means bring herself to believe a word of this. The fate that had made itself in part manifest, was not so evil. Her guests who came to her that day had seen life, and read books—she contrasted herself with them, they certainly seemed no worse off than she! those fortunate, happy, elegant people! They were, all of them, full of enjoyment—none of them looked like Mr. Leighton, so care-worn and sad; it was not his world, but theirs which was hid from her longing gaze.
               "And now, Susan," said Mr. Leighton, rising, and breaking her meditation.
               "Yes sir, I know it; you need not tell me. I know it's time to go. I've stayed too long."
               He followed her from the room, and down the stairs, carrying his lamp, which, when she first went into his study, was lighted, for he recognized no twilight hours up there in his tower, this toiling and constant student, but passed at once from daylight to lamplight, losing no time. Had he no courage for meeting involuntary, unsuggested thoughts?
               With his lamp he followed her down the dark and tottering stairway, until they came to the outer door, when a sudden gust of wind extinguished the light. For a moment Susan hesitated.
               "Are you afraid?"
               The sound of his voice was sufficient, on she went, and he with her, instead of answering her "good night." When they came to the rock they both stopped short, as if with one impulse.
               "A lucky dog," said Mr. Leighton, standing upon the verge and looking down upon the dashing water, as he drew the floating folds of his dressing-gown more closely around his lofty form. "If you had lived in the days when the gods reigned of whom you read in your 'fairybook,' you would not have been at a loss for some beautiful consolation. Jove would have had compassion on you, and Nep would have been exalted. In some shape you would have had him back, beyond all question. Why is it not so now? Verily, it is so. He has had, poor Span! already, a transmigration. Believest thou this? You will find it true,—most true. And it was here that Master Baldwin read the story? With a sling David slew Goliah. . . I am quite certain that poor Nep is immortal. You have him now in another form, that's all. . . Yet I am not quite sure that I understand why that story pleased you so much."
               Susan was by this time herself quite in the dark as to the wherefore—one thing was clearly apparent, it by no means contributed to her repose of mind that he should be continually returning to that point. If the story had actually pleased her, which she began to doubt, she knew not why it had.
               "Was it," said he, not looking at her, and as it seemed not speaking to her so much as to himself, "Was it for the mere reason that it was a new picture of life and you liked the cunningly-drawn figures, gay colors, and varnish? was that it?
               "Or was it," he continued, apparently unmindful of her silence, more and more abstracted from her, and drawn into a contemplation of the question; "was it because you felt sorrowful yourself, and sympathy. . . but you do not know!—how should you?—you perhaps felt comforted, thinking that there are people in the world actually worse off than yourself."
               "No," said Susan, quickly—on this point, at least, she felt sure of herself—"it was not that."
               "Well then, perhaps as a mere exhibition of spirit you admired it. You think it was a magnificent display of courage, when the young man took it into his head that he would get rid of his troubles, rise above, conquer them, by putting an end to his life! You need not answer. I know what you think of him now that you actually do think. He was doubtless a great coward, thinking to evade his debts to man by that shallow artifice. Laying down his life as if anybody would take that poor carcass for liquidation! As if sheriff and judge, and populace in the other kingdom, would not turn out in swift pursuit, and hunt him down, and accuse him at last—demanding, with inexorable will, the uttermost farthing! Now, Susan, tell me; was it because it is so pleasant a thing to think of the sprightly French girl and the young man Simon, meeting at the flower stalls, talking together like gay, chattering birds, buying violets for each other when they had barely bread to keep from starving? was it not precisely that, Susan?"
               "He certainly seemed to be approaching the neighborhood of the truth he was seeking to investigate. She started at his last words, and the faint flush on her pale cheek betrayed her. Betrayed her, though she so little knew of these things that she must needs ask herself with him if it were the truth that he had said.
               He repeated the question before she answered.
               "I was glad they had found something to love."
               "That is honestly spoken. But you surely perceive how blind and selfish they were."
               She certainly perceived nothing of the kind. He knew that before she answered. Indeed so well he understood her thoughts that she needed not to speak, and he went on, taking up his own words.
               "Nothing to love! Simon had his art and his mother, and sisters beside. Sufficient for one man's time and eternity, if he could but have perceived it; and what right had he among artists if he could not perceive it? What manner of thing could he achieve with such an unfortunate obliquity of vision? No, he was neither artist nor lover; he was clearly incapable of being either. . . You see what madness and folly these young people were guilty of,—taking hands and swearing to starve for each other's sake, for they had no better fortune in prospect. You see what vile trash such a story is, when you get at it. Like Dead-sea fruit, ashes, and death within. Death I say, and you'll understand me better after awhile than you do new. I wonder if that is the charm to you—that outside gloss and glitter, and pretty sentimental nonsense. If so, I hope you see now what it is worth."
               Susan had by this begun to think that the story had no charm for her whatever, and in some way she expressed her doubt.
               "Yes," said Mr. Leighton, "yes it had—you liked it. You are now more than ever mistaken. It did charm you, and you ought to know why. Simply because it was a fiction. You are tired of real facts—at least you think you are. The story was unreal, untrue; it was a trick; and because it was all this, it must be corrupting. That is, so far as it is capable of producing an effect. Even if the incidents transpired—they may have exactly as related by the writer; I do not dispute the historical facts, but they belong to the fictional order of things. They are not a healthful growth. They are false in their premises, false in their issue, and are therefore to be rejected and despised. You will say so yourself a week from now. You will say so when you know what a rank, rapid growth all falsehood has. You never would or could have thought of looking for happiness in such direction as these young people did." This was interrogatory—but not evidently so.
               But still Susan insisted that she thought their love was beautiful.
               He would not allow it. "No! no! it is impossible, altogether impossible. Be not so mistaken. Admire heroism and such virtues as much as you will, but do not admire base imitations and sham shows of these virtues. Imagination does very well as long as it takes intuitions for its postulates; but these vagaries and whims of minds in their dotage before their transmigration into new bodies to afflict the world, child!" The word he used recalled him. He paused abruptly. She was, indeed, but a child, and he could but smile at his own absurdity in talking in a strain like this to childhood; and yet her deep and serious, and, too, her reverent attention to his words, led him on. "You have certainly come fairly and honorably to your heritage, and I esteem it not a little valorous on your part, the way you have made the achievement. I have hopes for you when I say that." Here he broke off again abruptly, and then again: "I want you to occupy your heritage as quickly as you can. I want you to talk with me, and not stand looking at me when I speak as if you could only catch a far-off glimpse of my meaning. It is life I am talking about—life with which you have to do. I want to know from yourself, and from no less certain reporter, what you are. From what line you are descended—from what life you have issued. Do not look so grave about it, but make haste to discover, that I may know."
               Between this night, when Susan went back to her lonely home with the books, and the bewilderment and dire uncertainty Mr. Leighton's words had occasioned her, and those days, so recent, when she had watched in a dreamy expectation for the rising of the Queen of Beauty from the waters, there was a difference and a space. She never more would wait and watch for the working of that miracle. She had witnessed it already, and yet she knew it not. With unconscious eyes she had looked and seen, and now was going on her way, and no one said to her, no inward voice asked her the question, "Did not your heart burn within you as he talked by the way?"
            
            
               XIX.
               AND thus, as he retraced his steps, and walked on beyond the mill, Mark Leightor mused:
               "Given—a girl with a bright pair of eyes in her head, an inquisitive mind, but a more loving heart, to find a woman fit and prepared for suicide in the name and for the sake of the veriest delusion that ever beset mortal mind. Analyze the process. See the daughter of this fisherman as she is, and infer from the premises what she will be. In the first place, a child on the verge of starvation, ravenous at the sight of any food whatever. In the second place, a tendency to recklessness in the use of means where so great an end as human love and sympathy seems likely to be attained. Thirdly, an active imagination—a proper subject for magnetic delusions. Fourthly, an abundant curiosity. Fifthly, an ambition to be what she is not. Sixthly, endurance. Seventhly, a nuisance to fall in the way of a man who positively congratulated himself on having found a place where he should be able to pursue his course in peace. Mark Leighton, it is high time that you gave up seeking what you want.
               "But here the child is, a fixed fact; and if I do not look after her, who will? In five years there will be another woman in the world to raise the devil in others, or herself, if she's not looked after. No doubt this young puppy from St. John's, as such I remember him, has amused himself mightily to-day. And he will be sending down literary trash to make another stagnant cesspool of a human heart. She will read everything he sends her, and, between his books and himself, we shall have another poor little wreck. Honest independence, or what looks marvellously like it, seduced to wretched time-serving. Genial confidence turned into the gall of mistrust. . . Any other theme is infinitely preferable. If I have any work to do, the gods know it's not woman training. But this looks like an honest young soul. Had I the conduct, I would—" here Leighton paused, and a deeper shade came over the face of the weary man. He stopped short in his walk, his steps irresolute as his mind. Then walking on more hurriedly, he burst out: "There is no truth in woman. They are the great mistake of creation. From the first creation until to-day, the false, weak nature that could not resist an allurement, has run through every soul of them. And this girl is born of them. It's in her. If she looks at those books I gave her, something besides a real love of knowledge will lead her to do it. Some cause outward, and therefore a cause not genuine for her, will induce her to do it. A laughable, inefficient cause, very different, indeed, from that which would lead her to dive heart over head into the veriest twaddle that novelist ever penned, in case young Baldwin remembers that she has no books, as he assuredly will. . . She falls in love instinctively, just as she takes to decorating her person in every garb that trickery ever devised by instinct. She laughs and fools away her time, controlled by the same impulsion. And dresses dolls till she has learned to dress a little more perfect development of herself; and she learns to dance and curl her hair, and sing, and wheedle, and she dies to life, before ever she is born to life, by pure instinctive force. She can't help it; and what am I railing at? But this girl is certainly sufficiently uncultivated in these things to be deserving of an experiment. She will follow the others by instinct, of course, if left to herself. She has already come to their understanding of beauty and happiness. But is there not brain enough there to master the mere woman? Is there not seed there that can be coaxed out into a sturdy, and honest, and honorable growth? Ay, Mr. Baldwin, one thing is clear; she is ready at this moment to fall down and worship you. She will dream of you to-night, and remember you to-morrow, and in a few days be longing for you to come again. But you and I will have a struggle about that, young man. If, indeed, Truth, which is mighty, is so almighty that it can set a woman free."
            
            
               XX.
               IN the Library at the Hall, the small square room whose walls are lined with shelves, which are filled with books, Mr. Baldwin walks to and fro with that restlessness which impels him to motion by day and by night. His head is bent forward, his whole attitude tells the attention with which he listens to Mr. Falcon, who stands under the lamp that, suspended by an elaborately-wrought silver chain from the high ceiling, illuminates the room with a mild and pleasant light. Mr. Falcon has but now come from the drawing-room, where the rest of the family are gathered; his face betokens the good news to which his voice gives utterance, and smiles like the half-opened rose that shines conspicuously in his white waistcoat; and, as he speaks, still lower sinks Mr. Baldwin's head upon his breast. He says, repeating what he has said but now:
               "Yes sir; a chord has been fairly struck. His interest is roused. There is no mistake about it. What may follow of course I cannot say, but the great thing at which I aimed is accomplished—he may be wrought upon."
               "Remarkable!" says Mr. Baldwin, with a deep, serious satisfaction. He sinks down upon one of the great chairs of the library, and seems overwhelmed by what he has heard. At length he breaks out:
               "But what does he say? Does he want her up here, or does he want to go back to the beach? Find out what he does want, Falcon. Come, sir! you've got you hands full. Only don't deceive me about it—don't deceive me. I could n't bear that."
               "I felt bound, sir, to make mention to you of what has actually happened. It has made me hope, I repeat, and yet we must not be too sanguine, too confident I mean. Clarence has not expressed any desire for anything. I have not discovered that he wants to go back to the beach, or to have the young girl up here. But, sir, he is interested. That is the point. His attention has been roused. And, as soon as practicable, I think it would be well to repeat the visit we have made to-day. You will observe—it seems very apparent to me that his face has a better expression. When I spoke to him just now in the drawing-room about our excursion, he smiled as I, sir, never saw him smile before. From the depths—there was no mistaking it—it came from his heart. That led me on to speak of Susan, and I found, after a little conversation, though the talk was all on my part, that the whole interest of the day arises from the fact of seeing her. Whenever I repeated her name I saw that same smile. Now, if this is true of him to-morrow, I shall have great hopes of an ultimate total recovery of your son through that child's instrumentality. If his memory is really so far aroused, quickened, as to connect agreeable thoughts with her name by this day's experience, what, sir, is to prevent the perfect restoration of the faculty? For I believe that this is the sole difficulty; if the right note be touched a response is sure—the key note will involve the whole tune. . . I never, from the day when I first saw him at the hospital, believed otherwise. But you will remember that you and I can only act as agents; I entreat you, sir, regard me in no other light. I may be mistaken; we must be wise, and hold ourselves prepared for any event. God is good."
               "But do your best, Falcon, do your best! I depend on you. I knew all the while that something or other would happen. Now man, work! Do anything you will. I leave everything in your hands. Don't tell me not to hope—I do, and must. Give me back my son, Falcon—my poor boy." The old man sobbed, and wept.
               "If God wills," answered Falcon, scarcely less agitated than Mr. Baldwin. "It has fallen to my lot," he continued, making good his opportunity, "to be compelled to demolish the pet theories of a good many stupid persons in my time. Whether we are prospered or not in this undertaking, sir, let me urge upon you your duty never to look upon your son in any other light than as one whose mind is locked up, not destroyed. There's a key somewhere, if we have not found it, that can let it out of its prison; a lever somewhere strong enough to lift up the weight that presses it down. You owe it to God to trust Him in this thing. Not to me, to believe that I am so wise or skilful that I can effect a cure where no cure is to be effected, but a discovery merely to be made. It may be well for you in the course of a few days, as I said before, to send Clarence with me to the beach, with the purpose of bringing the child up here to make a little visit. But there is another thing against which permit me to caution you. This hope you and I must share with each other alone for a time. If we took others into our council, the result might be fatal. It would lead to a scrutiny on the part of the house which must be avoided. And as to ourselves, sir, if we can manage to affect an indifference in behalf of Mr. Dillon's daughter, we shall be wise. For the girl must do her work, if any she does, unconsciously, and so with Clarence as a recipient. There must be no watching, or annoying observation, or comment, or attention whatever. Let us, in short, deeply interested and anxious though we are, be content to act a very humble part in this, leaving God to work through us as He sees best. You see the force of my petition, sir?"
               "It's all in your hands, Falcon. Do with us all as you think best; but if you are right, and succeed, I swear—"
               No rash promises," said Falcon, hastily.
               "Just as you say. But what is there about little Susan? a pretty rough specimen, is n't she? And Clarence is so—so—I 'm sure, Falcon, I don't know what he is. I 'm all the time mistaken about him. But he is n't like her, that's plain."
               "It may have been the accident," said Mr. Falcon, thoughtfully; "but no: I observed something strange about his attention to her before the dog was lost. There's no accounting for these things. 'Love goes where it's sent,' people say, and it has since the beginning, I reckon."
               "Love, Falcon, you don't mean—"
               "Right, sir! I don't mean anything. For I don't know anything in this respect as yet. But you would not object to his loving her, would you, sir, if it made the man of him that nature intended?"
               "I! why Dillon and I used to have many a joke about that very thing when these young men and women—Lord, what a growth they've got!—when they were children. If Susan is like her mother, all she needs is a little training. As for old Walter, is n't he a trump, eh? Did you ever see a braver old fellow? She comes of a good stock, Mr. Falcon, and the Lord knows, a man who has carried a pack on his back as many years as I have, is n't the man to stop at trifles. I 'm not a looking out for your great matches for my boys."
               The energetic avowal of that sentiment carried the old man to his feet again.
               "Come into the drawing-room and see," said Mr. Falcon, leading the way.
               "No, man. . . . I can't—I shall just be letting the cat out of the bag, and making a devil of a muss of the whole business before its fairly under weigh. No sir. You've taken the very worst man you could find for your council. I shall go and do something to upset the whole thing before you are through with it. You may bet on that. Go you. I'll stay here. I 'm not fit for seeing visitors tonight. Go, and don't let me be sent for—no matter who comes. I believe I'll go to bed, and then we shall be safe."
               And before Falcon had an opportunity to speak again Mr. Baldwin had left the room, and was ascending the stairs that led to his private apartment.
            
            
               XXI.
               MEANWHILE sat Clarence in the drawing-room alcove, hidden from observation by a screen of embroidery and costly frame-work, his head reclining on the marble slab on which stood a solitary ornament, a small image in marble, exquisitely cut. Nothing that was passing around him observed he. No sound did he hear—the chatting voices at the opposite extremity of the large and splendid apartment did not fall on his ear—nothing of the beauty around him, for perception of which his eye was quick and clear, fell on his sight, for his eyes were closed. They saw another vision, the image of the child down there by the sea-side, standing fronting her great grief without a tear. Now smiling, now saddened, he gazed at her, and the inaudible utterances of those moving lips was heard in his heart incessantly, "Susy! Susy!"
               Mr. Falcon crossed the room and sat down by Clarence. The young man heard and recognized the step, and, without opening his eyes, indicated as much by extending tending his hand. No mortal being had ever brought himself so near to Clarence Baldwin as had Mr. Falcon during the few weeks of his residence at the Hall. With patient, loving care he had won his hold upon the youth's regard, giving meanwhile his whole time to a study of the phenomena of the case. He had well-nigh exhausted all the expedients to which one by one he resorted, in hope of the boy's mental restoration, when this day's visit to the beach revived his hopes, and stirred his mind to renewed vigilance of scrutiny.
               Falcon sat down beside Clarence, without speaking; taking and retaining the hand that was extended towards him; and the smile deepened and spread from the youth's lip over his whole face, as presently he said, whispering:
               "They have no garden."
               "None," responded Mr. Falcon.
               "No flowers."
               "No, Clarence."
               "Send her some. Send her some! You must."
               "When?" asked Mr. Falcon, quietly.
               "Why now," said Clarence, looking up.
               "But it's full a dozen miles off that she lives, you remember. We must wait till morning; the night is dark."
               "In the morning," repeated Clarence, slowly.
               "You will not forget to remind me, Clarence. And what shall we send?"
               "The white rose in my room."
               What, that fine tree full of blossoms?"
               "Yes, the one in my room you know, with the—with the—" here he passed his hand slowly over his eyelids as if just waking from sleep. The idea was gone; in another moment his head bent on the marble table again, and his eyes closed. The vivacity of expression which had the moment before enlivened his face, disappeared, and the tranquil, placid smile alone was left in token of the joy that day had brought him.
               With emotion hardly controllable, Mr. Falcon retained his place, watchful of the fair, calm countenance before him, and from that gay and perfumed apartment, from a heart worn with striving, a heart whose zeal had more than once well-nigh eaten up its human habitation, a prayer ascended in thanksgiving for that day.
               While Isidore, not many paces distant, gracefully reclining amongst cushions gorgeous with embroidery, detailed the day's excursion to a very distinguished figure in military undress, her vis-a-vis, who listened to her trifling prattle with a well-bred smile whose meaning a keen eye would have been at a loss to interpret; for it might have been a smile of admiration for her unquestioned grace, or of scorn for her frivolity and foolishness.
               This man had the eye of an eagle; it was one that must prove terrible in command on the field. Before his gaze weaker minds than his, and less than valiant hearts, could but blench and tremble. His attitude even in repose, his carriage when he moved, betokened a resistless and dominant spirit. He was fitted for command. His mind and heart had been trained almost solely for the exercise of control over other minds and hearts,—his profession had been the absorbing topic of his boyhood. To rise and shine in it was the sole aim of his manhood.
               In want of actual service he had contrived to feed his soul on visionary conflicts, but never of self-conquest; on deeds of daring, but never of heroic self-devotion to any thought of grace or hope of Truth; and he had managed to walk in the sight of men a veritable hero, whom opportunity alone had deprived of actual achievements, and definite renown.
               And as a hero no doubt Isidore Baldwin regarded him when, with stately grace, he came within, and went from her father's house, or when he led her, as was of late his habit, through a drawing-room conspicuousness that dazzled and enchanted herself, and made her the envy of surrounding eyes; in crowded scenes where people met with purposes of torture and inestimable sacrifices, actuated by the high and mighty motive of outdoing those who had outdone some others of the set on the preceding occasion, as eminently worthy of a wear and tear of soul and body, among civilized men and women.
               Something, beyond doubt, he had found to admire in this gem of art before him. Something that absorbed, and at the same time abstracted him also. But this evening while he lingered by her side and she sang for him, or talked, or kept silence, it was not as usual with him; he had many a bright speech to make, and many a commanding look and gesture to bestow.
               He went away early, while this mood lasted, leaving behind him a more than ever powerful impression, saying to himself, however, as he went down the avenue in his military grandeur:
               "The pretty little doll! But I have done well tonight. I must be improving. How long must this go on, though? if anything in the heaven above, the earth beneath, or the waters under the earth, can tell."
               While Isidore says languidly, turning her pretty face from the door through which the colonel had made his exit, towards her brother:
               "David, why don't you go into the army?"
               "I?" exclaimed David, looking down upon his sister with a puzzling expression on his features. "I am very comfortable where I am, my dear friend."
               "You might make such a figure!—it is such a splendid profession."
               "Is it, though?" asked he, somewhat doubtingly.
               "Yes, and Colonel Wheaton, I was speaking to him about it; he says you would be sure to rise."
               "Does he, indeed? he is very kind. Are you certain he said so?"
               "Yes, indeed, he did."
               "But there's no prospect of a war, Dora. The reign of peace seems to have begun in earnest."
               "Oh, but it will be all the better for that, of course," said Isidore, enthusiastically, rousing herself from her listless attitude.
               "No, thank you; I prefer to wait till there's a prospect of losing my head or limbs in a battle before I go into the army. I consider the citizen quite as honorable as the military undress, vastly more comfortable too. What was Wheaton reading you?"
               "Oh, something so funny and queer! Hand me the book, the one on the ottoman, and I will read it you. It was Hood's Bridge of Sighs."
               "Ah!" said David, handing her the book, and seating himself by his sister. A dark, heavy frown was on his forehead, but a bitter smile upon his lip. Isidore saw neither. In light and laughing tone, she read; and he, with his arms folded on his breast, severely watched and listened.
               "What are you laughing at?" he exclaimed, at length, when, the poem read, his sister closed the book, and gave it back to him.
               "Poor Hood! he was such a wit."
               "Isidore!" She looked up terrified, he spoke so sternly; but at that he laughed, and she also. "What may the wit of the poem be? I confess I don't see it," he asked carelessly.
               "That's your stupidity," said Isidore, oracularly.
               "But, tell me, did the colonel explain it to you?"
               "Explain it to me! why, brother, no. Worse and worse! Do you think I can't understand Tom Hood without help?" Lightly she laughed, and now her brother echoed her.
               "Oh, no, of course not, Isidore; but, to tell the truth, I'm deucedly dull to-night, and if I owned a harem, and you were my houri, I should command you to interpret poor Tom, so that I could join in your laugh. Come! come! have a little compassion. I swear I'm just dying to know what Tom Hood meant by that poem."
               "Dora! daughter!" It was Mr. Baldwin's voice, and at the call Dora started up, wonderfully relieved for once to hear it. "I must have my night song, birdy; the deuce is in me; I can't go to sleep without it."
               The next moment Isidore was playing, with no little grace of execution, the brilliant accompaniment of her father's favorite song.
               Not a word of it heard David. With angry, inward voice, he was saying to himself,
               "Wheaton has been amusing himself, making a fool of her. I suspected as much. If that ugly little mischief, who torments me with that face of hers, ever comes within these doors, and if she lives she shall come, I'll teach Dora Baldwin a lesson she will be apt to remember. Whoever since the world stood heard of such ignorance? By heaven! The Turk, with his harem, is the only philosopher in the universe. He knows where these women belong! I'll not challenge the colonel; I have tried the same game too often myself. I should have a regiment of brothers up in arms against me."
               This said he, as he strolled from the drawing-room to the balcony overhanging one portion of the garden, up and down which he walked with aimless mind and purpose, inhaling the delicious air, exhaling his indignation, humming a tune, looking at the stars, and annoyed considerably by the fact that he had left his cigar-case at the beach.
               And this reminded him of what he had been thinking in the drawing-room; and with the reminder he returned into the house, to the library, and to his own apartment, and from the shelves of books he made a miscellaneous collection of a dozen volumes, which he put aside, saying:
               "We will make a fair exchange in the morning for the cigar-case, Miss Susan, if you please."
            
            
               XXII.
               BUT on the following day it rained from morning till night, and the occasion does not seem so urgent as to demand a twelve-mile journey in the storm.
               We will take advantage of that fact and make use of it, as house-keepers are wont to do, going about in undress, in a well-grounded hope of freedom from intrusion, looking over old accumulated stores that sadly need arrangement.
               Mr. Baldwin, of the St. John's Hall, and Walter Dillon, fisherman, were boys together; as now they are old, gray-haired men together. The reader knows that already. Between the years of boyhood and of old age a great wave of circumstance had rolled, and wonderfully had it altered their relative position in the world's regard.
               Dillon loved the sea, and, also, from youth to age he had lived in sight of it: had drawn his support from it, had never travelled a hundred miles inland from the beach.
               A deep love for the music and the vastness of its waters, a perfect satisfaction, that filled up the measure of his desires, in aquatic pursuits, were the reward of his fidelity in following the sea, and looking to its generous bosom for support.
               He had no desire to know of, or to share, in the work going on in more populous regions. He had no worldly ambition, little curiosity, and yet was far from being the dull old clown some people might imagine, in view of these facts. He was, in short, a man who was satisfied with his condition and prospects, and was as much a growth of the waters and the beach, the sand and the sunlight, as strong, and as vigorous a growth, as those lichens that cling to the rocks.
               This was not at any time of life, in any manner, true of his friend Ishmael Baldwin. Not in his youth, when he was poor, restless, discontented. Nor in his age, when he was rich, and consequently troubled about many things.
               From the time when Ishmael began to think about anything in particular, one idea had possession of his mind. It grew waywardly with his growth, until it obtained positive dominion over him. Give him riches, oh ye blessed, adorable gods! The desire shone like a sun in his firmament: without it there was but darkness for him. Tell the boy that the reward of labor shall be wealth indeed, and then bid him forth to encounter—what? he will not stay to hear—all the demons the master fiend has in command, if so it must be. He has little faith in demons. Let the obstacles come up one by one, arrayed for full exhibition of their powers, until they seem mighty to overwhelm him—they cannot intimidate. Obstacles are not what he fears; they are not what he contemplates. Only promise him that he shall reach the rich man's paradise at last, then lead him by what road you will, here is a soul that will not falter—on! over Himalayas of difficulty, on through the valley of Tophet. This was the spirit that actuated the man in the first stages of his development. Of course, therefore, he left the beach with the determination never to return until his heart's desire was fulfilled.
               At St. John's he expended the few shillings of which he was master, in the purchase of small goods—thread, pins, needles, and the like, and assuming his pack, set out on his venturous tramp. A tramp of many years duration it proved to be. North, south, east, and west, extending his projects, growing ambitions as he met with success, until he became a man of property.
               It was in his forty-fifth year that he went back to St. John's, his fortune made.
               A greater change than the mere expansion of youth into manhood would seem to imply, had taken place in him. It was as if a graft had superseded the original tendency of growth. It had boasted itself so long against the original branches, that they, finally overcome by the force of the argument, had altogether withered away.
               It was his pride's whim rather than his heart's over-mastering desire, that led him back to the place where he had wanted all things, to enjoy there his prosperity. But at St. John's an irresistible temptation beset him. Lands were selling at high rates there; one day he attended a large sale, and exhibited himself before the people in a gorgeous light, as the highest bidder for the most valuable parcel offered.
               Well, what should he do with it? . . . This question he agitated until rumor helped him out of the difficulty. She told him that he was going to build a splendid house, and make his grounds the marvel of St. John's. He acted on the suggestion, and the barred gates of society gave evidence that they were shaken; slowly they creaking ed on their hinges, and a hand extended from within lured poor Ishmael to push himself, with all due sense of his unworthiness, through the narrow aperture.
               Then he married, and "began to live!"
               Four years his young wife shared with him the splendors of the Hall, and then she faded away like a ghost from the house and the world, leaving behind her these three children, the twin-brothers, and Isidore.
               In their infantile years people often said that Isidore and David were alike; that the resemblance between them was stronger than between the brothers. Such likeness may, in those early years, have been apparent, but subtle was the glance that could in after-times detect it.
               Mr. Baldwin's children had grown up with a full sense of the money-power that placed them where they were,—but it was almost the only lesson deeply impressed upon them by their father; this was taught never in words—in ways indirect, but none the less fatal. They had lived under their father's roof—fed at his table—were his—and every good and perfect outward gift he could bestow, was lavished on them—but by an unthinking hand. The relations existing between him and his children were wholly of an outward nature. He was proud of them—he exulted in the advantageous position won for them by his own vigilance and industry. They must be instructed, their wishes must be consulted, they must be fitted to fill the position he occupied with more of grace and power than he had at command. This the father thought in his heart, and no expense was spared to bring about the desired result.
               And perhaps he was satisfied with the results, now that the young people were around him, their school-days over. It may have been that of all eyes in the world his were the most dazzled by the show they made.
               Isidore had developed as girls do who are managed in the mass in a great female seminary—who are trained it is true, but who, if they are ever developed in any purely perfect way, must thank the inward impulsion, and not any outward influence, that compelled it. We have around us tokens, too abundant to be called rare, of the precious fruits of educational systems as carried forward for the benefit of girls who are to be the women of America, the mothers of the future statesmen of the world's model Republic!
               Faultless, superficial, in feature, and person, and taste, I have already confessed young Isidore—methodically selfish, profoundly incapable she was, besides. Such as her perfections were, none could complain of the development they had—it was perfect.
               But she was one on whom the weightiest truths might wait everlastingly in hopelessness of recognition. One on whom the "eternal years of God," as they went by, freighted with no matter what momentous burden, seemed utterly incapable of enriching. Things significant and potent had to do with her childhood, as with every human childhood, even as with His who, at the age of twelve years, was so alive to the world's need, and wrongs, and folly, that He found voice and theme for disputation with the learned doctors of the temple concerning those momentous things. But she neither saw nor felt them. They were of the truths around which heaven and hell revolve; and though these localities were admitted in her vision of the economy of the universe, they were as intangible, both to her faith and her conscience after all, as any other vision could be. Marvellously stimulated, alive, acute in knowledge of all that pertained to her social position and her worldly advantages, this girl was poor as Lazarus, and dull as the doubting Thomas in every thought, belief, or hope, that living in her might have claimed for her a place above the worm that revels in the dust.
               Bodily and mentally vigorous in his earlier years, David Baldwin gave ample evidence of a life capacitated, and, as it seemed, intended, to achieve much. He had what looked like the true energizing principle within him;—and certainly a favorable point from which to push forward on the path of external fortunes. Incentive, inducement, opportunity, were his. Even observant celestials could not but have anticipated that he would perch, eagle-like, on the pinnacles of human endeavor.
               Every object to which he attached himself in those days, to which he gave his affections, or his thoughts, he clung to strongly, until they shrunk away into their own worthlessness or real proportions, in the very intensity of his grasp.
               The fibres on his nature—they were many—ran eagerly in every direction. But as yet the main root had not struck far down beneath the surface of things, and taken irresistible hold of the idea that should prove sufficient to engross and absorb him. And now, at this time, when the reader first beholds him, the whole plant of life exhibits a sickly state of things—the tree seems dwarfed—one will not readily believe that it has reached its utmost height, that this weariness of all things, this sceptical view of life, this mocking, self-indulgent spirit, is the final result of the work of education that has gone on so many years. That this young life, whose capacities and advantages are sufficient to ensure his occupancy of a moral or intellectual influence in the great world, vaster, more potent than the power of many a crowned sovereign, will suffer itself to dwindle to the corruption, the emasculation of effeminate indulgences and luxurious trifling. Manhood's estate attained with no other hope or purpose than such an one as this.
            
            
               XXIII.
               DAVID BALDWIN did not forget either his cigar-case, nor Susan Dillon and the books, when, the second day after the visit, the sun rose clear and bright.
               The books went down to the beach. But no white rose went with them, for Clarence had by this time quite lost all thought about his kind intent, and Mr. Falcon was too desirous to perfect his experiment to offer a reminder.
               The days following had been one of unceasing storm, and in these three days Susan had not been up to the mill for recitation, nor had she seen Mr. Leighton. She had, in fact, hardly looked at the volumes he gave her to study. Other things had occupied her. But when David's gift came, she did nothing but pore over them hour after hour.
               At length Mr. Leighton came down to the cabin with an order for some things he stood in need of, which he left with Susan for her father to execute at his leisure.
               The moment he entered the room the new books piled upon the mantel attracted his notice. He had hardly spoken to Susan when he turned towards them, and in silence examined them.
               "You have not been up yet to recitation," said he at length dryly, moving away from the mantel.
               "No," said Susan, with less frankness than usual in her eyes and her voice. "It rained so, father did not like me to go out."
               The flimsiness of the excuse she thought made it quite likely that he would treat it with no very great respect. He was singularly patient, however, and said, encouragingly, that if it would please her to do so, he could spare half an hour for the purposes of recitation.
               
               Then was poor Susan obliged to confess that she had no lesson prepared.
               This did not greatly astonish him, apparently. Perhaps then, he said, she had no desire to retain the books, especially now that she was so well provided with others. If neither she nor he had any need of them, some other person might have.
               To which, though in great confusion, Susan responded, that if he would allow her, she would keep them.
               "Give me a lesson!" she finally exclaimed, breaking free from the impulse that would have led her to oppose the silent but mighty influence that she felt he was acquiring over her. "I will learn it this very day; but you must tell me exactly how many pages."
               "Oh, no," said the student, carelessly, half turning away, and yet profoundly observant, and pityingly too, of the fact that the poor child, in very fear of herself, was at this moment so utterly renunciative of that self. "I do not wish to seem so disagreeable to you. I know very well it would not be nearly as pleasant for you to learn the root of a language, and the grand architecture of the universe, as it is to pore over these rhyming lines and stories. You are in your path."
               "Am I, Mr. Leighton? am I, truly?" The voice was close beside him. Startled, surprised, he turned. Susan had risen, and was standing beside him, looking up eagerly into his face, perplexed and tearful.
               Then said he soberly: "I only know that I would not have had you taken as many steps in it as you have taken, for the world, if I could have prevented it."
               "Look at them all, every one," urged she in a low tone. "I will not touch one of them again, I never will, if you say so. It was so lonely here, and I could not understand the books you gave me, and these seemed like friends. They did, indeed." And here Susan burst into tears, which proved the climax of her confusion, if not of the student's perplexity.
               "I take you at your word," said he, presently. And one by one he took down the volumes, and carefully turned the leaves.
               While he was doing this the child had time to recover herself, and as she made no slight effort to do so, her face betrayed both her agitation and her struggle to subdue it.
               "Which of the books have you read?" he asked.
               She told him.
               He was so long in speaking again, that Susan began to indulge in all manner of conjectures in regard to his ultimate conclusion; and she breathed more freely when she fancied that he was himself puzzled how to choose.
               "Susan," he said at length, "how old are you?"
               She told him.
               "I am three times as old; I ought to be a little wiser. Hear me . . . You think it was very kind of the young gentleman up at the Hall to send you these books. Well, so it was; his intention was good. He thought his books would amuse you, and you are so much alone, as you said. No doubt they would amuse you Susan; but what if you gave a little child the privilege of wandering through closets lined with uncovered jars of sweetmeats? If I had charge of a young fellow of resolute energy fit to lead an army, or govern a city, with far more ability than many a king has shown in his government, how do you think I would train him? for weakness or for strength? Would I set him without restriction in the midst of temptations most exhausting to youth? Certainly not. And yet no doubt it would be the wisest plan to open his eyes at once to the temptations—let him see them as they are—not try to hide them from him. How can a man know his strength until he has felt it tested by temptations tions. I am not, therefore, on the whole, sorry that you have had this exposure. And still, had you waited to ask my advice, there is but one book in the whole collection I would have allowed you to keep."
               How severe, how disagreeable this was of him; though he spoke kindly. Moreover, how unaccountable, that a man of his years should stand there lecturing a poor lonely child in such a style as this, because she had found delight in reading a few pleasant story books! Susan looked at the mantel. It was bright with temptations. She thought of the pleasure she had already derived from the books—the judgment was too sweeping. Patiently he waited for her answer. He knew that she was having a sharp conflict with her will. Curiously, yet guardedly, he watched its progress. He had said all that he would say—had given all the leaven he would give. . . . He had sounded the battle-cry. The fight she must conduct herself.
               At length she said:
               "That one book—will you give it me?"
               Leighton did not look as if he had obtained a victory; he seemed rather surprised than elated by her answer.
               "You are at liberty to reverse your decision," he said. "I have changed my own mind within the last moment, and have no right to expect you to do better. I conclude that there is not a solitary volume of them all worth your time. You will do worse than waste time reading them. Years, perhaps, would not rectify the wrong that you might do yourself thus. It would be greatly better for you to go and sit on the rock and find amusement as you used to do."
               "Will you please tell me how far you will hear me recite to-morrow?" said Susan, handing him the books Mr. Leighton had given her to study.
               He took them without a word, silently pointed out the places, and gave back the books to her.
               Presently he asked:
               "When will you recite?"
               "To-morrow, sir."
               Thus she obeyed him.
               "One woman have I found," said Leighton, as he went back to the round room and buried himself again amongst his books and papers. "And shall I lose her? I believe that we must really have the struggle, Mr. Baldwin."
            
            
               XXIV.
               AS she promised, Susan went up the next day to the mill with her lessons learned.
               They cost her much, those lessons, Hours of hard study—not a little despair, not a few tears. Application was a new thing to her, and difficult as new. At first she could not at all succeed in the attempt to concentrate her thoughts. But hard as it was, she found it easier to do that than to meet the surprised and disappointed glance which she knew her failure would have received of Mr. Leighton.
               Yes, whether that was what he had attempted or not, he had succeeded in deepening and quickening the child's thirst for knowledge, in arousing her ambition. And is the reader a woman—need I explain what this statement implies? what it ordinarily, at least, among women implies?
               David Baldwin's books distracted her mind no longer. She turned from them, and gave all her thoughts to Mr. Leighton's tasks. And she found her reward. It came before the day dawned wherein he said, "I would trust you now with the key to all the written trash that ever saw the light."
               After Susan had resolutely entered on her studies, she used every morning to go up to the mill to recite. Dillon was well pleased with this arrangement, and manifested his sense of the student's services by superintending his domestic affairs, regularly taking him into the account when he laid in a supply of provisions for himself, as if he had been one of the family.
               Mr. Leighton's example in the prosecution of his own studies was a constant incentive to the child. If she had felt the inclination she could not have found the courage to lag. His industry knew no bounds; writing or studying, his mind was continually occupied, never at rest. Sometimes—for the child had a faculty of making herself needful as well as useful to those with whom she came in contact—sometimes he would permit, and again would call upon her, to assist him by hunting up some point in history, or in establishing the justness of some assertion, the correctness of some allusion, by quotation from an obscure text. And in this way her reading went on, extending much further than it would have done, had a library, under ordinary circumstances, been at her disposal. For in whatever direction his thoughts went searching for similar thoughts in other minds as shown in books, he never allowed her to merely read the passage he desired to have brought before him, but would point out its drift and connection, and in some way draw out her thoughts in regard to it. He compelled her to think.
            
            
               XXV.
               TRUE to the promise given on that day of the Baldwin visit to the beach, Mr. Falcon was now again there as a visitor—and Clarence with him.
               All recollections of Susan seemed to have passed from the boy's mind, until on this morning, when Mr. Falcon mentioned her name, he insisted on going down to the beach on horseback to see her again.
               Susan found them waiting for her when she went home from a recitation.
               There was that in the outward Falcon which inspired in all honest minds, that came in contact with him, a serene confidence. That in the healthful and quite grand organization, that commanded an involuntary tribute of respect from those who approached him. The perfections of his heart did not suffer in contrast with the goodly temple that enshrined it. His countenance was benign, impressive—the voice in correspondence, and his manner was a still further endorsement of the virtues of the man. Active goodness shone from every feature. Touch the man at any point of thought—the electric spark gave its token. Here was one who never would choose the "other side" of the way than that on which the fainting traveller, fainting from whatsoever cause might chance, had fallen. His hand was as ready as his heart for service. And through life, since the days of his youth, it had been true of him, as of the Philippian jailer, he had ever bowed in instant acknowledgment of Truth's new revelations to his mind;—and sometimes he had suffered on account of the too quick recognition. In all inquiry indefatigable—humble and teachable in spirit, brave in services rendered to the maligned, the incapable, and oppressed, he had borne with clean hands and a clean heart such vessels of the Lord as had been entrusted to him. Children and dumb creatures proved all this true of him, in the freeness of their love and trust. He it was, as we know, who had first succeeded in re-arousing Clarence Baldwin's interest in any living thing; and from the first day of their meeting, as the reader also knows, the youth had clung to him with a sense of safety, and an affection quite unaccountable in his own family when they first witnessed it. The influence which Susan had unconsciously exerted, and was still exerting, over him, was an advance upon that.
               Instead of bringing the rose-tree with him, Clarence brought for Susan a variety of flowers, which he had tastefully arranged with his own hand. With these he hastened forward in advance of Mr. Falcon, when, after wandering some time about the place, they saw her coming along the beach with her books, now carrying them under her arm, now bearing them on her head. He had but time to transfer the flowers to her hands, when Mr. Falcon came up, and began chatting with her, in his cordial but dignified manner.
               "Clarence and I were tired of waiting for you to come and make the promised visit at the Hall. How well you are getting on, my dear! And how is your father? gone out? That's a pity. The blood is getting red in your cheeks: we shall have a rosy face again now that you're on safe ground. You weathered a perilous storm though. What have we here? Are you studying these books?" He looked through them while Susan answered his questions, smoothing many times in a thoughtful, abstracted manner, the page on which was written, with a large boyish flourish, the name of Mark Leighton.
               "Your teacher lives in the mill, eh? What sort of a young fellow may he be?" he asked at length.
               Susan told him of the tall, thin figure, gray hair and studious habits of Mr. Leighton. In deep attention Mr. Falcon listened; and when she finished, some moments elapsed before he commented.
               "An old man, eh?"
               "As old as father, I should think."
               "Possible?"
               "He looks every day as old."
               "Susy," exclaimed Clarence, speaking with an earnest, perplexed look, and drawing nearer to Susan, "what is it about Tom?"
               In spite of Mr. Falcon's determination to be surprised by no feature of this awakening process, he started, with hardly less self-control than Susan, to hear this questioning, and at the motion accompanying it—for having spoken, Clarence offered Susan his arm; she, embarrassed, but pitying still, accepted it, and he led her away to the little place of graves, and Mr. Falcon walked off in an another direction.
               "I have a white rose-tree," said he, when they came up to the enclosure. "May I send it down to you?"
               "Would it live?" asked Susan, surprised at his words, but greatly relieved also, that he seemed now to have forgotten that he had asked about poor Tom.
               "You could make it," said he. "I wish I lived down here."
               "Oh no, not when you have such a beautiful home in St. John's," replied Susan, quickly.
               "You have n't been up, Susy; how do you know it's beautiful?"
               "Oh I've heard about it."
               "Go home with me to-night and see, will you, Susy?"
               "On foot?" said Susan smiling, "or shall I ride behind you on your horse?"
               With a serious smile Clarence answered her:
               "If I come down in the carriage for you, will you come?"
               "Oh yes, if you want me."
               "To-morrow?"
               "Oh no, not to-morrow! some other time," said Susan hastily, quite taken aback by this summary way of managing affairs.
               
               "I wish I lived here. Where is Tom? I thought you had a brother?"
               Before Susan could answer, his mind was wandering in another direction.
               "Don't you hate a dinner party? Up at the Hall we have them. They tire one so." And then back again into the theme that had taken such hold on his mind. "What do you do all the time, Susy? I should think you would want some one. It's so still and pleasant." He looked around him with delight, "and I could help your father!"
               His face became brighter and brighter with the intelligent and coherent desire he felt—brightened as it had not in years. Surprised and embarrassed at his words, and still more at his manner of speaking them, Susan looked back anxiously, hopeful that Mr. Falcon was near. But though still in sight, he had wandered away in an opposite direction from them, and was now hardly within call.
               Susan was therefore thrown, as Falcon intended she should be, wholly on her own resources for the entertainment of her guest. Once fairly engaged in the enterprise, she did not find it a difficult task; for never was listener more absorbed than Clarence by this child, whether she spoke or whether she was silent.
               She was still speaking, and herself more and more engaged in the monologue, when Mr. Falcon came back and found her thus occupied, Clarence leaning against the enclosure of the graveyard, intently listening to her words.
               They made a happy party that day. Late in the afternoon it was enlarged by the arrival of Horace Chilton and his sister, who came down to see the moon rise.
               In the cabin Leah sang her best songs, and on the beach they all resorted to the old amusement of testing the strength of their voices in playful rivalry, in which Clarence joined with all his soul. They wrote their names upon the sand, all excepting Clarence, who could not write at all, but who stood apart watching the others, and Susy, as he called her, with especial interest. They sat among the rocks, and Mr. Falcon told them stories of sea life, which would have done justice to an old tar's enthusiasm and invention, and over their tea in the twilight, which meal Leah helped Susan to prepare, they held high festival.
               At dark they went down again to the beach, and climbed up once more among the rocks, and in the grandeur of that shadowy retreat deeper thoughts and more sober discourse went on among the little party.
               In this, Mr. Falcon of course led the way, and as ever made the most of the occasion. There was no such thing as time-wasting with this man; at all times and everywhere he had a consciousness and a tact that enabled him to greet the ever-present with an "all hail!" and without making himself obnoxious to any sluggard, he managed to give the moments his own royal mark in passing.
               Speaking now, he addressed himself particularly to Horace Chilton, whose life and endeavor he seemed to have already very clearly discerned. A most mercurial temperament was that of young Chilton, in eternal 
                     vascillation
                     vacillation
                   between the lightest gaiety and the most unfortunate, unhappy depression, and despondency.
               To some discouraged utterance, or it may have been merely a sigh, that escaped Horace, who sat next him, Falcon said:
               "The just must live by faith, my boy, and all will come out right." There was a living belief in the man that proclaimed itself in his words. He said them with such earnest conviction of their inmost truth, that even Horace could not with curled lip or scornful heart cry out against the trash and cant of it.
               
               How ready and glad his listeners were to come to such sort of speech, they all testified, at least in a manner sufficiently definite for Mr. Falcon's encouragement. Horace took off his cap, pushed the hair from his forehead, and looked as if about to speak, yet he said nothing.
               Mr. Falcon's face was bent towards him. He saw this motion—thought he understood it; he understood better the silence of the other three listeners, who were ranged along beside him. And he continued:
               "Everything in this life that we see finds its explanation, if one will only remember the fact that all things relating to man's world are the result of his own working. The sooner people refrain from taking their Heavenly Father to task for what they call unequal providences, and proceed to examine into their affairs with honest eyes, the better it will be for them. They will see where all the wrongs come from. We show what manner of faith is in us by our works. The spirit that is in us, remember that! works its way outward, and takes its place according to its power and virtue, either in a marble pillar or statue, a house, or a painting, or a book, in a battle or a law, or a murder, or a martyrdom, or in eating or drinking. The just must live by faith."
               "Why?" said Clarence. The question could not have come from either of the other listeners, yet not one of them but was glad to hear it.
               "Because," said Mr. Falcon, who had a very clear perception of the truth he was attempting to convey to these young receptive minds, "we are not gods. We are subject to laws. We must obey them, work according to them, believing that if we are obedient—obedience is the sum of all duties to God—we shall achieve the result we aim at. So we shall. We must in the end find what we seek. Right seeking necessitates this. Christ himself has assured us of it; 'Seek, and ye shall find.' Now just look at the work of the man who has no faith. How feeble it is! He languishes at preaching, because he is not content to leave the harvest to the lawful gatherer. His picture is worthless; his statue, confusion. His battle is a shameful defeat. The just must live by faith. There's no other way for him; no other hope."
               Along the east, stretching wide to either side of the point from which the moon would rise, just above the water's edge, lay a heavy mass of black clouds, from which burst frequent flashes of lightning in one direction; here chains of purple splendor, there broad and blinding radiance. The cloud itself did neither rise nor spread, but remained one vast heavy mass, brooding low upon the water, stretching far along the horizon.
               Above this cloud the heaven was clear, and bright with stars.
               The pause that followed Mr. Falcon's words was not yet broken when, as with a bound, above the cloud rose the full moon, serenely above the vexation and commotion of those stormy tokens, queen of heaven and of night. Her path gave its reflection to the waters.
               The effect of this sudden flood of light upon the darkness was strangely felt, the emotion seemed communicable and magnetic, so similarly were the members of the little party affected by it. They arose as with one impulse, and Mr. Falcon with them, reverently aware of the right queenly presence in which they stood.
               "So," exclaimed he, taking advantage of the moment, "so shall life also at length rise triumphant, and the black dreariness of falsehood, with its forked tongues, shall not avail in strife against her. It shall cower like that cloud down right into the embrace of oblivion, for it cannot help itself, while she shall reign and serve. Now, young folks, we will take that lesson home with us and think about it. Clarence, we have a hard ride before us—twelve miles is a pretty fair price to pay for this indulgence; we must lose no time, or your father will think me the greater boy of the two, with good reason."
               So they all went back to the cabin, and the horses were got ready, and in another half-hour the sound of the horse hoofs was quite lost to the listening ear; and Horace and Leah were gone, and Susan, feeling herself in some way enriched by this double visitation, sat alone on the door-step, thinking that perhaps if she could go up to the Hall, as they all were urging her to do, there might be something pleasant in the trip; and thinking—thinking, oh, a wondrous many things beside.
            
            
               XXVI.
               ONE morning, not long after this visit, Susan Dillon went up to Harlem, and there was overtaken by a storm. It chanced that Horace Chilton saw her as she was taking refuge from it in a shop, and forthwith conveyed himself to her with the assurance that the rain was to continue many hours, and she must go down to his mother's house, and visit Leah.
               The house in which the widow lived, a cottage of no great pretensions, yet far from the humblest of its class, was situated on the border of the village with some bits of yard in the front and rear. A small building with low ceilings it was, yet still no mean or petty dwelling place, compared with that from which Susan had emerged.
               As yet, Horace informed her, as they hurried along the narrow, ill-kept street of the dismal village, Leah was occupied in her school-room, but she would soon be disengaged; meantime he should leave her under his mother's charge.
               Accordingly, somewhat to her consternation, Susan was ushered into the apartment occupied by his mother, a square room fitted up in a style of splendor which made the poor child halt and apparently meditate a retreat, instead of following Horace when he opened the door and went forward.
               "Miss Baldwin's little friend, mother. Susan, from the beach."
               His mother, Mrs. Chilton, a dignified, elegant woman,—elegant in spite of time and ill-fortune, the ravishers of beauty, was seated on an ottoman before a window, mending a rent in one of the lace curtains in which, evidently, some clownish foot had entangled itself. She looked up with ill-concealed surprise at her son, and at Susan while he spoke—half rose and bowed courteously;—would the young lady be seated?
               Little was Susan pleased with the manner of this introduction; it was so marked that she could but see, though she could not clearly understand it, that the manner alone turned the lady's manifest impatience into a smile of welcome. If he had not said it was Miss Baldwin's friend, Susan had hardly seen the smile, or heard the gracious welcome. But there was magic in that name—and Mrs. Chilton was not above castle-building.
               Horace remained only long enough to clear the path for Susan's entrance, and then went away, saying that he should return soon, but the shop must be looked after until the doctor came back.
               That was an awful presence into which Susan had come—a dire escape that she had made. Yet it brought up a pleasant vision of the old time, and the ladies who in those days frequented the house on the beach during the hot season. It was also another testimony concerning the world from which Miss Baldwin fluttered down the other day. The world of beauty, grace, refinement, and delight, in which David and Clarence had always lived.
               
               The splendor of the room at first greatly impressed Susan. But her eyes were too strong, too searching, to be blinded by it longer than the moments in which they were so taken by surprise.
               And even after she saw the tarnished splendor in its own light, and how worn it was with long-striving to keep up a decent show, and so well kept too, as if the hands of the owners had fought a hand-to-hand fight with time for its preservation; the first impression of the splendor did not pass, but held good still.
               Once that carpet, faded, and in places worn threadbare, had been gay to see, and soft to tread upon. Visions of the days when festive feet, satin-slippered, had glided over it, were yet lingering in the eyes of its mistress.
               The softly-cushioned chair which Horace drew forward towards Susan, and in which she seated herself, was covered with striped silk of faded red, and tarnished gold color, neither fair to critic eyes, nor good for common using. The astral shade crowning the exquisitely wrought bronze lamp was fearfully shattered in the quarter turned towards the wall; the books which lay upon the table were soiled and grim; they also had done service in that old time; how frequently their dainty pages had been turned; and oh, under what immense disparity of circumstances!
               Over the mantel, suspended by a red silken cord and tassel, hung a picture, well executed and quite impressive, of mythologic character.
               These things, reminiscences sad, but trustworthy, of ancient splendors, and especially the lady herself, were in striking contrast with the low ceilings of the house and its locality; they were all exotic; they had not flourished since they were transplanted—they were all out of place.
               Mrs. Chilton was a proud, haughty looking woman, slightly above medium height. There was more stamina in her pride than in that of Isidore Baldwin. Not more wisdom, but a certain something that seemed better to justify and maintain it.
               Her hair was black, abundant, lustrous, and worn with what we are wont to call queenly grace. Her eyes held one at a distance—cold, bright, repellent; they had done execution in their time; there was little of pity, little of sympathy in them, though they had known tears, enough of them. Her dress was plain, a mere cotton mourning robe; but it was worn with an inimitable grace, which would not have shamed the ermine. She had the manner of a dispenser of laws in fashionable circles—of one who would not readily overlook or forget, in the offender, a breach of etiquette. Shut up in that box of a house, in the dismal village, she was strangely out of place. Instinctively one understood that somewhere a deplorable mistake must have been made, or this climax could not have been brought about.
               The storm, instead of abating, continued during the afternoon, with increasing violence; there was no probability that Susan would be able to return to the beach that night, and Mrs. Chilton graciously set her mind at rest on that point, early in her visit.
               And while Horace was still in his shop, and Leah in her school-room, three hours Susan was left alone with their mother. Now the reader is doubtless in a wonder as to how the lady and the child contrived to pass that time alone together, since, after the Baldwin topic was discussed, there could be nothing in common between them.
               The room itself was full of resources. In the first place, there were all those books of travel and annuals adorned with fine engravings to look at: and a delight and refreshment were they to Susan's eyes. Then there was the St. John's Journal, which Horace had left with his mother, and this Susan read aloud while Mrs. Chilton continued her mending. But even those resources were exhausted long before the three hours were ended.
               Child as Susan was, and untutored in the ways of the world, clad in coarse garments, and incessantly, in every breath she drew, every step she took, every motion she made, violating some law which Mrs. Chilton had been accustomed to regard as sacred, to be kept inviolate, she was still a thoughtful, quiet, tranquil girl, endowed with receptive faculties; and, in the course of the passing hours, during which Mrs. Chilton had questioned much and Susan had answered according to her ability in regard to the Baldwins, they hit, by chance or otherwise, on more personal concerns, and at length, how or wherefore we will not stay to question, the lady was finally launched on a theme more absorbing to herself, and just then to Susan also, than any other. And losing all definite sense as to who and what Susan was, a raw girl, the daughter of an obscure fisherman, whose home was in a cabin on the sea-beach, so little and so humble that it would have troubled her to understand how human beings could move and live in it, yielding to the temptation of a listener, in Susan's ear was poured the whole story of Mrs. Chilton's early years, her first marriage, and the modes of life to which she had been in those days accustomed; her subsequent misfortunes, second marriage, and present state. All this of course not for the sympathy that Susan could give, or the counsel she could offer, but from the irresistible desire to utter herself anew in the ear of a human being.
            
            
               XXVII.
               FROM that story, looked at from another point of view than that occupied by its heroine, what follows is presented—should I say for the special consideration of the reader, some critic would be sure to cry out against the ignorant abuse of art. I do not assume to be artistic; I am merely endeavoring to portray the manner in which some folks get along.
               Mr. Chilton, the father of Horace and Leah, was a man of skill and science, as industrious and hopeful in the early part of his career, as Mr. Baldwin ever was in his. The difference in the results of the labors of these two men was as great as that between themselves. The ship-builder, laboring for the general advantage in his plans and aims, lost sight of the particular profit which smaller men might have reaped in abundance from his early discoveries. His brain was fertile in suggesting improvements, his mind was prolific in such suggestions. Other men entered into his labors and reaped the advantage. He suggested great discoveries, which, carried out into positive fulfilment by others, crowned their names with honor; he built large foundations, brought together in abundance all needful material, prepared workmen with minute instructions, did all but the final work necessary to establish his special right and title to honors, which became the enriching spoil of other men.
               Thus his youth and manhood passed away; and the builder, who never built, began at last to have sad days of reckoning with himself, and in those days the Tempter was near him with his subtlest wiles. The Tempter whom he had laughed at, and toyed with, and defied, and set at nought, in his bright, and hopeful, and resolving youth; the lying Tempter who led his soul on to the prison gates of Death. Chilton died in the delirium of intemperance.
               His death left his wife a second time a widow. Her first marriage with Mr. Butler took place in her extreme youth. Mr. Butler was a man of reputed wealth, one of the influential merchants of the time. A man of decision, of purpose, and large schemes. Self-willed, self-sufficient, prudent, yet daring, he had been a manager of affairs his life-long, first in his father's house, then in his own, according to his own will and pleasure. He chose his young wife, in his mature manhood, with a sultanic exercise of sovereignty from a bevy of gay girls, and she filled such a place as he, who understood her capacity best, allowed—filled it admirably. It was not a high place—her sway was not an extended or an exalted one—but such as her capacity permitted.
               It was the very position for which she had been trained from infancy. She never complained, never fretted against it. Preposterous idea! It was perfect bliss to her! Not a care in the world—not a thing to do—and that was Repose . . . . oh Gods, celestial and human, repose from what? . .
               So she ascended into the heaven of butterflies, and flitted away life until Mr. Butler became a bankrupt, sickened, and died. Now all this was no world-wonder—nothing like it. The merchant's career was not, could not be, a startling fact to those among whom his law had been immutable. Such things were happening every day.
               But the weeds of widowhood symbolled darkly the gloom that had fallen on Mrs. Butler's life. Her desolation was complete. It was not that of the bereft and stricken heart, for that is always comforted, if comfort it will take, in one way or another. A worse thing than bereavement had befallen her.
               There was a necessity of immediate exertion that could not be waived. It terrified her. Wealth and fashionable friends, position, ease, security, she saw deserting her. Everything except her needy self—the foundations of her world were shaken to the centre. The flowers were dead, the first frost had fallen, yet she was still alive, and had no shelter. No, for the Creator has made no provision for these ephemera. They are not the work of His hand—he provides for them no chrysalis. When the storm breaks it falls on their defencelessness.
               Now, an energetic, sensible, and sanguine woman, who has never been anybody's doll, nor anybody's puppet, may be impelled to nothing better than denunciation, contemptuous and wrathful, of this poor widow who was left in the position of a lost child in the wilderness of the world. But let not that woman cease thinking of this thing when her wrath has exhausted itself.
               For if, dear friend, under the broad heaven anything more worthy of your pity, bearing the impress of a sentient life, can be found, than the woman suddenly deprived of the hand that, perhaps in its kindness, perhaps in its stupidity, perhaps in its selfishness, dwarfed her mental and spiritual being, so that it had not outgrown, and could not outgrow, the stature of its childhood; deprived of the carnal riches on which she was taught to rely, and on which she did rely, in a contemptuous unbelief in any better power, if there is a desolation more complete, a destitution more hopeless, by what name, and under what form, does it appear?
               Whose fault is it that these things were so? Human justice will probably acquit you, slumbering in your grave, lord of this poor lady's worldly fortunes, Theodorus Butler. True, it was a wrong you wrought—but then, the extenuation is not wanting. The judgment that you formed was hardly other than inevitable. Were you not aided in its formation by a just masculine estimate of the gaseous feminine element through which fortune had led you?
               You married, we know, a child. You drew her out to your embrace from the shelter of a home circle where her maiden years were spent. And you trusted, perhaps tenderly and lovingly, hoping against hope, for the developement of that flower. You dreamed of depths of purity and spiritual fragrance, of all that man dares hope, and look, and ask for, of the heart of woman; in spite of all your eyes had seen, your ears had heard, you dreamed again the sweet poetic boyish dream, in your ripe manhood. And you still had hope, when hope, in the midst of those actual things that made your life, was but the mirage of the desert. She was so young, and Nature! . . . Nature! alas, in bondage from her birth, reared the slave of custom in word, faith, act, and thought, what could Nature do?
               You learned it for yourself that it was such a childhood as never culminates in the "bright consummate flower" of a noble womanhood. It was a grievous, because hopeless and irremediable, case for you. You made the best of it, in continuing your household's only head. It never had a heart. You looked for her to bring that portion—that fountain into the desert market-place where your fate, yourself, had fixed you. . . . The dead man may, perhaps, sleep in peace. It was, doubtless, not given him to work a miracle.
               But then, whose fault was it? . . . Nay, nay, whose grievous sin was it, that these things were so? In sober earnestness I ask an answer. Free am I to confess that the question has vexed me much. And in all sincerity I trust that the reader has some desire to have it settled also, (not by throwing it, and the book that contains it under the table!) that the record may go on, having made safe transit of so dangerous a pass. There must always be a halting point, and a season of perplexity, as every traveller knows, if the people will not mend their ways!
               Was the fault yours, legitimate, necessary, inevitable issue of vanity and infidelity, neglect and folly? Yours, poor butterfly, pampered with flattery, poisoned by luxury, and every indulgence that could best enfeeble and unsoul you? Yours, to whom this wondrous world of God must always be, if not a holiday instituted especially for your display of silks and satins, furs and diamonds, fine features, fine manners, and fine furniture, a poor, stupid concern—or, if your thought can soar so high, and take a broader cognizance of events, a very astonishing failure, a very essential mistake? . . . Yours! heaven and earth acquit you!
               Whose, then?—for an effect so momentous must have had a cause, and God's providence is not to be confounded with the "wrong"—whose fault that you flit before the face of Heaven's Lord to-day, so strange a spectacle for thinking men and angels?
               Let those answer for it who have educated and refined you after a fashion like this. Who have brought children into life and taught them only of the things of death—who have brought you into a world whose King was crowned with thorns, and by example persuaded you that he taught superfluous nonsense when he told you that the life was more than the raiment—that the thorn which proves a soul's pure faith is better than the palm that tells the homage of a self-seeking generation.
               Long ago the blood of the slain Abel cried out from the ground, and the Almighty heard that voice. So also from the grave where a sacred truth is lying, does a reproachful voice, and an appealing cry ascend. That truth shall yet have a glorious resurrection. And in that day it may be the kingdom of heaven will be taken by violence. Then shall there be another dispensation than this of vanity and ignorance . . . A very vigorous purification of this century's civilization. "On, for ever, on!" but whither? at the rate we are now going it behooves us to halt and to ask, WHITHER? of God, or man, or the Devil. To the verge of what kingdom is it we have come? What is that cry that echoes all along the shore? and that strange light encircling the horizon?
            
            
               XXVIII.
               COUNSELLORS the widow had. And all manner of impossible ways of escape from the doom that had befallen her, did they point out to the bewildered woman. These, one after another, in desperate mood, she endeavored to carry out in a practical manner! But they all failed when put to the test of use; and driven by her extremity to continual activity of attempt, Mrs. Butler finally sought out for herself an occupation, and managed to derive a living from it. But soon tiring of this state of things, this responsible independence, she married again.
               This obviously was her time of resurrection, could she then, with living energy, have broken the seal of her sepulchre, the control of habit, and complied bravely and obediently with the suggestions of opportunity. For Michael Chilton, gifted as he was, and noble, had yet need both of a guide and a friend—a veritable helpmate; more than anything else in the world he needed this, a constant friend—such as one common household alone could ensure him—a friend who, by confidence, trust, and affection, could nourish and quicken in him his languishing faith in himself.
               If his wife could only have understood his gifts and his needs! If with the instinct of a true woman she had understood the ministry that might have served him! But how should she?
               Thus, after years which vanished, leaving no token either of present or future good, he gave up the ghost of his forlorn hope, all the great works he had attempted unfulfilled, all his best designs failing, or falling into ruin around him, and yielding to the temptation that had beset his youth, he fell; and his family were left wholly destitute of provision for the future.
               For a long time after this calamity had befallen them, Mrs. Chilton supported the children by embroidery, but her eyes at length refused the hard service to which they had been compelled, and now Horace was employed in the drug shop, and Leah had her scholars and did "everything" beside.
               This school was the unfailing source of disquiet to the mother. Until Horace, moved by his sister's entreaties, co operated with her, and made the school an actual, existing fact, the mother declared it to be an impossibility. And then when the little ones, an unpromising, ungainly set, to be sure, as ever came under one roof together, when they were gathered in the school-room, as they designated the corner of the shed once used by Mr. Chilton for his workshop, there was, alas! alas! no trouble in life comparable with that of the poor woman who was constrained to see this awkward squad of ill-behaved, and worse dressed "vulgarians," coming and going from her house, morning, noon, and night; continually recurring martyrdom! exercising all the lawless liberty of childhood.
               Leah did her best under the harsh circumstances; patiently and well she did it. The "best" was good. And in spite of all hinderances this girl of feeble health and few years was fortifying herself with the noblest hopes, and looking forward, to what? to what, with calm expectance, and peaceful-heartedness! to years of labor, and womanhood not one whit more attractive than that of "poor Miss Scroggs," the withered and forlorn rival schoolmistress in Harlem.
               But Mrs. Chilton would never, even 
                     in in
                     in
                   her most secret meditations, admit the prospect. Cajoling and deceiving herself, propping up her hopes with unsubstantial fancies, she absolutely refused, after all her experience refused, to look Life and Time and Fact in the face; she must still have interposed the spangled veil of tissue, the softening and graceful illusion. Surely some great worldly good was yet to wait upon that fair young life. The sublime pomp, and the sweet vanity, were surely yet in store for all of them!
               It was an immense stupidity that could not see in Leah Chilton's life the serene result of occupied hours, and fulfilled duties; that highest and best reward, that never yet failed the faithful laborer. Why could she not be made aware of the blessed truth that shone forth in her daughter's daily life? The surety that she had found the source of joy, and proved it to be hidden from the world; a fountain never to be broken by the driftwood and the refuse of the world?
               She could not understand that "the light that never shone on sea or land" made the day beautiful, the night holy, and life precious to her child; that the Pentecostal Gift had its present significance and reflection in that pure existence—that for her it had somewhat beside a mere symbolic excellence and virtue. That for her in very truth the secret of the mystery of all warring tongues was given up—sorrow, want, and trial—she had the serene wisdom that could annul all their clamorous discord.
               Stung of a venomous serpent, the people looked to see the "greatest" and "least" of all the Apostles vanquished, dying. As if a serpent's venom might harm that charmed life! Works love no miracle in these later days for vulgar, hard, unloving minds to wonder at? Do no vipers cling to the right hand of valiant enterprise? Is it given a viper to sting a hero to death?
            
            
               XXIX.
               'T IS a rude rostrum in point of fact. The teacher's desk is a large box, strangely suggestive of a retail dry good's store—upon which is placed a little old writing desk; beside the desk is a bell, and near it an inkstand and a multitude of pens. Before this formidable pile sits the teacher, "like patience on a monument, smiling," not at grief, but at life; unwearied, unterrified, calm and contented. The twenty have just defiled before her, one by one, each taking her hand in parting, and receiving their due portion of her smile. Even now that they are all gone, the pleasant look has not passed away from the delicate features of the pale face; she has neither been deceiving herself or them in the past hours; there is a deal of sunshine in her heart.
               They are all gone; the door was closed by the last little hand that rested on the latch—it is quiet there—so quiet that for the first time Leah hears the beating of the storm against the windows.
               And now she takes out from her desk a scarlet purse nearly completed, and begins to work at it. Now she lays it back upon the desk, and draws a narrow strip of paper towards her, and applies herself to the solution of a housewife's problem; if so much is allowed for the dozen mats, and half dozen purses, and everybody pays in the quarter's tuition when it is due, why, the rent can be paid the very moment it is demanded, . . . and there will be,—how many dollars left beside? It is a trifling sum. I will not venture on a plainer statement, but Leah is satisfied with it, and contemplates, while she reckons, some little gift for her mother. . . . And then presently her head rests upon the desk, and Christ alone hears what it is she says. It may be she is pleading his own words about the sparrow's fall in behalf of those dear lives so tenderly involved in all her ways and doings.
               The door opens, but for a moment longer the head droops there, unlifted. When her face turns toward the intruders, she goes not away from the gate of Heaven, but they ascend towards her; and can they do so, and yet know it not?
               Five minutes ago, while the children, wild with fun, dashed through the mud and little ponds of water between the school-room and the shed, enjoying the sport like young ducklings, the parlor-door was suddenly thrown open, and a voice filled it,
               "Come, Susan! hurry up, if you would see our school ma'am in her den."
               At the sound of this voice, Susan rose quickly. Following Horace, she went through the hall, across a narrow passage beyond it, up a flight of steps, and the door that obstructed further vision being opened, revealed a long, narrow room, well lighted, clean, and cheerful, furnished with benches, and two long tables, a black-board, and the unpretending throne occupied by the lady of the realm.
               "Arise," said Horace, hurrying across the room. Leah obeyed him, greeting Susan with a kiss.
               "Pot-hooks and ladders! Never mind these, Leah; I'll get ready the copies for you. Susan will remain over night on account of the storm, and for some other reasons. She has been shut up with mother all the afternoon; amuse her if there is anything left of you. You do stand it like a Trojan. Sh! . . . I will say it."
               "Even if you don't know what you are talking about. Come, Susan, we will have the walk, since he orders it." And, as though she had not been perplexing herself with accounts, which held a close relation to the daily bread of life, as if she had not fagged six hours of that day over tasks most wearisome, as if in every other of its waking hours she had not been constant in exertions, of one kind and another, for the household good and comfort, in compliance with what she conceived to be her filial and fraternal obligations, Leah began walking up and down the school-room, Susan by her side, interesting and amusing the child. But not a moment of the time was she idle. The red purse was in her hands, and her fingers were bringing it to a conclusion.
               She had taken the last stitch, and explained the school-room and its arrangements to her guest, and drawn Susan quite within her heart, when Horace rose from the desk, having finished preparing the copies for the children's next day use.
               "Now I am going to show Susan some of father's tools," said he, "she is fond of looking at such things;" and so Leah and Susan followed him back into the house, and up the narrow stairway into the tiny chamber, with sloping ceilings, which was occupied by him.
               It seemed a sort of lumber-room. Against the walls trunks and boxes were piled, one upon another. On the walls were two or three drawings in plain, unvarnished frames, his father's work, unfinished, just as he had left them. Under these stood a large chest of polished black walnut, the precious chest of tools. This Horace unlocked and opened. How its contents shone! One by one he took out these tools, and showed them to Susan, holding them up for her to look at, but not in a single instance did he allow them to pass from his to her hands. In not one of these instruments could a speck or flaw be detected, though the handles gave evidence of much but also of most careful using.
               Besides the tools, there were in the trunk several rolls of parchment, and card paper. While Horace opened these, his sister and Susan sat down beside him, and he showed them the meaning of the beautiful designs. There were two old books of architecture, which he likewise lifted with careful hand and arranged with reverent look.
               "I would n't exchange that chest for Aladdin's lamp," said he, closing it, and transferring the key from the lock to his guard-chain.
               "Why, no," said Leah, "I should think not, since it is every whit as good."
               "I don't suppose the fellow could have sold his lamp to a goldsmith for the price of old brass. But as to this chest, it would fetch any day—"
               "Hush!" said Leah. The reproof seemed hardly to be a reproof, it was so gently uttered, and still she was in earnest; that he should absolutely have arrived at the idea that that trunk and its contents had a market value!
               "I said nothing," returned Horace, reddening; "if I knew its market value to a fraction, torture could not get it out of me."
               "It is beyond all price to you—we all know that. Just as it should be. It was so to father—Susan, did you know that we had Mr. Falcon down here yesterday?"
               "Oh, yes," exclaimed Horace, laughing; "Daniel come to judgment'—eight miles to look after me! Don't you think he came on a fool's errand, Susan?"
               "The conceit of the boy!" said Leah, but she smiled.
               "For what did he come, then? I say he came to preach. Hearing's believing."
               "Is Mr. Falcon a preacher?" asked Susan, innocently.
               "A regular stump orator, Susan, with the lungs of a whale, and a most wonderful blower at that. And he is the most considerate of the tribe, too! So delicate! You know they are all remarkable for their tact! Sh, Leah! if he had only got out of the house without putting his foot into the lace curtain, he would have made a convert of mother. You know it. Susan, were you ever at St. John's?"
               "No."
               "No! It is a wonderful place. Why, do you know the orator, or the preacher, as you call him—"
               "I, Mr. Horace?"
               "Yes, you—don't interrupt me—he has got a fellow up there whose acquaintance I am to make; it's to do me a great deal of good, you know. I'm to be purged of the whole of my sins and iniquities, as soon as I get into his orbit. Sh! Leah, I say, indeed, I'm in earnest. This artist, you know, Susan, has a trade, supports himself by it, consequently the way for me to do is to keep in the drug business; is not that logic severe enough for you? He paints houses, and signs of houses, window-blinds, and fences, and furniture, and for that good reason I am to continue in the pill and powder line. You see, it's clear as mud."
               "How it rains!" exclaimed Leah, rising. "If the storm would last a few days, what a fine time we should have here together, we three. Only Horace will dispute so much. Horace would do for a persecuting attorney. I'm sure he would succeed at that."
               
               "But hear that!" cried Horace, laughing, "the nice times have begun already—hear that!" the rain had found for itself a way through the decaying roof, and dropped without ceremony on the floor.
               "The old shell will be afloat by morning. If it is n't, we'll keep the drawbridge down, and no one shall come in, or venture out. Leah, how much do you expect to get for that purse?"
               Leah made no reply; but the faintest suggestion of a flush appeared for a second in her face as she looked at her brother. He either did not or would not understand the look.
               "Four shillings?" he asked. Involuntarily Susan moved nearer Leah, further from Horace as he spoke. She could not understand it; but there was something in his voice that did not please her. "Let me see the purse." Leah gave it him. He balanced it on his finger, and swayed it to and fro. With a smile of admiration, that changed darkly to one of bitterness, he said, "Some clown will buy it. By Jupiter! it's too bad."
               Susan started, almost as much shocked as though a higher name had been profaned when he took on his lip the name of the king of gods. As for Leah, she moved towards the door, and answered him only by a rebuking look.
               "See here," he exclaimed, replying to her glance in his own way, which was not the gentlest. "See here, this shan't go on any longer. Keep your school if you will; but think how you 're exhausting yourself with every other kind of work that was ever invented. I'll sell these tools before this sort of thing shall go on-longer. You've made your last work for Black—do you hear, sister?"
               "You are not good to Susan and I, getting up such a tempest when we come to visit you peaceably," said Leah mildly. "But I must go and see about tea; do you, meanwhile, make a compromise with that roof in regard to the rest of the rain. Will you come and help me, Susan?"
               Susan, wondering at Horace, followed Leah from the room. But instead of going down stairs immediately, they went into another apartment, like that occupied by Horace, separated only by a narrow passage-way.
               Behold our Susan descending the stairs a few minutes after, arrayed in the splendor of a black lace cap, trimmed with bits of black ribbon, and white artificial flowers, which Leah assured her she had made specially for her. Behold her, as, watchful of the young teacher's movements, she endeavors to understand them—how in the end she concludes that it is her office that makes her what she is; and Susan winds up her day's meditation with the resolve that she in some future time will have a school of her own, and make a great deal of money by it, and become the second best person in the world—the first, of course, is Leah.
               In the evening she must needs repeat all that she has before related to Mrs. Chilton concerning the Baldwin family—must needs again be told of the acquaintance once existing between Ishmael and Mrs. Chilton; and somehow the impression is left upon her mind that in those days the fallen family, or its head rather, stood higher in the social scale than ever the people of the Hall could claim to do. Which Susan retained, as she might, it being simple fact; but there was a less wonderful fact revealed to her, not by words however, that was still more abiding. The fair-haired, meek-eyed, pale-faced angel of the house, who made a home of it, like a good and blessed fairy as she was, abode in the heart of Susan, and was henceforth to abide, a wonder and a joy. In that simple, unpretending goodness, that tranquil and patient endurance ance, that steadfast purpose of helpful labor, that loving and trustful life, that sought, and not all in vain, to make an Eden of what but for her were an abode of pining discontent, and the gloomy despair of infidelity; in these did Susan Dillon see and hear the wisdom, joy, and beauty, that radiate not, say it not, oh wise philosopher, from the merely passive, but the surely sanctified heart.
            
            
               XXX.
               IN the afternoon of her return, Susan went up to account for her absence, and make known her recent doings to Mr. Leighton.
               "And so you have been out to see life," responded the student, slowly, taking special note of the new cap that Susan wore. "What do you happen to think of it?"
               What did she think of life? here was a question. Rapidly the child's mind recalled the little she had seen, and was surprised to find it was so little, for it had made a deep impression, and she said, perplexed, "I don't know anything about it; or if I do, I don't know what it is."
               "Ah?—" said he, musing in his quiet way. "But you can tell me what you think of young Chilton and his sister. What sort of fellow is he? Do not say you cannot tell. I should place reliance on your judgment of him. Proceed. The lesson is full as good as a page in Virgil. Tell me plainly what you think of him. And consider what you are about; what makes the distinction in character? You may as well have your wits about you now when you are beginning to come in contact with other people. Save me the trouble of asking questions. Now begin."
               With such an exhortation, it was not likely that Susan would "begin" with any great degree of perspicuity or eloquence. Indeed Mr. Leighton's injunction made her speechless. Her mind was so confused that it seemed no better than a blank for his purposes. But he was patient, and still expectant, when she had nothing to say.
               "His father was an architect, I believe," said Mr. Leighton, to help her on. "I have heard his name. Has the boy any talent?"
               "Yes!" Susan was quite sure on that point, for Leah had told her all about it; and how sorry she felt for her brother, and how she meant to help him. And Leah could not be mistaken.
               "Is he patient?"
               "No."
               "Do you understand what you are talking about? Are he and his sister alike?"
               "No, they are not alike."
               "In what respect do they differ? Is the boy full of talk, and his sister a bit of silence?"
               That was her precise meaning.
               "His father—but that—hum . . . what is the boy's aim? what is he going to do?"
               "He has a fancy for architecture."
               "A fancy! . . . Why don't you say taste?—or passion is better—Fancy!"
               "He has a passion for it; that's the truth," said Susan, thoughtfully.
               "What is it going to do with him?"
               Susan did not know.
               "Then nobody knows. Think again. What is it going to do with him?"
               "I do not know," she repeated.
               "Think again, and do not make me that same answer."
               "Let him come down to visit you, Mr. Leighton. He don't like Mr. Falcon a bit, so I know he would like you!"
               
               "And what if he would? Do you think I am so badly off for friends? Who is Mr. Falcon?"
               "Mr. Falcon stays with Mr. Baldwin. He looks after Clarence."
               "And why does not your Mr. Horace like him?"
               "He thinks he meddles so; but you are so—different. I did n't mean that you would care for Horace; you don't need anybody of course, but—"
               "Stop there. What makes you think I need nobody? I do not say it is untrue; but what makes you think so?"
               "Everything."
               "Overwhelming evidence, to be sure. But come, come, we must hurry on. Is he handsome, this Mr. Horace of yours? is he full of wit? Is he lazy? does he study? does he talk much? Did he come home with you? Did he say he was coming down to see you soon? Look at me—now answer."
               In her own way Susan told him.
               "Very well," said he when she stopped speaking. "Never tell me again that you know nothing when I ask you a question; I shall at once take it for granted that you do know all about it. But perhaps I can add a little to your information on the subject." Do! her eyes said. "That lad is in the furnace. He must learn himself there. If any one should take him out of it, a very wicked thing it would be. He must fight his own fight. He will then be a conqueror, unless he is deceiving himself about his powers."
               "No, he's not doing that," said Susan, quickly, and quite confident.
               "If he is, let not that trouble you. If it turns out in the end that he is a poor devil of an incapable, blasted with an aspiration, which I should think quite likely, let it not afflict you. It is quite a common spectacle. Permit me to warn you; you are too lavish in expending your sympathies. If he is incapable, I say, his torment will not endure long. For a moment only, and the rest of his life will be merely an echo of the first groan. No pain in it; enough to vex a righteous ear though, if such happens to hear it. Recollect now, recollect always, I am speaking of a general truth which you must remember and think about yourself—I do not know the lad. He may be a royal character. I know there is no danger of your interpreting your friends uncharitably. The danger is that you will make them all out gods. Indeed, nothing is easier than to be god-like as the vulgar understand it. It is harder to be human."
               "I think I don't—know what you mean," said Susan, hesitating and confused.
               "How should you?"
               "What is it you say then? why do you talk—so?"
               He not only allowed her to address him thus, but answered her:
               "You could understand it no better if I put it in a dozen different forms of speech. Your humanity is in the way."
               After a long silence he said again, speaking cheerfully, but the child's face had a wondering, doubting look:
               "You must never trouble yourself in the slightest degree about this young fellow.'
               But to that Susan did not respond with an assent. Already she was troubled, and in no slight degree; for his sister's sake, for his own sake, she desired, with no feebleness of hope, that Horace should prosper.
               "You found me growing up in ignorance and idleness. You had compassion, seeing what my need was, and delivered me from it," she said, as it seemed, in expostulation.
               With an assumed indifference, Mr. Leighton answered:
               
               "I had nothing to do with it. It was all your own work. You were determined to have the books of me. I was passive, and submitted to the demand. Your father tells me that you are going up to St. John's to-morrow. You will be able to tell me a little more about life when you come back from the visit. But these interruptions make sad breaks in your studies. Do you want to go?"
               This was the first intimation Susan had received in regard to the proposed visit, for since her return from Harlem she had not seen her father. The announcement, therefore, took her not only by surprise, but so much disconcerted her that she could not say a word.
               "There came an express down to your father last night while you were away. Your friends were intending to come for you to-day, but your father deferred it till tomorrow. This will be a great treat."
               "No," said Susan, "it won't. I must go home."
               "Are you going? good night, then."
               And so Susan went home in a tumult of worry and excitement, and some tears she shed, some smiles she smiled, thinking of that coming journey, that visit at the Hall . . . What would David say if he found out that she had not read his books? What would Isidore do with her? She held her breath thinking of that hostess. . . . Would Mr. Baldwin seem very grand up there? Would he be dressed up and stately? . . . Would Clarence—ah, there was refuge in the thought of him!—but, then, it was not pleasant to be watched and followed, as he watched and followed her . . . Still, Susan meditated, he seemed to like her—he did not put on airs. And then there was Mr. Falcon! He lived at the Hall; and he was so kind, so good, she could stay there under his protection. He wanted her to come—he had said so many times. It was a relief for the poor child to think of him.
            
            
               XXXI.
               "I THINK, after all," said the gray-haired Leighton, musing, "that this problem of the gender feminine may as well be left to solve itself. It is not worth an old man's trouble. And besides, if Falcon is Falcon, there would appear to be a fatality about it. He seems to have taken her in hand. No doubt he has managed this visit; who else up-there would want her?"
               And so musing he returned to his books, but he began to think again of Susan; even in the very midst of a profound debate fell to musing about the child.
               "She cares nothing at all about books, that is evident. She will never know anything . . . that books can teach her. She would make a good Lady Bountiful, if she had the opportunity; but there is not much to be anticipated from a nature such as that. She is no student—has no ambition. Open as the day, there's nothing to search out, not a dark nook or cranny in her mind, her heart I should say—for her affections are her thoughts. But now let the world try her; let her go up to that ridiculous place and find out life!"
               His sharp eyes glanced upon the open page before him, but he saw nothing there to divert his thoughts from the child—still he mused, and of her.
               "She reminds me of what Falcon used to say. Falcon was a fine fellow. But mad as a March hare, and no doubt in Bedlam before this day . . . Where was it that I saw him last . . . let me see—Alicia!" he nervously turned a page as he recalled the name; but he was not reading. "There was something sublime about that woman. She alone is sufficient to redeem generations of the common growth . . . The fault was chiefly mine. After I had emancipated her intellectual capacities, I saw it. The work was done too suddenly. Her past stood out in the glare of her future with too much prominence. God knows this was all. I never reverenced her so much as in that confession. Who could condemn when she so terribly denounced herself? If I ever loved a human being . . . how did I define love?—no matter—I suspect that child could define it with more precision than I—it was when I came at the secret of her life. She had deceived me. Did not even love me. But she felt the wrong more bitterly than I could do. She was frail, of course—all women are. But there was something in her not woman, not frailty: sublime, moral excellence. Anything less than that could never come to such a repentance. And yet that was a tribute I could not have done without. I would not surrender the recollection of it now on whatever demand. When she fell before me, and those fearful words burst from her, and I understood her rightly for the first time, she said it was the contact of her mind with mine that compelled the confession. Her own purity, conscious of its taint, was still too pure to allow the deception to continue . . . She would leave me! 'What hast thou to do with me? thou wilt destroy me before my time!' and she lifted herself up, and would have gone away. But I stayed her. 'Whither and wherefore would she go? woman of ten thousand!' She read my meaning, which I did not, and could not speak; 'Not to destroy myself, but to live: if I remain here I am dead—dead eternally.' And I said, 'Go then—so well I understand you, feeble woman, mighty conqueror that you are, you shall not stay. Go and make your expiation.' 'You understand me. You do not take me for a coward. You do not think that I am such a child as to lay violent hands on myself? I shall not leave your house so desolate as it would be if I stayed.' And I replied, 'Woman, what am I to teach you? Neither your staying nor your going can make me desolate. I never yet put my trust in these shifting phenomena. I have received you, sublime idea! into myself. Do what you will with the impression, I have the type. You cannot take that away.' Then she came back, and stood looking at me with her truthful eyes. 'They used to say that you despised and hated women,' said she, 'and for that reason I dared to do it. You would never, because I was a woman, so trust and respect me as to make me feel that I was guilty of a wrong, in coming into your home. I should, at least, give you as much as you gave me. But the world was wrong; and I, most of all, was at fault. I could not guess you. But when I came to know you, when you opened my mind so that I could see my own heart, I saw yours too. You taught me all I know. I saw it was not woman as God made her that you shunned and undervalued, but the world's woman that you could not abide. And then I feared, oh was it foolish? that you might mistake, and—and love me. Perhaps there was no danger, but I could not endure to think that there might be . . . I could not bear that That was the reason that I tried your patience many times, and was so stupid, and so wayward. If you had only thought of me as you did of the rest! I was no better, I was ten thousand times worse than those that were like dust to you . . . I tried to keep my mind shut against you. But I was too weak. You mastered me: my sin, as well as my weakness; for I would not live the lie that so tempted me. I have at last achieved my integrity—my right to avow it; and I would therefore go.' And then I said, 'Go, I am so rich in you that no robbery you may perpetrate, by taking yourself away from me, can make me poor. I know you well enough to understand that it would be misery for you to stay . . . And yet if you—' How terrified she looked when I said that! How her eyes did beseech me not to say it. 'Be not you my tempter You have been my deliverer, my saviour. I was sorely rent when the evil spirit was exorcised by you . . . Then you forgive me?' and she turned away from me again, as if she feared herself, or me. But I stirred not. I said, 'I cannot bring myself to insult you by saying that. I have nothing to forgive. We are mutually debtors to an infinite extent.' Then she went out in silence, and at night I found the cradle empty in our room . . . . And so there it ended. I am sure that I would not, if I could, know further. If I could, it would be of triumph and blessedness, I doubt not. She has not been lifeless all this time . . . How long ago it was!—she was the woman of ages . . . Falcon fancied that there was something to do when he found the wife and child gone, and the professor living alone in chambers. It occasioned the good fellow considerable distress that he could not understand it. He must set to work to bring about a reconciliation. And that was the rock, if I remember rightly, on which we split! As good as any other, since a rock was inevitable. The supposition that we were one, or could have anything to do with each other, anything in common, I hold to be the most perfect blunder we ever made. If I see clearly, he has not redeemed the world yet. It is about the same sort of a thing it was when he began at it.
               "Everybody commits once in his life a damnable sin, little or great, apparent or hidden, 
                     acording
                     according
                   to his capacity, and so all are under the curse. The thing is repentance. The power to come to repentance is the main point on which all the rest hinges. The shining lights which make good their claim to preservation in history, names which illuminated their time—these are manifestly responsible—and as to the rest, they must go in droves—for how shall they ever be lifted up to the dignity of moral accountability? They are only fit to squabble about creeds and 'social fictions.' . . . Into this great cauldron of life this fisherman's daughter seems bound to throw herself. What is to keep her out of it? She can do nothing greatly, if she is sufficiently defined even to be able to find herself, or to be found. And yet, if one did not pity her so much on account of it, one might be touched by her sympathetic nature. She is an instrument that could never, of itself, give out a sound, but is responsive to the touch of whatever hand—soft tones for the feeble, stronger for the strong. Yes—after all, one can get a glimpse of THE woman in her. But if this Falcon she speaks of, is Falcon, my fanatical old student, the devotee whom I taught, until he took it into his insane purpose to teach me: well, well—let us see what he—whoever he may be he wields an influence—will have done for her by the time she comes back again."
            
            
               XXXII.
               AND now, shall we make another brief journey and look after some of our St. John's friends.
               The heavy blinds that screened the convent windows were all shut but one, and that one was nearly closed. A nun stood before it, looking down into the street. We have seen her before—have been in her presence though her face was veiled, on that night when she walked with Stella Cammon in the garden just beyond the dusty street. It is late in the day—evening is at hand, but the street lamps are not yet lighted, and the shops down beyond there, lie in gloomy shadow. It is a disagreeable night: cool, still, and bright, on the beach where Leighton walks and muses, it will be a long while yet before a star can make itself visible in the radiant heaven that spreads over the sea. But here there is a warm, unpleasant, un-refreshing breeze sweeping up the street, raising clouds of dust; scraps of dirty paper flutter through the air, straws are carried up and down in those gusts of wind resistlessly, as, in the gale of fortune, helpless bits of human chaff are flying. Mothers of families are hurrying home to their children—maid servants and men servants go laden with packages—and business men, burdened with business cares, hurry up the street though the day's work is over, as if chased by the Demon Per Cent. Children rove about, idling, whistling, smoking, swearing, playing—tired of play but unwilling to abandon their sport.
               The milkman with his cart and bell, the bread-and-pie man, the man with glasstewpooteen! and the yeouster lad, are all going by for the last time, until to-morrow's daylight shall bring them into the crying world again. There stands the nun, while the gloom increases, looking down, as if she would never weary of the sights, into the living street.
               How calm her face is! A sweet and holy calmness that could never grieve or disturb another. Despair is not in it, nor pain. But rest, quiet, tranquillity. Often from the darkening street she looks toward the murky sky. She remembers that even at that moment the sun is somewhere shining; and that beyond the city dust, other eyes might at that hour be looking into a pure heaven. But what eyes she knows not, for she dreams not, this woman whose life is given to the lowliest and tenderest charities, of other existences than those which from day to day absorb her. She never dreams.
               There is a school in the convent, and she is at its head; its most important teacher; this is by all conceded. Every day young minds and hearts are subjected to her influence. It is a wearisome work, yet she has given herself to it, and finds pleasure in it, because she knows she has a message for youth—and because, narrow as the field may seem, the occupation is vast enough to employ and engross daily all her interest and energy.
               She has not, since Stella Cammon left the convent school, lost sight of her. Were she inclined to do so, she had not found it possible. For two reasons. Father Francis and the Superior made it a part of their business often to remind her that Christ and the church had need of a new bride, and that this young life was eminently fitted for such heavenly espousal. To enlist such energies as enriched Stella's nature in the service of the Church,—to secure such treasures of the world as Miss Judith Mar would doubtless bestow upon her ward, Stella Cammon,—was well worth striving after. Therefore, when they had in their own way communicated such suggestions to the saintly sister Theresa, it was but a natural consequent that she should have awakened to a special interest in her pupil.
               But there was a still better reason. While at school, their intercourse as teacher and taught had passed far beyond the limits usually maintained by persons holding such relations towards one another. It was not an alphabetical, nor yet a numerical relation. There had been at first, apparently, a more than common repulsion felt by each; but this had merged into an uncommon mutual interest, that in turn stimulated an uncommon curiosity; and the final result was a cordial friendship on the one hand, and a child-like reliance on the other.
               But it troubled the teacher;—the relation was one which she strove to annul. She, ever self-renunciative, would have denied herself even the interest she took in her pupil, had that been possible. But the resistance she attempted to offer to the fate upon her, that she should in this instance inspire a confidence and hope altogether gether unusual, appealed to her in the form of a necessity, an obligation of charity—it served also as a sacrifice to her—it cost her pain to yield to it—and none of the ministers of pain was she at liberty to reject. And then there were, besides, the cogent arguments of the Superior and Father Francis,—CHRIST AND THE CHURCH! Should she not aid in enriching these, in bringing to the temple another brilliant ornament for the sacred altar-place?
               So it had gone on until now.
               And now there is dust on the nun's dress. An hour ago she was walking in that garden-walk—the one that runs nearest to the wall—and with her Stella. The young girl's words were yet in the woman's ear, and in her troubled heart. Some tears she could not check had fallen from her eyes when she recalled those words, and all their conversation. How thoroughly her woman heart could read that young unquiet nature.
               "If I might but come into the convent," (in the silence of her solitude the recalled words had a most plaintive sound,) "I would willingly do the humblest work. Look at me! I am strong; I was made to labor, and I have the impulse; I would sweep and scrub—do the work of the humblest novice—and teach into the bargain—if I might but come."
               "And leave your aunt alone?" the nun had answered, "neglect a certain, a known duty, for one that—?"
               "She cares not half as much for me as for the worsted flowers she works at from morning till night. I am nothing to her in the way you might think. She needs me not. I am to her more like one of the dried plants in her botanical collection than anything else. But I tell you I am alive; every drop of blood in me is full of life. I was born for something—what is it? where is my place?
               "The world calls the convent a grave," said the nun sadly, and evidently in deepest sympathy with the impatient girl.
               "It is not a grave," Stella answered. "If it is, it is a place of resurrection too. Any one who has seen you will know it is a place for the living. I want to live to some purpose, as you do. A word from you would settle me for life."
               "Where is Mr. Layard? Let him speak."
               Not without a shudder could the nun recall the mighty effort with which, at these words, Stella Cammon had smothered the cry of amazement, and terror, and despair, that flew to her lip from her heart. The cry did not escape her; and her cheek kindled with a human sympathy and admiration, when she thought of the quiet, yet tremulous and suppressed voice, that answered:
               "Wait,"—and the deeper, more troubled utterance, "wait—you must not—you must not say that—he—he is a Protestant. I will—tell you all—presently."
               "No, my daughter—I entreat you, tell me not! I am not your confessor. Spare me, I entreat you;" and, recalling these words she had uttered, the holy sister thought it matter for regret that the emotion of the young girl had proved so contagious.
               "Mother, I will confess. I am not a Protestant. I am—I am—"
               "Daughter!"
               "I have not lied to you. I am in earnest; I would come—"
               "No more—no more, child. I can in this thing only counsel you; go home and pray. Lift yourself never from your knees until your prayer is answered. And I will tell you what to pray for—wisdom, and courage, and patience. Pray! pray till your prayer is answered. Pray to God! confess to Christ! The Almighty Father and his blessed Son will pity and help you, as I—cannot pity—and dare—" yes, dare she said—"dare," the girl walking by her side heard it—dare, though it was spoken in the faintest whisper,—"dare not help you."
               "Help me? and you dare not, though you can! Oh, mother, do you understand me? can you see into my heart?"
               "Yes." Not without hesitation, not without a sense of all that hung upon that word, a knowledge that, once spoken, there was no retreat—it could not be unsaid—other words must follow—but she said it. Yes, she did, only too well, understand—and she acknowledged it.
               Hearing that word, Stella's heart stood still, but on, in another instant, it went, leaping and wild.
               "Do you know, then, what it is I've done?"
               "Yes, Stella."
               "And do you call it a sin?"
               "No more a sin than the growth of a tree according to the light. Do I understand you?"
               "Yes, yes—speak on! where did you learn this? oh, do not stop here, go on."
               "Scripture has spoken to me of 'the glorious liberty of the children of God.' We are all born slaves, my child—but there is freedom for us—and when we know it, when we are come of age, spiritually speaking, and may have our liberty for the frank assertion of our right to it, it is indeed a weak and slavish mind that will refrain from claiming it. It is not a man's creed that can save him—woe to him if the creed makes him, and not he it. It cannot save him, neither can it do him harm, unless with a conscious capacity for out-growing it he persists in a superstitious bondage to it. And if he does narrow and dwarf the divine life to it, alas for him. Where Christ is, Stella, there must be freedom. He himself has said, 'If any man will open unto me I will come in to him; but he must have the freedom of the temple; think you he will be content to have another god in the altar place, and other shrines for worship than His own? Will he come in to be insulted by a partial recognition? 'Bring no more vain oblations."'
               "Oh mother, what is it you are saying?"
               "The very truth of God, daughter. I am trusting you beyond all others, because I believe you need me. You need that I should tell you the priceless truth that I have found."
               "You think I am a Protestant!"
               "I think nothing about that whatever. I know you for an untaught child of God. Listen, a man I say is criminally self-destructive, not blindly, not foolishly so, but criminally, when against the law of God he contracts himself to accept what it may be positive righteousness in his neighbor to accept. He who has ten talents shall not do the work of one, and be justified. Truth is truth. I may confess her by a denial of what my neighbor in as honest and loving a manner, according to his notion, glorifies by his confession. No soul that was capable of beholding beauty ever despised it. Capacity of vision is not equally bestowed. Beauty is truth; and our apprehension of it will be proportionable to our consciousness of freedom. I tell you again, in the divine words, the liberty of the children of God is glorious."
               "Oh speak on!"
               "I have said all. I have no more."
               "Then I must answer you. You have read me, at least in part. I did not know that you could so well. I would not believe that another in your church could speak so. I should suspect it was a Jesuitical proceeding. This Church of Rome is not mine, it comes between me, with its saints and images, between me and God; my soul has been choked up with them. I prayed to Christ that he would come in as he went into his temple in Jerusalem, and remove everything offensive in his sight, and he has taken down every saint, even the niche where the image of his human mother was, and the trumpery things—oh forgive me, I can but say it!—that were piled on the altar, he has taken away. And when they were all gone, 'behold my house was left unto me desolate."'
               "Go up then, my child, dear Stella, and lay yourself on the altar. He is there; believe me. He will behold the offering and accept it. Oh Lord! my Strength and my Redeemer! wilt thou not?"
               
               "But you spoke of Layard . . ." continued Stella. "I know it is said that a woman's affections are her guide in these things. And you, perhaps, think it is so with me. But it is not; he is nothing to me; I do not believe in him. Long ago when I did love him, I was thinking of these things. I have always thought of them—oh I have been so troubled by them . . . in those days I may have found it pleasant to look at things, or try to, in the way that he did. But since then I have been fearful. He would call me his convert."
               "Yet you are not?"
               "No."
               "Then why trouble yourself with a thought of him?"
               "Let me understand you: do you counsel me to leave you and your Church altogether?" asked Stella, stopping abruptly in the walk.
               "Yes, leave me, leave the Church, leave everything that pertains to men; learn of Christ, for he alone can help you. If I speak to you, I shall speak merely with a mortal voice, of things as they appear to my sense—He has another way of speaking."
               "But the Church, the Church."
               "Do not so reiterate that sound. I am in it, and of it; that is true. I labor also, as I believe, for its best and truest interests. Believe me that would be poor laboring if I intercepted, or endeavored to intercept, the messages of the spirit to your soul. If ever it should happen that you found in our Church a temple meet for you to worship in, you know well that I would welcome you even with tears of joy. But if you vex your soul here, and must continually, with questions that show you were born to render service elsewhere, be not deceived! God is not mocked! whatever a man soweth that shall he also reap! You will find tribulation and anguish here, and nothing beside."
               "And you, a Romanist, say this to me who protest against—"
               "I, a disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ, say it to you who seek Him. Hath He ever said, 'Seek ye my face in vain,' to such as seek as you do? In the eternal temple, not made with hands, worship and wait until he enlightens you further."
               "Father Francis and Aunt Judith, what—"
               "My child have done with names—Father Francis and your aunt are entitled to all deference and reverence; and you, I am sure, will not neglect to yield it to them; but they cannot work out your salvation for you—they ought not to think for you; you might assent, yet not believe; and if you built up your hope on that, what a miserable delusion! I do not counsel you to, indeed I would rather warn you against despising any honest word that experience says to you. Still, you are in the very position where you do not need them so much as you need the illumination of God's spirit. A proud contempt for their faith will never purify nor enlarge your own. If it shall appear hereafter that they are speaking truth to you, even God's truth, you will have the humility of love which will enable you to confess it. As it happened with the young man who was born blind, so it does with us. We can escape from no responsibility. There will come a time when all shall desert us and say to the Great Questioner, not to any mere man, 'He is of age, ask him.' Our reason is ours, or it is not. 'Be not high-minded, but fear.' 'Fear not them who are able to destroy the body, but fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.' I have dared to speak. This would sound heresy to some, and infidelity, I doubt not, to others. I cannot reconcile my conscience giving you a little manufactured cordial—you are in need of the pure Water of Life . . . May God help you. Go home and think of these things, and be not in haste to free yourself. If you are his servant He will free you from all other bondage."
               Looking now down from her high place upon the wayfarers below, the saintly sister did not repent her of the extraordinary utterance which she had allowed herself. She did not deem this conversation matter for confession—what she had wrought she had wrought in a holy fear. She had eyes to behold a struggle in which the honor of the Eternal God, and not that of any holy image, was concerned, and she dared trust the struggler to the conflict, and to Him.
               She turned at length from the window, for night and darkness were come; and she left the little cell which she tenanted, and, going down the length of the dormitory, passed below to the room where the students were already assembled for their evening exercises.
               As she noiselessly opened the door, fifty bright eyes were lifted from the school-books before them. They saw the same tranquil vision that ever met their gaze. Not one of them had ever glanced underneath that tranquillity Never but one soul, of all who had come and gone from these walls during the last years, had the audacity to make her own interpretations of that character. And trouble sufficient Stella Cammon seemed destined to occasion the compassionate teacher, through her stormy, impassioned nature.
            
            
               XXXIII.
               IN her own room again, neither praying nor weeping, Stella stands looking at the copy of her own portrait as a child, which Lucia Tree had that day completed and brought home.
               She found it upon the mantel when she went into her room. Lucia had been there and moved the books away, and arranged the little picture to her own satisfaction. The momentary wonder and pleasure excited by this incident had already given way to deeper emotions. Like a frightened bird from the impending storm, she flew away; from present, dreary, troublesome thoughts, to the recollections of childhood, to the happiest playground of those unforgotten years. And Tom and little Susan, each leading her, younger than she though they were, so fearless where she was so timid, carried her again a laughing and willing captive up to the old cabin—how the sun fell on the beach! how white those cabin floors were! how gloriously the ocean waves dashed against the rocks! and the fish shining, lying on the beach, just brought in by the men; and old Walter, old to her memory he seemed, laid aside his pipe, and took her on his knee, and told her stories of the sea. And then, within the house, a fairer face, a sweeter smile, a softer kiss, a gentler voice, was waiting, the beautiful mother of Tom and Susan, ready with a welcome, 
                     and and
                     and
                   the little table was spread with the clean white cotton ton cloth, and the plate of cakes, and the hard sea-biscuit . . . . Oh lowly memory of the thoughtless past, that you should move this thoughtful girl, brilliant in her beauty, powerful in her attractions, as she is—as night by night in festive scenes she proves herself to be, proud and arrogant among the proud, that you, oh humblest memory of childhood, should move this girl to tears! to such tears as crowd her heart and dim her eyes. . . .
            
            
               XXXIV.
               NOW, reader, Heaven bless you! is it your fortune to be poor, or humble, or of low degree? Acquit me of impertinence in this interrogation. I shall not be likely to discern in this confusion the response that you make to yourself.
               But did you ever visit in a great house?
               Then will you be prepared to enter, with me, all the more freely, into the flutter, and the doubts, and the anguish, and the trouble of poor Susan Dillon, on the dawn of the eventful morning succeeding her return from Harlem.
               In the gloom and grayness of the dawn she waited for the coming of the sun. It would rain—it must rain! that thick fog, which she discerned peering through the little window pane, was as good as a promise, a sure word of prophecy. And comforted by her hope, which had borrowed of the certainties of faith, she went back to bed again, and fell into a deeper slumber than had been granted her the night long, certain that one more day of grace was left. It would storm, and she should not go up to the Hall that day.
               Nevertheless, up to the Hall she did go that day. For the sun, when it rose, knew, and she who watched his coming knew, that the field of heaven was his that day.
               Before ten o'clock, a carriage rumbled up the beach; its sound deafened, but not so deafened that she could not hear it;—and David Baldwin—no! yes! it was he, and he alone, who had driven down for her! leaped from the lofty, showy vehicle, and called out, in his unassuming and yet important way, to announce his arrival.
               Now Susan Dillon running about on the sand, with her hair flying in the wind, shod, if shod at all, in rough, pegged leathern boots, and her dress as it might chance, running about very like any other wild animal, untutored, untamed, was in her way well enough; she took no airs upon herself—a glance explained her.
               But, poor Susan! decked out in her best, with the special purpose of accompanying some messenger—and, of all men, that it should prove the heir of St. John's Hall!—in a fashionable carriage, to visit in his father's house—was not she in this position quite a different affair? The marvel was that David Baldwin should be here on such an errand. Not a marvel to her only, but it should be to you also, my good reader. For David's mind was not philosophic; he was not a reformer, nor a man of such fine, quick, warm impulses as, in the name of Christian charity, to have embarked in this enterprise. Indeed, when he went into the house and looked at the poor child, if he had thought so far into the subject, he would have acknowledged that it was not quite charitable, not altogether Christian in him to have taken a step which occasioned Susan so much consternation and distress, merely for his own gratification.
               Mr. Falcon might have conducted the expedition quite as well as himself; and indeed he seemed disposed to do so, but David had chosen to come; and there did not live, at least not within the Hall, the person so presumptuous tuous as to oppose his will. Clarence was ill, which was the immediate occasion of Susan's summons to St. John's, it being thought by Mr. Falcon that the nurse for his sick room was Susan, and Susan only. This thought, however, had not been communicated to any person in the house beside the father of Clarence—it was in his own behalf, knowing that the visit was to be made, that David put himself to this unusual trouble. And he was not disappointed when he saw the consternation his coming occasioned in Susan. It rather pleased him. It was a long time since he had observed anywhere so much mental commotion; he should have something new to discuss with Professor Layard in the evening.
               The child's excitement stimulated his mind. With the passionate, irresistible hand of uncontrolled youth, he had torn from the tree of life its most precious fruits, with its most worthless. He was wearied with the medley—had not sufficient energy to cull the fruits. Here, before him, was a youth fresh and pure. Neither learning nor pleasure had corrupted it—its tastes and ideas were still unvitiated. The bee was covetous of that drop of honey lying so purely deep in the heart of the humble blossom, that was expanding so slowly to the light of the world's day,
               Poor Susan! with what jealous, envious eyes she looked upon this wearied, simulated, unsatisfied life! His body was not to his soul an instrument of torture. (Certainly it was not, so far as her discernment went; but how far did that go?) He knew what to do with it; how to walk, how to stand, how to sit, so conscious of himself in every movement as to appear entirely unconscious. But she! in all that ten-mile drive she would not have recovered from the misery of her position, but for one thought—it saved her. How strangely would Mr. Leighton smile upon her, with what reproach and scorn, were he sitting opposite to her—for he would know her thought without her speaking it. Even then the reflection restored her heart and courage, bitter though her self-reproach was that she had suffered herself to come into this false position, and by her own consent to be seated there in the old straw bonnet, the rusty black dress, and the red woollen shawl, beside the graceful figure that rose so high above her, dressed in fashionable garments, dazzling and beautiful as a god, as Adonis himself, she said in her heart.
               "I know what it is that makes you so silent," said David, darting off on a new theme, for during the first five miles he had vainly striven to engage her in conversation—she had scarcely opened her lips. "You have not forgiven me yet for—for—" He was quick to see that he should now have an advantage, and he loosened the reins; the well-trained steeds obeyed the hint, and instantly slackened their pace. "You do not know it, but it has troubled me to think how much pain I gave you. I am really very sorry, indeed, on account of it."
               "Don't say that—it was nothing," said Susan, making a painful effort to speak, not these words, but any words.
               "I think it was a great deal. I have a dog myself that I am very fond of. If anything happened to him I should not bear it quite so philosophically as you did. Where did you learn to be so patient?"
               "Nobody ever called me patient before, sir."
               "All the better for me, then. But I should really like to know how you felt about it after we had gone. Were you not vexed? come now, tell me."
               "Not vexed," said Susan, hesitating.
               "But very lonely and sorrowful then, certainly."
               She looked towards him and smiled; it was a faint, sad smile. It made the fast young man crack his horses, and look away quickly, and it also made him speak presently, and say:
               
               "Own up, Susy! Clarence calls you so, why should n't I?—a little?"
               "Yes, a little."
               "Of course; and that was what troubled me, that you should not storm about it. I did not like to think of you, as I knew you were shut up in your room at night, mourning over Span when nobody could see you grieving about him. It was a sharp and hateful thought, but I have lamented it, too, as well as you, and I lament it yet. So, now, if we are to be good friends, let us shake hands over it."
               And smiling, but timid, Susan's hand lies passive in his.
               "Now, do you know, I feel as if forty thousand millstones were off my neck. I can hold up my head again, and look you, Susy, in the countenance." And so David drew himself up, and bent forward, and his eyes scanned the blushing young face.
               Oh, Adonis! Adonis! she was looking full at you! No drooping lid veiled those eyes; straight, steadfast, and trustful, she looked, and saw beauty and glory in your face, and in turn what did you read?—joy and trust!
               David had casually mentioned the illness of Clarence before, now he said:
               "You and I have something to do. We must make Clarence well again. I shall expect you to prove a great help in the work for my sake. Good for evil is the law, you know . . . You had a brother, you will know then how dear mine is to me. You never think of your brother as though he were really gone, do you?"
               "Yes," said Susan, so decidedly that there could be no doubt of her meaning.
               "But he is not," said David.
               "I cannot see him." Susan looked up, wondering at the speaker. What a soft, pleasant voice he had. It would be pleasant and easy to believe all that voice could say.
               "Still he may be near you day and night."
               "I do not see him or hear him. I should not feel so if he were near. He is dead."
               "Maybe you will not say so some day," said David; but he did not seem to feel so sure about that, as Susan evidently felt of her ground.
               "Will you tell me about Clarence?" she ventured to say.
               "Yes, some other time," answered David, absently; and they both relapsed into silence, for they had, in their own way, struck upon the profoundest thought of life, and for the time were stranded. Would to Heaven, you say, that David might never find his way off that shoal again without Susan's help? I could almost echo your sentiment.
               But now they approached the suburbs of St. John's, and from the world of ideas David Baldwin reached back to the world of things, resistlessly carrying Susan with him, pointing out to her as he drove along whatever places of interest they passed by.
               But, secure as during the last hour Susan had felt by the side of her companion, it needed more than her newly-acquired confidence in him to enable her to think of the Hall, towards which their course was bent, with even the slightest composure.
            
            
               XXXV.
               THE Hall was a large, square, high building of brick, presenting a smooth sanded exterior, colored brown, with an imposing frontage of grand doorway, and elaborately ornamented windows. The portico, pillars, and steps, were of hewn stone.
               
               Midway between the gate and the house, the broad walk divided and wound around a circle of evergreens which were enclosed within a beautifully-wrought iron railing, relieved at regular intervals by white marble images of the Seasons.
               It was not by this entrance that David and Susan approached the house; a green lane just beyond, fringed with evergreens and ornamental trees, received them; and at a gate near the house stood a groom in waiting, who held the horses while the travellers alighted, and afterwards drove the gay steeds away.
               In the portico waited Isidore and her father, the latter engaged with a newspaper—the former standing in the very position in which Colonel Wheaton left her a moment ago.
               Isidore in this grand place, in one respect at the head of her father's house, falsely as she estimated the fact, was not what she had seemed to be upon the beach. On that day, overwhelming as her splendor had appeared to Susan, she had dressed herself for an encounter with the wind and sun. But what was this rare vision that met the child's astonished eyes, as she stood now in the presence! They were the same ringlets floating when she moved, or resting, a rich golden shadow, against the delicate face, when she was in repose. Susan could identify them. And the same proud languid eyes, straight brow, and scornful lip; these could not change—it was the temple's adornments that made the gazer almost breathless. Decked out like an idol as she was, it would have been a relief and an escape could Susan have fallen down before her as before a shrine, and by such recognition have delivered herself from all further duty of obeisance.
               But what was it Horace Chilton said that was ringing in her ears now? Leah had rebuked him for it, but the rebuke had but impressed his words more firmly on Susan's mind, and now both the word and the rebuke were crimsoning her cheek, and troubling her heart. "Some folks would hate you if you came across their path."
               Shorn of all its trifling and humorous connection, this assertion stood out like a black image before Susan, as if it were possible that one so humble as she should ever cross any person's path! The bare idea, the mere possibility of what he had asserted, made her fear.
               Very cordial was the reception that Mr. Baldwin extended toward Susan; so great a hope did he build upon her presence in the house, that the manner of the presence never once occurred to him. Had he acted on his impulse he would at once have led her up into his son's sick room. But both his humanity and prudence held him in check. He remembered Mr. Falcon's caution, that when Susan should come not a soul in the house must suspect wherefor—even David must perform his service ignorant of what he really did. When he enjoined on her that she should assist him in his care of Clarence, it was with him an idle remark, or a connecting link in his conversation between one point and another; he had no serious meaning or intent.
               Susan's embarrassment had no time to overwhelm her. Mr. Baldwin allowed it no time.
               "Caught the little sea-bird at last, by the Lord Harry!" cried he, rising as he spoke, and throwing aside the newspaper. "Come in! come in!" he had Susan by both hands, assisting her to obey him. "You've had a long, hard ride. Terrible hot day. Please to come this way, Susan." How she was to do otherwise with him leading her thus irresistibly, it would have been difficult to tell. "You're tired with your ride. Afraid its been too much for you. Here! come in this way, lie down on that sofa there; now rest awhile. Monstrous day . . . Dora, my daughter, Dora! ring for something or other— some refreshment. What'll you have to drink, Susan? How is your father? A lemonade? Yes, you will have a lemonade. David, my son, won't you see about it? Now Susan, rest."
               And he bustled about, the very same man, in the very same box-coat so often seen on the beach, active and anxious to make everybody comfortable. No guest of all who came to the Hall had, in a long time, not since the Governor dined there, occasioned such a commotion in the old man's heart as this arrival of Susan Dillon.
               So grateful the child felt for all this, that she could have fallen into his arms and embraced him. She did not this, but the next most impulsive thing. Sat down beside Mr. Baldwin on the sofa in the darkly-shaded room, and having answered his inquiries about her father in detail, she launched, recklessly lavish of her conversational resources, upon the theme of Mrs. Chilton, with whom, as Mrs. Butler, he had more than once come in contact, and to whom he was indebted for the many social obligations conferred on him in the days of her affluence, even as she had already informed Susan.
               The theme interested, astonished, absorbed her listener, for the moment, as Susan unfolded it; nor did he put it away until he had declared that to-morrow he would go down with Susan, and his son and daughter, to Harlem, to pay his respects to the widow and her children.
            
            
               XXXVI.
               MR. BALDWIN'S fine house was to him what an extensive museum is to a proprietor, who rejoices in his possessions not so much because they are a fortune, or the standing witness of it, but for the real enjoyment the possession confers on himself, and the interest he takes in its various features.
               He experienced unmeasured satisfaction in the exhibition of its comforts and beauties. Too much, indeed, and too frankly was it manifested to meet the approval of his daughter, for the enjoyment was suggestive of days when he had it not—it implied plebeian reminiscences—it betrayed the honesty of a heart that took genuine pride in all that a pair of hands, unwearying feet, a calculating brain, and a few sixpences, had accomplished. He took too much delight in the unfeigned wonder and pleasure in which common people expressed themselves while he played the showman about his premises.
               Since Isidore left school, or about the time of that important household event, the Hall had interiorly been subjected to some improvements, which Mr. Baldwin explained in detail to Susan, as he walked about with her after lunch. Some new pictures had been hung, some trifles of statuary had been imported; but there was nothing among these things that impressed our Susan very deeply, though why they failed to do so it would have puzzled her to tell. Because she was bewildered and dazzled it may have been, for it was not likely that she should perceive what was really true of them, that here, as in most houses of the description, the ornaments were pretty and costly, and served an ornamental purpose very well; but in not a solitary instance did they rise to the dignity of works of art. They were beautiful, the guests who came to the Hall said so—beautiful in the sense that held good and true of the gilded cornice of the drawing rooms, the embroidered satin cushions of the chairs and sofas, ottomans and divans—beautiful as the rich carpets and embroidered curtains were; but not as independent embodiments of original, high, or pure, or lovely ideas.
               It may have been—I but suggest it—it may have been that, after all, there was something besides dazzlement and bewilderment in Susan's appreciation of these things; it may have been instead of want of appreciative power, or feeling of disappointment, that they fell so far below the ideals which had grown up under the fostering care of those old gods down by the sea.
               The ramble through the house was performed by Mr. Baldwin and Susan alone. Mr. Baldwin could never become so accustomed to these things as to weary of them. The charm of their novelty would never be exhausted, no more than the sharp edges of contrast would ever be blunted. He was vain and happy in his house, and in his children. Susan did not wonder at that; he seemed the only real and natural thing there was about the house, as he led the way through gallery and boudoir, up the winding staircase, out upon the balconies which overlooked the garden, and into the observatory that overlooked the city—splendor everywhere.
               Dazzled and surprised by what she saw, and that which she passed by without seeing—confused by a sense of incapacity to take in all that her eyes met—bewildered by a succession of bright and pretty shows, through which she moved—Susan stood at length alone upon the last step leading from the observatory into the upper hall.
               Thinking what to herself, as she waited there for the return of Mr. Baldwin? for, as they descended the stair, he left her for a moment.
               Thinking, "Oh, this is life! If Mr. Leighton asked me now, I could tell him what I think of it! . . . My father might just as well have had such a house as this, if he had only done as Mr. Baldwin did!"
               And as she thought this thought, and made this lamentation, a principle of Susan's nature, whose existence she had never suspected, was revealed to her. Her childhood's seeming self had vanished.
               Looking up at the sound of a footstep, for her eyes had fallen upon the floor in the intentness of her meditation, Susan saw Mr. Falcon standing in a doorway further up the hall. She started, seeing him, and seemed sadly disconcerted; he was looking so quietly at her, he must have perceived what she was thinking of. Alas, poor Susan! She was wakened thus far to herself to know that in her heart were thoughts which were not meet for human eyes to see!
               With his wonted smile he greeted her, and stepping forward a little he extended his hand, calling her thus towards him, speaking meanwhile in his friendly, quiet way.
               Susan, to escape herself, herself which terrified and shamed her, went hastily to him.
               "Come in and see Clarence, Susan," he repeated, in a voice so much louder than his usual tone, or than seemed necessary, that Susan was struck by it, and her surprise no doubt was perceptible, though it received no comment of Mr. Falcon. He was intent but on one thing.
               "And so we are really sure of the long-promised visit, are we?" he continued, speaking in the same high voice. "I was prophesying to Clarence this morning that Susan would come. Come in; Susan, if you please." Evidently he was not talking for himself, or for Susan, but for Clarence, and he led her now into the room.
               It was a large apartment elaborately furnished. Unusual care had been taken in fitting it up with an express view to the return of Clarence from the Hospital. Everything in it was gay and cheerful—busts, and books, and flowers, the handsome chandelier, the drapery gathered in tent fashion over the bed, and the window-curtains and carpet were in a style of drawing-room luxury.
               Beside the window sat Clarence, wrapped in a dressing-gown, arranging flowers. He rose with a quick, elastic step as Susan entered the room, his pale face flushed with pleasure, and his eye bright with recognition. Mr. Falcon composedly advanced with the child—"There, sir, I have made my prophesy good; there's Susan, as I promised."
               Clarence for a moment looked perplexed, as he drew forward the chair which he had occupied, and begged Susan to be seated. And his perplexity was not solved, but it removed itself in the pleasure he felt at seeing her again.
               Not a particle of attention had the oft-repeated name of Susan excited in his mind that day. He had lost the idea that associated with the name, but now, the visible face before him, "Susy" was all in all again. Every trace of lassitude and melancholy had vanished from his countenance in these few seconds since she came; he sat down on an embroidered foot-bench in front of the window, filled her lap with the flowers with which he had been occupying himself, and said, quickly:
               "Now you have come to stay; has she not, Mr. Falcon?"
               "Have you, Miss Susan?" asked Mr. Falcon, turning to her quick, to direct attention from himself to the child.
               "A little while," said Susan, taking up the flowers one by one until her hands were filled with them.
               "All day?" earnestly inquired Clarence.
               "Yes, and more." This indefinite "more" seemed to satisfy him.
               "You like those flowers—we must go into the garden," said he, rising.
               'It is too hot yet awhile; and you are not well and strong enough to endure such a sun," interposed Mr. Falcon.
               "Am I sick?" said Clarence, laughing and shaking his head.
               "You were just now, I thought," answered Mr. Falcon.
               "No . . . I only forgot—" he hesitated. "I wanted something, and it did not come, and I could not think what it was . . . But it has come."
               "Me!" said Susan, lured into the question by her amazement. "Do you mean me?" involuntarily she closed her eyes as she used to do down on the beach in the days when she waited and watched expectant for the appearing Aphrodite. What was it that she thought to see when she opened them again? This was what she did see. Two pairs of eyes fixed on her, glancings they were that troubled and confused her, kind and earnest though they were.
               Clarence made no reply till she opened her eyes. "Did I mean her?" he said to Mr. Falcon with a wise look.
               "Certainly—of course," was the prompt reply.
               "You will not stay with Isidore in the drawing-room then, will you? Do not go down there?"
               "Well," said Susan, in childly acquiescence, looking, however, to Mr. Falcon in some perplexity. He came to the relief—when did he ever fail?
               "You will go down with her, perhaps, Clarence? It would not be right to leave your sister in that way. Besides, it would be selfish to keep Miss Susan penned up here—this is her first visit."
               "We'll go down now, then;" and saying this, Clarence rose at once.
               Mr. Falcon made no opposition, but followed the young people down the staircase, full of wonder and of hope, because of the growing miracle before his eyes.
               "You've been practicing without my advice, Susan!" exclaimed David, who with Isidore and his father, stood in the hall below. "I shall have my revenge for that; and in the first place, what have you been doing?" He was going on to attack Clarence with some playful banter, but at a glance from Mr. Falcon he caught a glimpse of what was going on—and he paused, bit his lip, and silently turned away. And Isidore, trifling and idle in her every utterance, because there was no depth of feeling in her heart, and an utter want of the intellectual capacity to feign it, destitute of tact or of feeling, rallied Clarence on his sudden recovery, for no warning or entreating glance could inform her mind with light, until he weariedly, and in another it would have seemed contemptuously, moved away, beckoning Susan to follow him.
               "She tires me," he said. "Come, and I'll show you something prettier." Susan followed him, obedient to Mr. Falcon's gesture; followed him alone through the hall, and the conservatory, to the grapery beyond, at the extremity of which was a marble image of Ceres, which, approaching, Susan recognized by the garland of poppies wreathing her brows.
               "There, you see—" said Clarence, pausing in the midst of his walk, and looking admiringly upon the statue.
               "See?" said Susan, "what?"
               "It's like you, and that's the reason."
               "Like me! the reason?" Susan was lost in the mystery. She could only repeat his words. As for Clarence, he too seemed at a loss. How was he to explain this? why did she not understand?
               "That is beautiful," said she, somewhat expostulatorily; he stood looking so strangely at her that she could but speak to break the spell upon him; it seemed, indeed, to be fast communicating itself to her.
               "Yes," he responded in the most amiable acquiescence.
               "But I, I am not beautiful, Clarence. You don't mean that I—"
               "Yes," he nodded his head with still more lively 
                     satfaction
                     satisfaction
                  .
               "Oh no! why, don't you see?" and she lifted her face in astonishment at his blindness, and stood back, that he might the more clearly behold her, and be convinced of his mistake, for Susan felt as if guilty of a moral wrong in having won his admiration, for, though it appeared incredible that she should have done so, he seemed so in earnest that it was quite as hard to doubt as to believe.
               "Yes," he said again. "I used to get tired of them all in there. So tired! and then I came here and looked at her; and afterwards I saw you, and then I—I. You know she always said so—but I did n't believe—I—" he looked at Susan with that strange, bewildered, imploring look, so frequently seen upon his face when memory was failing him. It was like nothing but beholding a death and a birth, as he passed that state, to this of placid repose, into which he now emerged.
               Another state it was into which he passed, and yet Susan was the light of this, as of that preceding; he took her hand, and walking up and down the glass house, talked to her about the beach, and her father, and the visits they had made there, as if she had but just arrived.
               And there they remained, walking through the grapery, amusing and amazing each other, until dinner was announced.
            
            
               XXXVII.
               WHAT had made them to differ? It is a simple question, so simple, so exceedingly simple as hardly to be worth a smile for answer—and yet, it was a perplexing problem to the child that asked it. For she had not yet learned life. Give a child who knows nothing of Geography phy a disjointed map of the globe, and observe what sort of a world he will make of it. What shall hinder his planting Italy in the region of the boreal pole? the Southern United States upon the coast of Guinea? and Turkey with its harems, or Paris with her unnameable corruptions, in the very heart of what we sometimes call, "the Union"?
               There is some information that people do not arrive at instinctively.
               Poor and barren Susan Dillon's home seemed to her, in comparison with this of the Baldwins. With an increasing, and an unhappy influx of light, did she contrast herself with these people; her destiny with theirs. Their life was a continual amusement, strangely bright and un troubled,—and what was hers? what had it been? what should it be?
               Now Susan was no doubt unwise—people do not often in their juvenile days arrive at the grand climacteric of wisdom. She was also, no doubt, ungrateful, to indulge in such reflections, while she sat among her entertainers, each one of whom seemed disposed to treat her with especial honor. Nevertheless she thought them, and it is not our intention to present her as a perfect miracle of grace or nature, knowing well that she was neither; and we desire that the reader should know the exact state of her mind when the family gathered around the dinner table, and her self-consciousness reached the height of desperation as she gazed about on the dazzling array of crystal, and silver, and china, and went through with that most formidable event of her life, her first dinner, poor child! in a "great house."
               She thought again that cruel thought when she sat in an alcove in the drawing-room, and with David's help,—Clarence making one of the group, for he never left her,—went through a portfolio of pictures, while Isidore sang, and Colonel Wheaton stood by her side and selected her music.
               But she forgot the thought when Mr. Falcon came from walking in the hall with Mr. Baldwin, when he sat down beside her, and, from joining in their conversation, took the lead in it.
               It was a path of ineffable brightness along which this man walked since. He came into the house to plead for, or rather to suggest the recall of Clarence, for there was of course no room for pleading such a point, the house seemed in a measure to be redeemed. Before that time it was a showy and comfortless place; and if none of them felt it to be so, so much the worse for them; but they did feel it. It was not a home.
               David, dissipating life at his club or among the gay officers stationed at St. John's, squandered youth and time as if the end of his being were attained when he received his collegiate diploma, and the highest testimonials from the professors. And Isidore, sought and flattered, and dazzled by her freedom from school restrictions, and the unlimited power of self-government which her father conferred upon her, was running a hardly less wild, certainly a not less ruinous, career of dissipation than her brother.
               We talk about the tendency, the influence of fiction! How careful had Mr. Leighton been to train this young mind thoroughly, severely, so far as time had permitted him! Written fiction may be bad, but living "social fiction" is infinitely worse.
               What thoughts were those that haunted Susan, as she lay upon her bed so wakeful that night? She did not blush to think them, but she trembled. A new element pervaded them, such as never before had aught to do with thoughts of hers.
               How strangely it differed—this new, bright, loving fancy—from the old dreams in which she had indulged in regard to the vastness of the lower deep, and all the tenants of that world hidden by the green waves of the sea! the gods that ruled and reigned there!
               If Mr. Leighton had ever, in the least degree, allowed her to dream, it had merely been after the manner of prophets, who must fulfil their own intuitions. Yet here was Susan in the very first day of life amid these scenes, breaking, like an outlaw, free from all restraints of his example, and of every other principle whose controlling influence she had felt hitherto. The teacher had closed the door of that world of fancy to which David Baldwin's books had opened. At his word, Susan had renounced the gift really and truly, though the volumes yet remained upon her shelf. But what was she now doing?
               Was she not dreaming after the very wildest fashion? Ay verily, poor girl, dreaming of herself—fatal mistake! Dreaming of herself, too, as beloved for her own sake . . . As dear to him who had a world of grace and loveliness, from which to choose objects and themes of affection . . . As living in the midst of all this beauty, that enchanted, enthralled, bewitched her—even as Isidore lived—knowing that it was her home. Waking, morning after morning, in the beautiful assurance that it was her home—living in it all the day—helping in the dispensation of its charities and pleasures. Beloved for her own sake!—anything—everything—to somebody. To somebody handsome as a god, who had authority, and every other thing that mortal man could wish!
               And as she thought, or dreamed, she recalled the grace and beauty of Isidore. None of her words or actions seemed to the musing, wakeful child either trifling or of small account. Why was she not in any manner like her? Why could she not be? Never could she be, was Susan's despairing conviction. How ugly must she seem, how awkward, and how ignorant, compared with Isidore!
               Mr. Baldwin must have spoken only in jest in those days, when he talked of a future union between his family and that of Walter Dillon . . . So concluded Susan, when she had built up her dream to its last height—he never could have foreseen that her nature would prove so perversely set against a fair development.
               When Susan launched out upon this theme, it seemed as if she would never come into port again; but somehow, before she slept, she had arrived at the beach again—had returned to Mr. Leighton, and the old red mill, with its flapping rags of sails—to her own cabin home—and the sound of the great waves was once more in her ear.
               In comparing her wild home with this of the Baldwins, now she felt it remorsefully, she had left out of calculation that which was an essential part thereof. The magnificent expanse of sky over the ocean, and the wide realm of cloud-land. The changeful sea—its winter and its summer, its passion and its rest. The brave and beautiful old gods, whose shrines were all around her there—the white sandy beach—the sea and shore birds—the wind-mill and its tenant—and those green graves. All these things were within the borders of her home—the child's heart throbbed faster, and her tears fell as she thought of it.
               And thus, oh mighty heaven, wondrous deep, sandy beach, and lonely graves, she was not unfaithful to you, for all that wild flight of dreaming. For when she slept at length, panoplied in state, in the very midst of what looked like fairy-land to her, she wept in dreams because of you. For in her dreams she saw dark clouds obscuring the sweet face of heaven; and black and terrible were the great waves in their restlessness! For she had met with an immeasurable loss.
            
            
               
               XXXVIII.
               MR. DE LISLE LAYARD, to return to him, is thoroughly mystified. He has on his hands a little affair which exceedingly vexes him. He has half a mind to take David Baldwin into council, but this temptation he resists, and so effectually resists that he succeeds in arriving at a whole mind on the subject, and he will therefore ask no counsel; but he will nevertheless avail himself, in such ways as seem desirable, of Baldwin's superior skill in woman craft, on the very next occasion of their meeting.
               Layard has accepted the professorship offered him, but is not yet in occupancy of his place. The leisure time he has before the opening of the new term when he will enter on its duties, is, however, fully engrossed.
               Day after day, he finds himself in the parlor of Fifty-four John's street, and there is a listener who never wearies of his story of travel. Miss Judith Mar has an ear to hear, and he knows it is at his service so long as he can speak. But there is another, whose manner as a listener does not please him as well. She involves him, even by her habit of audience, in constant perplexity. He thought he understood her—it is a very little point around which his doubt revolves, but the doubt itself is not contracted, it is large in its circle and sweep, so extended as to embrace even all the affairs of his life, his whole destiny. Is her indifference assumed, or is it not? If it is assumed, his path is plain before him; if it is real, the other path is equally plain; but he must understand her in the first place, or he cannot take a step.
               De Lisle Layard is a man who walks by faith and not by sight.
               He has discovered in some way, how, it does not concern us to know, perhaps through Miss Mar's confidential tial betrayal of her fears, that there is a decided relaxation in Stella's hold of the faith of Rome. Has the fact of his Protestantism brought about this change? De Lisle Layard smiles to think it may be so! He can walk with firm tread along the path this prospect opens to his view. But it may be, for she has not a trifling mind, nor a faltering will, it may be that her indifference towards him is not the perfection of acting, is unassumed, she may be living in the utmost honesty of act and look, when she continues so unmoved, so unconscious in his presence; her delay in avowing her belief may have a reason in which he is not involved in her meditations.
               If this be the fact, he thinks his course is manifestly different from that to be pursued in case the first supposition should prove to be the true one.
               If he desires one thing more than all others, it is to see Stella Cammon forsaking the Church of Rome. He will help her indirectly in either case, to that achievement. But why? Does he conceive that she is in deadly error, and in extremity of need? is it a desire that shows itself in prayer for her liberation? That is hardly to be thought. His heart is not large enough to harbor such a wish—his mind is not strong enough to cherish such an aspiration till it come to active life.
               It is quite impossible that he shall aid her deliverance, or hasten it, by any uttered word against the Church dear to her from the force of the habit of years. That would be brutal. His taste revolts against such procedure. But more than his taste revolts—he could not bring himself to inflict so deep a wound in the heart of Miss Mar; and more than the delicate instinct of friendship withholds him here. But if he sometimes speaks reverently of spiritual freedom, Aunt Judith, who thinks she has it, will bless herself on the possession, and the godly youth for his pious words; and Stella, who knows she has it not, will sigh for it the more, and wrestle for it all the more . . . And, if he expatiates on the magnificence of the cathedrals of Catholic countries, Miss Mar's face will become radiant with the reflected dreams of her imagination, and she will remember his eloquence; she will not heed the word, so slight in itself, and so simply uttered, that will suggest to Stella another and quite different train of thought, about the worshippers of those cathedrals, and the social and political life which radiates from them. His reverence will win the faith of one woman; his liberality—the liberality of Protestantism—will be a new and irresistible attraction to the, it may be, still wavering faith of the other.
               She is so cold, and so inaccessible to him! Does that trouble him? In so far as this, that he would understand its meaning; if it is a mask, she might assume such an one and wear it unsuspected he knows well, a mask to conceal other and far more different feelings, he would—know it. But why? as I said above, that he might walk in the right path straight toward the end he had in view.
               The conversation he has had with Stella earlier in this evening, which is the night of Susan Dillon's arrival at the Hall, has not set his mind at rest. He had made good an opportunity to say to Stella that he did not understand her coldness; he had asked her if she were forgetful of the past, and she had answered no—and very truly. He had remonstrated with her on that ground, that recollections of the past should ensure in his behalf a more cordial friendship. He had not claimed her, or demanded if she were not bound to him by any vow spoken of old, but had so recalled the promise and the vow, that Stella, if she answered, could not avoid replying to that very point.
               "I may be cold," she said, "but I owe that to you: you made me so. I feel it is no small debt to owe you."
               "I should consider that I had done you a great injury could I believe this," he had answered.
               "Oh no," he recalled her manner of saying this—she did not speak hastily, as if agitated—nor faintly, as though irresolute; whether he were right, or not, it certainly seemed to him that she spoke with the firm coolness of an unalterable decision. "Oh no," she had repeated, "I thank you for it."
               "You have forgotten," he recalled that word with vexation, it slipped from him unawares; it had been better, he now thought, had he not to reflect that, whether in maiden pride or actual earnestness, such words had been spoken by her to him.
               "No, I have not forgotten," she answered, apparently quick to take advantage of the opportunity. "I told you once that I loved you—I told you so frankly, for I felt it. You had not asked me if I did. I said it of myself. It was the bold daring of a bold child that prompted me. I think you should have understood it."
               "I may understand it very readily," Layard had been quick to answer, "but I do not see that it is a good reason why I should lose you now, as a friend."
               "Nor I," she had replied, speaking frankly.
               But now he doubted the apparent frankness, and the smile. It was, perhaps, nay doubtless, her woman pride that caused her to speak thus, and smile thus. Her woman pride would be sure to veil itself, even if their old relation still held good; but—but, the sight that would most delight Mr. De Lisle Layard at that perplexing retrospection, was undoubtedly David Baldwin. And yet he bolted his door to secure himself from intrusion, and drawing forth a travel-beaten trunk, took out Stella's letters, written in the first months after he had established himself in a foreign university, and proceeded to make a new study of them.
            
            
               
               XXXIX.
               WAS this that Stella had said, all true? When Layard was gone and she thought over her words, and weighed them, and contrasted her hero of the past with the person to whom she had thus spoken, was what she had uttered true, she asked herself. Was there no longer magic in his presence? Did she not feel it—had it no controlling influence? Beyond question, since his return, till now, she had not felt it, but now! With a shudder she looked at the past and this present as converged in and radiating from him again. Did the thought give her no light? Did it afford her no warmth? Had she not spoken too hastily to him—was it wise in her, was it right, to be rushing so continually into conflict with fate?
               Have patience with her, it is a mortal conflict—human nature's ignorance and weakness contending with an immortal spirit's instinct. Deep emotions, which, however, in this interview had not betrayed themselves—these emotions had exhausted her. She was not her own nerved complete self, or she had not questioned herself in such a manner; the house had divided against itself, or she had certainly not mused thus while she sat in her chamber till the lamp-light waned, and the silence in the street, and the city clock upon the mantel, told the lateness of the hour.
               "Am I fighting against God?" she asked herself. "Layard has fine prospects before him. He has some feeling after all, or he would not give himself so much trouble as he does. He is different from what he was—but so am I—and I cannot wonder at it, to this day, that I told him I loved him; it was not strange that I loved him—it had been strange if I had not told him; he was like the spirit of my spirit in those days Perhaps it was a fault of manner on his part—he was so taken by surprise too, and no wonder, for he had been taught to think by rule. He may have been as much in earnest as I—perhaps it was because I, myself, came afterwards to see how I had exposed myself by making such a declaration, and that naturally would have led me to think him cold, though after his own fashion he expressed himself as fully as he could. It may have been the only possible consequence that my own nature should avenge my folly thus. But now . . . . I will go no more to confession. I will, at least, cheat myself no longer with the notion that any good can come of it—good may come to others through that channel, but it will not to me. The fault may be mine; perhaps I've choked up the vent with rubbish of thoughts. But sometimes I believe that Theresa herself has opinions about it she would not choose to confess. She submits to formularies, but they are of no consequence to her in themselves—they have no interior, independent virtues for her. I believe it—it is true, if one can interpret the expression of a nun's eyes the same way he could do that of another person. The Father—oh that I had a father! . . . he does me no good—but he should, even according to a mere natural law, putting the spiritual out of the question. I can understand the control he might have obtained over me, but he neglected to do it. I do not trust him outside of the confessional; and I cannot see that a wall between us mends the matter any: he lives to eat and drink, and if the things of the spirit are spiritually discerned, I should like to know how he gets along spiritually—he is blind as a bat. He knows nothing . . . But this is an infamous way of thinking, of course. I should be a subject for the Inquisition if we had such an institution . . . I wish Theresa had not said so much. I should like to get a glimpse of my faith, if I have an . . . "She took down the rosary from the place where it hung on the wall, and mechanically turned the beads, and repeated a prayer or two, but the virtue had all gone out of the rosary. "If Layard had not come back I should have grown up into the light, I do verily believe, but now I cannot rise above the tangled branches that fret me on every side; and this poisonous odor will kill me. I thought I got a glimpse once of the bright heaven beyond, and a sun shining there with an angel in it . . . but now I believe . . . it may have been delusion, for it is very dark with me, God knows. And I doubt myself, my motives,—the whole thing from beginning to end. Father Francis, at least, is no saint . . . poor old fellow—my disgust, after all, may be only a personal one. When he tells me I must deny myself, and do penance, and take up my cross, I think, You, gluttonous wine-bibber, are a proper person to be sure to preach up such doctrines! but then my common sense cries shame on me, for did not Judas hold an office in the apostolic society, and that did not disturb the fact of Christ's divinity—Jesus was our Saviour none the less . . . Is it, or is it not, against the principle that I rebel? De Lisle Layard and Father Francis, if I know anything, should have nothing to do with the matter. Oh God! who didst speak not in the whirlwind or fire, but in the still small voice, tell me, tell me! that I am seeking Thee! . . . It is the religion for Lucia Tree, and I know it. It's the form for her I mean; for what the nun said must be true, the essence of Truth is everywhere—omnipresent as it is divine—and we only see it differently. She is not conscious of bondage—and so she is free. But for me . . . no! they may ring in my ears till doomsday that the saints all testified to it from St. Ireneus to Richard de Saint Victor, what's that to me? what is every name under heaven in the way of authority, when my heart rejects the testimony, and my mind disputes it Venerable names they have—but a foolish man is no more respectable is he, for. having white hairs, and wrinkles? There's Origin, and St. Cyprian, and Lactantius, and St. Athanasius, and St. Pacian, and St. Augustine, Chrysostom, and the rest—but . . . there's a Father Everlasting, who commanded that we should have no graven images, and the angel of Revelation who would not suffer John to fall before him. It is something to set up in opposition to authority, and take the curse of a Church for your reward . . . Their altar looks like a baby-house. I'm sure Christ's words to Nicodemus had no such meaning as our Church seems to think. One must become a child to enter a kingdom of heaven. But, good heaven! must one take to playing with dolls and artificial flowers, in that celestial childhood? have we not had enough of that already in our carnal experiences? . . . I have tried to bolster up my faith long enough—I have got quite beyond such a childhood as that, certainly; and yet John Wolvern the convert, the new St. John, comes up with his testimony, and seems honest about it; he gave up his church, and his beautiful wife, and lovely children for . . . a form. I mean for our Church and priesthood! It edifies Aunt Judith to hear him talk sentiment. I believe the Virgin mother would have been better pleased had he sacrificed this preference of taste, for he is too weak to be earnest, to his paternal duty and marriage vows. And the confessional has such attractions for him that I should not be at all surprised to hear that he had committed some deadly sin merely for the sake of getting upon his knees to tell it to some fellow mortal. Strange, he says, the relief and peace one experiences from performance of this duty. Strange indeed!
               
               "Father Francis suspects me—if he were a better man I would indeed confess to him, and take the consequences; but he would, as he is, be sure to shut me up on a diet of bread and water, and provide me with all the means requisite that I might discipline myself; that is his way. Theresa has another—she gives her creed its most forcible argument by her liberality—almost persuades me to embrace, heart and soul, the idea, for she has one, that makes her so liberal. Perhaps that is Jesuitism in its most refined form . . . I want light, and they turn on the gas—most brilliant illumination! . . . Aunt works her altar ornaments, and is happy; Leah sings her gloria in excelsis, and she is happy; saintly Theresa jogs on through her school labors, and she is happy too—and the convert John Wolvern is happiest of all. But . . . he, with all the rest, has thrown himself into some work. Work is the secret of it; all turns on that. But what can I do? Is there no voice in heaven or earth that can answer? I cannot work altar-patches . . . I would as soon be roasted in a slow fire as sit down to plod through a wilderness of floss and canvas, making Holy Families with glories around their heads; I'd rather make respectable families with peace in their hearts out of the corruption that festers in waste places. Aunt hasn't given up her hope of making a convert of Layard yet. Oh, that she may succeed! I believe the bars of my cage would be broken then . . . I am heartily glad the crucifix he brought me was broken. He thinks I have n't discovered what a harm happened to it by the way; it was so cleverly patched! But a broken crucifix, to my mind, cannot be mended . . . It came to me in good time that broken . . . Oh, Christ! what am I thinking! . . ."
               And with these lugubrious thoughts, and no other prayer than they implied, Stella betook herself to sleep— the blessed panacea of the weary heart and troubled mind; if it give not nightmare in place of the promised rest.
            
            
               XL.
               "WHEW! you're not off again! what does all this parade of baggage mean, most learned Orientalist?"
               De Lisle Layard heard a voice, and felt three distinct raps on his shoulder, and looking up saw David Baldwin.
               "I thought I fastened my door when I came in," said he, quietly, endeavoring to look unsurprised.
               "Yes; but I came through the window after wearing out my patience at your door. Which sphere contains you just now, sir? Are you in the body, or out of it, Orientalist?"
               "Sit down, sit down, till I get through my work."
               "Tell me, first, if you are going to run away again?"
               "No, no, Baldwin; leave me alone, my dear fellow, for a moment, till I pick up the thought you knocked from my cranium. Make yourself easy, I am not off again in a hurry. Here, take this puzzle and go to work at it—ten to one if you manage it, though you try till morning." And from the table, heaped with curious things, toys, and scientific wonders, brought from widely separated lands, Layard produced an ivory puzzle of Chinese workmanship, elaborately carved, which he gave to David.
               He then continued the examination of his letters. At length he had satisfied himself, whatever his object might be, and gathering up the papers, he arranged them according to the dates, tied them together, and locked 
                     the the
                     the
                   trunk in which he placed them.
               As he did so, David held the solved mystery of the puzzle before his eyes in triumph.
               "Go to work," said Layard to him as he took the toy "go to work in earnest, Baldwin, and in ten years you'll be the keystone of the State. I've seen men of renowned skill in weighty matters work a whole day over that trifle, making it a profound intellectual exercise too, and they considered when they found the clue that it was a real achievement. What was your process?"
               "A philosophical one, of course," said Baldwin, speaking out like a man, which was so seldom his method as to make it a matter of observation when he actually did so. For he was full of petty affectations.
               "But tell me your method?"
               "Magnetism."
               "Nonsense."
               "I know you think so; you're true enough there, too. Nonsense is the law of my being, sir. If ever I detected any other in operation within me, I should come out and deny my identity."
               "What are you doing now-a-days, Baldwin?"
               "Nothing—" said David, listlessly, suppressing a yawn, and playing an inaudible tune with his delicate white fingers, on one of which a costly diamond flashed, on the arms of his chair.
               "Nothing!" repeated Layard, somewhat weightily.
               "Even so, Orientalist. What the deuce is worth doing? I should like to buy out this museum of yours, and arrange and classify these ancient relics you've got together with such a vast deal of trouble. You have had all the good you deserve out of them already. Why should you keep them? Just save yourself the trouble of packing and unpacking them every six months, and give me something to do."
               "No, sir. I keep them in reserve for evidence."
               "Of what, pray, professor?"
               "That I am alive, or was once. If it is my mission to gather together these rags and bits of antiquity, I hope I shall fulfil it."
               "Oh, man, man! you are in the whirlpool! what cord can penetrate to the depth of your delusion, and so extricate you?"
               "Let down a ray of light, philosopher. I will climb along it, and so up to the heights of your serenity, perhaps," said Layard. "But tell me first, what general law it is that regulates the life of womankind? I have pitched headlong into ruin, I believe, in consequence of not understanding it."
               "General law! Orientalist, every soul of them has a law of her own, which she repeals or amends, or in some way modifies, every twenty-four hours. 'You can calculate her as you would a comet;' but you must, of course, know something about the comet to begin with. You know, don't you, when to look for the rising and setting of the sun, and the phases of the moon? . . . You understand? Exalt yourself for the celestial contemplation—that's all."
               "Exalt, eh? but you are laughing, are you not?"
               "Laughing, venerable sage! Say, rather, I have spoken with the superlative gravity of an ass."
               "Baldwin, you have lived in the world—"
               "Have not I?" interrupted David.
               "And seen women?"
               "Heaven bless your soul, professor—I have done that."
               "We used to say when we were boys—I remember it of myself—I made an address once to mothers, when I left the academy; how they did pat me on the back for it, though! that woman was mightier in her affections to achieve, than a warrior in his armor, at the head of an host."
               "You did! well, why not? If a woman could be found, you know. That's all. You are not boy enough to say that now."
               "I am man enough to say it," responded Layard, carefully observant, with every word he uttered, of the effect produced.
               "True enough—of the old time, when there were women, it may be; but I think even that a delusion on your part. Where did you get your proof?"
               "From History."
               "From History! that notorious liar and quack! History! that makes all its facts falsehoods, by leaving out of count the very points that constituted them facts! What you have to do, is to see with your own eyes. Take the women of this age, or even of this city—make a history of them, professor! The book would be ostracised, or deserve to be . . . There's a little girl, no bad likeness of a female ourang-outang, at my father's just now;—do you know, that child seems to me a perfect miracle of nature. As you live, man, she has a heart in her breast. On my soul, Layard, 'tis true."
               "Oh, we all behold such a miracle once in our lives, at least," said Layard. "You have made a study of the phenomenon?"
               "Yes, yes—have I not?—in boudoirs and ball-rooms—in shops and in carriages—in the street and in gardens—in laboratories and on the stage. I think I have exhausted the subject. How pretty they all are! It is wonderful where so many good looks, little feet, and loves of hands come from. Our little girl at my father's has the proportions of a young elephant, in comparison. But she don't simper when she smiles, and you are morally certain that if she would open her lips she would speak like a reasonable being. The fact is, De Lisle Layard, Orientalist, a harem is the only place on earth fitted for these young women who throng our saloons and streets."
               "The fact is, David Baldwin, Esquire, it is just the anomaly presented by the idle extravagance of such young devils—you would rather be called a devil than a devil's tool, I take it,—as yourself, young men in every way prepared to advance to offices of public trust and power, it is precisely the fact, that you, and such as you, live for no other discoverable purpose than to descend to the level of such fashionable platitudes, such scandalous decencies, as make the brilliance of society just now; it is that fact, I say, that accounts for the other. When men are emasculate, what can you expect of women?"
               "Professor—you are slightly excited, I think, sir."
               "No, no, boy. It is just that—if I could only excite you a little—put you into a rage; but you pass off everything in that way with a laugh and a sneer. It makes the very hopelessness of the case."
               "Oh, sapient professor! If wisdom comes with office-holding, I commission you to buy an office for me tomorrow."
               "Buy an office! Earn it—earn it! I am almost tempted to cry out to you in the Apostle's words to Simon, 'thy money perish with thee!' But I should vastly prefer to have it perish before thee. Depend upon it, Baldwin, it would be a happy thing for you."
               "Professor, spare me! if you must needs practice your oratorical powers, I will have a class here to-morrow morning ere dawn streaks the orient; you shall lecture to them without hinderance, I promise you. Layard, were you ever in love? Not seriously of course, that would be impossible—but—"
               "Let us have the explanations as you go along. Impossible, do you say? why?"
               "Because, of a certainty there is nothing on earth that could answer to a call from the depths of a man's heart. I believe you would call from no less profound depth. Knowing, as you must, that the call could not be answered, you would be sufficiently wise of course not to make it."
               It was true then that this youth was unsatisfied! Do you think that De Lisle Layard failed to perceive that point?
               "Suppose," he said, "suppose, David, that I call to you from that depth. Suppose that I confess myself in love with you!"
               A moment David hesitated, then with an energy surprising in him, he bent forward, and taking Layard's hand gave it a cordial shake, while a smile of real pleasure brightened his face, chasing away its lassitude.
               "It makes no odds whether or not I have been in love before to night, or with another than one of my own sex, my dear fellow. I have had strange entertainment this evening—it affects me unpleasantly. You love me? then listen. Four years ago a lady made rather a surprising, at least uncommon declaration of personal attachment, in which I, as an interested party, acquiesced of course; certain circumstances rendering it not easy to do otherwise. I submitted to destiny."
               "Submitted to destiny, man! what are you talking about? Show me that girl; I love her to distraction already."
               "Nonsense. Be still, you neither love her now, still less would you if you should see her. But she seems at present disposed to undo all she has done. I mean, unsay all she said—she is cold as an ice-berg."
               "Of course you looked for this?"
               "Not I."
               "You might have, since you believe in the constancy of woman, and remember that four years are a great affair in the life of a young girl. I presume she is ready to swear by all the saints that she detests you."
               "Pretty nearly, if not quite, I suspect," said Layard, with perplexed gravity.
               "But you don't believe a word of it?"
               "Tell me if I should."
               "A girl who loved you so well as to inform you of the fact without your expressing any particular curiosity about it—hum, hum, where are your wits, sir?"
               "Explain, David, if it is feminine pride that has occasioned this manner of retreat. I suspect it is so; or, was it merely inflamed youthful imagination that impelled an impetuous nature to a speech that was refuted, and known for false, the moment it escaped her."
               "Persevere, and you will yourself discover. I do not mean, of course, that you should dog her steps as if you were one of the police. Her vanity would carry her all lengths in that case; you would both end, not by soaring to Paradise, but by falling into the ditch."
               "Pursuit is the last thing I contemplate."
               "Then, professor, calculate on your success. Is the lady nameless?"
               Layard hesitated just long enough for Baldwin to perceive that there was a reason why he should hesitate; that, not for himself, but for the unknown fair one, he kept back the name; and then replied, "You ask me to betray her. That you would not have me do."
               "Right, sir!" exclaimed David. "And after all, she is but a woman. So we go blowing bubbles, and peering into kaleidoscopes. Rare amusement for men!"
               David stretched himself in his chair, and gave utterance now to an unlimited yawn, which had almost the emphasis of a groan.
               "I wish I were an Irishman, gaunt with famine. An Irishman with a spade on my shoulder, and a wife and ten children dependent on the fruits of my expert digging."
               
               "I wish you were!" echoed Layard; "only the wife, poor woman! would kill herself working to keep you in rags and meal. And the ten would turn out, ten tribes of extra vagabonds to burden the face of the earth. The worst feature in your case, Baldwin, is your propensity, irresistible it seems to me, I give you full credit for that, to mock and scoff at everything."
               "If you will show me a solitary thing worth striving after, Layard, I will promise to achieve it." David spoke with sincerity, but every avenue of his intellect was barred against the entrance of conviction. Layard could only talk at random.
               "Baldwin, I should take you to be five and forty at least, instead of two and twenty."
               "I am so prematurely wise? Oh, don't compliment me; I take a compliment to be a direct insult."
               "Far be any such purpose from me. I did not refer to your premature wisdom, but to the premature exhaustion of your mortal, material frame. What has worn you in this fashion? If you had given these wasted energies to any right manly aim, I tell you I should not see you lounging there in that style. You would be—"
               "Yes, I know all that—maybe a public speaker of some description—an orator with a name for a placard to adorn the lamp-posts, whose end is to be smeared with oil drip, and ultimately to smoulder in a baker's oven, to help him on in his custom-mongering . . . I know, sir; De Lisle," he continued with still more earnestness and spirit, "politician, orator, book-hack, special pleader, one event happeneth to all. No, sir! I was born without the nerve to be a humbug. If I have an epitaph this shall be it: 'Here lies a man who never stood in the path of any soul—who, to all intents and purposes, did mind his own business.' I've worn myself out, you say; then it is high time to retire from service! I have been thinking of that very thing quite seriously. But you say I have exhausted myself pursuing an ignis fatuus—why that is all that any man does."
               "Great rejoicing the authorities who 'believe and tremble' must hold over a confession like that! It passes my understanding, I acknowledge, how you, with whatever talents you happen to have, and your position besides, how you can deceive yourself into the belief that you stand or fall alone. David, do you believe it?"
               "Professor, I respect you as a very respectable sinner in your own way, and I make other allowance, too, for a man in love; you are not so impertinently religious as you would have me believe; I think I shall resort to a Champaigne frolic in order to discover what it is you are driving at. Then you would confess it all. It takes a glorious libation to make a man illustrate himself."
               "Confess!" exclaimed Layard, sternly; "have you no more faith in man's honor than in woman's genuineness?"
               "Not much," responded Baldwin, coolly, carelessly.
               "Then you are incapable of a friendship which a slight act of yours just now led me to hope for."
               "That may be . . . No, Layard! I am not incapable, I am not so badly off as that. I believe in man, for I know you—and in woman, there is the fisherman's daughter; her name is Susan. And besides, in the very midst of the heartlessness and shame of society, there is Miss Watson, her name had some reputation as a writer once, who has such faith in her sex that her credulous weakness is actually contagious; you inevitably believe with her when you hear her speak, that women are angels, and men gods, and the world an Eden. And besides her, there is another, some people call her my sister's rival, but why, I know not, a Miss Cammon, whose eyes have more romances in them than a world full of fairy books. I've read some of them myself, though I have always kept at a telescopic distance from her. Acquit me, therefore, of that charge of infidelity. I have had by far too much respect for her to ask an introduction. Report says she designs herself for a convent, but it is difficult to believe."
               Baldwin, as he spoke, took up the puzzle again, and seemed to be absorbed in an examination of the beautiful carving.
               A broad ray of light had streamed through Layard's brain: a convent! She had actually thought of that! But—why had she thought of it? The help this man might render him was quite too valuable to be lost. Layard roused himself again.
               "I met Wadsworth Vane this morning in the street. Do you know the effect? When I came back to my room I threw open my window and let all the sun and air in that would come, and greeted them with a shout. When one man can occasion as much as that in another, is he not a fellow worth looking after?"
               By the steadiness of the glance that expressed the calm scrutiny to which Baldwin was subjecting his words, Layard knew that they should work admirably together. Cool and deliberate they both were, but only one of them had ascertained the fact so thoroughly as to make a use of it.
               "I'd give a thousand worlds," said Baldwin, "for a loan of that furnace you have in you, that propels you at such a rate over these iron roads. What a heat! but the smoke chokes me. Roll on, oh turbulent engine! I'm not the man for that train; maybe I am not fit to get on as passenger, nor to be thrown on as baggage . . . Who's Wadsworth Vane?"
               "Did I never tell you of him?" replied Layard slowly. "He is a little fellow, looks like a Spaniard—a house painter, works in the employ of somebody in town."
               "Indeed," said Baldwin, with a smile, "that is really quite a remarkable scrap of biography!"
               "Twelve years ago I saw him last," continued Layard. "His father was a judge in my native county—but his reputation was not of the best. Vane and I were bosom friends. We exchanged gifts when we parted, and swore fidelity to death. You'll find his jack-knife somewhere in my museum, I dare say. I have always been careful to look to its safety. It was a surprise when on my way up here this morning I heard his name pronounced, and a still greater surprise when I learned his occupation. When I looked among the workmen I recognized him at once;—he seemed hardly to have grown an inch; by his unmistakable eyes and long black hair I knew him. He recognized me too. But what I want to get at is the hero; pardon the reminiscence . . . I used to think that Vane would be an artist—not on quite so large a scale as I found him though. It seems his father turned him off, and a trade he must have to support him. He judged, he was a mere boy remember, that he might as well in his necessary labor 'for the stomach's sake,' work in a way that would ensure his more perfect mastery of the tools which he meant to employ when he should get beyond want. Imagine a boy twelve years old taking these things into consideration, and losing no time in carrying them out according to his own manly philosophy—looking for an employer, patiently submitting to be a drudge, that he might one day study art in peace, and go to Italy."
               "How happened the father to dispose of him in that way? Does he want help, Layard?"
               "Help? Do you think such a fellow wants a—patron? You don't understand him yet. I will explain him further. His father disposed of him because the boy honored the memory of his mother."
               "What do you say, professor?"
               "I do not betray him by letting you into the secret of his disgrace. The scene took place in a chamber where death was. Vane's mother had but just breathed her last, when the Judge turned away from the bedside saying, 'She has been the cause of every particle of ill luck I ever had.' . . . The boy, who idolized his mother, broke out, losing all fear of his father, 'And of all the honor and respect that belongs to our name! but for her we were villains, every one of us!' Of course there was no longer room for the boy under that roof. You see what stuff he is made of. If we have not an artist in him we may as well give up looking for one. Glory to God! there is some faith too, some enterprise, and self-reliance in the land!"
               David Baldwin rose, and slowly drew himself up to his full height. "You have done it rather clumsily," said he, not quite so much at ease as he would have chosen to appear. "You tell this tale, a very interesting one by the way, as you observe, as a sort of summing up of all you have said before, De Lisle. I believe you are enough a barbarian to be regretting in your heart, at this instant, that some such fate had not befallen me. Providence understood me better, and kept me on the paternal domain, knowing well that a cage was the best place in the universe for me."
               "If you had not broken the wires, and wandered away into the unrecovered, wild, and worthless tract, you might talk with a better grace about cages. You have a little too prominent frontal brain to be successful, young man, when you attempt to convince me that you have had no serious thoughts, or great imaginations in your day."
               "Oh, professor, once for all, it is sad trash that you have picked up in your wanderings. Cast off this oriental rubbish from the shelves of your cranium, I humbly entreat, before they tumble down, a whole heap of ruinous rubbish, into that very capacious vault of a heart that belongs to you. Tear open those grates, and let in a little of the blessed fresh air, I beseech you; there's a smell of earth about the region that offends me. It is 'rank—it smells to heaven.' . . . Good night."
               But De Lisle Layard caught his arm as David moved towards the door, and brought him back, and taking a lamp examined his features by its light. David quietly submitted to the inspection with a provoking gravity. "I have fed Solomon with proverbs," said Layard, and passing his arm through Baldwin's he escorted him as far as the Hall gates.
               The professor might well sleep with a smile of satisfaction on his lip that night, for what he had attempted he had achieved, and he knew it. He had awakened David Baldwin's interest in him—had secured a friend in him—had won for himself the sceptical youth's admiration and respect—and if no more than this was accomplished, why, what was De Lisle Layard that he should make a lamentation and water his couch with tears on that account? Was he his brother's keeper?
            
            
               XLI.
               TEMPTED of the Devil . . . what does that mean? Are the words merely a figure of speech?
               Was it the unfolding of her actual nature, or an independent attack of the infernal that sent Susan, when the sun had risen, with the revolutionary thoughts of last night dominant, again out into the day? Were there about that child's path spirits watching the moments for their nefarious purposes, who knew her altogether, and, rejoicing in her weakness, looked for a speedy conquest?
               When she stood before the mirror that reflected her person at full length, and for the first time saw herself as she was, was it wonderful that, disgusted with the poor picture that for the moment had so fine a setting, she turned away, wishing in her heart that she had never heard of St. John's, and never seen the Hall?
               From the window of the chamber she occupied Susan's eyes fell upon the horizon where she watched the sunrise, to the garden beneath, where the flowers shone resplendent in the tranquil shade. A thought struck her. She listened at her door; there was a sound of life stirring in the rooms below, the house-maid moving quietly about. If she could go out into the garden she should forget herself—the splendor of her room, for it was one of the grand guest chambers, might well be exchanged for the out-door freedom; and so Susan descends the stairway noiselessly, and passes out at the hall door, and makes her way into the garden.
               The fresh breath of the sweet morning greets her like a loving friend, whose tender voice is tremulous with love; it is prodigal of kisses, cheek, and lip, and forehead are laden with them. How the birds sing! The gorgeous orioles perched on the branches survey their swinging nest, and the precious treasure in them; there is one who sings more loudly than the rest, his mate and little brood he watches in paternal pride, and looks about as he sings as if questioning his neighbors whether any one of them can show as promising a family; and Robin and Phœbe, and the twittering yellow-bird, what a musical medley they make. The girl from the sea-coast walks under those populous branches like one in a trance. I do not deem it an extravagance when I say, that if she met here two angelic creatures whose loss is her unending lamentation, if she met them while she walks, it would not much surprise her. She has so far forgotten where she is—it is so like heaven all around her.
               How the dew-drops lie in the heart of the roses! how they shine on the fresh green leaves, making even the white flowers purer! Troops of companions, fairies and spirits, come from their coverts as she passes by—they throng the garden paths, and the air, and the sky beyond. She has the soul-subduing consciousness of the presence of many—an innumerable host: she cannot help herself, with trembling and tears she makes her confession, she is not worthy to come among them—she has sinned against the Earthly and the Heavenly Father in her last night's complaining, and in its continuation of this morning. She plucks no leaf nor blossom—they are all too pure for her—through the walks she moves, and as she strolls along her arms are folded on her breast.
               Still she cannot choose but think, as she comes to the arbor which Mr. Baldwin yesterday pointed out to her, of interwoven tree branches, where, he told her, he took his noon-day naps in fair weather—she cannot choose but think upon the slumbering inmates of the Hall. She cannot help wondering at the sudden change that took place in her feelings toward David as she came with him yesterday from the beach . . . She trusts him now as she trusts every one she loves—her father, Mr. Leighton, Mr. Falcon, Leah Chilton—and in the enumeration she remembers the gay girl who made such joy in the cabin in the old, old time, Stella Cammon. She does not add Clarence Baldwin, nor yet Isidore to the list. They are both excepted, not for the same reason, however. There is something in Clarence, womanly-quiet and gentle as he is, something in his ways that troubles her much. If Mr. Falcon were with her, she would ask him to explain it, for he could—he understands all things—he is the wisest man in the world except Mr. Leighton. Clarence beats against her nature so strangely—and she does not stand fast and firm as the rock that bears with the dashing of the waves without a stir of the muscles of its heart, that, with a grand, undisturbed serenity, submits to it.
               He lays claim to her so strangely. She feels this, but she mistakes when she thinks she could explain it to another. Mr. Falcon might indeed understand it, but not from any illumination that she could give. He seems—she does not comprehend it, it seems incredible to her, but nevertheless it is so—he seems to rely on her so much. And then, what strange looks are those with which he regards her when his memory weakens and relaxes its hold, and he breaks suddenly, and falls from one range of speech into another! With an awed, sinking dread she thinks of this strange thing. What is it? what does it mean? why does he seem so careless and indifferent to all others when she is by? And why does the child shudder, and shade her eyes from that morning light, as she recalls his voice and his way of speaking to her? it is so mild a voice, it saddens her to hear it—it seems to plead for him, when he speaks, that she shall be kind and good to him. Dear child! as if she could be otherwise to any human being! Thinking of these things, she breathes heavily, like a tired wrestler, like one struggling to shake off a spell—to escape an illusion—to break an enchantment. If Mr. Falcon would but come!
               In the very midst of these reflections Susan fell into a slumber—her broken rest of the last night—the quiet of the morning—the warmth and the blended odors conspired to weave the scene outward and inward into one blessed spell—the garden glories concentrated before her eyes into one broad iris—and she slept with the bow of promise arching over her soul.
               How long a time she slept, or how she wakened, Susan could not tell; when she opened her eyes, it was slowly, and with a calm heart, as if her slumber had been undisturbed; but there, before her eyes, stood David Baldwin, leaning against a branch of the blossoming arbor, watching her, and the great Prince John lying in his shining sable robe on the gravel-bed before her.
               When he perceived that she was waking, without allowing her time to become confused, David went into the arbor, and sat down beside Susan, and began immediately to speak.
               "I saw you walking about," said he, "and, as it is yet some time before breakfast, thought I would come and give you a taste of poetry. Is it safe, taken before breakfast, do you think? Prince, is it safe? Down, sir! You see how it is, Susan; he puts on airs, and places himself on a level with you the minute you ask him a civil question. I warn you against taking the least notice of him . . . Do you like poetry?" All the while he spoke David was turning the leaves of the book he had brought with him, and he only paused a second for her reply; for though he was not looking at her, he perceived her embarrassment, and did not that morning, or in that presence at least, betray a bantering mood. He began to read aloud. He read well—with appreciation of the poet's sentiment; and went from one poem to another, merely glancing for criticism now and then to the face of the child.
               Her face was not changeful with the varying sentiment. It did not betray an emotional, impulsive listener, nor a slowly-comprehending one. Not a single enthusiastic note of admiration escaped her; yet she was listening with her mind, and with her heart. The dilation of the world hid by her eye-lids, the quick-drawn breath, the suppressed sigh—these tokens, which he was quick to discern, were what most awakened the interest and curiosity of David Baldwin.
               The innocent wonder and faith with which she listened to the thoughts majestical floating along the smooth current of the poet's rhyme, the voiceless testimony of the child to her reception of those grand sentiments, was to him a most impressive testimony. While he read and observed, he was also contrasting this listener with his own sister, and with many another belle and beauty of their circle—contrasting her silence with their speech; for it was a silence not to be mistaken for stupidity or incapacity. He would hardly have been surprised to have heard her give utterance to any, the profoundest criticism, when he closed the book. She, however, was still silent.
               And that also, on the whole, pleased him. Presently, she timidly took the book, which he held loosely in his hand, and turned its pages, and began reading for herself with the slow, studious manner of one who feels her way, and is not certain of her sense of sight. When he had read for her, this painful and absorbed look was not on her face; she received the thought when he uttered it without let or hinderance—inhaled it with the breath by which he had projected it; but those printed characters, those fixed, unrelenting symbols were, as a medium, almost worthless to her. She could but feebly apprehend ideas by them, they fell so far short of communicating the life of which they were the index.
               The moment she took up the book of words she fell to plodding. When she heard the poet's ideas proclaiming themselves through the nobler book of Life beside her, by the human heart's agency in modulating its human voice, the sun gave not clearer light. It was all true of her that Mr. Leighton had affirmed; companionship and sympathy were everything to her; world-lore, world-wisdom, diffused as shining grains through great beds of gross unmanageable clay,—sands of gold in a vast gravelly tract, excited no desire, no covetousness after possession, in the child. Her nature was too dependent for its joy upon the sunlight, to bear patiently with an eclipse. As yet she was susceptible, through her misapprehensions of life, to the seeming withdrawal, occasioned by the intrusion of a cloud, and the phenomena of night; she was not patient with moon and starlight, she was not content, and what need that she should be? Forever shines the sun for eyes that can behold it. And the passing cloud, in the fullness of its time, drops down upon us, and in the richer, fairer growth that follows, when the soil has in it vitality, we understand why into the god's embrace the shadow of those better things meant for us should be taken up. While the covetous soul, that hides its treasure far away from all possible absorption, inevitably has its reward in barrenness and dwarfage.
            
            
               XLII.
               CLARENCE also came down into the garden. He too had perceived the occupant of the arbor from the balcony; had seen and remembered. But he did not hasten, did not go forward swiftly, allowing no impediment to his progress, looking neither to the right hand nor the left, as David had done, when he went toward the sleeping child. There may have been some significance to on-lookers of the spiritual world, in the fact that it was David, not Clarence, who had wakened her from that morning slumber which sheer force of sensuous beauty had impelled.
               
               He came in no straight line, yet his purpose was as clearly defined in the mind of Clarence, as those circles he described among the garden beds in his progress towards Susan.
               The dew was yet on the breast of the rose, in the heart of the lily, on the violet's purple robe, and he gathered with careful hand the most fair and perfect blossoms, and came thus with his gift to Susan.
               When he perceived that she was not alone, that David was with her, Clarence looked troubled, not joyful as when he had gathered the flowers. This fact did not escape David's notice, and by the hand that Clarence extended towards Susan, he drew his brother down upon the seat, between them.
               "Now," said he, "we might take our breakfast here; it would be almost equal to a pic-nic on the beach, only this sea of flowers is of course not to be mentioned in the same breath with the great sea of waves."
               "No," said Clarence, looking at Susan.
               "You say no, too, a thousand times over no, don't you Susan? You are no 'traitor to your causes,"' said David.
               Susan looked out upon the garden; there was a decided negation in her face as she did so; and she shook her head to make her opinion more apparent, but she said nothing.
               She loved this glowing fragrance better than that salt sea air; she loved these beds of moss, and myrtle, these painted piles of stones, ornamented with such tasteful and luxuriant growths, better than the rank grass trailing among and along the rocks; this sunshine on the radiant flowers better than that on those mighty unresisting waves; this repose better than that turbulence; this wealth of beauty than that waste of barrenness. She could grow here into some conformity with this beauty . . . but there . . . and the possible dying out of all fair remembrances of what she now saw around her! Often as she had read the words, the time was yet to come when Susan should ascertain the meaning of that assurance, "The kingdom is within you."
               It was not for the pride and splendor of the place, for the glory of it, that it was known abroad, and made its owner honorable among men, and gave his children ample place in paths where other men were cramped and crowded, struggling with and jostling against each other. Not because Isidore's way was made broad and clear for the full floating of her silken train, while other women trod upon each other, that they might come more definitely into her presence. Not for these things, but for the glory of the vision, for the healing power of the balm that grew there; for the flashing of the fountain in the sun, for the sweet singing inland birds; for the quiet and repose—for the wondrous drops of dew which fell at night into the hearts of those flowers.
               Parade and show vexed her, vexed and troubled her so much, that even now she was thinking how she might be rid of the dinner which loomed darkly in prospect of the evening horizon. It was not to be called beautiful by lips that could as readily frame weightier falsehoods, and blaspheme, and deny, and ruthlessly wound and offend; it was to be so, to feel that she was so! to move through those garden walks with graceful assimilation, not with large liberty through the sentinelled walks of society where the guardians themselves are traitorous and corrupt; it was to be in harmony with, to live in unity with, this fair outer world, which no mortal can ever be or do, who has not within him the resounding key-note that has brought himself into harmony with the life anthem. Intuitively she knew what some of the world's wisest men have overlooked, or misunderstood when the truth appealed pealed to them, that the life must needs be divine, before it can become veritably, grandly, human.
               "You like the flowers best, then . . . better than those magnificent waves and all that may be hidden under them," said David.
               "Yes," answered Susan; but faintly she said it—how would her mother listen to her word—would it offend her father?
               "Yet you always have the waves; we only have this garden half a year! think of that."
               "I like the flowers best," she repeated.
               "Beauty before strength, a true article of their creed," murmured David, soon after, as he rose and walked away. "Yet a botanist or a chemist might insist, and very forcibly, that there must be considerable strength in these frail looking things, when their seed and roots can sustain and destroy life, and make men lunatics. For once in my life I should like to confine myself to one side of an argument. Layard evidently thinks me frivolous: well, I may be that, but I can see my frivolity and his—his—what? He is a fine fellow. If I could for a single day live in his mood, I should think it a fair apology for having been born. Susan's silence is a wonderful feature. I should like to have the training of that child. But I should probably then exceed myself in fool-making. Strange how quick Clarence has been to perceive the difference between Isidore and Susan . . . Let me see,—what is the programme for the morning. Lunch at Don Juan's, where I must get myself wound up for the day . . . like an old clock. I should run down utterly but for that expedient. I shall have a talk with Silsey; and will the gods be gracious, and throw me in Miss Watson's way? Wheaton comes to dinner. Wheaton is a devilish fine fellow after all—he can see the good points of a picture as quick as any man I know. Wonder where Layard's little painter puts up? . . . I must have another talk with Layard; what an irresistible fellow he is! If I had gone abroad with him! Travel with such a man would have been immensely advantageous. How he did berate me; but he overvalues my powers quite as extravagantly. I wonder if I shall think that I wasted my youth, when I have travelled on forty years further . . . Whew! forty years to go through! Isidore will marry Wheaton I suppose, and I dare say it will devolve on me as a good citizen to marry . . . Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof . . . I never respected but one woman, and of course she looks on me as an idle, trifling boy; and I think now I've made a comment on myself that Layard would hail as a symptom of conversion . . . if the world were a better world . . . good enough for me and my mates, do you say? who says it? A sorry time the man would have now-a-days who attempted to be a fisher of men. Shoals of whales, and porpoises, sharks, and flounders, I grant—but men! they are rare as women! . . . If I could look at these flowers through that little monster's eyes, perhaps I should see what I never saw before. Crapo told me of a blind girl who smiled invariably when he took her flowers, even when they had no fragrance. This led him to experiment. He adorned her room with them—they had no odor perceptible to him, he said. Oh Crapo, you blockhead! as if that was not the amount of it! What sort of a nose have you got, you old dog, for the fragrance of flowers? You can scent wines afar off, and detect their distinctions, I grant. I have proved you there, old fellow. Your nose and my eyes are on a level, I think; you can smell to about as good purpose as I can see . . . Susan looked humbled when Clarence brought her the flowers. I should like to feel once as she looked, for the novelty of the thing! . . . As if she felt that they were too beautiful for the juxtaposition. She sees something in them that I never saw. I believe that . . . Because she has grown up without them . . . probably . . . I must look into it. No doubt—why any man, most royal Cesar, if he looks resolutely as yourself, can see the enticing vision, and hear the wonderful music of the flute it plays 'tother side the Rubicon! But, thou glorious Julius! did what followed pay you for the cost and pain of ferriage?"
            
            
               XLIII.
               WILL the reader accept some further illustrations, and wander with us about St. John's in quest of certain persons to whom allusion has been made already in these pages?
               Col. Wheaton we fortunately find at home; he is in his private apartment too; still more fortunate is that for us; and he is saying to himself just now, with considerable earnestness in his solitary debate, 'to be, or not to be.'
               But his countenance does not indicate that he has given himself over to any prodigious exercise of thought, nor indeed does it indicate that he has any great capacity for so doing. The forehead is too narrow and too low—the eyes are not clear—the nostril is too heavy—the lip too gross for any great intellectual power, or for a purely spiritual power of any decided exaltation. He is, notwithstanding, one of the handsomest, and by far the proudest man that strides through the St. John's drawing-room. But, I repeat, no great thinker—nor even given to frequent serious reflection; else, when he contracted those great debts, sureties of which lie before him in the form of numerous promises to pay, and the unreceipted bills of creditors, he would at least have wondered how they were ever to be liquidated.
               Col. Wheaton's appointments do not look like those of a man whose treasury is empty. The room he occupies, which has been his home for the last ten years, since his promotion, is furnished after a sumptuous fashion that proclaims magnificent, if not the most refined, taste. His ideas of comfort have had a careful development—nothing short of princely appointments satisfy him. The costly pictures on the walls, the elegant and rare volumes of engravings, the clock on the mantel, the single group of statuary, more costly than the whole mass to be found in the Baldwin Hall,—the bust of himself, the work of one of the most eminent of sculptors—the carpet, chairs, and chandelier, these things, crowded into the small room he occupies, give evidence of anything rather than a severe taste—indicate anything but a soldier-like contempt of the luxurious appliances of fashion. You would think the man hardly one to fight for freedom, so has he enslaved himself.
               It was not always so. Two of the best motives that could urge a man on in the calling once influenced him: he gave himself in his youth, which long since passed away, to the service of his country, and his mother. The army opened before him in his boyhood—no other profession did. The only brother of his mother was a soldier—he could advance the fortunes of his nephew in the army, but not elsewhere. The nephew bade fair to attain to a goodly stature—he had popular manners, and was of the very disposition to hold command over subordinates. So the uncle made interest for the boy, and the boy made interest for himself, and had risen from the ranks in the course of fifteen years, by force of his ambitious perseverance in military well-doing, to his present position.
               This was he, verging now towards his fortieth year, who started in life burdened—not heavily but lovingly—with the holiest obligation. Albeit he has risen to the command which he now occupies, and is at present in contemplation of an important commission with which none doubt that he will be entrusted; what better thing could be looked for than that he who had long ago lost sight of all filial obligation in the ascent of his star, who had forgotten her who was left in the darkness of lonely poverty, should at this mature period of manhood be pondering, in the midst of luxuries, immense impending debts, and the manner in which a man of honor might most easily satisfy them.
               "If a man must marry," he is thinking, "and if added to that, he must marry a simpleton, decidedly an amiable one would have the preference, other things being equal, as the men of sound argument have it. Silsey's little Violet, for instance—were, yes, in fact were quite an acquisition to one's fortunes—a treasure I should say. But a man must really think twice before he consents to put up with an ill-natured fool. Any man, I mean, who has the good fortune to be able to afford any thought at all about it. Not that Miss Baldwin is quite a fool, or altogether ill-natured. She has been spoiled—that, however, is a misfortune that can easily be remedied. There's not stamina there for any lengthened opposition. I made a transformation in Bill in less than an hour. He has been like a lamb ever since, though before I took him in hand he was just the fiercest beast that ever carried saddle-man. This young lady has some ways that must be seen to: though it will be difficult to instruct her when she has such barbarous taste as to dance a man down, as she did me the other night. Silsey manages well. But he is a philosopher—hum—hum. And love was a positive episode in his career. He can look back, and lay the finger on an actual point of time, and say, Then I was infatuated.
               "I could like Miss Watson. She has a soldier-like intrepidity of character—straightforward—full of courage to stand fire; and withal, is full of plots, and schemes and stratagems as any general ever was. Great pity that the men who can understand such women are just the men who cannot afford to marry them! No doubt, she could endure starvation, but I could not . . . But this is really too cold-blooded. I don't see, though, why I should bother myself in this sort of way, beating about the bush, when I am perfectly aware that I shall end by reaching to the branch where the bird is perched. She comes nearer and nearer—how can I help it? She is singing her life away, trying to convince me that there's some music in her voice. No doubt of it—if she would only leave me to the belief, without troubling herself to prove it . . . If she were a little less devoted . . . Let me see. Twenty thousand dollars out, and not a particularly good investment either!" The Colonel's eyebrows were arched beyond their usual curve as he glanced about the room. A strange smile was on his lip. He was seeking amusement in his own way—which was rather a singular one—tantalizing himself, and perplexing himself with difficulties, the remedy of which was in his hands. "Silsey says I'm extravagant, and reproaches me for my epicurean enormities. Now, Epicurus fed on bread and water, and I'll be cashiered if I'm guilty of any such abomination. These pictures might possibly bring at auction a tenth of the price I paid for them. Perhaps I was a little too fast about the pictures, but what is a man's taste good for if it is not to be indulged? I should like Silsey, or any other man, to answer me that. Everything that's here must go. A tremendously fortunate thing it will be if I get the order to march, for these wretches cannot be staved off much longer. I verily believe they would have made a seizure before this—the devil himself seems to have been in league with 'em along back—if I had not kept the rascals at a distance. It is not every man that has the ability to look down his creditors. The hungry wolves may divide the spoil according to their liking. Old Baldwin—" The prospect suggested by the name was sufficiently exciting to send the Colonel from the table, and his night-supper, striding up and down the room, humming, "See, the conquering hero comes," varying the tune occasionally with bars of "Hail Columbia! happy land,"—a national anthem which came with peculiar grace from him, as one of the country's defenders.
               It was long after midnight when the Colonel's meditations came to a conclusion. Sitting down then at the table, from which he had removed bottle and goblet, he spread open his portfolio, and then and there penned, and three times amended, the letter which the next day was to lie in the bosom of Isidore Baldwin.
               It was a pure source for the emanation of a love-letter! but, tell me, was the destination for which it was intended purer?
               Isidore Baldwin was not guilty of the immorality of contracting debts which she had no means and no idea of paying, it is true. She had not been guilty of murder, as the Colonel, who slew the hopes of his mother—the waters of pollution had not laved her mortal frame; but I say unto you, that this letter of love that he wrote her on this night, even with such thoughts and such designs as are above recorded—this letter was quite pure enough to lie in that fair lady's bosom; more meet than holier words had been, were those false words that took such form of passion and of fashion, which she was to read with her lips and her eyes, and to repeat in her heart.
            
            
               XLIV.
               PURE-HEARTED, loving Violet Silsey had been slandered and profaned by the rude mention Wheaton made of her in his reflections on the leap for life he was about to make.
               It was not of her that Silsey wrote in that paper, a scrap of which Violet had read, and which so much had troubled her.
               "Inwardly or outwardly it holds true. Unhappiness comes only when a good life is united to a worthless one—a living to a dead one—a wakened to a sleeping one. When one is quickened to fly into heaven, while the wings of his mate trail heavily in the dust. When a man finds himself in that situation, keenly alive to the fact, unable to make it other than it is, all he can do is—" and that was the burden of the fragment which an ill wind had blown to her.
               All he can do is what? If she might but know that! but she did know. All that he can do is to withdraw himself, and live alone, and keep his great thoughts to himself—work in his chamber in solitude, and forget her! . . . . .
               An evil spirit whispered this to Violet, Silsey's young wife, as with her foot upon the cradle she swayed her sleeping infant, and read again those lines.
               The second anniversary of their marriage had just passed, and all the joy of that union was lying in the cradle. So thought the wife, as she looked down, and bent down, and laid her childly face against the little child's, and kissed the eyelids which veiled the wondrous blue eyes beneath them.
               She was barely eighteen, this young creature who had contrived to make herself so miserable, thinking of the paper she had read, and of the prospect before her. Silsey had promised to love her as long as she lived—and it was but two years since he had promised! If this was to be the way of it, he would be altogether free of his vow very soon—for he had made his love of so much consequence to her, how was she going to live without it? In her bitter musing Violet even forgot to jog the cradle.
               Of course he had written that about himself—it was perhaps a letter of complaint to some one of his old friends whom she never heard of—certainly it could not have been meant for her eyes. The state of things was bad enough before this new revelation. She hardly believed it could be worse. But there was something to hope for then, now nothing. She could conjecture, and be miserable, and still hope then—but now, where was the use of conjecture? and hope was gone—the misery alone was left. What was there to hope for? She was no fit mate for any but his leisure hours—when he soared aloft her wings must trail in the dust. He used to call her his darling little simpleton, but then his arm was around her, and his talk was broken by fond kisses; the arm was withdrawn now, the talk suspended, the kisses withheld; and with a threatening sound that word simpleton ran in the wife's memory.
               He had tired of her. All along she had a foreboding that a time would come when this would be true of her and of him. She had no other thought but him, and he, oh he had a thousand thoughts beside her. He was ambitious; and ambition was mightier than love, and a separate thing from love altogether—it had no reference to her whatever.
               Slowly and sadly the wife went over the ground of her own character and capacities. As she had never done before she surveyed herself—and she acquitted him!
               "I have no genius. I can do nothing wonderful. He used to say I had a pure, sweet voice, but it is nothing. There are such splendid singers now-a-days my voice sounds poor and weak in comparison. If I could do anything that he would like! When I went and sold my diamonds, and gave him the money to pay that odious woman who tormented him so about our board when he was expecting his money, and it did n't come, every day, he scolded me for doing that, but yet he took me in his arms and kissed me, and smiled, and thought there was something in me worth loving, I am sure. But now I have n't any more diamonds to sell. There's no danger, I think, of my being scolded in that delightful way again . . . If I could talk grand, like Miss Watson—he thinks her so wise . . . I am afraid of her. And Silsey is afraid too—he treats her, I mean, with great deference, as though she belonged to some royal family. I never understand her, but it all sounds very wonderful. Silsey knows that I don't. I told him so once when he praised her, and he looked so surprised—and he looked displeased too. And it is since then, I think, that things get worse and worse. I don't know anything, only that I'm very unhappy. I am like a drag to him—creeping along in the dust so, when he hates it, and wants to get above it—and I hate it too. I'm sure if there's anything in the world I hate it's that. I shall never have wings that will fly till I am dead, and then, if I am an angel, who knows? I don't suppose I shall live long—everybody in the house looks at me as if I were doomed, and I know they are all pitying me—I wish they would not; how can they understand Silsey? it is as much as I can do . . . He would be happier, poor man, and better off this minute, if he had left me where he found me. Not that I want to be there, only if I were quite sure about it I think I would be willing . . . I ought to be very indignant; I ought to tell him that I might have done better by myself than live with him here in such a dreary place, left alone so much to think how neglectful he is, and how miserable I am. I ought to make things different. But I cannot. If I went into his study to say so to him, he would very likely think I was deranged, and put me in a lunatic asylum, or what is just as bad, would grow colder and colder, and—I might as well be dead. Besides, how could I say it? I could not if it would make everything different from what it is, and I was sure beforehand that it would.
               . . He is not to blame because I am so foolish and ignorant. I have read in a great many books about wise men loving weak women. I never was jealous. I like to hear him and Miss Watson talk together, though I don't understand a word of it, or not much of it at least. I am glad of all the friends he makes—how can he help making them? and they are all among wise and good people, too . . . But," and with a sigh she bent her head upon her hand, and looked down into the cradle, "I am only eighteen, and if he does not love me now, if he thinks me foolish and trifling, oh! what is coming afterward? I am foolish—I always was, but then he knew it in the beginning, and loved me in spite of it. Perhaps I am too sober-minded. But he don't like giddy people; I would study—but I am all the while so tired, and my head aches when I try to think hard . . . I am too silent maybe, but if I speak, he does not half the time seem to hear me; and if he does hear, he gives me some short answer that makes me feel ashamed that I am such a woman as can be answered so. He said: 'I never hear you singing now, Violet; isn't your nest built in the sun?' I did not quite understand him, but every day after that I sang, and sometimes there was not much heart in it, and my heart is so weak, it flutters so! I sang every day till I heard him talking with Miss Watson about the street singer, and how much such sounds disturbed him; and ever since then I have been afraid that I should disturb him too . . . I am very well named, I think. I am Violet down by the root of the tree—but the tree has grown so high above me! If he were sick, he would need me . . . something else may happen that will make me of some use—I will bring up little Viola, his child; he will see sometime that I was worth something to him. I am very wicked to complain so much."
               The young mother's face was turned towards her child while she pondered so seriously: as she ceased speaking, a broad ray of sunlight, streaming through the window, fell on the baby's face.
               Violet started up to shut out the too dazzling light, but it had wakened the little one; full of heaven the blue eyes lifted to her mother, the tiny hands and arms outstretched towards her in a gleeful recognition. A crimson flush, too deep and warm for any but joyful emotion, overspread the mother's face, as on her knees she dropped beside the humble cradle, and raised the little one; and then, forgetful of her late sorrowful meditation, a gay song burst from Violet's lips. Hardly beyond childhood herself, it was not difficult for her to take the one step needful, and she was within its magic circle once more.
            
            
               XLV.
               BUT the singing ended with the conclusion of the first verse. And the tremor of the heart began again. Indeed, it was not without a deal of resolution and self-subjection that Violet went through even that solitary stanza, for with the first line Silsey had risen, and, till she finished it, he paced his narrow study. When the sound of the last line died away she heard him go to the window and open it, and, for a long time after, a dead silence reigned in either room.
               At length there was a rustling of papers—a re-closing of the window, and the spell which seemed to bind the mother was released, her little thin hand played with the fair curls of the child who was again slumbering, this time on her bosom—lulled by that sweet song which had also not been without result elsewhere.
               The door of communication between the two rooms, occupied, the one by Silsey as his study, the other by Violet for her nursery—these two comprising, not comprised in, their suite of apartments, for the house in which they lived was a boarding-house; this door of communication between the rooms opened, and Silsey, pausing on the threshold an instant, struck perhaps by the heavy shadows of the room, or by the central group of the scantily-furnished apartment, went in.
               "I have been thinking, Violet," that it is getting so warm here, you and our little one should be going into the country. This is most dismal! You are losing all the beautiful summer here in the dust.
               The kindness of his voice, his manner as he bent forward and looked at the sleeping infant—'our little one'—this proof that he did think of them, so overpowered Violet, taking as all this proof did, but one hue and one form, that, though she could keep back the floods of tears, she could not modulate at will the voice that spoke, to any less urgent entreaty than, "Oh Silsey, don't send us away." Silsey did not look displeased at this—he did not turn away in silence, but said, she almost thought that it was tenderly, as he sat down beside her,
               "But dear Violet, you are not well—you need better air, and the sight of the green fields, and our Viola needs them too. She will grow up a poor puny little creature if we fail to look to it now. This is the time, while she is so young. Any physician would tell us so. But common sense tells us so too. Now my little nurse darling, you are not going to play stupid. I thought your voice sounded just now as if it needed strengthening—fresh air is better than bitters—the best tonic in the world is—"
               "My voice never was very loud, Silsey;" be it here observed there was a little pride at the bottom of this hasty reminder. Well she recollected how he used to praise that 'sweet, low voice.' Neither had he forgotten, as the very quietness of his next observation proved.
               "That was the reason why I loved it so well."
               "Did you love it, Silsey?" she exclaimed quickly, making a rapid motion with her hand as if she would grasp his, so that he should not go until he assured her of the truth. But the immediate frustration she herself brought upon this purpose, and her own succeeding words, told him better than any other way or word could have told, what was passing in her mind.
               "Did you love it, Silsey? oh, there, what have I said!"
               Her love and her fear were before him in a new light. Was he careless of the one emotion, did he despise the other?
               "It is the sweetest of all voices," he said; "teach it to our little Viola, dear wife."
               "And you will teach her to be wise then, wont you? Don't let her be so foolish as her mother—make her wise, Silsey," pleaded Violet, half fearful even of the strange new confidence she felt speaking these words for her hope had out-run her conviction.
               "No," he answered, "I shall leave that to her mother also. Her mother shall teach her wisdom out of her own good heart."
               
               "Oh, Silsey"—but, could she ask him if he meant it, when he stood looking so gravely, so earnestly, so tenderly upon her? Was there now anything that could make her afraid? Though he did not kiss her, though he spoke in this brief way, "Viola's father would have his little daughter in all things like her mother. He is greatly worthy, if he is worthy to call them his."
               "Silsey . . . . I never dared to think that you would speak so to me again. I am not wise, oh, you don't half know how foolish I am. And I have been very wicked in my thoughts. I don't know anything except to love you and the baby. I cannot talk with you; and I cannot keep up with your thinking. Perhaps you made a great mistake Silsey. Oh, how dreadful it must be to you! I can't help it, don't be sur—surprised. I must say it out; it kills me to think it by myself so, all the time. You should have married a wise woman who knew everything."
               "Stop, Violet. I would as soon have married a—a—hippopotamus. You are as you say very wicked in your thoughts. I will not forgive you for thinking such cruel things. You are my heaven on earth, believe that—"
               Awed, humbled, and confounded by these words, Violet could not answer. Still she kept back her tears—she knew he liked not to see her weep.
               I'll go whenever you think best, dear Silsey," she faltered.
               Now he bent down and kissed her, and said softly—"Will you? Then I must go and reflect about it, for such a thing is not to be settled in a minute, you see." And so saying, he hastily left the room.
               Silsey was as old again as his wife. Her influence over him, and his over her, was easily understood by those who thoroughly knew the man—there were not many who did, but Col. Wheaton who had pronounced upon him, only knew him as he appeared in the clubroom room, or at an occasional midnight supper. Among the club members he was noted as one of the best talkers; his extraordinary conversational powers seemed to dwarf his other faculties, but when necessity compelled him to their exercise, they were found in the full vigor of a large, strong growth.
               He married his wife on an impulse—impulsively he loved her, or rather the exhibition of this love was altogether an impulsive one. Days in which he seemed forgetful of, or regardless of her existence would go by, and the bitter weed of doubt which sprung up, large and strong, for the shelter of any evil bird that would rest upon its branches, would again wither and die down to the root in the heat of some assurance like this above recorded.
               But he had never called her his kingdom of heaven before! The designation somewhat shocked her, she could not quite understand what he meant by it; but she could not mistake the look of his eyes as he said it, so serious and grand was their expression. It was a look that humbled, and yet uplifted her. He had not spoken in jest—he did find in her something to love. He did not repent about the wise woman, it was strange that she could be so dear to him, yet it was true—true, even though he understood so well that she knew nothing except to love.
               "Now, Violet," she said, playing meanwhile with the little one who was lying wakeful and merry on her knee, "Now Violet you must be good, you must not trouble him, you must be happy in your heart, and then you will smile just at the right time, always at the right time, and no other. You know Violet, what he thinks of a face that is always smiling, where the look is put on. He would rather see you serious sometimes, and then if he wants to speak to you he will have something to say, you know. He can ask you 'What makes you so serious to-day Violet?'"
               
               The tears, long repressed, began to fall; they fell upon the baby's sunny face. "I'll just be quiet, and never think another wicked thought in my life. But—then to call me his kingdom of heaven! We never look for that as we should. Nobody does that ever I saw in my life. And I do not know exactly how to look myself—and—but I wish he had not said that . . . Violet, you said just now you would never be afraid. And so I won't!—Oh, it will be so sweet in the country! To be in the country, and watch you, little darling Viola when you look at a garden of flowers for the first time in all your blessed life; to see you look about, wondering so where the dear sound comes from, when you hear the birds here, and there, and everywhere in all the branches of the trees; and then to walk about with you in my arms in the woods, and let you see the squirrels, and everything. Oh Viola, it will be heaven there, and you and I—no, you, not I, for you never have wicked thoughts; oh, how I pray that such bad thoughts may never come into your heart! You, down there in the country, my blessed little Viola, 'our daughter,' you'll be just like an angel, and it will be heaven all true—truer than that was that Silsey said. Oh, to hear him saying that to me! I wish Miss Watson could have heard it too." Even that name she could now pronounce without a grave look, without the pang to which her young heart had become so accustomed during these past two years. "Baby Viola, how do I look to your eyes, I wonder? I am your mother, you know. Do I look great, and far-off, and wonderful, as your father does to me sometimes? or do you feel me in your heart always, when you sleep, and when I hide out of your sight a minute in play, and you smile so when I come again? Am I always in your heart, my little one? I am your mother—that is my place. You must give it to me. It must be mine always, daughter Viola. We are going to the country, but you must not love anything you see there better than you do me. And when you are no longer a child—when you grow up and are what your mother is now, only a great deal wiser, for Silsey must help me; he must teach you so that you shall be wise, Viola—I shall always know you through and through. I shall know when you are sad—my eyes will be very quick to see; but you must love me always too, and whenever you look at me, you must let your eyes tell me so, over and over. I never shall be tired hearing it, for love is everything, little one. Ask Miss Watson, and she will tell you so; and everybody that is good will do the same. Love! why, Viola, love is everything indeed."
            
            
               XLVI.
               THE Silsey's rooms looked out upon a dead-wall of brick. They had no prospect. Two little back rooms they were, in the third story of a large boarding-house.
               In the fourth range, above the hall of the third, was a small room lighted by a solitary window. This room was occupied by Miss Watson, the lady with the flowers in her hand, who stands before Violet's door, and waits for admission—the tall lady in black, who has such singular taste, whose habits are so peculiar, "of whom," say boarders, "young Mrs. Silsey is so jealous, poor thing!"
               "Ah, but you must not thank me yet. I mean that you shall pay the full price for the flowers," she is saying, while Violet rapturously dances the bouquet before her baby's eyes, and with her heart and voice says fine things to Miss Watson.
               And so speaking, the lady assists herself to a chair, and the sound of her voice does not bring Silsey from his study.
               She has a majestic presence, as contrasted with the delicate, drooping figure of the much more youthful Violet. She is of a less sensitive, more independent temperament; needs not so much the props and stays of affectionate forethought. She has a strong, masculine habit of thought, men say, when they wish to flatter her. She has a broad vision; can plan, and direct, and govern her own affairs, and those of other people, if there be a need. She is quick in her perceptions—a sharp and discriminating observer of psychological phenomena—is at home among profoundest speculations—has generous and quick sympathies to extend to every philosopher who promises, or endeavors to redeem the world—though her faith in his labor, her tears at his crucifixion, might not be taken for granted.
               The precise estimate she has formed of our Violet does not appear from her manner of address—perhaps she is still hesitating in its formation. It may be that she is not yet quite decided in regard to the relation this wise man and artless woman sustain towards each other.
               "Mrs. Silsey," she says, "I am going in a day or two to my place in the country. When I went down this morning I felt guilty to think I had stayed away so long; I brought these flowers from the garden to show you—they are somewhat faded. You must go down with me and gather them for yourself. The city is quite intolerable. I have engaged a woman to go and make the house habitable. Will you come with your baby and make it bright and cheerful? The cottage is not what it once was—quite dilapidated—but the river wanders by, as irresistible a vagrant as ever : always on the go; and there are some fine groves on the hill-side. And I doubt if you ever heard as many songs as I heard in a half hour this morning—the woods are full of birds. You need the change; what do you say?"
               Wonderful voice and argument that she had! Violet's prejudices vanished like the early dew before them; her surprise was turned into an actually grateful response. Silsey would be so pleased! and then, living for a few weeks with this lady in her own house, listening to her and talking with her, who could tell but that she might also end in being wise! . . . And the vision of the water, and the sky, and the woods, and the singing-birds, rose clear before her mind: it was all very astonishing—incredible it would have seemed to her an hour ago—incredible not only that Miss Watson should have given her an invitation, but still more so that she should have felt such satisfaction in view of it. But Silsey's word had already made her happy—is not that the all-sufficient explanation for the reader—though it did not occur to Violet's mind?
               She would not have listened now as she did a few nights ago to that long conversation between Silsey and Miss Watson about passional catalysis, not one word of which could she understand any better than if it had been carried on in a foreign tongue, which made her so unhappy and so conscious of her ignorance. Even while she told her visitor of Silsey's recent proposition that she should go into the country, she courageously reminded herself of her past fears and rising to prove herself—her courage and her confidence—and there may also have been a latent wish that Miss Watson, who evidently looked upon her with something like compassion, might understand her happiness; rising with some, perhaps all, of these thoughts, Violet went to Silsey's study door, and called her husband.
               At her call he came, and it is proper that the reader should now behold him as a person. We, therefore, will turn our eyes towards that opening door, with Violet and Miss Watson.
               We know well what the wife sees in him. He is the thought of her life. He is her destiny. Whether he should be—whether he is aware of it—the fact has not to do with either of these considerations. He is her fate; he cannot direct himself and his fortunes as he can her will and hopes. He cannot in the conscious and most strenuous exercise of his powers, build for himself as he unconsciously enacts for her. She is his heart. He called her so, not only in her hearing when he was enthralled by her innocence, and the purity of her character, by her high, spiritual grace and loveliness. He calls her so now, silently to himself, but not often with his lips. She is his heart. But Silsey just now is aiming with a prodigious energy of purpose after success in life; and, slow as he might have been to admit the fact, he nevertheless well knew, no one knew it better, that in such efforts a man can readily do without a heart.
               It might be equally true of him to say that affectionate fears for the health and safety of his wife and child had urged their removal to the country, or, that he wished to feel himself absolutely alone, entirely unfettered. For this might or it might not be a day of warfare with the man; his affections or his intellect might be in the ascendant. They never were harmonious co-workers.
               Violet looks up and sees, what she never dares to call her own: she never claims him, even in her most secret thoughts, as she claims the baby in her arms. She is proud of him. When sometimes she ventures, oftener when he sleeps than in his waking, to lay back the locks of hair which fall negligently along, and so much conceal his prodigious forehead, she lays her hand back on her own straight, smooth brow, and wonders how it ever happened that she should be his wife. She always sees what others rarely see, and yet at times the dullest eyes can see it, the rare beauty of his face. At times it is haggard and wretched, but a quickening, high thought can spiritualize it into perfect grandeur. When he held his child the first time in his arms never will Violet forget the divine light that filled his countenance with glory! He has an erect, imposing figure, a control in speech over those whom he addresses by his intense personal authority, and personal application of remark. Violet is well persuaded that he is everywhere as great a man as he is in the sphere of her affections.
               Miss Watson beholds, as he approaches, a character that somewhat baffles her—a man of large thoughts, and large schemes, apparently—she takes these for granted, or rather as a logical deduction, from what she does perceive and understand. Independent of his personation she beholds him; to her his human dignity, strength, and beauty, are abstractions. It is the idea, not the embodiment, with which she interests herself.
               Her estimate, accordingly, runs thus:
               "Impassioned, or capable of becoming so—greatly so on occasion: not passionate, too strong for such weakness—fairly balanced thus. Despises and condemns the world, but does his utmost, or will, if this new beginning means anything—and he has sacrificed too much for the beginning to doubt it—to find favor and advancement among those whom he condemns. This argues one of two facts—a very base or a very great character. He is aware of divinity within him—at times it would almost seem that he has united with his instincts to secure its overthrow. If his wife were not what she is . . . I could endure her very well for the sake of finding him out. But she is a very pretty and curious little piece of mosaic herself. Knowledge is inseparable from penalties. He knows how weak she is, or thinks he does— he never goes beyond anecdote and sentiment with her. He told me once that when he came from his study he took a walk through Violet's heart, and it refreshed him more than a long stroll through woods and fields. But that was a year ago. She is precisely what she was then, only paler and weaker—not a bit wiser, and he seemed to dread the sophisticating effects of a little learning on her, I thought. Does he derive as much refreshment now, I wonder? He would have me believe it, evidently . . . But, whether to convince me that his experiment is not a failure when he knows it is, and suspects I perceive it also? . . . When a man has once opened his eyes, and taken a fair view of things, he may close them again, but can he forget what he has seen? St. John is the only person of whom such a supposition may be received as a probability—other men retain, as he probably did not, some recollection of their apocalyptic visions. If the presence of Violet has become anything short of refreshment to him, I shall have her at the Elms quite as long a time as I can afford, no doubt. Dr. Borg insists that she will fill a niche in some obscure corner of my 'gallery of portraits' when I build another book."
               Silsey, who before Violet called him had recognized Miss Watson's voice, had laid aside his pen, that he might the better listen to it, perhaps. When the call came, he arose.
               "We shall now finish this affair of the passional catalysis," he murmured; "'a brave man is never more courageous than when he fears he is afraid.' Verily thou art apt with thy consolations, most notable poet and philosopher, else I should scorn to suspect what I now valiantly confess, that I terribly fear and quake as I confront and subject myself to the influence of this odylic phenomenon, who seems to claim me as her responsive sive echo. If there's a penalty to pay, now who shall pay it?"
               Asking that of himself, Silsey paused a moment before his unopened door. Between the door and him a vision stood: the face was paler, and more wan the figure, than he had before seen it, and Violet's eyes seemed no longer the open gate of the heavenly kingdom; he could not see the gate for the heavy lids that pressed remorseless upon them.
               He smiled back too scornfully upon the vision—he laid his hand too ruthlessly upon the latch—he went out with too commanding a bearing—he said to himself too mockingly, "A very decent sentimental poet was spoiled in my making, but I believe I have sworn to make something different of myself."
               "Will you trust your children with me;" asked Miss Watson, as he opened the door and advanced into the room. "We have been discussing the point, and call on you to make a decision. Only beware, if it clashes with ours. I am going to carry Violet and Viola off with me to the Elms."
               "And what will you do with me?" asked Silsey, his eyes, however, directed from the lady he addressed to the beaming face of his wife, who did not quite dare betray all her joy, because she was not yet altogether assured of his sympathy. Violet met his glance and answered his question, "Oh, will you go with us, Silsey?"
               "Not at all," remarked Miss Watson immediately. "There's no room for you in my house. I can by no means ensure a royal reception for the two little Violets even. You would be compelled to take refuge in the boat-house, or root-house, or in the dove-cot, if you should chance to come down, and have the misfortune to be left behind by the return train. No, sir. I by no means second Mrs. Violet's invitation. You must stay behind, and take your fate."
               "Is there a telegraph between St. John's and the Elms, then?"
               "Not that I have heard."
               "I will venture to assert that will be the truth of it this summer, if you can persuade my wife to desert me." He glanced towards the young creature, whose eyes since he came into the room had not once removed from him. Seating himself again beside her, he took the baby in his arms.
               "No, Silsey," she said, "I think I'll not go."
               "But why not, Violet?"
               "To leave you here alone, so? and you will miss the baby so much. Look, how sweet her smile is! You will never know when to stop working if we go away, and you have no house to keep, no children to take care of."
               The pain she already felt at the mere prospect of parting, betrayed itself in the look of her eyes. Since their marriage-day she and Silsey had not been separated.
               Miss Watson was placing the flowers she had brought in a vase which she herself took down from the mantel and filled with fresh water; but she heard, and remembered these words; saw and understood these passing looks.
               "Never mind about that, Violet; though Miss Watson is the most barbarously inhospitable woman I ever heard of, she has brought upon herself more than she wots of. In the first place, her house will be haunted by the postman, and Violet, you must answer all my letters, every one. Now just see her punishment for parting man and wife! And then we shall otherwise be in such a state of communication as will upset some of her pet theories."
               Miss Watson listened, and to herself she said, "Now, he is avenging himself on account of my too keen in sight; he could not have rendered me assistance more thoroughly to the purpose. I should thank him for that. Let me see if he appreciates the fact." Aloud she said, with her usual slow and courteous speech:
               "Next week, then, I shall receive my hostages."
               "Hostages!" repeated Silsey, caught by the word; and poor Violet looked intensely mystified, and yet intensely relieved withal, that Miss Watson had said something that even Silsey was in doubt about. Silsey did then stand between her and Miss Watson. Not Miss Watson between her and Silsey. Ah! not jealous, Violet? Ay, not jealous, reader.
               "Yes, hostages. Sureties from nature that the summer will be more than usually productive, unless the frost comes late and destroys the fruit, or some other blighting influence falls on vegetation."
               "Preserve my children from the frost and blight, and I will thank you."
               "You will, indeed?" There was much in this question, but it did not, apparently, get further than the ear of Silsey, and he replied:
               "Yes, convince Violet that health is precious above rubies—commend her to the woods and fields, I will not be jealous of her love for the sun. Nature, who presides at the Elms, is rich—tell her that my poor children are eminently worthy of her kindliest favor."
               "Preeminent sophist! how aptly he defies insight by the showiest confidence! He does not believe in me, fain would persuade himself so, and to convince me, which he more than half suspects he shall fail to do, puts himself to all this pain and trouble. It is not my theory whose overthrow he anticipates, but his own."
               So reflected, while he spoke, Miss Watson. But when she spoke, it was to say:
               
               "I promise you they shall come back blushing with the kisses of the sun. You will see the difference between them and violets that grow in the shade. But I have a world of work to do before I go. This gossip is a fatal hinderance. Good-morning, my friends."
               And so she went out.
            
            
               XLVII.
               "ONE thing," thought Silsey, when again shut up in his study; "it is vastly more comfortable, even if the fascination be less, for a man to have a Violet in his garden than a plant about which he knows nothing, and which defies analysis. A world of Watsons for one Violet?" and he plunged into the midst of a chemical investigation. But presently the energy of thought and action relaxed, his eyes wandered from his table, his instruments, his books, with more of speculation in them than these appliances of thought and discovery could account for, or, at least, with a different kind of speculation . . . He may have been defiant of, or victorious in his faith.
               Miss Watson, in her room above, where she quietly occupied herself in preparations for her departure, mused:
               "He dreads innovation. Nothing would just now afford him so little satisfaction as companionship or sympathy in his fights. He would achieve alone. There self is all in all. But-when he is wearied, and descends for lower enjoyment, he wants something at hand that can pleasantly be confounded with other beautiful natural objects. It is not a soul that he cares for. He is one, and the world ministers to him. The grass smooth and pleasant under his feet, that singing bird yonder, those flowers I left below, are one with Violet . . . Is this true? If it be, she is safe for the present. She is apparently satisfied just now. If the time comes when he will not weary of soaring, and will have no necessity for descending! Now a man who grows and expands under the culture of experience, must finally come to this measure of self-sustained strength. With long looking at the sun, and long soaring through the upper air, will he come down to grasses?"
               But Violet sang softly to herself a better song, a simpler hymn than these.
               "If she thought me so very simple, she would not want me down there in the country with her; it would be such a bore. She spoke in such a friendly way! and I always liked her manner. How glad Will and Lucia will be when I tell them about it! She likes me maybe, and respects me, I should n't wonder even at that now, because I am Silsey's wife, and she knows that he is a great man, as well as I know it. I shall certainly improve down there, and then he is going to write me ever so many letters! He will sit by his table just as he does now, and he will be thinking of me then, and will write me his thoughts, his beautiful thoughts, for he never puzzles me by saying such deep things to me as he does sometimes to Miss Watson. Viola, you shall share the letters with me; I'll read them all aloud to you, every word of them—you are every bit as wise as your mother—did you hear what she said, Viola, about the river? I see the house—it stands, a little cottage she called it, and so small that there's no room for Silsey in it! How little it must be—but we shall see about the room . . . And there are vines all around it—of course there must be, she is so fond of flowers, and between the river and the house there, stand all those groves of trees, and when we get up in the morning, Viola, we shall have sweet glimpses of the water from our window. There's a vine growing over the window, you know, my little bird—perhaps it is a honey-suckle. Yes! it is a honey-suckle; and then we shall have humming-birds flying around us on their fairy-like wings, and perhaps some day I may lay you on the grass, Viola, the soft, long, warm grass, and go chasing after them as I used to do when I was young—before I got to be eighteen, and had a little daughter to take care of, and a great, splendid husband to be proud of! We must grow strong and rosy down there, baby, do you hear? and when father comes, we will surprise him with our good looks—oh, won't we! . . . My little girl, what is going to become of you? When you grow up, will you go travelling away on a long journey, as your mother did, and meet somebody by the way who will look into your eyes just as I am doing now, and just as happened to me; you will not take it so quietly, Viola, as you do now—and somebody will tell you he loves you, and why, and how much, and will you love him too, more and more every day of your blessed life? I'll never let you go, my child. But that's selfish—don't look so at me, Viola—I want you some day to be just as happy as your mother is—but then . . ." There we for the present leave Violet, troubling herself with that self-accusation, and the prospect of the baby's marriage! If they make their escape into the country before we see them again we will certainly all rejoice, all, excepting perhaps Dr. Borg, the man who hid himself under a pair of blue spectacles, and adored Miss Watson, who was "such an extraordinary woman!"
            
            
               XLVIII.
               THE first half hour since breakfast at the Hall had not yet expired. Mr. Baldwin, whose heart was resolutely set upon dazzling the imagination, and captivating the affections of Susan, and whose resources as an entertainer were compassed by the office of exhibitor, anxious to confer all honors on his little guest, invited her up to a survey of his cabinet of shells. Though he was no conchologist, his love of all marine productions was excessive, and he had spared no expense in making his collection. Soon after he had thrown open the cabinet he was called away, and Susan was left alone; and she, instead of pursuing knowledge in a manner that would have secured the approbation of Mr. Leighton, very soon after Mr. Baldwin's leave, turned the lock on the cabinet, and strayed away into the drawing-room.
               The secret of this movement lay in her suspicion that Clarence was in his room, and would come out and find her there. Her impulse was to avoid him. She did not fear him, but something she feared! She knew not what, nor even that she did fear.
               Down the stairs the little figure glided, and presently was nestling in the drawing-room alcove, and spreading open before her a portfolio of engravings, and proceeding to examine them again by the daylight, for they had roused many thoughts last night, when David turned them for her one by one.
               No doubt, when there came a sound of voices so near that she looked up startled, and half rose, as if to withdraw in some direction or other—though in which was the question, for she could not tell whence the sound came,—no doubt she should have resolved the point, should have taken herself away. But, instead of doing this, she sat down again. She should have stopped her ears then. No! she heard every word that found its way through the intervening space.
               It was Isidore's voice, saying:
               
               "Oh, David, are you here? I have looked for you high and low. Where is our visitor?"
               "Father is showing her the shells."
               "And Clarence?"
               "Is in her neighborhood, no doubt."
               "Put down your book, will you, and do tell me how long this dispensation is to last. Father has been talking about Harlem, and some people, Chiltons—we saw them at the beach you know, a boy and girl—and we have to go and visit them! But I have managed it so that we have one day of grace, at least. Colonel Wheaton promised last night to come to dinner, and you had better ask Mr. Silsey and Dr. Borg—though I hate him; but the colonel likes him. And what shall we do with that little—? I shall believe anything they tell us about the monsters of the deep after this. I always fancied that mermaids were—"
               "Mermaids!" said David.
               "And such owl eyes! I declare they frighten me."
               "The owl was sacred to Minerva," said David.
               "Minerva?" hesitated Isidore.
               "Yes, my dear. Minerva was the goddess of wisdom, you remember. I wish I could make you acquaint. As to Susy, as Clarence affectionately calls her, she was brought up among the Greeks and Romans—has all their bravery—yes, and their grace too—laugh as you will. I can see her with your eyes, an awkward little scarecrow; but I can see her with my own beside. My sight is bad enough, but it is better than yours. So don't talk any more nonsense this morning, if you please. A regiment of young girls like Susan, marshalled by a lady like Miss Cammon, would put men and women like us to disastrous confusion and fight, I verily believe. Look not so angry—I put myself in with you."
               "I have sent Bennett down town. Presently you will see Minerva dressed like a Christian."
               "That's quite right. Sit down here now, and let me read to you some pretty conceits of a poet."
               "In the morning! when I have heaps of work to do? I should really like to oblige you, but you choose such odd times to ask favors."
               "Go, then," said David; and she went.
               A bitter smile came over David's face as he closed the volume, and laid it on the library table; 'favors,' 'odd times,' 'work,' he repeated. And for a moment he seriously considered the charge Layard had brought against him, that it was he, and such as he, that fostered such growth in women as this which, in his sister, he despised and wondered at.
               "If I believed it," he concluded, "I would go hang myself."
               Susan still sat in the alcove, holding in her hand a portrait of Dante.
               The stern countenance, stern in the purity and delicacy of its outlines, would of itself at another time have absorbed her; and she found a certain pleasure even now in looking at it. She would have thrown aside a face less sad and stern, a careless smiling face, but this looked like a victorious warrior; and even at that moment its spirit found no faint reflection in her own countenance.
               Against whom did her outraged feelings expend themselves at that time? And what could she say or do? She had only heard from human voices what her own heart had told her as she stood before the glass that morning. In herself was all that Isidore's ridicule had pointed out. That self was not only the wounded, but the affronting one. So profoundly did she feel this, that whatever of indignation may have at first roused in her was instantly overpowered by the conviction that it was all living truth that Isidore had said. No wonder she laughed—no wonder she was anxious to be rid of her; and yet David had rebuked his sister . . . No matter. What if it was cruel? what if it did betray a blind, weak, selfish soul? No matter. It was none the less true. She was a scarecrow—her eyes were frightful. If mermaids were horrid monsters of the deep, no doubt she was one of them.
               And yet, in spite of all these conclusions, there was something in Susan's heart that rebelled against them. Once she started up indignant, to go in search of Mr. Baldwin, and ask him to send her home again. But her heart failed her. Once she hid her face in her hands, and violently pressed back the tears that would, unhindered, have found their way in streams down her cheeks. The walls of the beautiful apartment closed round her like the stone walls of a prison, unimpassible, cold and dark—excluding all things save darkness and herself.
               Like the poor victim of cruelty, whom the stalwart hand of superstition is walling, stone by stone, out from the sweet breath of earth and the fair light of day, sat she in this her sepulchre, when, an hour afterward, David went to the place in search of a book.
               "Do you know anything of that poet," said he,—"of Dante?" as he bent down, that he might better observe the print—and he saw how her hands that held it trembled, and how pale her face was; and a suspicion of the truth flashed upon him, and gave her a new interest in his eyes; and his conscience was ill at ease.
               Susan had never heard the name before. Seating himself beside her then, for very pity's sake, and that not with the air of a martyr, he told her of the fortunes of him of whom Veronese women said, when he passed through their streets, "That is the man who goes down to hell whenever he pleases, and brings us back tidings of the sinners below."
               Of the poet's sorrowful love he told her: of his struggles, his banishment, of his death in exile—of Beatrice, and the wonderful monument he built for her. He was still occupied with the tale, and Susan was listening, as in a dream, when a maid came to tell her that Miss Isidore was waiting for her in her room.
               "Well, then, Susy," said David, rising, and escorting her to the door, "it may happen that I shall not see you again till evening. I fancy that Mr. Falcon has a conspiracy in his brain that we shall hear of by-and-by. Do you hear? a conspiracy for carrying you off bodily this afternoon—to the menagerie, I believe."
               "And then I shall not be here at that horrible . . . dinner! Oh, Mr. David, do tell Mr. Falcon to come and take me away—please do! I wish I could go home!"
               Now what was all this? Susan had resolved that she would not mention Stella Cammon's name aloud, certain as she felt that she was the very 'Miss Cammon' David had spoken of to Isidore, because she would not betray to him the fact that she had heard that conversation. But what had she now done?
               David Baldwin lifted the beseeching young face toward the light, and looked at it—he laid his hand on the child's shoulder, he relapsed into a hearty smile that ran on into a heartier laugh, and kindly he said:
               "Don't look as though the universe would collapse in case I said that you should stay to dinner. You shall do precisely as you choose about that; I take it that it is not my 'manifest destiny' to torment you. And I hope sincerely that you will go to the caravan, and that you will persuade Clarence to go with you. If I could . . . but now you must run on, my sister is waiting for you Never mind—I will see Mr. Falcon."
               
               The assurance of that all-powerful "I" soothed the child, and calmed her. Quietly she went up into Isidore's room, and there put on her new apparelling, the mourning dress—for Tom. And David forgot the book he had in his mind but now, and went in search of Falcon, in whose prolific mind he dropped the seed, the roots of which were sure to run down into the warm soil of the heart, and so send out into the sunshine the best fruit that the seed could yield. Susan must be delivered from the dinner martyrdom—she must go where she could find sympathy—among other wild beasts: to the caravan!
               Then he betook himself to Dr. Borg, an Englishman of large pretensions and immense capacities, who had come to St. John's as it appeared for three purposes, which manifested themselves in an attempt to pick up a living—in an unlimited appreciation of "Miss Watson's genius;" and, it was his crowning quality and distinguishing capacity, in universal fault-finding, grumbling, and ridicule.
               He was a talker. Words! words! words! How they leaped, and gushed, and gurgled, and roared! shining; piled up, layer upon layer, sparkling, foaming, like a flagon of exceedingly small beer; and he always had his group of listeners and toadies.
            
            
               XLIX.
               AT noon that same day, while Dr. Borg and David Baldwin sauntered arm in arm toward Don Juan's, the young painter, Wadsworth Vane, heated and tired with his long labor in the sun, threw himself on the rude sofa in his barren chamber, and ate his mid-day meal—a frugal meal it was, and taken while he read the concluding pages of a work on art. As he turned the last leaf, and scanned the last paragraph, the book, dropped from the weary hand and he lay with closed eyes, as if in sleep. In the room adjoining his, and in those above and beneath him, and in the street upon whose border stood the house held by his employer as a work-shop and boarding-house for his workmen and apprentices, were sounds of busy life, merry-making, and unceasing conversation. But Vane was alone; and in his room was silence; and these surrounding witnesses of life did not disturb his meditation, for it was not sleep in which he was indulging. It was the biography of the author which was appended to his work, on which Vane was reflecting.
               "Was it, after all, martyrdom? And what is martyrdom? Was the man's self perpetually obtruding between him and the highest aim of the artist? The biographer has printed him a martyr in capital letters, but I cannot see that he was one. I should hardly confer that title upon him. He was not a true knight of the cross; he was not ready to perish for his idea. In no event of his career, and I have paid particular heed to the several points, in not a solitary event does he show that the real anguish of his struggle—horrible struggle! resulted from his conception of the distance between his work and his aspiration. Nor, worse for him, since he seems not to have quite had the right spirit for time-serving, that he had an idea beyond the present time's reception, It was not that in the state of the arts in his day he had the assurance that if he undertook to show wherein art was misunderstood and unappreciated in some of her divine aspects, and how the artists wronged her by preaching her gospel after their false interpretations; if he had struck deeply into the heart of the truth, more deeply than any other, he must have foreseen that his generation would not understand it or him, they would quarrel with him, throw stones and mud at him, try to put out his eyes, call him an idiot, and so on; a more advanced time alone could come up to his level . . . Now, I do not see that this was his case . . . I cannot see that he was a martyr. He was not fighting to preserve the purity of art from such decorations as a false taste laid upon her. He was one of those many—doing precisely what they did, and he is as dead as any of them. He preached no truth through his pictures that this age discerns more clearly or appreciatingly than his own did. He did not understand aright the historical facts he attempted to depict, and he had no instinctive discernment of the spirit which would have made his domestic scenes, so perfect in form, alive and immortal. He failed in his angels invariably, for he could not understand the difference between one who had grown in a heavenly atmosphere and us poor clods. The faces were human, and the wings did not help the matter any. He did not fight to preserve art from such decorations as a false taste laid upon her. He was one among the many—doing what they did, and meeting the same fate. But to call him a martyr! . . . He was miserable—he ought to have been happy. He fought against God. Every recorded prayer of his is a solemn absurdity . . . Am I an artist?"
               The young fellow lifted himself in the startling abruptness of that demand. He had asked himself that question before, but never in such a mood as the present. "Have I any insight? what does my enthusiasm mean? is it the heat of young blood only? will it grow weak and flat with age? or is it an inheritance as enduring as the sun—more lasting than the sun, eternal as God and my own spirit? Am I meet for martyrdom? Martyrdom is not pain. Martyrdom is joy and glory, to the man who gives his last breath for the avouching of truth. Must I content myself with low achievements? How do I know that my ideas have not already been put upon canvas a thousand times? and proved false by vanished generations? I have never seen a great picture. Pucelli's daubs would make me laugh, only they are so popular, and that is an evil sign of the times . . . Fame and fortune, and multitudes drawing some sweetness and comfort from my creations—a benefactor to my kind . . . understood as such. Ah, if a man could read these things in the future, it were an easy work to realize them . . . That is a world's argument. We do, indeed, measure greatness by success, and power by conspicuity . . . I know myself how true it is that somebody said somewhere the other day, 'the world knows nothing of its greatest men.' . . . Through evil report or good report, through the triumph of fame, or the hooting of ignorant men, and profane artists, through poverty and loneliness, oh art, I will follow thee! It is not for glory, it is for beauty and for truth. It is my gift, and I will use it—and when all is over for me here,—Put away this everlasting ME, from my thoughts, oh Thou all-beautiful! I am thine, not mine, and if the taste of this age is false and to be redeemed, let me" . . . before the splendor of his dream Vane's eyes closed again,—for an instant only; when he opened them they were full of tears. What vision had blessed him that he smiled so grandly—so humbly, yet so resolutely looking forward to the future? What thought was it that gave him so much spirit, such blithesome joyous spirit in the lowly labor to which, at the expiration of his hour of rest, he went out into the world again? In the far prospect if he saw a cross, it was crowned. If, from the men that crowded ignorantly on his path as he went forward, he heard only sneers and laughter, from the infinite depths beyond them he heard affectionate recognitions, loving welcomes, softly-uttered blessings, such as find the heart No brazen blast of acclamation, in which for the very sound's sake the multitude joined, cleaving the air:—a diviner breath, a nobler assurance of victory.
               It was a slight figure—too slender, one would say, for combat; a prize-fighter would assuredly have looked down on the boyish object in contemptuous observation. But the power of its endurance, nerved by the energy of genius, no mortal eye, though perchance some mortal spirit, might estimate.
               As he passed on foot along a quiet street on his way to the building on which he was engaged, at the further extremity of the town, through the blind of a window looked a young girl who, during the last hour, had been waiting and watching there.
               He went up on that side of the street where she was watching, carrying with him a paint-pot and oil-can—presenting in his coarse dress a not very imposing appearance. But the bright eyes which looked for him grew brighter as he came, and the heart of the young girl beat faster, and she looked at the little nosegay in her hand, and down at him, and leaned forward as on he came.
               She had an eye for measurement—could calculate the distance well, for, as he passed underneath the window, down into the paint-pot fluttered the little bouquet. But—he never saw it! The gift did not win for her a token, not even the slightest, in acknowledgment. This too she perceived, that he had not observed her—which she had indeed been very careful to prevent; and it did not much trouble her that she had succeeded to this unlooked-for extent in eluding his observation, for she leaned back from the window and laughed. And yet—if he had only seemed a little more conscious of the neighborhood through which he was passing!
               It was Lucia Tree who was indulging in this innocent expression of her approbation of the young laborer. What faith she had in him! Well she knew that what did afterwards take place would be sure to do so—of it she wanted no surety.
               That when he should come to the end of his walk, if not before, he would look into the paint-pot and see the flowers, and not wonder at it, but understand the gift. He would lift the poor buds and cleanse them from the paint, and smile on them, and they would smile back on him; and he would regard them as the day's blessing on his labor. While he worked, now and then he would glance at them—and oftener be thinking of them as the token meet for one artist's heart to offer to another!
               Lucia has in the past few days become wonderfully industrious. Her portfolio is now ever spread open before her. She is diligent in making copies of the drawings which Vane gave her for safe-keeping. She has learned to look with loving and serious eyes upon her pencils. Is there a thought of fame, so wild a desire, so unhappy an imagination, troubling, vexing, scorching her young, heart? No, but she has some strange fancies lately: strange and deep they are for so guileless a heart, so sunny a temper. She thinks of the manna that the wandering Israelites gathered, and remembers it was of the providence of God—the bird on the eaves of the adjoining house has a worm in its beak: things common, trivial seeming, (because familiar,) are fast assuming significance to her eyes. Day by day her pictures grow; she too in labor is gathering a supply of strength and knowledge for the future's use; and day by day her ideal expands, and becomes more radiantly beautiful, and need not contract, need not to be changed, in order to befit the mortal name fit for any station, great for any use that ever may befall them.
               Vane does not see her work, has not seen it since that day when he left his own drawings with her. She never sees his name in the papers, nor hears it in society, but she tells Will, sometimes, when he comes into her room to see what progress she is making, that Vane's name will some day have rank and fame to support it. It is the confident prophecy of a fervent friend. She looks deeper through her friendly eyes, into the years that are to come, than any one on earth except himself, and there is more of trembling, less of pride, in his prophetic hope than in hers.
               For her own sake, you may be sure, Lucia Tree is not working; something besides an ambitious desire to please herself, or to astonish others, leads her on. It is a significant fact, worth looking into, when a buoyant spirit sits down to plodding work, to pains-taking, and exactness. Lucia Tree has been leading such a joyously idle life, keeping always as aloof as might be from the ominous "cupboard of bones" in the house, that this change, every day deepening in its influence, and becoming more marked in its result, in her character and habits; this studious and happy industry, this simple, honest pride with which she regards her own progress, and claims Will's commendation, is a change worth noting. Yet no one, save Will, notes it—for Mr. Tree is an official, and the silent and hurried meals he takes at home, and the half hour which he spends late in the evening, in the bosom of his family, are not periods given to holy social communion. Yawning through the thirty minutes, he goes to bed; and gets up in the morning, and has, all things taken into consideration, it must be allowed, a not very comfortable boarding-house.
               There is a mother in the house. But her heart is a waste moorland; not a bird sings, not a flower blows there. She lives in a tomb; the stone is removed, but she does not come forth at the call—she is so deaf that she cannot hear it—she has been tried—and she has been found wanting, she cannot make a home—there is no grace said for meat, no wonder it nourishes so little life. She is Martha, troubled about many things. If the sick of the palsy had not been gratefully obedient, had not taken up his bed and walked when so commanded, where had been the healing? She looks to the future as they who know not what to do with the present, are, in their weakness, wont to look. None can tell why she looks, since the present passes by her so unheeded. She will take herself into it, and is not that sufficient to make of it a ruin? Life does indeed pay us back with interest what we bestow upon it. Wheat ships for the crumbs we cast upon the waters; blessings for a smile; creation for a prayer; God for a thanksgiving!
               
               So went they, day after day, through the eternal path, wrathfully jealous of the gifts of fortune—disdainfully unmindful of the gifts of Providence. Plucking thorns and feeding on them, while the young lambs browsing at their feet, sunning themselves in the dewy grass, run which way they will by day, gathered into the fold by night . . . but—unless they had a heavenly shepherd, unless their angels were indeed of heaven, beholding evermore the Father's face!
               Frank, the oldest son of the house, long ago, before he was of age, had gone to sea, for the puritanic gloom of the house without the puritanic zeal of faith to keep its laws in force, was, after long endurance, finally rebelled against, and he had run away. They had never heard from him. He was lost to home and kindred forever, if not to himself.
               Rose, the oldest daughter, had in due time followed his example, fled from home, but not alone. Five years of harsh experience in life had brought her penitential back to her father's house—penitential, not on account of the wrong she had wrought, so much as because of the loss she had sustained; and there, to the mutual disgust of the parties concerned, she was now living with her husband, whom Mr. Tree had received into his office. There is nothing left of the old flimsy romance but the fine title; and even that name, Mortimer Maurice, has somehow lost its sweet sound; the wife's ear cannot detect now the music of the name which once entranced her.
               Will and Lucia were, in comparison with the rest of the household, like fairy children. It seemed hardly possible that they should have grown up in that same hard, clay soil. Will is Lucia's child: though he is the oldest of the two. She has kept the wild boy in safety, because he so much loved her, in years which, but for her, he would have squandered life, time, health, and virtue, as the others had done before him.
               No other child but Lucia, of that household, had ever climbed the father's knee, or sat at the mother's feet, and read aloud books of fairy tales. The smile in her own eyes has been too pure and deeply glad to allow perception of the absence of it in their faces; to her, so buoyant has her love been, their grave, ungenial looks have been tender and kind—so she has interpreted them! She has laughed away their harshness, and formed in her own heart a thousand generous apologies for it. She proclaims the innocent joy of her own being, and does not heed the silence with which that gospel is received. She does not know—she rebukes herself if ever she approaches a suspicion of the truth—that they are blind and deaf to the world that is so musical to her. She is never lonely, never sad. She adores Stella Cammon—in a mood not unlike that which prostrates her sometimes before the Virgin's shrine. She is full of hopes and innocent plots. Will and Vane are her demi-gods; her child's faith in the fairy folk lingers yet. She would have reverenced Malte Brun for his confession of faith in regard to the pigmies of the Thibetan desert.
            
            
               L.
               WELL, Lucia Tree is drawing pictures, as I said, with an interest and a diligence of which she was never before guilty. And she is contemplating, besides, a much greater achievement than she has yet attempted; and with a view to it, a week ago, she went down to Pucelli, her old master, and looked over his paintings; and, doubtless, in consideration of her progress when he taught her drawing, he insisted that she should resume her lessons, only this time exchanging lead for colors, and cardboard for canvas. His daughter is just beginning to study painting, and he is anxious that she should be led on to labor by having a companion who might become a rival.
               And this point Lucia has still in consideration, and cannot quite decide about it.
               The song with which she broke loose from her perplexity just now, arrested Will's steps as he was passing by her door; he paused there in momentary hesitation—should he go in?
               Lucia answered the question for him. She had heard his step as he came near and halted, and, breaking off with the song, she said, "Come in, Willie."
               Yet a moment longer he hesitated. He should not have yielded to the impulse of which the hesitation was suggestive. But he was in want of courage, and patience, and hope. Could she restore these to him?
               He made the venture, and went in.
               Brightly smiling on her darling and favorite, Lucia looked up as he came. Willie was troubled; her eyes were quick to see it.
               "What ails you, dear?" she asked.
               "Me! not anything," he said, greatly astonished that she should suppose that anything ailed him.
               
               "Yes, indeed. You look tired, and vexed, and sick.
               Come here, darling—you are studying too hard. You will kill yourself, and there will be the end of it. What shall we do this afternoon? Shall we stroll away into the country?"
               "Not to-day, Lucia."
               "Have you had another pitched battle with Maurice, Willie? I verily believe you have, and he glories in such things so! Don't you see he never attempts that sort of thing with me now? He treats me with marked respect. He is too far beneath me for a quarrel; I can say that without being inordinately puffed up. So can you."
               "You are all wrong in your guess. I've not been fighting with Mr. Mortimer Maurice. Not that I have had no occasion. He has been chastising little Rose again, the infernal bully. If I believed in annihilation, I should be tempted to put him out of existence; but he would only be a nuisance elsewhere, and we are getting used to it. There's nothing like being used to a thing. I may as well tell you, that you may be prepared for him, and not let him triumph too much in his new victory. There are breakers ahead. If you feel as if you could not bear disgrace, you must go and stay with Stella for a day or two; but don't, if you can help it, betray any more feeling than if you were a stone. It is on his account that—father lost the office. He has been showing off some of his rascally tricks. And so there's the end of him. We are wrecked; and if he is not pitched overboard presently, I don't know whom he will have to thank."
               "Father lost his office!" said Lucia slowly, looking her surprise in the agitated face of Willie. "Poor old father . . . Does any blame fall on him, Will?"
               "People are never very deliberate in distinguishing between right and wrong in such cases. He was at the head of the office, you know, Lucia; they will be pretty sure to say, more's the shame that such a swindle could be carried on under his very eyes, and he not know it. It happened nearly a week ago."
               "It will be the death of him! Where is he? Let's go to him—we are the youngest; we can get into his heart and comfort him, if any one can. Oh, this is infamous!—does Rose know it?"
               "Rose is probably confined to her bed with one of her mysterious headaches," said Will, with bitter significance, laying his hand on Lucia's arm; for she had risen as if to go when she spoke of comforting their father. "Father is below in the dining-room; but do you hear those other voices? There are gentlemen with him—he may get out of it, but only by a miracle . . . I have told you the very worst, so that Maurice should not have the advantage of you; there may be a better side to it, but the office is gone—the authorities met last night and appointed another person. That is all settled and certain—we have no occasion for suspense about that."
               "Well, Will, what is going to become of us now?"
               "I am going to work," said Will, manfully; but he turned his face away from his sister while he spoke
               "And so am I," said Lucia.
               "You?"
               "You?" asked Lucia in turn, half laughing.
               "Why, yes. I should have my profession in a year by close study; but I can go to writing for Phipps & Co., and maybe I can study a little at odd times, so that I will be admitted, say in two or three years. I shall not be so very old, even if it is delayed longer. I can earn enough by writing to take care of you, and father and mother beside. But as to the rest . . . poor little Rose!"
               Poor little Rose was at that instant beating for admittance tance against the door. Opening it, Willie took the child in his arms, smoothed the tangled flaxen curls from her forehead, and kissed her.
               "And this is my little girl," he said, with significant emphasis, which Lucia well understood—he looking meanwhile with a smile into the child's eyes, and stroking her fair cheeks, and making her laugh; but there was a moisture in his own eyes, and a tremor in his voice. He had in this moment, and by this word, solemnly adopted as his charge the hapless little one. The act at such a moment, when he was girding on a sword for battle, burdened already with cares, and troubled with doubts, spoke for him all the noble things that Lucia had believed true of him her life long.
               "Will," she said, her cheek crimsoned as she revealed the bold design, "you laughed just now; but I should like to know what there is to hinder my working too? I can draw and paint very well now. But I shall do better if I have an object for trying. Why not let me join with you for father and mother's sake? Now, don't laugh, and make fun, but think of it. I know I can do something."
               "Lucia, you never prophesied yet but the thing you said would, did come to pass. You will rival Titian if you set out to do it, I'll bet all Phipps' library."
               "Phipps' library cost a fortune—I think you have enough on your hands already. I hope we shall stay here, though. You and I were born here, Will."
               "Perhaps if we moved, we should have a change of fortune," said Will, dryly. "We shall have to go, I think . . . But we will not talk about that yet awhile, though we may as well. Do you feel alarmed and anxious about it? Confess, if you do."
               "Not for myself, not a bit, Will. I say it truly. We were never up so very high but we can come down without any great commotion. No danger of dizziness in the descent, I mean. If father would only talk with us about it, everything would be easy—but he never talks about anything with us."
               "Not he—not the first word will you get from him about it. It would have been a little more kind of him to let me in to the secret himself, for instance, instead of waiting till I should hear it talked of up and down the streets."
               "But I shall talk to him," said Lucia, courageously. "I shall tell him as soon as I see him that I am going to paint, and that you are going to writing, and we will let him know that he has two right-hand men to fall back upon."
               Lucia spoke so bravely that Will ventured further in his narration than he had yet done.
               "The man in the dining-room is taking an inventory. The furniture is all going to be sold—to meet the liabilities incurred by that—" he hesitated, looking at the child he still held in his arms, "swindle"—he said, in a low tone.
               "The furniture, Will? what! our chairs, and carpets, and tables, and things?"
               "Yes—you have it exactly; our things, Lucia. Whose else? that's a small part of what we owe to—" again the presence of the little blue-eyed girl upon his knee suspended the harsh judgments about to be pronounced upon her father, "and the ottomans and chairs you worked so beautifully!"
               "Don't mention anything I've done! Oh! how will father bear it? . . . All his lifetime—dear me . . . How will he bear it?"
               "As you do, like a hero."
               Don't say that—I had rather hear you abuse than praise me any time. You know I always said so, Will. We both know what we ought to do. Oh, let us do it, and keep still about it."
               "But you know, Lucia, it is gospel truth for all that. I should just as soon expect to hear the trees groaning because the autumn wind and frost tore off their leaves, —some poets say they do, but they don't understand,—as to hear either you or father complain."
               Will delivered himself of this remark with quite an air. "Just think," he added, "just think of what he has borne and endured quietly so many years."
               "Will . . . he has you and I, at all events," said Lucia, half frightened to hear such bold words from her brother.
               She understood him well, and did not dissent from the strictures—their father had them, and only them. In the other inmates he had, what he rejected, discord, dishonesty, disgrace. His eldest daughter, weak and fallen—his son, her husband, the point for a villanous paragraph in the catalogue of crime—his wife, who should have been his help-mate and consolation, filling neither place nor office. Well the children understood all this. Their sympathy, compassion, and resolution to be the props of their father's heart, that it should not sink into ruin with the rest of this chaos, had in it a certain moral grandeur.
               Until there arose from the room beneath them the sound of retreating feet, the opening and shutting of doors, which proclaimed the progress of the sheriff through the house, Lucia and Will talked of their prospects and plans with each other; but the face of each was a trifle paler when at length the sound of those feet ascending the staircase was heard.
               "You had better go away," said Will, rising, with little Rose in his arms. "I will stay and see the man, and help him, if he needs me."
               "And I fail you in the very outset!" exclaimed Lucia.
               "It is not failing me—but it would please Kennedy better if you were out of the way: women bother him so. I know the man, it's really as I say—he will get through easier and sooner; you can go down, and—"
               "And see father! so I will." And as Kennedy rapped at her door, she passed through another that led by a back passage to the lower story.
            
            
               LI.
               SHE went alone.
               It is a pleasant thing to have a stranger in one's home on such an errand as this! To see his cold glance of computation as he notes down the household "stuff," and puts on it a market value; a dollar and cent valuation on treasures use-worn, time-faded, beyond all price to you! This bit of 'broidery, a gift of love which loving hands wrought for you with patient, happy labor, day by day, thinking of you meanwhile, of your pet fancies and special tastes; those hands perhaps now resting from all loving labors, all human work whatever!
               Pleasant to note the manner of valuation, and the rate of valuation of things sanctified by long use and daily sight; to see them all going down in the dirty memorandum book of the slovenly official, whose tread through your rooms made sacred by births, and life, and by death also, seems like a profanation to you—a desecration of the sweetest and most precious of your memories. These things, I say, are pleasant. But if a house is guilty of a misfortune, it may look for this climax, and probably will not be disappointed. The house will find it easier to bear if the misfortune is not the result of its own oversight, or recklessness, or carelessness; though there was not, probably, in Mr. Tree's dwelling one who took this new domestic calamity more coolly than its base originator.
               With such patience, or rather with such an air of patience, as a boy of William Tree's mettle and spirit might be supposed capable of assuming, he waited in Lucia's room while Mr. Kennedy wrote down the trifling value he affixed to the simple furniture there. He evidently attached no high price to the whole contents of the apartment; his work was done in a moment, and then he passed on, having received the direction from William, who deigned not to accompany him; the only room in the house that was sacred to him had been watched by him while the officer was 'on duty' there—he cared not for the rest.
               Officer Kennedy had not left Lucia's room when she had descended-and entered the dining-room, where her father was alone.
               Tree was a poor, broken old man, but he never looked so broken as now, under this fresh blow of fortune.
               At the sound of the opening door he turned quickly with a frown upon the intruder; seeing his daughter, he strove to draw himself up into something like his customary dignity, the secret of which lay in the silence that usually sealed his lips. Yet, at the same time, he attempted a smile, which was not successful; the feeble attempt and the utter failure did not escape Lucia, and she likewise saw upon his face traces of tears—tears which he had not brushed away as they gathered, and now he forgot the evidences they left of their passage from his heart down his wrinkled cheeks. These tears the daughter saw, and nerved herself to see them, and strengthened herself to smile back an answer to his poor attempt at welcome.
               "Sit down," said the old man, "sit down;" then he paused and listened to the sound of the treading feet in the room above: nervously listened, and turning to his daughter said, with she well knew what kind of hope:
               "You have just come in, have n't you? Sit down; you are going to Pucelli's, I believe?"
               "I went there, sir, but I have been home some time," said Lucia, with a show of composure. "I came down from my room . . . Willie told me."
               "Told you what?" said the old man, with stern displeasure, as if he had been betrayed into the hands of an enemy.
               "About Mr. Kennedy, father. And how—Maurice has served you," she answered resolutely.
               To this Mr. Tree made no response. He looked at Lucia, and looked away again—walked about the room—leaned against the window. Contracted and narrow as that little patch of grass was this life of the old man. It had no prospect; a wall, like the dead brick wall of the house just beyond the yard, which rose sullen before him, hedged him in on every side; but there was the patch of green! No far recollection of a free and happy boyhood—no dream of a halcyon future; but in the present was this bit of green, this ray of sunlight.
               "Father, Will and I have been talking about it—we know. We know it's more terrible to be served as you have been by Mortimer, when you were doing everything you could to help him—a great deal harder to bear that than the rest—than the poverty—" she was determined to keep no thought back, or to deceive him into the belief that she did not understand it all. He should keep none of these gloomy prospects to himself—he should not bear their heaviness alone, in solitary thought. Disgrace and poverty were actually upon them; why should they not understand and bear together? "But people will see after awhile," she added, to comfort him, for, strive as he might to conceal it, she could read his anguish in his posture and his face; "even if they fail to do so now, they will find out some time where the fault lies. It is not so very terrible to be poor. Will and I have idled long enough—we are both going to work now."
               Again Tree looked at his daughter; he looked as if he could not believe his eyes; and he listened as though he hardly credited his ears.
               At length he spoke—bitterly the man's thought escaped him—" You have your mother's voice," said he; "God knows, if she had ever spoken to me as you have done, I should have been another man, and you would have had a different fate."
               Coming from such a source as this, wrung out as the words were, and as Lucia knew they were, from a heart riven by anguish, they sounded in her ear with awful emphasis. She did not expostulate. She could not condemn such speech, not even in her heart, much less with her lips. She could not soothe—at least the soothing did not come suddenly, did not spontaneously gush out with healing from her heart.
               Sorely wrung was her heart, as, by these words, as in a solitary flash of light, the uncommunicated sorrow, disappointment, hopelessness of her father's lifetime was revealed before her eyes. What he had endured—the solitude, isolation, shame and misery; she understood it all. She had never known him till this day; and now, with the rising impulse, the resistless impulse of her love, which had heretofore beat always against a barrier when it rose towards him, she turned her to him with a woman's pitying sympathy, and a child's confiding love. She rose with a quick beating heart, not fearful of herself, nor suspicious of her confidence in him, nor of the strength of her impulse.
               "Dear father," she said, drawing herself up when she came before him, not throwing herself into his arms—how did she know that as yet he would so far unbend as to receive her?— "I am almost glad that anything should happen that could happen, so I might tell you how much I love you. I am so glad, too, that I must prove my love! You shall see if I cannot work—and how happy we shall be!"
               "Why could I not have heard a voice like this twenty years ago?" answered he, looking down upon his child, unconscious of the tears that overflowed his eyes.
               "But it does no good to look back now. We can do everything yet," said Lucia stoutly, as if determined not to yield an inch of her position.
               "Everything!" repeated he. Too actual had been the trouble through which he had passed, too long had it been in continuance, to allow of his being captivated by any prospect his child could bring before him of a future good. He reasoned his way through the future by the desolating experience of the past thirty years. "Everything? hope and health, and trust in men and women?"
               "Yes, in Will and I, father!" said Lucia, smiling brightly. "You do not mistrust us? We will never fail you, father. We will give you health and hope again. Everything that you believed in years ago—you will see how true they all were. God meant us to be happy, and we shall be, I know."
               The old man almost smiled to hear her. Yet too childish all this promise seemed, this hope that she was holding forth, this faith she was confessing. When his stern life had broken into a ruin, and his hope lay in the dust, what were that life's or that hope's fragments worth to him?—let them moulder.
               And yet he asked, "What will you do?"
               "Draw and paint, sir."
               "For whom?"
               "Shop-keepers, book publishers, anybody."
               
               "They grind the faces of the poor—'anybody' is famous for that."
               "Mine could not look much worse than it does already, if it were well ground,—grinding might improve my looks on the whole, father."
               The old man laughed a little at this. Even so slight a token encouraged her.
               "And what's Will going to do? Where is Will? You two are like the Siamese twins."
               Now, indeed, was there a commotion in Lucy's heart; and her head whirled round in a delicious dizziness—her triumph was well-nigh too much for her—for her father spoke out to her as he had never done before.
               "And people who love well are sure to work together for good!" was her swift, audible conclusion. "So now you will be sure to trust us," she said. "Will is going to work to copy for the firm—he can make a great deal of money in that way; and he can study along too—so it is only in about two years instead of one before he will be admitted."
               In his daughter's voice the old man recognized the confidence of his own early youth: the dead and vanished confidence which had lured him, so he now thought, to his destruction. He put forth his hand in warning—solemnly he said:
               "I see myself in you. I was like you once. I believed in what was fair, and had a good outside show, that it was all it promised to be. I learned better. Be cautious now, while caution will do you some good. People are to be trusted as far as you see them, but not an inch beyond."
               Here their conversation was interrupted by the entrance of a large, well-dressed woman, of middle-age, who seemed to be in great excitement. It was Mrs. Tree.
            
            
               LII.
               "MR. TREE," she exclaimed, looking hastily around her to ascertain the inmates of the room, "I should like to know the meaning of this! There's a fellow in my apartment, taking an inventory, he says. Are we going to be sold out again, Mr. Tree?"
               "Why, yes, madam, I suppose that is just what you must look for," said Mr. Tree, coolly turning his back on his wife, who had given vent to her amazement and wrath.
               Lucia did not, as she did usually, withdraw with the beginning of the contest. She stayed to fulfil the promise she had inwardly made, that she was henceforth her father's comforter and aid . . . he did not just now look as though he stood in any great need of a protector.
               "And what will be done next?" asked the wife. "How under heaven did you manage to get your affairs into this shape again? Tree, you ought to have a guardian."
               "That is what I have had for the last thirty years. A guardian who has succeeded in defending me from everything that bore the slightest resemblance to peace or prosperity. Do not tell me that again. I have had my guardian, you ought to know that," he rejoined.
               His cool manner and deliberate speech had the effect to still the raging of his wife's spirit—she became in a moment as bitter and as calm as himself.
               "What has happened?" she asked. "We are to have an auction; what next?"
               "Ay, what next? perhaps you can counsel me there—you were ever apt at that."
               "Buy a monkey, and a hand-organ. . Lucia here will make a red flannel frock for the animal—begin life again, and never fear. All men succeed when they begin in the right way."
               "But meantime, my dear angelic wife, what will become of you?"
               "Father and mother!" exclaimed Lucia, "God sees and hears you!"
               Mrs. Tree looked wonderingly at the girl, and laughed. The father made no comment, and apparently paid no heed.
               "Has Mortimer been spoken to?"
               "Ask him, wife. He will be a good counsellor for you. He can, besides, throw a little more light on this business than any other man, probably."
               "What is to become of us!" exclaimed Mrs. Tree, now wringing her hands, and changing her defiance and passion, for a pathetic mood.
               "Surely, what is?" said the old man, for the first time glancing towards his wife—not won, however, by her grief, for confidence in her, on his part, was become a moral impossibility.
               Lucia would have spoken, the consoling word was on her lip, but her father's stern, cold "Us! who do you mean?" restrained her.
               "Your family, Mr. Tree. Your wife and children."
               "They have hands, and feet, and brains, madam, as well as I—they can use them, since I have worn out mine to so poor a purpose. You are younger by ten years than I—your health is unbroken. Do you remember our marriage day?"
               "Remember it!"
               "Then you must recollect that you took vows that day as well as I. You swore to be my helper; and a good many other things beside. Do you remember those also? Is it not time for you to begin to make some of them good?"
               She answered only by an hysterical sob, but Tree would not understand that as an appeal—for her tears he cared not, an ocean of them would be no atonement.
               "This child here," he said, "shames you. She never vowed to be my helpmate; she never swore to love, honor, and obey, which words with you seem to mean to hate, despise, and defy. She never vowed to cleave to me in sickness and in health, evil and good report. She has done it, though. I tell you she is a reproach to you, and to me too. I know it. We gave her life, but what else? if you will think of it. I tell you she is more God's child than ours. In spite of the misery, and disgrace, and contention of this house, she has turned out good and holy! came in here just now offering to go to work to support—us; and loving us all the more because we were hardly fit for her pity. I tell you, madam, I am humbled as I never was, and as I could not be by the disgrace Maurice has brought on us. But that she should have grown up here so good, in such a place! And there is Will, do you think, ma'am, that it is you or I who have made such a man of a boy born with such a temper as he was? can you see, or are you blind, that it is this girl here who has made him what he is? Do you know what he is? or must I introduce your son to you as well as your daughter? He and Lucia are going to work to support us. Do you hear? To support us, madam; God knows what their obligation to us is, for all we have done to make them anything else, they might have been as villanous as Maurice and Rose; or, as we are!"
               Mrs. Tree's sobs grew fainter, less frequent, as this prospect of a support appeared. The lady sank back upon a chair, and buried her face in her handkerchief. She had nothing to say. Lucia, long before her father finished his speech, had stolen from the room, for he motioned her to go.
               "We remain together," he continued, not so feebly nor in such agitation as he had before spoken. "But as for Maurice, he sleeps not another night under this roof, or any other that I may ever call mine. He has doubly ruined me. And Rose shall go. She has outraged me long enough. They shall go, and perish in their infamy, unless they can repent after they are gone. Starvation may bring them to their senses, and cure them. I hope so."
               "Turn out your first-born child upon the world to die!" but the voice could not wail or groan successfully in its imitation.
               "To die? . . That's the best fate that could befall the wretched creature, to my thinking," said Mr. Tree solemnly and unforgivingly.
               "You are a hard-hearted brute, Tree, to speak so of your own daughter."
               "You may go with her to protect her, and show your motherly devotion. You ought to prove it in some way, Annie, for once in your life."
               A quick and violent succession of sobs, indicative of considerable impetuosity and passion in the breast from which they issued, responded to this proposition.
               "You have said more than once that you would like a divorce—say so now, Ann, if you ever intend to again; you shall have your wish. But one thing, for the future no such work shall go on under our roof, as has gone on—under our children's roof, I mean;" he pronounced those words tenderly. "You must take a lesson of your youngest child, or there must be some other change. We should have very little to do to get the separation, I think. Nothing in our hearts. You had divorced yourself long before Lucia was born."
               "For the Lord's sake, what do you mean?" In her amazement Mrs. Tree quite removed the handkerchief from her face, and surveyed her incensed husband.
               "You were not my wife in those days, and have not been a day since. It's too true to make a jest of." How astonished did she look, and continue to look—she was afraid, she actually trembled before the fluent speech and the roused spirit of this silent man. But even now she could not see the truth, that he had shaken off a spell which had bound him for years—that the indignation, the sense of injury his words betrayed, was what had been seething and condensing itself, through those long years of silent, uncommunicable gloom. "What could I say in this house that would not be made a handle for insult? I will not leave you now, ma'am, with a chance of going away and thinking that I have abused you today. Just look at yourself—look at facts as they are, and do not contradict me till I speak a falsehood. You and I are getting pretty old; we may as well quit the world with an understanding."
               He paused, having spoken these words, giving her an opportunity to reply, or withdraw. He clearly expected an indignant exit or defiance.
               But she sat still, and did not speak; some guilty, awful conviction that he neither was speaking, nor would speak, falsehood, but terrible and blasting truth,—or terror, which did not seem probable—or repentance, which did not appear possible—held her chained to her seat.
               "You have lived under my roof thirty years."
               "Don't harp eternally about the thirty years—and the roof. I know as well as you, we have been married thirty years, Mr. Tree, and of course, being your wife, I have lived in your house. Where under heaven would you have had me live? You expected me to reside with you, did you not? I supposed it was customary for wives."
               "You have been no wife, but a squatter, a hanger-on!" exclaimed Tree, incensed by her words, and still more by the manner in which they were spoken.
               She had the advantage now that her words had so enraged him, and she saw it—but something chained her tongue, that the cruel, biting, wicked words, of which she had store at command, did not escape her. Tree repented the violent expressions of which he had made use as soon as they were uttered, and he went on more quietly, "I can only say that thirty years is a long time for experimenting: we have led a quarrelsome, disgraceful life. I accuse myself; I know I am guilty, but I ask you if you can point to the time when you ever helped and encouraged me—when you did not embarrass me by your extravagance, and discourage me by the discouragements of an uncomfortable home. I am an old, miserable man. I have twisted, and turned, and cramped myself for you, and worn out my brain with thinking, night and day, how I might get bread for a careless, thriftless family. You never gave an indication that you married me for anything but a support. And this is the end of it. If it were not for the children, who are indeed my children, God be thanked! I would leave the house."
               Truth was in every word that he had spoken. But no conviction attended his utterance. The eyes were tearless, that met his look of denunciation—the face was sullen, loveless, and the heart hard and dry as limestone rock. What verdure could spring from it? What hope was there of that blasted barrenness? Hope for himself, or for her, had long ago vanished, and never to return; but the indifference with which she now looked and listened made the absence of all hope, the impossibility of its return, seem the more dismal, nay, the more horrible.
               "We shall be compelled to make some new arrangements about living. Can you suggest any improvements on the old, Annie?"
               "Are you asking advice, sir?"
               There was a momentary pause, during which Tree surveyed his wife—his answer at length was a loud and scornful, "no!"
               "Then it was unlucky that I fell in your way this morning. You seem so exhausted too, with your exercise, poor old creature! have a little pity on yourself." With this she left him.
               The old man sunk back in his chair, and screened his eyes with his hand. His lip trembled—he attempted to speak a word before she went, but words failed him. She mistook him now, as she had ever: saw only passion in his grief. But for the light tread of feet above him, and Lucia's voice singing, and Will's joining in the chorus, he had sat there a ruin.
               But now he listened as to heavenly sounds; and because they were in the world, there was not yet perfect desolation, not yet absolute despair for him.
            
            
               LIII.
               THERE was a cooler atmosphere pervading the Hall—no black thunder-cloud of passion like that whose break we have adverted to in the preceding chapter. There was a special exultation in one heart there that day—hid from human sight in the folds of her morning robe, Isidore carried with her the Colonel's letter as she went down the winding stair-case, leading Susan Dillon by the hand.
               "So, then, I shall have the honor of presenting my young friends to their majesties of the Cape, and the Boreal regions?" said Mr. Falcon, meeting them at the foot of the stair-case, where he with Clarence was waiting for Susan's appearing.
               Susan looked up and smiled with a whole and happy heart.
               
               In making the child's toilet, or in directing it, Isidore had disproved, by her kindness and amiable consideration, all the words that had escaped her in the library and fallen on the ear of the child. Perhaps it was the certainty of the prospect of the afternoon deliverance, and some misgivings when she looked at the sad face of Susan, that drew from her such kindly utterances, for she had begun to speak them before that letter came. The sudden burst of tears with which Susan listened to her when she said that her own dear old father had desired his friends to procure this mourning raiment for her, could not fall unnoticed by Isidore—they did in some slight degree affect her.
               She must rouse herself to soothe the young mourner, must trouble herself to think of cheerful words to say, must do her best to smile away this sorrow. When she stooped, she! and kissed the child, oh, magic of beauty! the grieving eyes restrained their tears, the heart lost all consciousness of that which had embittered and grieved it—she felt that she had nothing to rebel against, nothing to pardon; she more needed pardon for her unsightliness. And she loved that proud, hard, selfish beauty, yes, so did our little Susan Dillon, from the moment that she said, "Do not weep—but I know you have good cause—only it is so sad to see you—" and from that moment, obediently, she wept no more.
               And afterwards, when David told her that she was to go to the caravan, and Mr. Falcon came too, and told her of the fine entertainment he had in view for the afternoon, she was not merely calm, but joyous, and ready to smile her joy on any face that looked to hers.
               Yet was the new dress that she wore a trouble to her. Simple, unpretending though it was, it weighed upon her heavily—she was more conscious of it than a young belle of her new diamonds. And at first she contrived to keep herself in out-of-the-way corners of the hall, library, and drawing-room, attempting thus to escape observation. But David, when he saw her, wondered at her good looks, and she knew it; and as to Clarence, though at the first glance he seemed bewildered, and unable to identify her, she could not mistake the well-pleased looks with which he regarded her. But Mr. Falcon's tribute was the best of all—he said, how very like her grandfather she looked to-day! and Susan thought to herself, it must be then that I look something like my mother! That comforted her—and it makes us breathe a blessing on the old heart that knows so well what is going on in the young.
               And so Mr. Falcon, and Clarence, and Susan went off to the caravan.
               We will not follow them, neither join the dinner party to-day, on which occasion Isidore regards the handsome Colonel in the new light of an accepted lover, and he throws himself into the enjoyment of Baldwin's entertainment, good wines, and good company—for Silsey and Dr. Borg are of the guests—with the zest of a gay man who has been terribly embarrassed, but now sees clearly the way in which he is to get rid of his indebtedness. He is getting along famously; and he can appreciate the stately flow of the Dr.'s talk, and the profundity of Silsey's argumentations, and the beauty of Isidore; he is himself in his most sparkling vein to-day—and he feels so at home —and is so sure and safe about his credit! but, would it not be safer for him, if he went down to the most abandoned hell St. John's boasts of, to find there a liquidation of his debts, than to look, as he is looking, to this fashionable lady in her gay attire, choosing her for his partner in the world's tremendous game of Profit and Loss!
               It is now evening. Aunt Judith is at the confessional . . . Layard paces up and down the church, waiting to escort her home . . . Sister Theresa waits for the return of Father Francis to the convent: Isidore and David are making their toilet for a party—the one adorning herself as for a bridal; she looks at herself now in a new light —and so, also, she fancies, does another. Rightly she is judging!
               Mr. Baldwin paces the balcony that opens from the dining-room—Clarence, and Susan, and Mr. Falcon are with him.
               They are silent—all busy with their thoughts. Susan is thinking of the difference between a moon-lit night upon the beach; its stern solemnity, the abruptly-spoken, wild, bold pæans of a ruder and stronger spirit, and the sweet flowing of this ornamented poetry of nature here.
               The silence is presently broken.
               "Colonel Wheaton in the drawing-room, sir," announced a servant.
               "Show him this way, Ben—no, I will go in—come, Falcon."
               But Falcon deems that the quiet and shade of the balcony are better than the drawing-room light, and he remains behind.
               Now comes another voice, whose sound is so sweet that Susan starts up, amazed, to hear it, for it calls her name.
               "Is Susan there?"
               And when Susan responds to the call, another surprise awaits her, for she has not yet a quite assured confidence in Isidore's morning mood—it is really Isidore who speaks to her, that says: "I must say good-night to you now, dear; you will be fast asleep by the time I come home again. See, I have made myself as splendid as possible. Do you think I will do?"
               How proudly conscious of herself she was, how she plumed herself on that word of graciousness to the poor little mermaid! What admiration she read, whether it was legible or not, whether it was written or not, in the eyes that regarded her! Now she should, for her own soul's sake, have known what was passing in Mr. Falcon's mind at that very moment. But she had her mood, and so turned smiling away, tripping daintily over the carpet, a dazzling ray of light. Clarence had risen and walked away at the first sound of her voice. As she also vanished from sight, a voice very near to Susan said, in a low tone, repeating Mr. Leighton's query:
               "What is life?" and a pair of the most friendly eyes, not quite free from anxiety, however, fixed upon her.
               "That," answered Susan, pointing toward Isidore's path.
               "What is it?" he asked again, with the gentlest modulation. It lured the full heart into speech.
               "To be so beautiful—and to be loved so much."
               "Do you think so?" he said, and went slowly back again to the far corner of the balcony.
               Presently he returned to Susan.
               "Not the best life, it may be," he said, seriously, but so kindly that Susan felt in spite of herself disposed to believe him; "shall I tell you better words than you have spoken?"
               "Yes," urged the eager look the child fixed on him
               "You gave me the answer of longing youth that believes every shining thing to be worth striving after. I give you a better. And if you will not take it kindly now, you will some time. I'm willing to wait. You need not assent to what you cannot yet believe, and perhaps are not able to understand. But I tell you nevertheless. Some day it will have a sweet sound to you, I think. Love of truth and self-renunciation, these are what make the blessed life. I suppose you would not utter a falsehood on any account, Susan; but you might in some way or other, without knowing it, get into the habit of living one. Be true, Susan, and if you are that, you are everything—beloved of God, and all good people."
               Having said this he walked away again, and the poor child began to perplex herself forthwith, about the things he had said. Leaning against the balustrade, not over it, as he had done, looking down upon the flower-garden, among whose oddly-shaped beds the white walks wound brightly as a river, not stooping as he, with ever-helpful hand, to aid in its upward tendency the aspiring trumpet-flower, whose drooping vine, with a humanity it was impossible to conceal or control, he had fastened to a pillar with a cord; leaning there and so, in questioning idleness, she pondered his words, and was not happy thinking of them. She would not believe in their truth, even while all that she heard and saw induced the questioning, if not so, why thus and thus? In other words, a conviction of the fact his words dealt with, was in her mind, but in her heart she rejected and denied it.
               "Come, come, Falcon, this is folly, man! And you, too, Susan! what do you mean out here, and all this dew falling? Clarence, where are you? Come in, my son, come, all of you. I want you to read to me—I mean you, Susan. Look up something and let us have it."
               They were now in the drawing-room, having followed Mr. Baldwin in his rapid lead. Mr. Falcon pushed a book across the table, beside which Susan had seated herself. She opened it; the old man observed her. "Go ahead— 'a miss is as good as a mile'—read the first thing you come to—read till I tell you to stop, unless you are tired to begin with," said he.
               Then he stopped and looked at Susan, "I'm afraid you are tired to begin with?"
               'I had rather read than not," said Susan, and eager to prove her sincerity, she began at the first page at which she opened— 
                     
                        "Come, let us set our careful breasts,
                        Like Philomel, against the thorn,
                        To aggravate the inward grief
                        That makes her accents so forlorn;
                        The world has many cruel points,
                        Whereby our bosoms have been torn,
                        And there are dainty themes of grief
                        In sadness to outlast the morn,—
                        True honor's dearth, affection's death,
                        Neglectful pride, and cankering scorn,
                        With all the piteous tales that tears
                        Have watered since the world was born."
                     
                  
               
               "Stop!" thundered Mr. Baldwin, and, half laughing to see the effect of his uproarious interruption, he continued more moderately; "yes, yes, it's very pretty, I know; but that'll do. We don't want to hear about any of those piteous tales to-night—and as to setting our careful breasts against thorns, we look as if we could be drawn into that folly, don't we, Falcon, old fellow? You shall finish the reading to-morrow, Susy. Your reading suits me. Just tell your father that, when you go home. He and I are judges of good reading. There's the voice, and no getting rid of it. Kitty used to put me to sleep with her yawning, and whining, and stumbling, as sure as I had her in to read to me of an evening when Dora was away. The wench's heart was in the kitchen, with the rest of the gay folk. She and the parson served me the same trick: both of 'em in such a deuce of a hurry to get through with a bad job. Yes sir! Don't dispute that, Falcon. What do you know about it? If it had n't been for the ague, sir, that kept me out of the church all summer, I'm morally certain I should have helped that young brazen image of a calf down the pulpit stairs, and sent him about his business. But he was out of the way before I got round again, thank the Lord."
               "By the way," said Mr. Falcon, taking up the evening paper, "that is the most respectable act the city council has passed yet. The one passed to-day for the relief of the emigrants." Falcon had been waiting the last three or four hours for an opportunity for making this remark.
               "They're a pig-headed set of rascals," exclaimed Mr. Baldwin, warmly. "A pig-headed set of rascals, sir! The emigrants swarm like bees in the streets. It makes me feel as if I'd been stung within an inch of my life, when I walk through such a crowd. 'My poor baby, sir,'—'Not a mouthful of bread, sir, and the children starving,'—'Blind,'—'Crippled.' Good God!" Here Baldwin stopped short in his walk, and surveyed his listeners with a keen, hasty glance; then he went on in a milder tone, as if he would redeem the last expression from irreverence, "What will the common councilmen do? can they make a common sense regulation? or will they be a month longer adopting their resolutions, and another month finding out whether they're according to law and order?"
               "I met a woman in the street to-day," said Falcon, "who was bustling about, helping some poor wretches. She had gone down to see the new horde of arrivals—to help if she might. No tragedy queen I ever saw, delivered herself with more spirit, or more touching eloquence than she, when she told me of her countrymen. But when she told me her own story—I tell you, sir, there was pith in that matter. Will you hear it, sir?"
               "Hear it? . . . Go on, John Falcon. Have n't I seen the story looking out of your eyes these two hours? I'm willing you should cheat me, Falcon, but I can't help letting you know that I can find you out after all. Proceed with your story, man. I'll go bail for its edification. Susan, listen when Mr. Falcon speaks, and let no dog bark. Clarence, my son, bring the backgammon board—you shall teach Susan to play the game."
               And so Clarence brought the board, and placed the men; and Susan looked at Mr. Falcon, and listened; and, instead of taking his seat to engage in the game, as was his nightly habit, Mr. Baldwin stationed himself near Susan, prepared to aid Clarence in teaching her.
               And Mr. Falcon told his story—a tale of heroic endurance, and struggle, and self-sacrifice, that needed no embellishment at his hand, and certainly received none. It was a tale of humble life—its sorrow and joy—its temptation and deliverance—its cross and crown.
               "How much do you want for her, Falcon?" asked Mr. Baldwin, when his friend ceased speaking.
               "Not a dime, sir."
               "Well, then?"
               "The woman needs not a copper—but—"
               "Yes, yes. I understand. We'll talk about that in the morning; we'll show the city council up to itself. Gad! they're a parcel of brute beasts, sir—brute beasts, I say. Susan, my daughter."
               Susan looked up; distinctly she had heard it—he had called her "daughter," "my daughter!"
               "We are going to Harlem to-morrow. You are tired; perhaps we had better put off learning backgammon till another time."
               Half an hour after, Susan lay, with a happy smile on her young face, thinking of that word Mr. Baldwin had spoken so gently—so gently even in the midst of his passion about the councilmen. She went to sleep thinking of it. On the whole, that had been a happy day for Susan.
            
            
               
               LIV.
               ONE reason, and one only, had prevailed with Stella Cammon, inducing her to appear in the gay company to which Isidore and the colonel had already gone on the evening last recorded, and that was the rumor of Miss Watson's intended departure immediately from the city to her "place in the country," a few miles distant. To see her again, and, if possible, to speak with her, Stella appeared in a crowded drawing-room, ill prepared for that strife of rivalry with Isidore which people imputed to her.
               Her appearance had this sole motive; and, early in the evening, perceiving Miss Watson seated in an ante-room from which Dr. Borg was just emerging, evidently in search of some person or thing—some less-prepared antagonist—she broke away from the little knot of brilliant triflers of which she was the centre, and went hurriedly, yet with an assumed composure and deliberation, into that little ante-room. Direct in her manner as her purpose, and yet with exceeding grace, she paused before this lady, drew a rose-bud from her hair, and said, in a low voice, whose music and agitation did not escape the listener, who smiled upon her as she listened—"I am not, perhaps, a perfect stranger to you, lady, Miss Watson; you may have heard my aunt, Miss Mar, some time mention me. I would have asked an introduction, but that would have compelled a great formality, more tedious to you, I believe, than even this breach of etiquette of which I am guilty. I heard you were about to leave town; I wanted to speak with you—not as these people around us are speaking to each other. Will you accept this rose, in supply of all deficiencies—in the same spirit that I give it you?"
               "Sit down, my dear," said Miss Watson, a cordial smile brightening her dark, plain, but enchanting face. "You have attacked me on my weak side. Who ever heard of my refusing a rose?"
               "And will you take the bearer with it," said Stella, sitting on the divan beside the lady.
               "That will quite depend on yourself, Miss Cammon. But now tell me, for you must have something to say, tell me clearly and briefly, why have you come here to me? What do you want?"
               This was an ordeal to pass through, with such eyes on one as loomed, lustrous and piercing, from the somewhat heavy and projecting brow of the elder woman. But Stella was prepared for it; often, afar off, she had watched that wondrous glance, and was not, now that she had come under its immediate influence, disconcerted by it.
               "I knew," she said, her eyes downcast as she began to speak, but speedily uplifted, and calm, and confident, "I knew that you were a woman of large experience, and that you were in earnest. I had always heard so—and then, besides, I had seen you. I have wanted for a long time to come and say what I would like to say now. I wanted a wise friend. I felt lonely, and I do still. I have felt my need more keenly since I came to believe that it could be answered. That is all. I can only vindicate myself by saying—no, I will leave the vindication to you."
               Miss Watson still sat looking with those piercing eyes upon the handsome young face turned toward her. There were verily in that ante-room two living souls unheeding all the vexatious vanity, the jealousy, and dissipation separated from them only by a pyramid of flowers, and a trifle of lath and plaster.
               "My dear girl," she said, when Stella finished her brief speech; "if I were not sworn against yielding to all impulses, I should inevitably embrace you. As it is, sit still, and do not anticipate any such thing. Do you take me for an oracle? do you want your fortune told?"
               "No, Miss Watson."
               "What is it that you want?"
               "A little earnest thinking in the right direction."
               "I take that as a certain sign that you have had too much of it already."
               "Invite me to come to your place in the country, will you?"
               "I would gladly—but my place in the country, my dear, is but a nut-shell, and unfortunately, at least for you it may be, I have already engaged some friends to fill it. But you shall hear from me when they are gone."
               "And have I really not done an unheard of thing, putting myself on you in this way?"
               "My dear girl, talk no such nonsense. If I did not want you, I should say so. I assure you I do not take it as an intrusion; we have both of us liberty of speech, and for my own part, I know too well the delight of its free use to condemn another who is so bold as to adventure. But, I should really like to know how you achieved your freedom. How came you by the courage you have shown in the last five minutes? Believe me, that is about the extent of the information you can communicate to me at the present time."
               "I do not know. I find everything that people expect of me so unutterably wearisome."
               "Say not that, or I shall think that you are suffering from a disease: that you are romantic, sentimental, and on the point of becoming very religious."
               Stella was silent.
               "Understand," continued Miss Watson,"I mean no disrespect to religion—only if you take to it as a dernier resort, I warn you against that. You talk of my large experience. That has been a portion of it. I am plain of speech, you see. You are not quite so much a stranger to me as you seem to suppose. I know you are a thoughtful girl, disposed to make something of your life, and therefore you are entitled to confidence and respect. Understand then, to begin with, that I have a great deal in common with you. If in the faintest degree I have attained to a divine life, I have approached it through avenues; and those not the most smooth and shady. My human feet have walked in them. If what I have attained seems desirable to you, think of me as of yourself; a human being, and a woman, and use your intelligence—make an improvement on me in yourself. I am honest in this, and sufficiently interested in you, to hope that you may be successful in your attempt. If you can, and care to do so, use me for a stepping-stone. I am nearly forty years old—ah! you thought me younger? that is because my health never flags, and my spirits are always in good order. Take care of your health, and look after your spirits. Those are the wisest regulations I know of for success in happiness. In my youth I had a lover. He afterwards preferred my friend, and married her. After that I was obliged to do something for my own support, circumstances were such. I taught a school for ten or twelve years; and wrote some books. Last year I bought the Elms with the proceeds of my labor.
               "There are twenty acres of the farm, and I shall be sure of a living while I live. After I lost my lover, as I began to tell you, I was excessively depressed. Not for a day or two, nor for a year or two—facts never impressed me so lightly as that. I had actually lost myself in him. And when I was left with nothing but my rejected and impoverished self, I assure you I felt my poverty. In that mood I presently turned to God, whom I had forgotten until then. I elevated myself in my imagination as the special object of His providence. He had sent this grief on me—he had ordered that I should suffer; while, on the contrary, I was making my own grief, my own suffering—moaning over His dispensations in an utter mistake as to the nature of His government. That I saw my folly, and repented of it, you have certain proof in the fact that I am now neither fanatical nor ascetic. I am content with my fate. I never quarrel with it. I have earned a living, and learned the meaning of resignation. Be quiet and calm, if you can; if you cannot, yours will be the loss; impatient striving gets no manner of acceptable compensation. Understand as much of life as you can. It may or may not have a mystery—that depends on the manner of sympathy that exists between your eye and your thoughts. Be cheerful. Recollect that the universe is a broad one, and the nearsighted soul has, of course, the most contracted vision. You are a needful part of the great whole. Esteem yourself of high worth on that account. It is of infinite importance that every vein and sinew of that glorious body should perform its proper function. If the tiniest blood-vessel breaks, there is an immediate result, visible in discoloration: the body is not so fair as it might have been—as it would have been, but for that wrong done to nature. Look at life rightly, and you will be calm and steadfast as the mountains. Nothing will dismay, or make you afraid. Believe that the best good is ultimately to be evolved, and the highest perfection to be developed; that is the most appropriate of all prayers that you can offer your Creator."
               Though the speaker was so calm, and spoke freely of herself, so directly from the convictions her experience had afforded, Stella could not quite receive this philosophy phy of life. She was too young, too full of life, too ardent, too impulsive, and withal, as yet, more eager "to do" than "to be."
               This Miss Watson perceived, even while she spoke; but she nevertheless went on with what she had to say, till she had said it all, and then she added:
               "On these points we do not agree? Very well. We both believe in LIFE, and that is the essential thing—the rest is comparatively unimportant—for if we really believe, we shall justify and do honor to our faith. It is the result of all true thinking and believing. If all the world were to assemble in London there would be a pouring in from east, west, north, and south. So it is with the kingdom of heaven; our route varies according to our locality. The main point being to get there, every man and woman must make choice of what his guidebook assures him is for him the most direct route."
               "Miss Watson, you say to me, or you intend it, that quiet and repose of mind is what I need. Shall I sit down to embroideries, and expend my superfluous energies in fatiguing evening entertainments, where I shall make a wreck of myself inevitably, and countenance others in doing the same thing?"
               "My dear . . . what do you want? A revolution— a disorganization? That is rank foolishness, incendiary, and anti-philosophical."
               "Some sort of action I must have. The world's work is done by human hands, Miss Watson. Everything on earth, every social element seems so broken, so distorted —harmony and order must come out of it—a great calm of perfect beauty and fulfilled purpose, I think—and that is what makes me so impatient, when people bid me be quiet and calm. I have energy and hope. I cannot understand what you have just said. I desire to labor. Is there no work to be done?"
               
               "If you desire, why not do it? This rose you brought me, teaches as much as that. How perfect it is when it grows according to nature—but let a worm creep in, or an untimely frost try to improve and reform it! If it opens according to its law, its beauty and fragrance are sure, you may rely on it as on the rising of the sun. Learn this lesson—open to the light—with your face gazing upon heaven; give freely to the air, which is the common breath of life, all the fragrance that you have. Is it not still yours, though the passing wind bears it away into a distant sick chamber, or past the toiling man, or the poor woman who sits in her dreary home, and fights with her needle all the spectres who come to terrify her little children? Live according to your law. Do not put darkness for light . . . Assuredly you shall come to the Elms. I will get rid of my housefull, and carry you off captive, if there be no other way. You should not have delayed until this hour to come to me;—not that I can do any great thing for you. But I like you. Books and preaching are worth very little except as recreations; we must discern truth with our own eyes, or it is never ours. If a writer or a speaker does us good, it is not in the way of teaching. Within us is our teacher. If you buy a house and furnish it, the property is yours—you hold the deed; but it belongs to its originators in a deeper sense than to you. You brought not these things into the world with you, neither can you carry them out—but their originators can. What is educed from your own mind is yours—to be enriched and cultivated, or to be left like 'an heath.' You may in this sense be as rich, or as poor, as you choose. Now, I put it to you, have you not here a work to do?"
               "Is that the sum of it?" asked Stella, thoughtfully.
               "Of my philosophy? Yes."
               "It does not satisfy me, honestly it does not."
               "Will you take back the rose, then?"
               "On the contrary, I would be glad to renew its language every day that I live."
               "As a Romanist," said Miss Watson, speaking in that same slow and measured tone that gave significance to every word she said, and seemed, what it really was, a voluntary, respectful tribute to her thought, "you hold, of course, to the faith of works. My philosophy, as you call it, is even more exacting than your faith. Its demands are less easily satisfied. It demands a never-ending work, a life of goodness, a life of perfect harmony. Its penance, confession, and absolution, are deep, profound, internal facts of belief, which yours but symbolize. I do not intend to disparage; the comparison stands for itself. I do not ask you to renounce your belief; but make it more entire, follow it out until you reach its essential cause—its sovereign necessity."
               "Miss Watson, why, if I may ask it—"
               "Go on, my dear."
               "Why did you write books?"
               "Because it was as evidently a part of my business as breathing or eating."
               "Why, then, do you write none now?"
               "For the same reason that I shall presently cease to breathe, and be delivered from necessity of eating. I have said all I had to say. I have actually told all I know, which is a confession you would never draw from a gossip. There is with them always something kept back worth more than all they have told. At least they manage to leave that impression on their listener's mind."
               Stella was silent. Miss Watson rose, after a brief pause. "Come, you should join the dancers," she said. "More than a dozen young gentlemen have looked wishfully and enviously into this room since you came. Your duty lies in every direction; wherever there is a call made for you, go there and do your best. Your personal influence is not to be undervalued—the moment you doubt it and shut yourself up, put stakes around yourself, and make your manner inaccessible, that moment you sin egregiously. Recollect that the rose does not allow its green leaves to screen it—as a bud it is so folded up, and must be; but as a rose it stands out alone, and every eye may rejoice and refresh itself in it. Dance, if it will please others; sing, if any ear longs to hear you. Give a reality, a tangibility to the joys of social life. Believe that, and believe it not only as a theory, but as something practicable, to be realized and exemplified. Your sphere will be large or small, according to your gifts to fill it; whether large or small, you will find it sufficiently exhaustive of talent, and time, and strength. Have I not prophesied truly? There is your partner advancing towards us: he is hoping that you will not disappoint him; now use your woman privilege; add to his evening's enjoyment, but do it in a way that will elevate all women in his regard for ever. You can do it in the lightest conversation, in what seems the idlest moment, and most trivial occupation."
               Stella responded to this injunction to the letter; and her interview with Miss Watson was for the evening at an end.
            
            
               LXVI.
               WHILE Stella was listening to the preaching of this gospel, before her confessor, Father Francis, Miss Mar was kneeling, and revealing the trouble of her heart; and De Lisle Layard, waiting for her, walked up and down the broad stone flagging before the convent and the church.
               The church is dark—but one lamp, near the altar, is lighted, and the shadows fall heavily around the woman's kneeling figure; her voice is subdued to a whisper, but what it says is well known to the heart of him who keeps his solitary watch. He is more impatient than she even, for the final end of all this struggle, which, in its progress, he understands so well.
               "Recommend to her," said the priest soothingly, "by your own holy example, our blessed faith. I do not fear the result. She, who has seen in you these many years the beauty of its truth, will not long be unconscious, or lethargic, nor wickedly suspicious. The Church does not look upon her as lost. Be not so distressed; prayers shall be daily offered for her soul's salvation, that she fall not into deadly heresy. God careth for His own children. If we are faithful, think you that He will fail? Pray, and wait, daughter; but do not argue with her. That were but to foster the natural vanity of the heart. Error must not have such deference shown to it."
               "She will not read the books you left for her. I saw her look at them, and I said how excellent they were, but she answered that they did not satisfy her. I did not ask her why. I waited; holy father, for help and direction."
               "That is right. Trust still in God. It is the ardor of youth, the natural vanity of a mind puffed up inordinately. You hear no more now of her desire to enter the convent?"
               "Nothing, father."
               "Liberty is a great blessing, but it is full of danger to the young. She will of herself, led by the blessed Holy Spirit, soon come to understand it; and then she will also of herself ask wisdom, not of her own heart, but of the holy Church."
               "Oh, father, I fear," sobbed the voice of Miss Mar. "It does not seem like a day's wilfulness, but something deeper. She has had an awful struggle with the dreadful tempter."
               The holy father within the confessional did not receive the trembling words in the spirit of their utterance; he was evidently quite as fearful of nature as of the devil.
               "Did she come of a believing and faithful generation?" asked he. "Ought we to look to see her thinking for herself, and thinking rightly at the same time? We must pray and wait. Such is the will of God."
               "And she shall be saved at last, father? Do you say she shall?"
               "I trust in God. We will hope that she is not the heir of perdition. I myself will soon see her again. I can promise nothing more. But we can humiliate our-self in prayer and fasting before God. We must sacrifice. It is a great blessing that we seek. Day and night must witness our faithfulness in seeking."
               "But, holy father, I am not equal to her in argument."
               "Said I not, refrain from argument? Satan may be in league with her, tempting her by giving her words that have the sound of wisdom. Strive not so much in her behalf; strive not as you have striven. The Church does not so instruct you. Pray—watch—fast. That alone is your duty in this thing."
               
               With a comforted, relieved heart, Miss Mar went away from the confessional, and left the church. She went out slowly through the gloom, striving to remove the evidences of her recent great emotion, for her tears had fallen like rain, and her voice had been tremulous with her trouble.
               When he saw her emerging from the door-way, Layard advanced hastily, offered his arm in a silence which she appreciated, and was not swift to break.
               "How strange it is," she said at length, as they approached her house, "that none except those who have experienced the comfort of it, can understand the holy peace that such an half hour as I have spent can bring to one. Holy Catholic Church! well may thy children bless thee!"
               To which fervent utterance De Lisle answered, as one whose interest was deeply roused in the very subject, and as though her words were an infinite relief to him, opening thus the way for his own speech.
               "Blessed, indeed, must they be who are rooted and grounded in your beautiful faith. The children of such a mother may well rejoice; the magnificent cathedrals which arise, invariably, the world over—as soon as there are, in societies, the least tokens of worldly prosperity—are the best testimony the holy mother needs. Her children's reverence and gratitude are sure to do her honor. This is the great glory of the Catholic Church, that she has such a loving and devoted family. I never met one of your spiritual brethren, Miss Mar, who was not open to her calls."
               "And yet some among you are so cruel as to call this devotion superstition," said Miss Mar, whose heart rejoiced with great joy to hear these beautiful words from the professor. Insensibly, the hope that she had allowed to centre in Stella Cammon was centering in this godly youth, for whose conversion she was ready to perform any act of penance.
               "No true man ever said it," returned Layard with spirit. "All true men understand well that THE CHURCH is the grandest growth of the ages. It is the tree rooted in earth, whose branches reach to heaven; its leaves are for the healing of the nations."
               "Oh, De Lisle, it makes me so happy to hear you saying that! I knew you must believe it. De Lisle, let me go back with you to Father Francis I will do sentinel service for you as you did for me. Go you in, and rejoice that good man's heart, by confessing that the holy mother, the Church, has another loving son."
               "Not now," hesitated Layard.
               "But why not now? You ought not to deprive yourself of one of the unspeakable consolations, joys and satisfactions, that our dear mother can impart. Oh, go now, De Lisle."
               "Not yet," he repeated. "I have still many things to learn. It is a great step for a man just taking a place in life. I will not conceal it from you—so many momentous affairs will grow out of, and depend on this step, that I cannot take it rashly. I have, undeniably, a career before me, if I go on in the way I have begun. You will perceive, then, it is no slight thing to give up a creed in which my mother taught me. I must study further—I must understand myself and my ground. I would prefer you for my adviser and teacher, for the present at least, to Father Francis—whom, indeed, I greatly respect and admire. I must ascertain my own position in regard to this thing before I surrender myself to another. In taking you into my confidence, my best friend and benefactor, I do not consider that I make any surrender. It is like speaking to myself. Well I know, you have heaped proof upon me, that my fortune in life is dear to you. You would not have me make rash haste in this momentous concern. You would not have me bind myself to vows which I might be liable, from weakness of faith, to break or do discredit to."
               "Oh, De Lisle, I am so deeply thankful!" murmured Miss Mar, who already saw the youth by her side arrayed in a bishop's robe, high in authority, advancing by his talents and her fortune, high in favor and office! "But, dear De Lisle, trust in some other beside yourself, as our blessed mother teaches. Consider, it is not your own power that is to make you strong. Oh, when I think what you may do in the world—what your influence may be—what it might immediately effect in at least one wavering soul!"
               De Lisle Layard so well understood the point at which he aimed, that he quickly endeavored to turn Miss Mar's thoughts from that direction which they were now taking, by presenting to her more fully the immense sacrifices he would make in giving up the creed of his childhood for another in his manhood, until he had made out a very fair case of martyrdom. To which Miss Judith responded even as he would have had her; but that did not prevent her returning, and so swiftly that he could not apprehend it, to the point he had deftly waived. Her earnest sincerity outran his cunning.
               "If Stella could but know this! if you could only come out now at once, oh, what a world of anxiety you would save me!"
               He rebuked her heart's too eager desire.
               "It would be at my soul's peril—it might be, Miss Mar. You attribute too much power to my influence. It might prove a blind leading of the blind—and there is the fatal ditch before us."
               "I am so anxious about her," responded Miss Judith, rather penitently. "I do not—I would not hurry you—I only thought that perhaps you were too deliberate. And I am very certain that you underrate, and not that I overrate, your influence with her. Still, De Lisle—but it hardly seems needful or proper that I should say it—if you wish it, what you have said is as safe with me as with yourself."
               "And I know," answered he, with a demonstration of grateful thanks in his voice, "I know that setting aside what I acknowledge must be a source of painful interest and anxiety to you, you will agree with me that the great acts of a man's life should be wrought with deliberation."
               
               "And when I remember that you were never careless when you had an end in view, or a wish at heart that might be accomplished, I ought not to give myself any uneasiness—yet I hope so much—but, not another word! my dear De Lisle, when you come to a conclusion; not another word on the subject! Come and tell me when you have anything to tell."
               "And must I regard myself in exile until then? it may be—a long time."
               "And you will need to know every morning if your old aunty slept well, and every evening if she has had a good day . . . No! no! be sure you do not fail to come twice a day at least to gossip . . . Well, then, good-night." If all the blessings that good old trustful soul called down on the young professor went with him in the shape of guardian angels, he was well attended.
               Meanwhile the saintly Theresa, who also early in the evening had contemplated a confession, and after conference with Father Francis as to the prospects of the church in St. John's—who, in particular, had desired to make some question in reference to the conversion, ascertained or suspected, of Mr. De Lisle Layard—tidings of which had come to her in Miss Mar's revealed hope, and the confused confessions of Stella Cammon, she, waiting and watchful for the proper moment, was fortunate in getting to bed at ten o'clock without discovering it. For confession on her part was a work of supererogation; and as to De Lisle Layard, the less she knew and had to do with him in speculation, reflection, or individual contact, the better for her.
            
            
               LVI.
               AND here we are again at Harlem;—heartily I wish that Susan Dillon were safely landed at the beach, for this very day she is to make her transit from St. John's Hall to the fisherman's humble cabin. I wish from my heart, I say, that she were there.
               But before we can attempt any removal of the kind, we have to see what the Chilton family is doing in the way of "getting along."
               All the morning Mrs. Chilton has been in a state of dire perplexity and great disgust.
               And Horace, standing at the accountant's desk in the back part of the druggist's shop, biting his pen and musing, is in quite as narrow a strait of tribulation as his mother, though his anxiety, or trouble, or wrath, whatever the feeling or spirit may be, has shown itself in a manner quite different from hers.
               Leah, too, in her school-room, is abstracted and sad; there is not as much sunshine in the shed as usual, yet somehow the place seems hotter and more uncomfortable than ever before—Leah's task seems lifeless because her heart is heavy to-day. There really seems to be nothing but trouble in the world—in all this fair sweet world, with its holy morning hours, its glorious days, its nights of rest, nothing but vexation of spirit and distress.
               And it all came of the green note that was brought to the house at breakfast time!
               Such an out-and-out villany of imposition! A familiar note to Mrs. Chilton, penned by a Harlem hand, and written on green paper that bore on its surface the finger print of the dirty boy who brought it. But there was something beside, something more than all this, or the family had hardly been thrown into such commotion by it.
               Let us steal in on their reflections.
               Mrs. Chilton sits with her hands folded, looking into space, vacantly, and meditating in the midst of sighs.
               "I wonder Mr. Butler can sleep in his grave. This looks very little like the time when all the world followed our move; when we had our carriage and footmen—the servants all in livery—for all the world, as poor dear Belvidere used to say, what a lovely man he was! like a foreign nobleman's establishment! Talk about resignation! It would take a fool to be resigned under the circumstances . . . I ought to have died twenty, years ago. I should have gone out of the world with some grace then, but to drag one's self out at this rate! Such a miserable old dilapidated crone as I'm getting to be now. It does seem as though I weren't worth carting off the ground. Janet, odious creature that she was, used to say there would come a change. I never loved her the better for that. And that reminds me of what somebody said, a prophet never has any honor in his own country.
               "There's Leah, poor thing! she ought to have a chance in the world. She's handsome, only a great deal too good for this world, as they say—and too still. She couldn't make a mark anywhere, to be sure; but she might make a match. I don't know anything more terrible than to have grown-up children on one's hands. But this Scroggs woman's impertinence exceeds anything I ever heard of. Take Leah Chilton into partnership indeed! open a large school! hire the old session-room! Do a 'smashing business,' I suppose she means. Good gracious! If I recollect her, it's the pale, sickly looking creature with red hair, and a stoop in her walk—a creeper—wore a pink silk tawdry bonnet trimmed with black lace last winter. A red-haired woman in a pink bonnet! She has her answer by this time. I hope she may understand it." And the widow smiled bitterly, as if she felt a little triumph as she recalled the reply she had written to Miss Scroggs' proposition. "Poor Leah! if the child only had some spirit—she is too dead-and-alive—too meek; she's all Chilton. It vexes me. Your pieces of perfection were always my stumbling-block, and here I have one under my own roof! . . . It is astonishing how some people get on in the world. The Baldwin tip-tops, for instance. Ishmael Baldwin owes me a good many favors. But people forget such things—'out of sight out of mind' is in the catechism that the used-to-be's have to study. Everybody makes a tool and a stepping-stone of his neighbor, till it's hard to tell who in the end will get on the fastest. Nobody understands these things better than I. When my dress is finished I will make one bold push of it, and go up and ask old Ishmael to give my son a helping hand. That Mr. Falcon might be of use, and little Susan too. There seems to be no one capable but myself in this business. Leah would be sure to throw cold water on it, and Horace would scatter the brands about, and put the fire out, thinking to make a better one . . . Let me see . . ."
               And with knit brow Mrs. Chilton meditated, planned, and plotted. Comforting herself with her vague hope, as though it were an established one, she forgot the grievous wound her poor pride had received that morning.
               Though she had no faith whatever in her son's ambitious desires, none in his talents, still her scepticism did not result from her apprehension of any defects in his character, or ability, that would prevent his success as an architect; her doubt was as vague as her new hope—nay, still more vague—for the hope had an object to attain now clearly in view. But Chilton's fate was ever in her recollection, and his career she held to be prophetic of his son's. And yet, now that she thought again, and in this connection, of the Baldwins . . . what if he should, through the patronage (it was a stinging word, but she made use of it) which his father never found—finally, splendidly succeed. Oh! what brilliant dreams were appended to this imagining of the widow Chilton's heart! How she beheld herself, and not as in a dark glass, darkly! the soul of the family fortunes, advancing them all, from Horace, through Leah, down, even to herself!
               No such thoughts as these, no such daring speculations, visited Horace in the counting-room, as he tried, but not with any good success, to go on with his work.
               "By heaven! I have hit it at last! I shall stand this no longer. I will not sell the tools, but I might as well, out and out, for all the good I shall get of them. I will go up to St. John's to-morrow, and make some arrangement—pawn them, if I cannot do better. And the devil take that school! The devil take me if I ever get into such a scrape again. Leah shall not keep it another day . . . Mother is so shallow! but then, she has some of her old feeling left, of course; and I suppose it is hard to be snubbed by such an old withered curmudgeon as Miss Scroggs. It would n't have been so unbearable for her, though, if the name had not been Scroggs! and if she had not written the note on green paper, and sent it by a ragamuffin at breakfast time. But it makes no great difference after all . . . There is no use keeping the tools—but mum's the word, or we shall have another row among the women. I never shall use them . . . never . . . I'm collapsed; I've fallen. That green note has taken the wind out of my sails. Rot in the harbor, ship! in place of gallant sailors, rats shall inhabit thee. 'Nothing ventured, nothing lost;' it reads so, or it ought. Noble wisdom of the ancients, I bow before thy teaching. Henceforth I venture, I lose, nothing. Folks make money, and they do it by attending to their business. Pill-boxes, soda-water, broken legs, and influenza, all hail! henceforth forevermore, I 'm your obedient servant. Curved spines are all the curvatures I will affect; the machinery for fractures shall exhaust my power of invention . . . 'Write me down an ass,' oh, Futurity. And so farewell to you, pleasant dream of years! Go cheat some other ignoramus, the world is full. Reeve & Co., one-half gill of rose-water: Thomson, one Seidlitz-powder." The writer's pen again, for a moment, hovered in air, but the next moment it dashed into the midst of accounts, and Horace did not change his position, nor lift his eyes from the books, until the church bell-rang for noon. Does the reader think he has achieved the greatest triumph that is ever achieved by mortal, even the conquest of himself? . . .
               "Six times twelve . . . yes, that's right, go on . . . Willie, your face is n't improved any by the ink you are rubbing over it . . . put up your apple, Charles, until recess . . . now let us have a little more quiet, dear children, and we shall all get on better" . . . and distracting as the pain is that darts through her temples, occasionally quite blinding her eyes, the mild voice of the teacher indulges only in such enunciation as this. No complaint, no groan escapes her. Her word among the children is sufficient. Willie renounces himself so far as to suspend the savage adornments of his countenance; and all the rest of the little prisoners, for half an hour, go on soberly with their tasks, and do their best in trying to remember where they are, and who it is they are obeying.
               But the teacher's thoughts are not to-day absorbed in her occupation; they are not wholly merged in the small voices, and small faces, and slight tasks of the children. While she goes through her duties, and smiles on this timid one, and gently reproves another more boisterous, helps on the faltering, smooths the way for the stumbling, and directs the bewildered looks over the daubed copy-books with as much interest, apparently, 
                     as as
                     as
                   if they were rare specimens of art, turns the hem for those who are learning to sew, and performs that incomprehensible feat in the "seam needle" for the girl who is learning to knit, she is sometimes, while in the midst of all these occupations, thinking of other things; deploring, in the depths of her tender heart, that Miss Scroggs should have done so ill-advised a thing as to address her mother on that unfortunate subject of the school-teaching, at a time when all things were going on so smoothly, and she was congratulating herself so heartily on the favorable turn her mother's thoughts seemed to have taken concerning it.
               But this, too, must be borne quietly. It was not for herself that Leah felt troubled on account of it. Were not such scenes as this they had gone through this morning, her mother's weak crying out against what she was pleased to call fortune, the very scenes to provoke still further that wild and rash temperament, not latent, not inert, in Horace! When he went away after breakfast he was in a rage. The look with which he had regarded her haunted Leah. It was a look in which anger, and shame, and sorrow were combined. There was no such thing in his soul as patience. In his aspiration, and the struggle it had ever occasioned, she saw what gave her constant anxiety in his behalf. Well content was she to work with him, to accomplish that end which he seemed more than all things to desire. For this reason she would have been gladly willing to accept the proposition of Miss Scroggs, to do anything which would enlarge their income, and make the way of their advancement easier to him. Her brother's ambition was all the guaranty she needed of his success. She had full faith in his genius—she was ready for sacrifice on that altar: she regarded it as a trust which should be religiously occupied and improved. With solemn, but steadfast, gaze she regarded the difficulties which impeded him. His gift brought its own demands. He must use it. He must make it productive of good, and honor. That he did not himself set this high estimate upon it, she would not, even in her most secret thought, allow. Her heart had many excuses for him. He was impatient, as youthful genius always is; all his characteristics, as she understood them, were those belonging to a high order of genius. He had all her sympathy, and her deep, pure, exhaustless love. Her patience never tired in his behalf . . . She longed now to say these things to him. Had he not gone away so quickly she would have said them with different words from any she had ever made use of for such speech before . . . How long the morning seemed in passing; would it never be noon?
               Yet this is she—this sadly-thinking, nobly-resolved woman—who shears every whispered word addressed to her—who answers every question the little busy students can think to ask—who takes the book of fairy tales from the hand of the idler, with a remonstrance the faintest and mildest; for fain would she have sat down, instead, beside that little one, to read, with such wondering eyes and enchanted eyes as hers, the marvellous tales of fairy. This is she by whom the school hours of those little children are made pleasant and cheerful as the hours of a holiday, though her head is racked with pain, and the morning hours are so long.
