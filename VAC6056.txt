                        To the pale realms of shade, where each shall take
                        His chamber in the silent halls of death,

               CHAPTER I.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Yet be sure, my child,
                           Howe'er a dream thy fancy hath beguiled,
                           
                              Some sorrow lurks to cloud thy future fate;

                           Must still be shed—and 'twere as vain a thing
                           To ask of nature a perpetual spring,
                           As to evade these sad autumnal hours,
                           Or dream thy path in life should bloom all flowers."
                        
                     
                     MRS. NORTON.
                  
               
               "Helen!" said Mrs. Raymond, as she entered abruptly her daughter's apartment, with the air of one who has something pleasant to communicate, "Helen!" she paused, for her eye rested on a picture which should have met a painter's gaze. A young girl, in a half-undress, lay reclining on a couch near one of the windows. The rich glow of a summer sunset filled the room, and lighted a face of uncommon beauty. The features were perfect in their pure outline, and large dark eyes, made very lively a face, which otherwise might have been considered rather tame in expression. The hair, a mass of rich dark curls, was thrown back from the brow, and fell to the waist in long and perfect tresses. The sweet countenance was turned with an earnest gaze upon the sunset sky; but it was evident from its expression, the maiden's thoughts were not of the purple and golden clouds, nor the fair scene they lighted, of wood and water spread away as far as eye could reach. Well might that mother pause, and hesitate to disturb so beautiful a picture!
               "Helen," again said Mrs. Raymond in a louder tone, "Helen, my love!" and seating herself by Helen's side, she kissed the fair up-turned brow, with a mother's fondness for her only child.
               "Ah! mother," exclaimed Helen, with a look of great earnestness, "I have been so wishing for you! Mother, you promised once to tell me dear Ida Maynard's history. Tell me now, please," she continued winding her arms about her mother's neck with a kiss; "tell me now, for dear Ida's tears flowed freely to-day, at some sad memory I had innocently recalled."
               A pained look crossed Mrs. Raymond's countenance, but after a moment, though there was an evident tremor in her voice, she replied:
               "I had not intended, my Helen, yet a little while, to give you the painful incidents connected with our dear Miss Maynard's life. Young as she still is, there is so much of the sorrowful to relate, that I shrank from the sad tale on account of your youth and ignorance of grief; but"—and the mother paused, and hesitated ere she added—"if you still desire it, come to me to-night before you retire to rest. Go now," she continued, with a gentle smile, as she placed in her daughter's hand an open box containing a richly chased gold ring, "and write a note of thanks to your aunt Mary for this token of remembering kindness. The bearer waits below."
               With a delighted look, and an expression of warm admiration, the young girl received her aunt's gift, and hastily fastening a simple dress about her slight figure, she left the room to do as her mother desired.
               Mrs.Raymond gazed after her with a fond look, yet with eyes filled with tears, while a prayer went whispering on the evening wind, "God keep my darling safe for Heaven!"
               That night, as Helen came to receive her "goodnight" kiss, she again preferred her request, and her mother placed in her hands the written history she had penned; "Read, my Helen! and may Ida's God be yours!" And the morning stars were in the sky, ere Helen laid aside the manuscript, and sought her pillow, which was wet with many tears before she slept.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER II.
               IDA MAYNARD'S HISTORY.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           ——"But deeper things than these
                           With woman's lot are wove;
                           Wrought of intensest sympathies,
                           And nerved by purest love.
                           By the strong spirit's discipline,
                           By the fierce wrong forgiven,
                           By all that wrings this heart of sin,
                           Is woman won to Heaven."
                        
                     
                     N. P. WILLIS.
                  
               
               "Ernest, we must part!"
               "Never, Ida! never! so long as your heart's voice goes with me! You can not, will not, dare not, give me up, because a conscientious fancy bids you. We are one: you do not even attempt to deny this, and yet you would madly consign me, as well as yourself, to a lonely fate. Listen! our hearts beat in unison!" and as he spoke, the lover took the lady's hand, and placed it on his heart. "Listen, Ida!"
               For a moment the lady yielded to the gentle pressure which detained her hand; then suddenly releasing it, she knelt at his feet, and with one hand pointing upward, and with her dark eyes raised reverently to Heaven, she spoke:
               "One in all things, Ernest? Is God in Heaven? is Christ the sin-sacrifice? is the Spirit powerful to change men's hearts? Believe this, and we are one. Until then we are parted. Did I yield now, or hereafter, to one who looks not for protection to the great Omnipotent, in love and fear, I would soon be weeping in remorse, over a broken idol, for my love would bring its own punishment. My religion must conquer my love, if it lead me astray. Farewell! God keep you, Ernest! May His powerful Spirit touch at last your heart!"
               As she uttered the last words, the maiden bent forward, and could have kissed the hand of him, who bending over her, had listened earnestly to her, and then have left him, but casting his arms about her, he said quickly,
               "Is this your firm resolve, Ida? Do you mean to send me forever from you?" As he spoke, the lover bent down, and gazed pleadingly into her dark eyes, till they closed with emotion. Oh! the agony of that gaze, thrilling even to the heart's core! The delicately tinted cheek became colorless, the heavy-fringed eyelids trembled, and the thin nostril dilated as with pain, yet the sweet lips wore an expression of almost painful firmness. The young martyr to her faith was unmoved in her resolve. He saw this, yet said once more,
               "Must we part thus, Ida?"
               "Even thus, Ernest!"
               "Then you recklessly cast from you a love which would have made you happy! I say it, Ida! for you too will be made miserably wretched by this mad separation. When you pray again, think of the heart you have crushed!" He raised the head that lay droopingly on his shoulder, parted the shining curls from the fair brow, and looked long into the sweet face, now drenched with tears for his sake; then pressing a wild kiss on cheek and brow, he left her.
               With a gesture almost of despair, Ida sunk down upon a sofa near the window, and watched to see him depart. He went with a high, proud look, and crimson flushed cheek, but she knew and felt for the agony within. The horse he rode seemed fiery, unmanagable, but a fiery spirit tamed him to gentleness. So he rode away with no backward glance.
               "God be his guide and mine!" and the weeping girl buried her face in the cushions, in a sorrowful yearning wretchedness, none but the deeply loving and unselfish can conceive. A prayer for strength murmured at intervals, brought at last peace to her stricken heart. Ernest had come and gone—thattrial was over. Dreary indeed, and dark, looked the coming years, but an ever-trusting faith prayed for the sun of righteousness to arise and shine, and the stricken one was not forsaken in her hour of bitter need.

                        "These are words of deeper sorrow,
                        Than the wail above the dead;
                        Both shall live, but every morrow
                        Wake us from a widowed bed."

                     MISS. SEDGEWICK.
                  
               
               Ida Maynard is now in the fourth year of her orphanage. Her mother, whom she remembers as possessed of exceeding beauty, had been married by her father, a man of sensitively refined tastes, and high intellectual endowments, while yet in the freshness of her surpassing loveliness. He had met with her while on a journey in the south of Europe, where she was traveling under the care of her guardian uncle, an eccentric and indulgent old bachelor of fifty. To see her was to love. He had at last he imagined found the cherished creature of his dreams; a being perfect alike in person and mind; for his imagination supplied the graces, intellectual and moral, so necessary to make a woman truly beautiful, and which he deemed indispensable for his wife to possess. In one short month from the day he had first met with her, they were married, and for a time he seemed to have mounted to the highest pinnacle of human bliss. With no care, loving and beloved, he lived for a time in the enchanted palace of joy, completely bound up in the existence of one whom he thought realized all his visions of earthly, even angelic perfection. Her dark eyes seemed to answer eloquently, his high aspiring thoughts, and at a burst of glowing enthusiasm on his part, the only sympathy he required was a mute pressure of her gentle hand. But this lasted not long. Reality's stern hand removed, though in mercy gradually, the veil, the mist, which had obscured for a space the clear light of reason. He was startled at times by an inane expression from her lips, but she seldom spoke, and he forgot it when he looked in her faultless face. He was surprised, too, at her apparent want of interest in some favorite author, from which he read aloud; and once the lady actually slept through the reading of an exquisite poem. At last, with the aid of a sobered judgment, he gained power to see the goddess who had ruled with such a despotic sway his deathless intellect through his heart, in her true light, and fearful was the deformity, the almost degradation, that now met his eye, compared with what in his insanity he believed her to be. In very deed, he had loved a doll, a creature beautiful to gaze upon, but like those brilliant birds of a southern clime, which charm the eye with gay plumage and graceful motion, but when the pleased beholder listens, he finds them to his disappointment, songless—so with his young wife. The spirit, given to all in God's image created, in her, gave no token of its immortal calling. The casket so delicately fashioned, so exquisitely ornamented, was utterly gemless. Alas! for the discovery! That haughty man, proud of his genius's greatness, yet with no fear of the Omnipotent Ruler of the universe, shrank with abhorence from the mindless being he had taken to his bosom. She, whom he had raised high on a heart-shrine of love, then bent him down in mad idolatry before, he now turned from with a deep disgust that boded ill to both.
               Long ere the little Ida was a year old, her father was far separated from her mother, and she was as an orphan. What was to become of the little unconscious unfortunate? Her mother, selfish and indifferent, left her to the care of menials, while she sought, in the fashionable world, food for an inordinate vanity, the only strong passion of one, whose life was aimless as it was useless, even sinful. Fortunately, the child's nurse was an affectionate, prudent woman, and physically she was well cared for.
               When Ida had entered her seventh year, tidings came of her father's death in a far distant land. Unfeeling, and cold-hearted as Mrs. Maynard was by nature, yet the news of her husband's death, coming suddenly as it did, was a severe shock to her. The memory of the first few happy months of their marriage, came back, and the world-loving woman was touched by a feeling akin to remorse, when she thought how little she had cared to make him happy, or be what he desired. There was something of terror, too, to her weak spirit, when she remembered that he had died untended by any of his kindred. But after the first sad surprise was over, old feelings again had way, and she was gay and heartless as before.
               The only message that came from his lonely deathbed, to the dying man's nearest of kin, was a request, almost command, that the little Ida should be sent to live, until her aunt's death, with his only sister, Mrs. St. Clair, a childless widow, living in simple retirement in a far-away country town. He felt that she would be far safer with her pious cultivated aunt, than with a silly Godless mother.
               Without much regret on the mother's part, Ida and her nurse were sent to the residence of Mrs. St. Clair; and after the usual period of mourning was ended, Mrs. Maynard entered with renewed ardor upon the gay scenes of the world in which she lived, bestowing scarce a thought upon her child.
               Mrs. St. Clair was eminently fitted to undertake the education of young Ida Maynard. Like her brother, she possessed rich mental endowments, but unlike him she confessed her Father in Heaven before men. Talented, beautiful, and gentle-born, she had been as meek and lowly a Christian girl, as she was now a woman. She was one of those very few angelic characters, who seem from infancy to have no other desire, than the service and glory of God. Three years after her marriage with one well calculated to make her path in life lead happily to Heaven, she saw laid in the tomb her beloved husband, and a darling babe, just taught to lisp in her delighted ear, the tender name of mother. Sorely afflicted by the dispensation, she yet bowed to kiss the rod, and sought in prayer for strengthened faith, to await her appointed time on earth, now made so desolate to her by her loss. Her brother she had seldom seen since his unfortunate marriage, and she could only pray with a fervent spirit of hope, for one, who by his life, seemed to have forgotten the early morning and evening prayer, offered to God, with his mother's knees for his altar, in the fresh trust of loving, sinless childhood. When, therefore, his sweet child was brought to her at his dying request, with many tears she received her as a precious gem to be made pure, and polished for the Saviour's crown. And when Ida became, by her prayerful teaching and care, all that she could wish, a child of God, she felt that she was richly rewarded.
               To Ida's great personal beauty, were added a highly gifted, inquiring mind, and a noble, generous disposition. Endowed with superior reasoning powers, she soon learned to discover in any argument the weak points, and her aunt led her to employ her talent chiefly in combating the various doctrines of infidelity, aided of course by her own superior knowledge of the Bible. Thus Ida came to believe, as all should, that there is for men on earth, no strong hold like the word of God.
               As the years went and came, and Ida passed from careless childhood to more thoughtful girlhood, her aunt looked upon, and treated her more like a companion. Now that Ida could understand and converse intelligently with her, Mrs. St. Clair found pleasure in communicating to her some of her world-won, and oftimes bitter experience, and Ida was thus taught to expect shadows, as well as sun shine, upon her pathway through the world. Her aunt spoke often too, (though in no fault-finding vein) of many whom she had known in other days; of the different course of conduct each had pursued; leading the mind of her young listener to mark each final result. One narrative tive told thus, influenced and shadowed her whole life. She never forgot it. It was called forth by a remark of Ida's, after witnessing in awe-struck wonder, a terrific storm of thunder and lightning.
               "Dear Aunt!" said she earnestly, "could any one remain an infidel at heart, while gazing upon a scene like this?"
               "My dear child," said her aunt, "the human heart is desperately, stubbornly wicked; none but God can know it." Mrs. St. Clair remained for some moments lost in thought; at length she said, "your remark, Ida, recalled by association, the memory of a dear friend of my girlhood, who married one who denied the existence of a God. I do not think I ever shed bitterer tears than those I wept at her wedding."
               "Have you heard from her since? Do you know her history since her marriage? Pray tell me of her," asked Ida eagerly.
               "Well, Ida," said her aunt with a sigh, "listen then. I will tell you all, save the true names of the parties. I once knew a young and beautiful lady, who loved God with her whole heart, and who tried never to do a wrong deed, or think a wicked thought, and who prayed night and morning, that the Lord would guide her by his Holy Spirit. There was a gentleman who loved this lady tenderly, and whom she too loved. They had known each other a long time, and she had learned to look to him for much that gave her pleasure. At last, one day he came and besought her to let him take her, a bride, to his home. But the lady knew that he did not believe as she did, in the Bible; she knew that when he knelt beside her in the church, or at the hour of evening worship in her father's hall, his eyes were far oftener bent upon her, than closed in supplication. She told him, when he besought her to listen to his suit, that she feared she would do wrong, did she unite with one who so often knelt at prayer with no prayer in his heart. But he told her she could change him, and that she must teach him what she wished him to believe; that if she would not grant him her love, she would see him ere the next sunset, in his father's desolate house, a shrouded corpse, 'for the waters,' said he, 'will be kinder than Alice, and will take away the life she cares not for.' Then the lady wept, and besought him not to think of this great sin; so he kissed away her tears, and told her she could prevent it, and promised to endeavor to understand and believe as she did the Holy Bible. Then the lady's tears flowed still faster, and she hesitated, and at last promised to be all that he desired. Thus the proud Henry Herbert won the beautiful, gentle, and good Alice Mortimer.
               It was not until Alice was some years married, and there lay in her bosom a sweet babe, which she purposed 
                     
                        ——To guide,
                        Through tempters in the land,
                        Through dangers dread on ev'ry side,
                        In love, to God's right hand,
                     
                   that the young mother began to fear she had done wrong in marrying a man who lived as if there was no God in Heaven. Could she ask him to assist in the education of her child? As yet, no doubt as to her being allowed to give her boy a religious training, had crossed her mind. In the quiet retirement in which they had lived after marriage, she saw little of the infidelity she so dreaded, for all the good in her husband's nature was awakened in her presence, and he never willingly spoke a word, which he knew would give her pain. She never held an argument with him, but endeavored by a consistent conduct, and many prayers to God, to draw him from his error; she knew, indeed, little of the infidel doctrines which he believed; nor ever dreamed she, that he, her husband, held the selfish theory that it was best for a woman to be a religious being, as it beautified her character, and made her render more readily, the obedience lordly man requires. But her peaceful life was soon to end; her trial day came at last, and suddenly, and harshly she was awakened from her dream.
               When her child had entered its third year, and could lisp one or two connected sentences, she thought it would be a pleasant task to teach him of God and immortality. The young mind open for the mother's touch, received eagerly the teachings of her pious heart, and she was delighted to mark the progress of the boy's active intellect.
               One eve the father entered abruptly his wife's chamber, and found the little Henry at his mother's knee, lisping his infant prayer. A dark scowl gathered on his brow, and he spoke angrily—"Teach not the child this nonsense, Alice! I will not have my noble boy's mind, trammeled by such teachings," and fiercely flinging the flowers he had brought for her on the floor he left the apartment. Bitter, scalding drops fell like rain, upon the child's bent head. That mother wept not for her husband now, though she had often before shed tears in her prayers for him; nor for herself, though these were the first angry words he had ever addressed to her; but for her child she grieved. She knew that henceforth, he must no more kneel to pray with her as heretofore, for she had learned from her husband's look as he left the room, that his determination was fixed to prevent the religious training of the child, and she felt that nothing now remained for her, but to beseech God's mercy and pardon for her unblest marriage; to pray that Jehovah would in judgment remember compassion, and bring her with her precious ones to Heaven at last.
               That mother lives yet; for as I told you Ida, it is a true tale. Although she loves her noble husband and brave, kind boy, yet it is a fearful affection, having terror in its strength. When she thinks of their infidelity to God, for the boy is fast following in the father's footsteps, she is well nigh in despair. Each night and morning, nay! each alloted period of the day, sees that loving, God-fearing mother on her knees pleading for her beloved ones. "God be merciful to their souls," and fallen upon her face, on the tear-bedewed place of prayer, her attendants often find her, laid insensible. Is the Almighty deaf to her entreaty; is her sin never to be forgiven? Doubtless she will yet reap the reward of her patient prayers, and humble, trusting faith, for we have the promise, "In due time ye shall reap, if ye faint not," but the gentle Alice will still be worn with sorrow, and acquainted with grief."
               Ida had listened with breathless attention, and when the tale was finished, she still remained gazing up into her aunt's face, with a look of deep thought, seldom seen on so young and joyous a countenance. Mrs. St Clair drew her to her bosom, while she asked, "What would my dear Ida have done, had she been the lady Alice?"
               "Loved Mr. Herbert, Aunt Annie! but never married him till he prayed to God."
               And her aunt was satisfied.

               "Good morning, my love," said Mrs. St. Clair, as she entered the breakfast-room, and approached the open window where Ida was engaged feeding her bird. "See," she continued in a playful tone, "I have been twining a wreath for your birth-day; have you forgotten this is your nineteenth birth-morning? How very old my little girl is becoming." And as Ida knelt to have the garland of mingled green leaves and lily of the valley placed on her head, she stooped with a fond smile, and kissed the fair, up-turned brow of the kneeling girl. A feeling of love, and thankfulness to God arose in her breast, as she looked on the child of her adoption, for very beautiful and graceful had Ida grown, and in mind, as well as outward appearance, did she well reward the anxious care, her aunt had bestowed upon her. With one hand laid caressingly among the bright curls, Mrs. St. Clair went back in memory to the day when the helpless mother-neglected child, came by a dying father's wish, to her protection. The years had flown by on unseen wings since then, and she thanked God for the blessing that had sprung up beneath her desolate roof-tree.
               "Whose horse can Wilson be taking to the stable? suddenly said Mrs. St. Clair, as she observed the serving-man leading away an animal very unlike either those belonging to the simple equipage of his mistress. As she spoke and before she had time to call to Wilson for information, the room-door opened, and a tall distingué looking young man entered, and approaching Mrs. St. Clair folded her in his arms, while he pressed an affectionate kiss upon her cheek, saying as he did so,
               "Have you forgotten Ernest Montague, dear Aunt?
               "Dear Ernest! how delighted I am to see you! But how changed you are grown! I hardly recognize the little boy of years ago! she exclaimed, gazing up into the noble face which was bent with a loving glance upon her own.
               "Yes, Aunt, changed in all things, save my old love for you. I think still all about you is near perfection. Even those who love you," he added, glancing with undisguised admiration at Ida, who had unconsciously retained her kneeling position in the surprise of his abrupt entrance, and was looking beautifully in her aunt's garland. Confused, and blushing, she sprung to her feet.
               "Then you must consider yourself perfect also," said Mrs. St. Clair jestingly, "for according to your own confession, your love for me is unbounded. But I must introduce you to my niece, whom you have never seen, and whose forgiveness you must ask, for entering her presence unannounced." Accordingly she presented Ernest to Ida, who acknowledging gracefully the introduction, left the room at a summons from her nurse.
               "I wonder not Aunt, that you were reconciled to your loneliness, with such a companion in your solitude." Ernest said with enthusiasm.
               Mrs. St. Clair only smiled archly, while she begged him to remain for the day, an invitation which needed no urging on her part.
               Ernest Montague was the son of Mrs. St. Clair's husband's sister. His mother having died when he was an infant, the early part of his life had been passed with Mrs. St. Clair, whom he looked up to with a son's affection. When a boy of some fourteen years, he left his aunt, to accompany his father, on a journey through Europe. His tutor being invited by Mr. Montague to travel with them, his studies were pursued at intervals, as they remained a longer or shorter time at the different stopping-places on their route. After a year of travel, Mr. Montague decided to place Ernest at a celebrated European university, to finish his course of study, while he waited his release from college, at Rome, the resort of many cultivated persons, from all parts of the continent. Here he died, the very year to which he had so long and anxiously looked forward, which was to complete his son's studies, and bring him a companion to his side. After his father's death, on his release from a student's life, Ernest spent some time in making a tour of Europe, and some parts of Asia; and was now only returned to his parental estate, which lay some three or four miles distant from Heath-dale, Mrs. St. Clair's place of residence, His family mansion was large, well-built, and in good repair. "It needed" as Ernest remarked to his aunt on the day of his arrival, "but a little remodeling, and a woman's presence to make it an abode, fit for the residence of Pleasure herself."
               That night as Ernest Montague mounted his horse, after bidding his aunt, and Miss Maynard "Good night," he found his brain confused by a rush of bewildering thoughts, and his heart strangely stirred in his bosom. He attributed this emotion to his return to his early home, and to being surrounded by olden associations, after the absence of long years, spent among foreign people, and amid strange scenes. But ever and anon, as with loosened bridle-rein he slowly passed homeward, 'mid the trees, in the darkened path before, and close to him, beside his own, appeared a fair, sweet face, with long, shining curls, amid which lay enviously, green leaves, and delicate lily-cups. Once or twice with a half-spoken exclamation at his own fancy, he tightened the rein, and for a space hastened his horse's steps, but soon again was the pace slackened, and his thoughts wandering.—That night Ernest Montague lay down to rest, with Ida Maynard's name upon his lips, and a half-uttered hope to call her yet by the sweet name of wife.
               The next day, and the next, and the successive days for months following, found Ernest a warmly-welcomed visitor at the house of Mrs. St. Clair. Each morning ere the dew had been gathered to the sky again, saw him galloping swiftly in the direction of Heathdale, and each night, late, late sometimes in the white moonlight, saw his horse's returning footsteps. His aunt, and Ida came to consider his presence indispensable, in a walk or ride, or visit to some far-away country neighbor; and indescribably pleasant, were the long hours of each day spent in listening to Ernest reading aloud from some gifted author, or in hearing his interesting, or thrilling narratives of some curious, or fierce adventures of his own, in other lands. His mind was richly stored, and a child of genius, he found little difficulty in communicating his thoughts and feelings to his gentle auditors. They gave him little praise, for he needed none; he felt that he drew his inspiration from the dark eyes of Ida, which were often raised to his own, as with parted lips she listened with breathless interest, to his vivid description of some perilous encounter in which he had been engaged.
               Thus the days fleeted by. In the dreams of Ida came often the image of Ernest; and very oft in her sleep a listening ear might have heard his softly breathed name, spoken even then, in her sweet unconsciousness, with a crimson blush, deepening and fading in a moment.
               About this time, Mrs. St. Clair received a letter from Mrs. Maynard, which disturbed no little the tranquility of their lives for a short space. Mrs. Maynard had written at irregular intervals, since Ida had been removed to her aunt's care, sometimes short, hastily-written, careless letters; at others, long, rambling epistles, filled with accounts of the gayeties of the season. But the letter which caused so much anxiety to Mrs. St. Clair was evidently written with more of purpose and plan, than any she had hitherto received. A few extracts will reveal its purport.
               "Tell Ida," wrote Mrs. Maynard, "that I think it is quite time she was introduced to society. In a year or two, she will be too old to appear with any eclât, in a fashionable circle, for her manners will then be formed, and I fear the quiet life she has led, has not improved either her manner or style."—"I shall go myself for her in a week or two; in the meantime, I have decided to send my maid Pauline, who is a Parisienne by birth, and possesses great taste, to assist in the preparation of Ida's wardrobe, that she may be made passable when she first reaches town, for I can not of course expect you to be aware of the fashions of the season in your far-away retirement."—"I hope my best Annie, you have not allowed Ida to form any attachment in the country. She is just at the age for romance in love, and girls educated as she has been, are so crammed with sentiment, that it needs a great deal of intercourse with the world, before they become at all bearable. Truly! it would terrify me to death, to be obliged to be civil to a blushing, awkward, country lover of my daughter, with his hands continually in his pockets, and voice and manners like any laborer's."—"That last miniature of Ida's does not suit me. Does she wear her curls falling to her waist, like a child still? It almost terrifies me, when I think of the trouble, and pains, I shall have to make her at all like the young ladies of our set. Beg Ida to dress her hair in the French style of the fashion plate I send with this. But I forget, Pauline will arrange all this."
               Mrs. St. Clair in answer, in compliance with Ida's own request, who with tears in her eyes, begged her not to send her from her,—wrote that neither she, nor Ida, were willing to be separated; that Ida herself had no desire to enter the fashionable world, and that for herself in compliance with her dying brother's wish, she should insist on Ida's being allowed to remain with her, so long as she lived; and finally concluded by a prayerfully written appeal to the conscience of the vain worldly woman.
               Mrs. Maynard was too angry to reply, save by a peremptory recall of Pauline, who had arrived, and was awaiting further orders from her mistress; and Ida was left to the quiet, natural life she loved so much. It was not remarkable that Ida should prefer remaining with her aunt, who had indeed been a loving, tender parent to her, to residing with a mother who had ever shown her little affection, and whose tastes and pursuits differed so materially from her own.

                           Through all that night of bitterest woe,
                           She bore her lofty part;
                           But oh! with such a glazing eye
                           With such a curdling cheek!

               Ernest Montague had been absent a week, on business connected with the repairs of his paternal mansion, which he was refitting in a style of great elegance, and his aunt and Ida had both learned how necessary he had become to their every-day's enjoyment. It was now the day of his expected return, and Ida, who had been nervously excited, and restless since early mornning, scarce even examining herself, to account for her wayward humor, threw on her bonnet and shawl towards evening, intending to walk, for she felt that the cool air of the calm, sweet, summer eve, would exert a quieting influence upon her fevered spirit. She had reached the garden gate, when her aunt, whom she met returning fatigued from a visit to a distant, sick friend, begged that she would call at the Parsonage, and invite their pastor to dinner for Thursday; "and" continued her aunt, "the clergyman who is visiting Mr. Forsyth, say that I will be happy to see him also. Did you not tell me his name was Fairmount?"
               "Mr. Fairchild," answered Ida, as with a playful bow to her aunt she passed on, and in a few moments stood at Mr. Forsyth's door. As she ascended the steps, she saw the clergyman and his friend standing at one of the front-windows of the room occupied by Mr. Forsyth as a study. They did not perceive her entrance, and she was shown by the servant, into a small parlor adjoining the study. As she advanced into the room, she observed through the open door Mr. Forsyth incline his head, as if returning a bow from some passer-by, and immediately after, she heard Mr. Fairchild remark,
               "A fine looking young man! What a noble mien, and that broad brow has genius written legibly upon it. Pray who is he?"
               The name spoken in answer by Mr. Forsyth, was not heard distinctly by Ida, although she fancied it to be that of Ernest Montague; but the next moment she checked the thought, while a warm blush rose to her cheek, as she murmured inaudibly "How completely Ernest is in all thoughts of mine! I can not even hear a highly spoken of stranger's name, with out fancying it to be his, as if none were noble, none talented but he."
               Absorbed in a dreamy pleasant reverie into which she had fallen very oft of late, she heard no more of the conversation, until some words spoken in a higher key, with surprise in their clear tones, by Mr. Fairchild met her ear,
               "Infidel in his principles! almost hopelessly, sir! Oh! can it be possible? But methinks I should know the name; did not his father go abroad some years ago? If it be his son, the family estate lies somewhere in this direction."
               "It is the same," returned Mr. Forsyth, "his father died abroad, and I fear me, infidel also, though none of his friends know to a certainty, his nearest kindred except his son, being dead, or living in deep retirement and not likely to hear of things like these. His son was absent at the time of his father's death, pursuing his studies at a German university, notorious for its infidelity. The guardians appointed by his father, are all unknown to me, and trouble themselves little about the young man now that he has become of age, and no longer under their control. There is one however, who is deeply interested in him, who is, I feel certain, unaware of his skepticism, and to whom my duty will shortly compel me to speak upon the subject, though I fear the lady."——
               At this moment the servant who had been detained in the hall, announced Miss Maynard's presence in the other room, and Mr. Forsyth passed in to receive one whom he had known from childhood, and regarded almost as a daughter. After accepting Mrs. St. Clair's invitation for himself, and his friend, first begging Miss Maynard to be seated, which she declined, he said with an air of embarrassment unusual to him,
               "I should apologize Miss Maynard, for the remarks of mine, which if I mistake not you overheard me make and which"——
               "Pray make no apology," interrupted Ida, "none is necessary. I heard but little of the conversation, for my thoughts were elsewhere," and blushing at the recollection of who her thoughts had been busy with, she bowed gracefully, and hastily took leave. But as she went slowly homeward she wondered what possible reason Mr. Forsyth could have for apologizing as he had done, for remarks which apparently had little connection with herself.
               When Ida reached her aunt's door, the bell for evening worship was being rung, and with a lingering glance at the forest path by which Ernest always came, she entered, and passing the group of domestics, knelt at her aunt's side, while Mrs. St. Clair offered a simple, earnest prayer, beseeching the Almighty's protection then and forever, intermingled with grateful thanks for the many blessings, which strewed their daily pathway.
               A light step upon the gravel-walk, which none heard save the dog, and which a caress instantly hushed, a spring upon the trellised balcony, and Ernest Montague parting the light curtains of the window, which reached to the floor, looked within upon those who knelt in that dim twilight hour, in holy devotion. As the words of his aunt's prayer, met his ear, a feeling akin to reverential awe, crept over his spirit, and he too could almost have knelt with the worshipers, so pure, so full of love did the words of her prayer rise to the God she served in blessed single-mindedness. The next moment as his eye grew accustomed to the dim light, he discovered that Ida knelt, in her innocent beauty, almost at his feet, and it was a powerful will that prevented him yielding to the wild impulse which prompted him to kneel at her side, and clasp her in passionate emotion to his bosom. Letting drop the curtain gently, feeling certain that he was unobserved, he retreated swiftly and silently from the window, to wait the dismissal of the domestics, while he paced up and down the garden path leading to "Ida's Bower," a fanciful name given by Mrs. St. Clair's old gardener to a pretty vineshaded summer-house, the young lady's favorite resort.
               There had grown up in Ernest's heart, unresisted and consciously, a deep love for the gentle girl, whose daily companion he had now been for months. The unceremonious intercourse of country life, and the constant interchange of thought and feeling, had made them nearer friends, than a much longer city acquaintance, would have rendered them, and Ernest came to connect Ida with his future life as something indispensably necessary to his happiness. He had never met with one so richly gifted, and so beautiful, withal so gentle and graceful, and with what he loved most in woman, a high look at times, which made common beholders almost shrink from addressing her, so little could they comprehend a fine spirit, equally removed from haughtiness and familiarity. He had been withheld from declaring his attachment, in the fear that Ida would deem him precipitate, and put him on probation, for of her love he was almost certain, so well had he read the language of her eloquent eyes, and interpreted the tones of her sweet voice, which ever he fancied, became more thrilling and tender when addressing him. His absence, though short, had taught him how entirely his happiness lay in her keeping; and this night, he resolved that he would learn his fate though by his beaming, and hope-lit eye, he dreaded no unhappy ending of their blissful companionship.
               Ida immediately after worship, had accompanied her aunt, who complained of head-ache, to her room, and after administering with her own hands, a simple medicine, sat watching beside the couch of her beloved patient, until finding that she had fallen into a composing sleep, she left her under the prudent care of nurse Parker, and silently took the way to her own room. When she had nearly reached her own door, she was surprised to see Wilson standing there as if awaiting her coming. Before she could ask a question, he announced Mr. Montague's arrival, adding that the young gentleman would not disturb his aunt, hearing that she was indisposed, but begged to see Miss Ida at the summer-house.
               Startled by the sudden announcement, Ida paused irresolutely in the passage; then slowly and with hesitating steps she passed on to meet him, with a sort of vague fear that she would be unable to speak, when they met. But Ernest's words greeting her gaily, restored her self-possession.
               "Do say, you are glad I am returned to Heathdale once more, dear Ida!" he exclaimed, "I have waited very long for your welcome, for I saw you more than three hours agone, as you entered the Parsonage. I would have followed you there, but perceiving you were unaccompanied by aunt Annie, I supposed you wished to see Mr. Forsyth alone. Pray, fair penitent, what weighty sin had you to confess? Methinks! had I been father confessor, I could have found it in my heart to impose none but the lightest penance."
               
               "The first sin then," returned Ida jestingly, "that it would be incumbent upon you to punish, in me would be that of rebellion, for know oh! respected father, I perform no penance, and my lips confess no sin to mortal ears."
               "Listen then, to a confession from mine" replied Ernest, and as he spoke, he drew the half-reluctant girl to a seat beside him in the summer-house.
               I will not repeat what Ernest said, as with Ida's hand clasped in his own, he poured in her ear, his many passionate hopes and fears; neither purpose I to record Ida's half-inaudible, though unreproving replies. Each young heart knows with what a fluttering pulse, and voiceless emotion, it has first listened in unutterable happiness, to the avowal of affection, from beloved lips; knows how swiftly the uncounted moments fly, and with what a lingering pressure of the hand, and oft repeated adieu, the hour of separation, comes at last.
               The moon which shone in the eastern sky when Ernest and Ida met, rode high in heaven, ere she left her "bower" to accompany him to the garden gate. The parting words were at last spoken, and with his first kiss yet warm upon her lips, Ida ascended the stairs leading to her aunt's room, paused there a moment to watch her quiet, painless sleep, then entering her own chamber, she lay down without undressing, upon the bed, in a flood of almost insupportable happiness. How more than commonly blest was she, that he, the noble, the gifted, the superior to all others, as she deemed him, had besought her with tenderness of manner, and winning tone, to grant him her poor love. Ah! had she not given it before all unasked? and, and—oh! she was too happy, too blest indeed!
               It often happens that light words spoken by another, which at the moment of their speaking, are so trivial as to be little noticed, will return to the mind in moments of meditation, bringing with them a weight, which neither speaker nor hearer, ever dreamed of their possessing; having vast power to enlighten a subject before dark, or make obscure a subject before clear. And so it was now. Ida had arisen, and stood at the open window, in the silence of the deep midnight, looking upon the moon-lighted forest, and sky glittering with stars, and exceedingly fair, and beautiful visions of a happy, calm future, rose before her. Suddenly, by some mysterious, inward association, she thought of Ernest's playful words asserting that he had seen her enter Mr. Forsyth's door, and then she recollected that he must have passed while she waited for her coming to be announced by the servant who had admitted her. With a sick feeling at her heart she recalled the conversation she had overheard between the minister and his friend. Ernest was then the person Mr. Forsyth had spoken so sadly, so almost hopelessly about. The words of both the clergymen came back to her recollection, and Mr. Forsyth's attempt to apologize was made clear. Oh! agony! agony all the more keen and intense in its sudden fall upon a young head so lately raised in innocent gladness; a young heart, but a moment before so full of unutterable joy.
               The moonbeams rested no longer on a fair, upturned happy face; they fell now upon a bowed young head, to be raised never again, with the same hope that had lifted it a moment agone. Slowly, and with a labored, painful utterance, from pale, quivering lips, came the words, "Infidel in his principles! infidel! infidel!" repeated many times. The conviction was there, not to be resisted; it was too apparent in its naked truth, there was no escape, no palliation. And now what path was she to choose? Might she still remain Ernest Montague's betrothed wife? Terrible was the trial; fiery indeed! the ordeal, but God through her conscience triumphed, His Holy Spirit, aiding the stricken heart. She planted her foot by her Bible, resolved there to stand, and abide by its decision. It was made! Ernest must be given up! And although a cold shuddering and deadly faintness seized her, she conquered the momentary weakness, and unfalteringly, though with streaming tears gushing at every word, did she kneel and before God, renounce the hand, the protection, the dear love of Ernest Montague. She knew that in giving him up, she was taking to herself a weary heartache; she knew she was bringing to each hour of her future existence, a regretful memory, which however resisted, and struggled against, would off times overpower, and make her heart weak, even rebellious, to the decision she was now making; but with a soul of prayer, and an eye of faith, the iron resolve was taken, the sacrifice made, trusting to God her whole being for the coming years. No hope influenced her now, though afterward she trusted with a feeling akin to belief, that Ernest would yet return to her, a Christian. Her renunciation was wholly, and devotedly made; her affection, strong and holy as it was for Ernest, was martyred to her sense of religious duty.
               After a sleepless night, with a heart strengthened by prayer, in the early morning Ida descended to the breakfast-room where so many happy hours with Ernest had been passed. She knew with Love's prescience, that he would be at her side ere the lark had left its nest for the sky; and there waiting and watching, at the open window she stood, with pale cheek, and tightly compressed lip, yet with eyes often filled with tears, which were as often brushed hastily away, as with an unchanged determination she awaited his coming.
               He came at last, with such a joyous look, and high, proud mien, that Ida in her sorrow for him forgot her own suffering. He had observed her as he approached the house, and perceiving no servant about, he hastily fastened his bridle-rein to the garden fence, and ere Ida could gain resolution to speak, his arm encircled her waist, and she felt his breath upon her cheek, his kisses on her lip. Oh! how weak she felt at that moment! What happiness it would have been to have allowed him still to remain her betrothed husband. But it could not be; the caressing hand was put aside, and disengaging herself from his embrace, she replied to his look of surprise, and mute inquiry, by relating the conversation she had overheard at Mr. Forsyth's, adding, as if still incredulous,
               "No believer in the Bible, Ernest? Is there no Heaven above to your darkened eye! Oh! is this so?"
               Ernest was honest and honorably. He acknowledged that he thought not as she did, though he respected her religion; told her that from the time he left his aunt a boy of fourteen, he had heard nothing but infidel principles, from either father or teacher, and they became in time his belief. "Christianity," he said "ever seemed to him a cunning system originated by subtle priests, or crafty political rulers, for the better subjugation of man." "But surely," he added inquiringly, as he suddenly remarked the expression of Ida's face, "this mere matter of opinion, can furnish no obstacle to our union, Ida! You may even in time make a Presbyterian of me," continued he playfully, "and in any case, if you desire it, I will attend church with you. Can you ask more?"
               Ida was silent; an inward struggle was dividing her heart; her woman's nature was warring with her conscience! But true to her last night's resolve, by Divine aid, duty conquered at last. It was with a strange, altered, and hollow voice that she at length said.
               "I can never unite with a godless being! Ernest we must part."
               The scene that followed, Ernest's passioniate vehemence, and Ida's decided, though deeply sorrowful farewell is given in the beginning of this history. Firm and holy indeed, was the resolve that sundered thus, two young and fondly loving hearts.
               The next hour, Ida, with an untremulous voice, and tearless eye, told her aunt all; of her first acceptance, and final rejection of Ernest, and her reasons for it; keeping from her aunt during the interview, the knowledge of the sorrow hidden in her own bosom. Mrs. St. Clair was inexpressibly shocked, for she had thought, though not a professing Christian, Ernest's mind was open to religious truth. During all their intercourse, the subject of religion, though often adverted to, was never discussed in a manner to elicit his opinions upon it. Indeed! Mrs. St. Clair and Ida, had supposed him so entirely one with them, that no suspicion entered their minds. Ernest himself, saw so much to admire in the quiet, unobtrusive, self-denying Christianity of both, that his customary, half despising thoughts of the "system," had been changed into deep respect, influencing insensibly his manner and conversation.
               There was great comfort to Mrs. St. Clair, in the apparently indifferent, quiet manner of Ida, for she was completely deceived by her firm voice, and straightforward relation of what, she thought, did Ida love deeply, must have been very painful, to refer to with calmness. "They were more like brother and sister," she said to herself, and almost happy in her unconsciousness, she felt only regret, that Ernest would in all probability leave them soon.
               And she was right in her conjecture; the next day brought a farewell letter from Ernest briefly stating his intention of revisiting Europe,

               Now that Ernest was gone, did Ida with the necessity for exertion over, and the knowledge of the almost hopeless future before her, yield to a despondency, which however natural in her case, would have seemed almost a mockery of the high decision she had made. Did her aunt suffer by a listless, absent demeanor on Ida's part? Was the eye of her love, to mark a fading cheek, and her ear to note that her beloved niece was becoming by sorrow, slow and heavy-stepping? Far from this! Though bitter, burning tears were wept in secret at first, and a feeling of utter abandonment to her love at times almost overcame her, yet no word of recall reached Ernest; and so courageously, so religious ly did she perform her duty, that her aunt, who as beloved mistress and wife, had been singularly happy, never suspected the depth of her attachment to Ernest. She imagined that Ida would soon forget one, whom she had known but a comparatively short time, and whom she felt it dangerous to allow memory to dwell upon. Ah! little could any one judge from Ida's calm, sweet manner, of the trial, to force back the ready tear, to still the throbbing heart, and with a mocking smile upon the lip, answer calmly and coldly, when questioned by friends and acquaintances concerning Ernest's sudden departure. The struggle to appear indifferent to a loved name is in all cases no easy one, and when thoroughly successful is uniformly painful and difficult. But Ida's secret lay buried in her own bosom, and she was solitary and uncomforted in her grief, bearing ever a constant remembering thought of Ernest, never lost sense of, even in her sleep.
               As the years sped on, Ida came serene and thoughtful into womanhood, lovelier than when younger, though with a brow bearing sad traces of woe and care, for she had known much sorrow since the first heart-breaking one. Her aunt and mother both died, within the two years following Ernest's departure for Europe.——Mrs. St.Clair laid down one summer eve, with racking pain in her delicate frame, and with the light of reason in her eyes quenched for a time. Ida watched tirelessly beside her couch for long days and weary nights, until at length her aunt's eyes gazed up into her own, once again, with the old, loving look, all the more precious, that it had been so long yearned for in vain. Ida, half in joy, half in fear, threw herself at the bedside in a flood of uncontrollable tears. She heard Parker enter the room at the instant, and at a motion from Mrs. St. Clair, she knelt at Ida's side. Then Ida felt her aunt's hand laid softly on her head, and a moment after the silence of the room was broken by Mrs. St. Clair's low, sweet voice speaking at intervals:
               "Stay with her Parker, when I am gone; leave her not! Ida! I am going home! Kiss me once more my own dear child. This parting will leave you strangely sad and lone; but do not weep unavailing tears over my grave. Remember that above, ever stretching out arms of infinite love, is a Friend nearer than a brother, a Father better than any earthly one. A little time, dearest Ida, and you will join me in the abode of redeemed and sanctified spirits. Till then, farewell! And now Oh! Heavenly Father! receive my unworthy spirit through the atoning blood of they dear Son."
               It was long before the gathered household could be convinced that the calm, sweetly smiling face of their beloved friend and mistress bore indeed the impress of death. Ida lay in her old nurse's arms helpless as a child, and very, very desolate, but not hopeless, or desponding, "God has taken my dear aunt to Himself," she said, "and we may not murmur. Lay me upon my own bed, Parker, for my limbs refuse their support." And then for weeks, did that faithful woman watch beside the sick couch of her dear foster-child, who seemed to be long hovering between life and death. She rose at last, with thankfulness for life, though she had been resigned to die, and once more went out into the free air, and mingled with those whom she had felt, while on her sick bed, content to leave.
               Mrs. Maynard died where it was a terror to Ida to think of her. In a crowded ball-room, suddenly and hopelessly. Her physician had warned her that with her disease, (that of the heart), she must shun excitement and public places, but disregarding his injunctions she thoughtlessly pursued her usual round of amusement until Death snatched her from the arms of pleasure and clasping her in his cold embrace, laid her, all unprepared as she was for the change, in her mocking, jewelled dress, with the rose yet unwithered on her bosom, in an icy, dreamless sleep.
               Ida left Heathdale shortly after her aunt's and mother's death, to reside at her father's paternal mansion. To this we owe her presence among us. She is now without a near relative in the world, and yet there are many who lack but the name of kin, for they love her with undying affection. Her friends flatter, and caress her, and the world has given her fame, for she is richly gifted, and writes eloquently; but although she esteems their friendship, and is not insensible to the praise of men, yet she feels daily, that could she but lay her heart with all its warm affections, and the fame which brings her so much honor, at Ernest's feet, she would be happier, even were her lot a more lowly one.

                        "All my faults perchance thou knowest.
                        All my madness, none can know;
                        All my hopes where'er thou goest,
                        Wither—yet with thee they go.
                     
                     
                        Every feeling hath been shaken;
                        Pride, which not a world could bow,
                        Bows to thee, by thee forsaken,
                        Even my soul forsakes me now."
                     
                  
               
               And he! what did Ernest, while Ida suffered on in loneliness for his sake? He fled far from his home and her presence, and engaged in wild, eccentric pursuits, and spent his best years in seeking from the world, what it never gave yet,—forgetfulness.
               
               While Ida lives a gentle, enduring woman, made almost saint-like in character by her sacrifice, Ernest is unchanged in all things, save that his love for Ida has become a deeper, holier, life-long passion in his heart. For her rejection, spite of the grief it gives him, he admires and respects her; and he is not without almost a wish, infidel in his principles as he still is, that yet, yet he may see more as Ida sees, a Heaven beyond the grave; but his proud reason ever rejects the simple truths of the Christian's faith. He seldom breathes her name, save almost as a prayer, and never glances at the mementoes of their deep love, feeling as yet all too weak for this. He knows that kneeling in her chamber's solitude, each night, his dear name leaves her lips on the wings of prayer for Heaven, with the hope of a chastened love, and the strength of a firm faith, that yet he will be brought in penitence to the foot of the cross; and there is unspeakable comfort to him in the thought, that by her he is unforgotten still. Mutual friends often meet him abroad, and thus they indirectly hear of each other's welfare. Those who last saw him, tell us he is looking worn and spiritless, and they say they can discover no traces of his former fiery energy. Ah! the world deals but roughly with a wearied one; it has no balm for heart wounds! Inestimable indeed! would Ernest deem a home, the light of which might be Ida's smile; its charm, her tender, careful love, ever wakeful and untiring.
               
               "And this is all, Helen," wrote Mrs. Raymond in conclusion, "the history I promised. Both still live; Ida you know, and love; Ernest, we may both hope to see returned to Ida a Christian. Happiness on earth may then yet be theirs. Let us pray for it!"
               
               Helen Raymond had always tenderly loved Miss Maynard; now she almost worshiped her. Her friend she resolved should indeed be the bright example, her mother had ever upheld her; and blessed beyond wish, she felt she should be, did she possess a tithe of her dear Ida's firm, conscientious, self-denying love to God.
               Ida, though unknown to herself, was beginning in Helen Raymond to reap the fruits of her unchanging fidelity, and devotion to Him who hath said, "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven," and again, "Ye shall have your reward."

               "Tell mother, when she returns, that I have gone to Miss Maynard's to spend the day," and passing the domestic to whom she had given the direction, Helen Raymond left her father's door, singing a glad song in the innocent gayety of her heart. She passed into the front garden, and arranged with exquisite taste, a bouquet of delicately tinted and fragrant flowers, and then sped away rapidly in the direction of her friend's house. In a few moments she stood on the threshold of Ida's apartment, looking affectionately upon her she loved so well. She was greeted by Ida with an arch look, and merry words, as she rose and welcomed her with a kiss,
               "Good morning! and welcome, my Helen! But the book you promised me, ah! wild one! forgotten again?"
               "Was there ever any one so careless?" exclaimed Helen, "but dear Ida, you shall have it in a moment," and before her friend could prevent, she sprang through the open door, intending to go back to her own home, for the forgotten volume. As she turned to descend the stairs, she heard a suppressed shriek, and the sobs of some one apparently greatly distressed. At the moment the sobs met her ear, she saw her mother, with an open letter in her hand, standing beside Ida's old nurse Parker, and with eyes streaming with tears, speaking in a low tone to the also weeping old woman. Helen stood for a moment in sad surprise; then the thought flashed upon her like lightning, "Was Ernest in danger, or dead?" She heard Ida approach the door of her room, attracted evidently by the sound of the smothered sobs below, and she clung with sudden faintness to a window near which she stood. But seeing that her mother perceiving her, was about to speak, and dreading all manner of evil from what she was going to say, knowing as she did, that Ida was within hearing, she flew rather than ran, down the stairs, and across the hall, with upraised hand to press upon her mother's lips. But it was too late; Mrs. Raymond spoke quickly, though in a low voice, "Oh! Helen! how shall we tell our dear Ida, that Ernest Montague is no more?" and the excited girl sank at her mother's feet, sobbing out in heart-broken accents, "Ida hears it, oh! Ida hears it," and then there was silence, save the low deep sighs breathed amid gushing tears, of those three mourners, grieving thus for the beloved one, suddenly stricken.
               ——"I pray you give me my Ernest's letter, for he surely wrote me before he died," and the weeping group turned, at the dewy, pleading voice, and beheld Ida, grasping with one hand the balustrade for support, and with the other out-stretched toward Mrs. Raymond, who still held the tear-stained and blotted epistle. Silently Mrs. Raymond gave her the closely-written sheet, which had caused so much grief to them all. With faltering steps Ida passed to her own room again, motioning away Mrs. Raymond who would have followed, to speak a word of tender comfort to her stricken heart. The door was closed and bolted, and although Mrs. Raymond listened breathlessly outside, for some cry or groan of mortal agony, she heard none, and returning to Helen and nurse Parker, she gave them the incidents related in the letter she had given to Ida. It was from M. Moliere, a protestant clergyman in the north of France, who had written, in compliance with Mr. Montague's request, to Mrs. Raymond, she being one whom Ernest knew Ida loved and esteemed for her kind heart and truly Christian character. The writer as God's minister to all the afflicted within his reach, visited daily the prisons of the French capital, filled to overflowing, by the then existing revolution, endeavoring to mitigate by his presence and spiritual advice, the terror and suffering of the many innocent persons, confined there by arbitrary rulers, who gained power in a day, and lost it as suddenly. That M. Moliere himself escaped imprisonment or death, he esteemed to be almost miraculous, but grateful that it was so, from day to day, he only renewed his attentions to those more unfortunate than himself. Among other prisoners, in one of the least crowded, but most miserably appointed places of confinement, M. Moliere was struck by the exceedingly fine person, and strikingly intellectual face, of a young foreigner, who with a high cold look, ever remained unmoved, and proudly dignified, while he addressed words of comfort or exhortation to his companions. Once only, had he observed him visibly affected; M. Moliere spoke to those assembled, some of them from different nations, of their distant friends, their loved homes, their fatherland, and to his surprise, the high head was bowed, and the cold stranger's agitation became evident to all.
               That night a bribed menial from the prison, came to M. Moliere, and begged that he would visit a prisoner who lay ill in his dungeon, and had asked to see him. In a few moments the kind hearted minister stood beside the sick couch of the haughty looking foreigner, who had before attracted his attention, and whose name he had ascertained from the jailer, to be that of Ernest Montague; one who had been confined for speaking rashly and impatiently against some ruler, popular among the people.
               A hand out-stretched to grasp his, was the only greeting he received, and sitting down by the prisoner's miserable bed, M. Moliere selected and read aloud from the Scriptures, passages calculated to comfort and strengthen a fainting heart, if consolation by it could be found in the Bible. He was interrupted in his reading by the entrance of the physician, who after examining Mr. Montague's pulse, and asking a question or two, gave some orders to an attendant, and then left the room, beckoning the clergyman to follow.
               When M. Moliere had joined him in the corridor, he said quickly, and with some feeling in his voice, "I am sorry I was not told sooner of this case. Three hours ago, I might have hoped to save him. Now the fever will come on which in his present state of mind and body, will end his life, although he may yet live days with intervals of quiet from pain, and with power to think calmly and clearly. Is there no hope of getting him removed from that dungeon? He might be made more comfortable!
               "None!" replied M. Moliere, "the keeper's orders are strict, to make no changes."
               "Then had you not better inform Mr. Montague of my opinion, and ascertain whether he wishes to send message or letter to his friends? I grieve for his sad fate, in this strange, mad land." And with something very like a curse on the popular government, muttered between his closed teeth, the physician passed on.
               
               Death comes a fiend to the wicked, an angel to the good! Came it a cruel spectre, or a seraph presence to the bedside of that lonely stricken man? God in his infinite mercy be praised! in no form of terror came the king of the grave to the couch of the suffering Ernest! The hour, though it might be the late eleventh one, had come for the breathing of God's Spirit upon him, the long prayed for, the long wept over. In the prisoner's dungeon, reading aloud to his anxious ear, the long neglected Bible, sat the clergyman, who had penned the letter to Mrs. Raymond. The simple truths of Christianity, which should have been so familiar, were mysterious to him, and long did his proud reason shrink from believing all that our blessed religion requires. But the anxious prayerful endeavors of the faithful minister were rewarded at last. Ernest came to see "Christ and him crucified," the only atonement for sin. He was prepared for death and eternity.
               
               At length one day, during which Mr. Montague's mind had been unusually elevated, and peaceful, the physician who had constantly visited him since his illness told him with some emotion, that ere the next sunset his spirit would be beyond the sun. Ernest then earnestly begged M. Moliere to write without delay from his dying bed to Mrs. Raymond, that Miss Maynard through her might be informed of his sickness unto death. On a small slip of paper enclosed in the letter he wrote with difficulty a few words to Ida, which brought unspeakable comfort to her when the shock caused by the sad tidings was over. Written in a faint, almost illegible hand were a few affectionate words.
               "Ida! God's Spirit hath touched my heart. I believe in the Omnipotent Jehovah, whom my soul so long despised; and I would be indeed most miserably lost and undone, did I not see Christ, the All-sufficient to save me, from the wrath of a justly offended God. The merciful Saviour hath brought me in His own time, and way, out of my great darkness, into his marvelous light.
               And now Ida, weep not at what I am about to say, but kneel down and thank your, our God, for His infinite mercy to me. Death is here at my side, in this drear dungeon, which is now not dark or gloomy, for God, and the angels are near. Farewell! dearest Ida! I but go before to welcome you, with holier than earthly greeting to a heavenly home"——
               The clergyman closed his letter by informing Mrs Raymond, that by the physician's and his own exertions he hoped to obtain permission from the government, to lay the mortal remains of Mr. Montague in the burial vault of a Presbyterian church near the prison. The funeral, he concluded, should be attended by as many of the English and American residents of the city as could be made aware of the foreign birth of Mr. Montague; and many, he added, of the most influential and noble of the citizens already known to the prisoner would, he had no doubt, cheerfully unite in paying the last tribute of respect when it was needed, to one they vainly attempted to aid, when first confined by the arbitrary decree, of unjust and tyrannical rulers.

               Upon the floor, in the utter silence and loneliness of her darkened chamber, lay Ida Maynard in deep and uncompanioned grief. Her rich hair was flung upon the carpet in long, disheveled tresses, and one or two shining curls lay across the colorless face, but no hand put them aside. Moveless and tearless, she remained for hours, as if stunned by the shock. God himself was not visible to her stricken soul. She was only conscious that a heavy calamity had befallen her, and unresisting and powerless, she was almost insensible of the real cause of her misery.
               Even in Ida's renunciation of Ernest, after the firm rejection, which sent him in sorrow and anger from her, there had been much hope; she trusted that he would yet love the God she served, and that, though long years came between, they would at length be united. After her aunt's death, having none else near and dear, this hope became stronger, more lasting. Her life was made beautiful by it. Each night she lay down to dream of his return; each day was spent in sweet reveries of their coming future, and blessed Christian life together. These thoughts influenced her more than she herself was aware, and made her resignation the more calm, because in the far blue future the star of hope beamed clearly, scarce shadowed by a fear. It was not mysterious then, that she should shudder and almost sink, under the sudden tempest, that darkened around and overwhelmed her, though only for a time. Angels might have wept, to look upon that beautiful and delicate form, prostrate in untold misery, but fiends could not have triumphed, for the Almighty's arm, was underneath, and around her still, although she knew it not.
               At last, in making an almost involuntary change of posture, Ida felt the paper crushed in her hand, with Ernest's dear words written upon it, and with a low cry of anguish she pressed it wildly to her lips. Then she thought of him in his noble manhood laid in the cold desolate grave; she thought of his lonely deathbed, of his cheerless dungeon, and a wish came, earnest and strong, as it was wild, and vain, to have been with him in his last hour. During all this time, no grateful thought that he was at last a Christian entered her mind. Infidel or Christian, he was passed for ever from earth.
               In the dreamy, wretched state into which she had fallen, she thought she saw her Ernest, as he lay dead amid the dungeon's gloom. It was but a vision, caused by a fevered imagination, but it seemed no less real. The corpse she thought lay a stiffened and pale figure, beneath the winding sheet. The face only, was uncovered, and to her roused fancy, seemed to need a covering also. "I will just kiss his pale brow once more, and then cover it, for the last time, said she dreamily, and rising up, in her bewildered mood, her eye fell upon the Bible, which had been her aunt's, and which now lay upon the stand, open at the chapter which she had read in her solitude that morning.——At the sight of this familiar, sacred object, light suddenly broke upon her clouded mind, and gradually she came to see how she had deceived herself, had sacrificed nothing for the sake of her conscience, but merely by an act of the mind, put off a certain good to a later day which was almost certain to come at last. Insensibly God, even, she thought with bitter remorse, had become a secondary consideration, and Ernest, whom she professed to renounce, became her religion. Condemningly she remembered her formal attendance on religious duties, and felt with humility, that divine eyes saw how utterly she had wandered astray.
               "Oh! God!" she cried, as she knelt with hands stretched beseechingly towards Heaven, "the sacrifice my vain nature thought to make, was not real. I have mocked Thee with lip-service, when my heart was, is now, with my dead idol. Give me a contrite spirit, Oh! my Father! and strength to say, Thy will, not mine in all things. Long-suffering, and most merciful God! cast me not utterly from Thy presence, but have mercy for the sake of Thy dear and well-beloved Son.
               
               But the struggle with human weakness for power to say "Thy will be done!" was repeated many times before the chastened spirit no longer rebellious, sent up to God a psalm of praise, for mercy and deliverance: ere Ida could think of Ernest calmly, and without tears, as an angel in Heaven.
               
               For days Ida had not left her apartment, and sweet Helen Raymond, who had remained in the house, each day, from morn, till nightfall, began to fear that Ida's grief would destroy her. She had not seen her save at meal times, when, accompanied by nurse Parker, who carried some refreshment, she would knock at Ida's door, and beg her to receive what nurse had brought. It was never refused, and her gentle attention, did not go unrewarded. As she sat one day, about a week after her mother had received M. Moliere's letter, in the room directly below that which Ida occupied, she heard a light foot-fall on the stairs, and a voice inquiring whether "Miss Raymond had returned home?" The servant thought she had, and the next moment Helen saw her friend enter, approach and seat herself at the piano. From her position she felt she was unperceived, and clasping both hands upon her heart, to hush its rapid beating, she listened breathlessly to words which Ida sung in a voice low, trembling, and tearful, but with utterance clear and sweet. 
                     
                        Father! I thank thee! thou hast given,
                        My spirit strength to bear;
                        I thank thee! thou hast sent from Heaven,
                        An answer to my prayer;
                        
                        A 'still small voice' hath kindly spoken,
                        And now all earthly ties are broken.
                     
                     
                        All ties are broken! I would say
                        Father! 'Thy will be done!'
                        And if I shrink, and wildly pray
                        Forgive the erring one,
                        Father! forgive thy sinful child,
                        For the sake of Him the Undefiled.
                     
                  
               
               Helen could hear no more. Gliding noiselessly from the apartment, and from the house, with a face all drenched in tears, she crossed rapidly the paths that divided her's from her friend's home, and entering her mother's room, with hasty impetuosity and mingled tears and sobs, besought her to take Ida home.
               "Let her live with us, dear mother! There will then be loving hearts to make the desolate one happy."
               "My own Helen," said her mother, "your father and I both intended to beg Miss Maynard to accept a home with us, now that she will feel her loneliness to be greater than formerly, and when the first bitterness of her grief is past, she shall hear our proposal."
               "Come now then dearest mother," said Helen, joyfully telling her mother of Ida's unexpected appearance below stairs; but the impatient girl yielded when her mother considerately begged that Miss Maynard might be left in solitude for that day at least.
               The next day Mrs. Raymond's kind offer was made, but firmly though gratefully declined on Ida's part; and when Helen burst into tears of regret, at her refusal, she promised the affectionate girl, that each day should see her for a part of it, at least, in Helen's home. She felt it her duty, she said, to retain her mother's establishment, and make no changes; many of the servants vants, who had been in the family when her father was a boy, were now grown old, and helpless, and she was their only dependence.
               Helen was struck with the wisdom and kindness of the decision, and dried her tears.

                        "Look not mournfully into the Past; it comes not back again! Wisely improve the Present; it is thine! Go forth to meet the Future without fear, and with a manly heart."
                     
                     LONGFELLOW
                  
               
               Years passed on, and brought their changes; nurse Parker was laid by loving hands, with respect, and a grateful memory in an honored grave. Sweet Helen Raymond bore no longer her father's name. When the young, devoted clergyman, Arthur Tesimond, first knew Helen, he saw that she was beautiful, and a very short time sufficed to convince him that she was good; and not long did he wait till the hand of her he loved better than all else on earth was placed confidingly in his own. Ida did not, however, lose Helen. Mr. Tesimond's residence was near, and the friends were together as much as formerly. And after a time, as bright young heads sprang up about Helen's board, one or more of the little ones, were constantly with "dear aunt Ida" as they familiarly termed her, and she learned to look upon them with almost a mother's love.
               And during these years, Ida was not without the friendship of those who, had they been permitted, would willingly have offered her the deep love a character like hers was well worthy; her hand was very often sought in honorable marriage, but each offer was firmly, though respectfully declined. Constantly employed in God's work on earth, she had little time to dwell upon her own lonely lot. Many in a situation like hers, with similar, kind, self-denying dispositions, might have chosen the life of a missionary, or that of a Howard, or a Fry, in order according to their views to perform more good; but Ida did not go from home to seek objects for her benevolence. Around her, in the refined and cultivated circle, of which she was a member, and by all composing which she was looked up to, as a superior mind, she found work, which in its importance equaled that of the missionary on a heathen shore. She gathered about her in a bond of friendship, the daughters of her many friends, young creatures brought up in the midst of luxury, and with no wish ungratified, and taught to them the importance of principle in their daily life; self-denial for the sake of One higher than any earthly friend. These subjects were not forced upon their attention, but insensibly, they were led to read or converse, upon them, as they spent days or weeks with her, at her city home, or beautiful country residence. This influence, this unguessed teaching on her part, were not the less needed, because the parents of many of these maidens were regular church-goers, and esteemed quite Christian people by the world around them, and who would have been shocked, at any want of religious knowledge in their daughters. She knew *
                  
                  that in them, at an age like theirs, what we believe to be principle, is generally but a vague sentiment, and
                     
                     *The authoress is indebted to a friend, who in a letter to her expressed the clear and true sentiments quoted.
                  
                  what we imagine to be religion, is after all but an impulse strengthened and protracted by habit. So often these pretensions are swept away by a moment of passion, that there is great reason to doubt, whether in them, principle and religious sentiment, be not after all matter of education, and habit, and subject to the caprices of circumstance. Few, indeed, are there who have strength to apply a correct principle to the ordinary incidents of life. Temptations so assail us; so weak is our unsupported humanity, that with the very Bible in our hands, we plunge into sin. Miss Maynard led her young companions to think earnestly and conscientiously of the part they would choose, were they ever placed in cases of difficulty, where feeling clashed with conscience; and very often was she gratified by the avowal, though sometimes made with tears, that they "hoped God would aid them to decide aright, and strengthen them to abide by the decision, even though it wrecked their hopes of earthly bliss." Thus she prepared them for future wives and mothers; and their saved and conscientiously brought up children, will be to her, as well as they, themselves, a glorious "crown of rejoicing," when the better land is reached at last.
               With all these modest, and altogether unsuspected, and unknown endeavors, to improve and more religiously educate, the young beings, who looked up to her as their own, and their parents most valued friend, she was still tireless in her efforts to enlighten, and make happier, mankind in every condition. With means at her command, no work of benevolence, did she know it, was suffered to be discontinued, for want of necessary funds to carry it on. No starving poet, or poverty stricken scholar, was ever mentioned in her hearing in vain. No sorrowful one passed from her door uncomforted. She lived happily, for she made others happy. Truly! there could be no better safeguard around her daily pathway, than "the prayers of the hearts she had kept from breaking."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XI.
               IDA MAYNARD'S HISTORY, CONTINUED.
               
                  
                     "Aide toi, et Dieu t 'aidera."
                  
               
               
                  
                     "For this is he, who was dead, and is alive again; was lost, and is found."
                  
               
               "My thirtieth birthday Helen! still, I do not feel very old! and yet," continued Miss Maynard, as with Mrs. Tesimond's hand in hers, she led the way to the glass in her dressing room, "I think I have discovered the first gray hair. See! just over the left temple, Helen! am I right?"
               "Nonsense, dear Ida! gray hairs at thirty indeed! If this single hair be gray, it is a traitor, and must be banished forthwith," and as she spoke, Mrs. Tesimond drew the obnoxious hair from among the dark, clustering curls of Miss Maynard, who in her ripened and delicate beauty looked scarce older, than Arthur Tesimond's fair young wife. "There!" she continued, smiling, "look not for another gray recreant, for ten years at least! Now my little Ida" she added, addressing a fairy creature of some six summers, "kiss me good bye! for I must return to papa, who is not at all well to day. Be sure and not tease dear 'Aunt Ida,' and then you shall come as often as she sends for you."
               "Which I would every day, if you would consent to spare her to me, Helen," said Miss Maynard bestowing caress after caress upon the little one, which the child returned with an earnest, tender look of respectful, yet free affection. At this moment the servant announced the presence of a gentleman in the drawing-room, who refusing to give his name, begged to see his mistress alone.
               Miss Maynard accompanied Mrs. Tesimond as she descended the stairs, and after bidding her farewell, proceeded to the drawing-room. As she laid her hand upon the fastening of the door, she heard a voice within say, "You told your mistress, I wished to see her alone, did you not?" which sent a strange thrill to her heart, she knew not why. The servant passed her as she entered the room, closing the door after him, and the next moment Ida stood alone, and face to face with Ernest Montague. Though much changed by years of suffering, she recognized him immediately, and with a wild shriek of mingled surprise and joy, she rushed forward and sank fainting into his arms. It is not in the power of words to describe the exquisite happiness of Ernest, as he beheld once more, held once again in his embrace, the being he had prayed so earnestly he might find still spared to him, and though now deprived of conciousness for a time, living, and even more beautiful than he remembered her. He called no assistance, but chafing tenderly her small hands in his own, he breathed her name with many endearing expressions, in the thrilling tone of bye gone days, and Ida soon again opened her eyes, and though very, very faint and weak, feeling unutterably, breathlessly happy. It was as if the atmosphere around her, which had not before been at all dark, or gloomy, had become suddenly, intensely bright, and full of all sweet sound. And when she beheld Ernest bending over her, and with a respectful, and gentle caress, claiming her as his betrothed wife, she felt indeed that her dream was at last realized; Ernest was returned to her a Christian, and God was not forgotten now. From both their hearts a voiceless song of thanksgiving ascended to Him who had delivered them out of six troubles, yea, out of seven, and given to their chastened spirits a holy and innocent joy.
               It was long before Ernest could tell, or Ida could listen, to all that had befallen him, since the time he had left her, until his wonderful restoration to her now. But when, after many confused questions and answers, they each understood fully, how much the one had endured both of physical and mental suffering, and the other of agonizing grief, they both felt, with renewed force, how great cause for gratitude they had, that they were thus permitted to meet at last.
               And now to account for Ernest's sudden appearance among those who had thought of him as one lying in a lonely grave, beneath a distant sky. The day on which M. Moliere had written the letter to Mrs. Raymond at Ernest's anxious desire, was the last his physician conscientiously thought, he was to spend upon earth. Towards sunset, however, instead of a gradual sinking away of the powers of life in Ernest, to the physician's great surprise, he fell into a calm, and quiet sleep, from which he awakened, pale and languid, and scarce able to lift his hand to his head, but with a coolness in his reins, and a half concious feeling, that "God was about to lift him above the grave." For weeks the kind-hearted physician watched beside him, and at last Ernest arose, emaciated and very, very feeble, but with rapidly returning health. M. Moliere, wrote to Mrs. Raymond again, at the physician's request, informing her of the favorable change in Mr. Montague's case, but the prison assistant to whom he gave the letter in charge, pocketed the postage money, and destroyed it. Shortly after Ernest's recovery, he made an application to the government for a release from his imprisonment, and owing to the petition of some foreigners of note, to the then changed and more lenient rulers, he was set free.
               The second day after Ernest's release from prison, all the arrangements for embarking for the United States, were made, and that very afternoon, he was to leave the shores of France in an American ship, homeward bound. He had bade an affectionate and touching farewell to M. Moliere, and the kind physician, and now, within an hour or two of his departure, stood at a window of the reception-room of his hotel, in a fit of absent thought. While standing thus, the side fastening of the curtain, accidentally gave way, and the drapery fell in heavy folds to the floor, completely concealing his presence from any who might enter the room. Before he was aware of his unsought concealment, he heard some persons enter, and close the door carefully after them. From their conversation he discovered them to be two Roman Catholic priests, whom he knew had taken lodgings at the hotel the day previous. While he was hesitating whether to make himself known, or remain at the window, as this room was appropriated to the common use of all, he heard hurriedly disclosed by one priest to the other, a scheme of unparalleled and atrocious villany, for benefiting the Holy Mother church. Before the priest had well finished however, Ernest parted the curtains, and stood revealed to the two hypocritical fathers in a church, which has ever contained too many such characters. At the instant of Ernest's appearance, one of the priests, darted from the room, while the other calmly approached him with some common place observation on the singular unpleasantness of the day, which was stormy in the extreme. Ere Ernest could reply, the other priest re-entered the room, followed by four stout men, who before Ernest was aware of their intentions, gagged, pinioned, and throwing a mantle over his head, carried him from the hotel, and placed him in a carriage. For days he traveled blindfolded, save at the hours of refreshment, strictly guarded under the direction of some person or persons unknown, probably one or both the priests. At length he found himself occupying a cell in a large building, which he was told was the Inquisition at Rome. For a time he hoped to be released from this unjust confinement, but as year after year went by and no change came, he was well-nigh giving way to a mad and utter despair. But God forsook him not in this sore trial, but to his worn and tried human nature, gave spiritual strength. Often on his knees, he learned how blessed, and precious a thing is faith to the Christian believer. Occasional efforts were made by the priestly fathers to induce Ernest to change his religious belief, and become a Roman Catholic, but in vain, and when finally he was released from confinement, it was only after having given his solemn promise never to reveal what he had overheard between the priests, and to give no account of what he and others had suffered while in the Inquisition. Thankful for his escape, Ernest returned as speedily as he might to his native land, never again he hoped to live from under the far-stretching stars and stripes, of her protecting Liberty banner.
               
               A happy day was it to Miss Maynard's numerous friends when her betrothal to Mr. Montague was made known, and her marriage day proclaimed to be near. Rejoicings and congratulations greeted her on every side, and she could not but be aware, from the joy of all around her, of their deep sympathy in her present happiness. And when, at last, the marriage benediction by the Rev. Arthur Tesimond, was pronounced, after the simple ceremony which united the long separated ones, had been performed, there was much sobbing, and many quiet tears shed by Ida's faithful friends, and the old, attached servants, who had known her history, and many a blessing from pious hearts, was breathed with a fervent prayer, for her own and her husband's future welfare.
               "And the Lord blessed them." Purified by trial, and suffering, their lives made happy by each other's presence, were yet wholly devoted to God. An irreligious or thoughtless mind, can not conceive of the truth of the earnest offering made night and morning, nay, each hour of their earthly existence, of deep, fervent, and grateful love, to Him who had indeed been a merciful and kind Parent to them, who had taught them to say in the midst of dark and bitter anguish, "Even thus, O! Father! for so it seemeth good in thy sight," and then in infinite love put a new song into their mouths, of joy and thanksgiving, and gave them to drink of a cup of happiness, rarely tasted upon earth.
