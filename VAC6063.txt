               CHAPTER I.
               HOW JOHN WHOPPER DISCOVERED THE AIR-LINE TO CHINA.
               TWO years ago last February, I think it was on a Tuesday morning, I started as
                  usual very early to distribute my papers. I had a large bundle to dispose of that
                  day, and thought that if I took a short cut across the fields, instead of
                  following the road from Roxbury to Jamaica Plain, I could go my rounds in much
                  less time. I do not care to tell precisely where it was that I jumped over the fence; but it is a rough, barren kind of
                  spot, which nobody has ever done any thing to improve.
               After walking about a third of a mile, I began to think that I had better have
                  kept to the turnpike; for I found that I was obliged to clamber over an uneven,
                  rocky place, among trees and bushes and shrubs, that grew just thick enough to
                  bother me, so that I hardly knew where to put my feet. All at once I lost my
                  balance, and felt that I was sliding down the side of a smooth, steep rock; while
                  underneath, to my horror, I saw what looked like a circular cave, or well, some
                  five or six feet in diameter. I tried to grasp the rock with my hands, and ground
                  my heels as hard as I could against the surface, but it was of no use; down I
                  slipped, faster and faster, until at last I plunged, feet foremost, into the dark
                  hole below. For a moment I held my breath, expecting to be dashed to pieces; and
                  oh, how many things I thought of in that short minute! It seemed as if every thing
                  that I had ever done came back to me, especially all the bad things;
                  and how I wished then that I had lived a better life! I thought, too, of my poor
                  mother and my little brother and sister at home, and how they would wait breakfast
                  for me that morning; and how they would keep on waiting and waiting, hour after
                  hour and day after day; and how the neighbors would all turn out and search for
                  me; and how I should never be found, and nobody would ever know what had become of
                  me. And then I wondered whether Mr.
                  Simpson, who employed me to distribute the papers, would suppose that I had run
                  away somewhere, to sell them on my own account; and so I went on thinking and
                  wondering, until it seemed as if there was no end to the time. And yet I didn't
                  strike the bottom of the cave, but just went on falling and falling, faster and
                  faster, in the darkness, and sometimes just grazing the sides, and still not so as
                  to hurt me much. My great trouble was to breathe; when it occurred to me to lay
                  the sleeve of my coat across my mouth: and then I found that I could breathe
                  through the cloth with tolerable ease. After a while, I recovered my senses; and
                  though I continued to fall on still faster and faster, I experienced no great
                  inconvenience. How long this continued, I cannot tell; it appeared to be an age;
                  and I must have been falling for several hours, when I began to feel as though I
                  was not sinking as fast as I had been; and after a while, it seemed as if I were
                  rising up, rather than tumbling down. As I was now able to breathe much more
                  freely than I had done, I began to think calmly about my condition; and then the
                  thought flashed across my mind, that perhaps I had passed the centre of the earth,
                  and was gradually rising to the surface on the other side. This gave me hope; and
                  when I found that I continued to move slower and slower, I tried to collect my
                  faculties, so that I might know just what it would be best to do, if I should be
                  so fortunate as to reach the other end of the hole into which I had tumbled. At last, looking down, I saw a little
                  speck of light, like a very faint star; and then, I tell you, my heart bounded
                  with joy. At this moment it suddenly occurred to me that it would not do to come
                  out of the hole feet foremost; and, by a tremendous effort, I managed
                  to turn a complete summersault,—what the boys always called a
                     somerset,—which, of course, brought me into the right position.
                  How thankful I felt that I had been taught to practise gymnastic exercises at the
                  school in Roxbury! In my present attitude I couldn't see the bright spot any
                  longer: but, before long, I perceived that it was growing lighter around me; and I
                  was confident that the time of my release drew near. I had determined exactly what
                  I would do when I reached the surface of the earth again; and, accordingly, on the
                  instant that my head came out of the hole, I grasped the edge with all my might,
                  and, by another terrible effort, swung myself up into the air, and leaped upon the
                  ground.
               It is impossible to describe the strange thrill that passed over me when I thus
                  found myself standing on what I knew must be the eastern side of the globe. As
                  soon as I had fairly recovered the use of my reason, I began to speculate as to
                  the region of the country into which I emerged. If I had come directly through the
                  centre of the earth, I knew, of course, just where I ought to be; but this hardly
                  seemed possible, considering how short a time it had required for my journey. It
                  then occurred to me that I was really
                  unable to form any accurate idea of the number of hours that had elapsed since I
                  left the soil of Massachusetts; for, before I had fallen a hundred feet, a whole
                  age appeared to have passed. I knew that it was about six o'clock in the morning
                  when I started; and, on looking at my watch. I found that it had stopped at 6.45,
                  owing, as I afterwards ascertained, to the influence of magnetic currents upon the
                  hair-spring.
               The country around was in a high state of cultivation, except in the immediate
                  vicinity of the spot where I stood. This was rough and barren, and so situated
                  that the small cavity in the earth from which I had just been released, would be
                  very likely to escape observation. Thinking that it might be important for me to
                  be able hereafter to identify the locality, I took a careful observation of its
                  general bearings, and twisted together a few of the twigs that grew near the hole,
                  but in such a manner as would not be likely to arrest attention.
               Striking off now at random, I soon found myself in a low, marshy region, covered
                  with a species of grain unlike any thing I had ever seen before, but which I
                  concluded must be rice; and then the thought came to me, that very probably I was
                  in China. After walking for an hour or two, I reached a rising ground, and saw in
                  the distance an immense city on the water's edge; which from its position, and
                  resemblance to certain pictures that I had once seen in Boston, I believed to be
                  Canton. Refreshing myself with some fruit
                  that grew by the wayside, I started off in haste, in order, if possible, to reach
                  the city before nightfall. Just as the sun was setting, I entered what appeared to
                  be one of the main streets; when, tired and hungry and footsore, I began to think
                  seriously what I should do to procure food and lodging. Here I was,—a poor boy in
                  a strange land, unable to address a word to the people around me, and with only a
                  few cents and two or three bits of paper currency in my pocket, that could be of
                  no value in that country. What was I to do? Just then I came to a
                  large and respectable-looking building; and over the door there was this sign, in
                  good plain characters:— 
                     "ENGLISH AND AMERICAN COFFEE-HOUSE."
                  
               
               Tears of joy filled my eyes. In an instant, I said to myself, "Your fortune is
                  made, old fellow! Here you have thirty or forty Boston newspapers, not twenty-four
                  hours old, strapped around your neck; and I rather think they will be in some
                  demand in Canton."
               With a light heart I now entered the office of the hotel, and threw down my
                  bundle, with a good, black-leather covering around the papers, so that it looked
                  like an ordinary piece of luggage, which gave me the appearance of a regular
                  traveller; then called for a room, and ordered supper. It was true that I had very
                  little money in my possession,—not enough, certainly, to pay my bill at the hotel;
                  but no questions were asked, and I gave myself little concern as to the future. I had a first-rate appetite, and ate
                  voraciously.
               After supper was over, I took my bundle in my hand, and strolled leisurely into a
                  pleasant and spacious room, where a number of gentlemen—English and American—were
                  sitting around in groups, some chatting together, and others reading the London
                  and New York and Boston papers. Among them I recognized the face of a merchant
                  whom I had seen several times in State Street; and slinging the strap over my
                  shoulder in a careless, every-day sort of tone, just as any newsboy would have
                  done at home, I went up to him and said, "Have the morning papers,
                  Mister?—'morning papers?'—'Advertiser,' 'Journal,' 'Post,' 'Herald,' last
                  edition,—published this morning, only five dollars!" Everybody in the
                  room looked up, for I managed, as newsboys generally do, to speak loud enough to
                  drown every other sound; but no one uttered a word. It was evident that they
                  thought I was crazy, or something worse; and so I just cried out again, "Have the
                  morning paper, sir?" at the same time thrusting a copy of "The Advertiser" into
                  his hand. He looked like an "Advertiser" kind of man,—well dressed and highly
                  respectable.
               Involuntarily his eye glanced at the date,—"Tuesday, Feb. 16, 1867"; and then, in
                  an excited, quivering tone, he said, "Let me look at your other papers." There was
                  a long table in the centre of the room, which I approached; and, slowly unfolding
                  my bundle, I laid a few of the papers
                  wide open in front of the gentlemen, who crowded around in the highest state of
                  excitement. Still there was dead silence; when one of them suddenly burst out with
                  the exclamation, "Good heavens! Here is a notice of the arrival of 'The Golconda'
                  at New York, with a full account of the cargo, and every thing else correct. Why,
                  this must be genuine!"
               One after another followed with a cry of surprise at some news which they had
                  found; until, in a few minutes, every gentleman in the room was absorbed in
                  reading the papers, appearing to have entirely forgotten all about me, and not
                  caring to ask how it was that I had brought them to China in less than twenty-four
                  hours. After I had stood there whistling carelessly as long as I thought worth
                  while, I spoke up in a loud voice, and said, "Well, gentlemen, you seem to be
                  enjoying the news pretty well. I hope you don't mean to forget to pay for the
                     papers,—only five dollars a copy!"
               At this speech every one of them looked at me with a strange expression, as if
                  they hardly knew whether I was a real human boy or something else; when the Boston
                  gentleman said, "How on earth did you get these papers here?" To which I answered
                  very carelessly, "I didn't get them here on earth."
               "What do you mean?"
               "I will tell you what I mean, and answer your questions, after you have paid me
                     five dollars each; and cheap at that, considering."
               
               "Indeed it is, for me at least," said one of the gentlemen. "What I have learned
                  from this paper is worth to me, in a business way, thousands of dollars"; and with
                  that he came forward and put a hundred into my hand, in the good, solid form of
                  gold-pieces. His example had its effect upon the others. Instead of the two
                  hundred which I had hoped to receive for my forty newspapers, I was actually in
                  possession of not less than—well, I don't care to tell exactly how much, on
                  account of the income-tax.
               "Come, now," said the gentlemen, almost in one breath, "tell us how these papers
                  came to China."
               "I brought them myself."
               "When did you leave America?"
               "The morning when these papers were printed: but how long ago that was, I really
                  don't know, as my watch stopped while I was on my voyage; only I thought it was
                  just as well to call out, as I always used to do at home, 'Morning paper!'
                  although, perhaps, for all I can tell, they may be two or perhaps three days old;
                  anyhow, I guess you find them a good deal fresher than the rest you have got on
                  hand."
               Having delivered myself of this somewhat protracted speech, I began moving towards
                  the door with the air of one who had said every thing that could reasonably be
                  expected, in reply to the curious inquiries of my liberal patrons, when the Boston
                  merchant motioned for me to stop, saying with some severity, "Did you not promise
                  that you would inform the company pany
                  how these papers came from America to China in such an incredibly short period of
                  time, whenever you should have received your pay for the same?"
               "Yes, sir; and I just told you that I brought them over—not exactly
                     over—but—in short, I brought them here."
               "You say, 'not exactly over'; do you mean by that phrase to be
                  understood to say that you did not come over land?"
               "Your honor has hit my meaning precisely."
               "You don't pretend to say that you came by water?"
               "Far from it, sir."
               "How then, under the heavens, did you come?"
               "I didn't come under the heavens at all."
               "I don't believe," said the irritated gentleman, turning to his companions, "that
                  the fellow came at all; he must be lying."
               All the answer that he received was the rustling of forty newspapers, bearing the
                  imprint, "February 16, 1867, Boston." There was no getting over this.
               After a pause of several minutes, during which a bright idea entered my mind, I
                  came forward into the circle, and said, "Well, gentlemen, I want to see if I can
                  make a good bargain with you; and when that is settled, I will tell you how I came
                  over—I mean, I will tell you how I got here; that is, I will tell you the
                     route that I took. If I can arrange for the delivery in Canton of the
                  New York and Boston daily papers, within thirty-six six hours of the time when they are issued in those
                  cities, will you all promise to give me your generous patronage?"
               "Of course we will," they cried all together.
               "Very well; then I pledge myself to appear again in this place one week from this
                  day, ready to carry out my part of the bargain. And now, in bidding you
                  good-night, allow me to inform you that I came from America to China by the
                     air-line."
               With this I retired at once to my room, and was soon sleeping soundly.
               I knew that I should be watched so closely the next day as to make it impossible
                  for me to escape without detection; and accordingly I got up an hour or two before
                  daylight; and, having laid upon the table in my room an amount of money which I
                  supposed would be considered a fair compensation for my supper and lodging, I tied
                  the sheets together, and lowered myself down into the then silent and deserted
                  street. It was not long before I found myself once more in the open country; and
                  looking carefully for the twisted twigs that I had tied together the afternoon
                  before, I soon discovered the chasm through which I had made my remarkable trip to
                  the eastern hemisphere. Taking the precaution to tie a handkerchief over my mouth
                  in order that I might economize my breath, I summoned all my courage, and leaped
                  into the hole. My experiences were precisely the same as they had been in the
                  previous journey; and in course of a few hours, I found myself standing once more in the familiar outskirts
                  of Roxbury, and gazing tenderly upon the solemn dome of Boston State House. As
                  fast as my legs would take me, I rushed to my poor mother's humble abode, longing
                  to relieve the bitter agony to which I knew she and my brother and sister must
                  have been subjected during my absence. It is not worth while for me to describe at
                  length the scene that ensued when I stood once more in the family circle, with my
                  mother's arms around my neck, and the young folks bellowing with joy. To the
                  frantic inquiries that were showered upon me as to what had happened,—where I had
                  been,—had I had any thing to eat? I coolly replied that I had not had much to eat;
                  and, if they would give me a good, substantial supper, I would endeavor to relieve
                  their minds.
               "Supper, indeed!" cried my good mother; "why, it's just after sunrise! You haven't
                  lost your senses, I hope."
               "I beg your pardon; but it was about sunrise hours and hours ago, when I—when
                  I"—and here I faltered, not caring just then to let the whole family into my
                  secret.
               "When you what?" said my mother, looking very anxious.
               "Why, when I left Canton," I now answered, very promptly.
               "You don't say that you have been to Canton?" she replied, but without any such
                  show of astonishment as might have been expected.
               "Yes, I have, mother. It occurred to me
                  that I could sell my papers to better advantage there than I could about here;
                  and, indeed, I did, as you may see." Whereupon I laid in her good old hand such a
                  sum of money as she had not clasped for many a day.
               "Did you get all this money by selling papers in Canton?"
               "I did, and a great deal more; which I am going to deposit by and by in the
                  Savings Bank to your credit."
               "There must be an awful demand for papers in Canton."
               "There is, mother; and they pay such high prices there, that I am thinking of
                  setting up a news establishment in the place."
               "And did you walk all the way to Canton day before yesterday, my
                  boy?"
               "Then it was day before yesterday morning when I left home? I thought it was
                  longer ago than that."
               "Longer ago! Oh, dear, dear! you are not out of your head, my son?"
               "My good mother, I am as sound as you are. Only you know that sometimes, when we
                  are very much occupied, the time passes quickly; and I have been quite busy since
                  I left you."
               "And did you say that you walked to Canton?"
               "No, mother, I didn't walk a step."
               "Then you took the Providence cars?"
               "Well, mother, it was a kind of a providence car."
               [John's statement at once relieved the old lady's mind; but those of our readers
                  who are not intimately acquainted with
                  the geography of Massachusetts, may be somewhat puzzled at this. For the
                  information of foreigners and uneducated people in general, we must mention that
                  there is a thriving village on the Boston and Providence railroad, about ten miles
                  from Roxbury, which rejoices in the name of Canton.
               It may here be observed, that the young man's mind had got into a kind of
                  chronological muddle, and the days and nights were mixed up together in the most
                  miscellaneous manner. We, who are competent to solve any ordinary problem, furnish
                  our young readers with this explanation. John left our American soil on Tuesday
                  morning, at or about six o'clock. He is twelve hours—there or thereabouts—passing
                  through the earth. This brings him to China also in the morning, as every thing is
                  topsy-turvy on the other side of the globe. His walk to Canton fills up most of
                  the day,—Tuesday night here. He sleeps in Canton one night.
                     Wednesday here; leaves Canton, via Air-Line, the next morning,—Wednesday night here;
                  and arrives at Jamaica Plain on Thursday morning. Absent from home forty-eight
                  hours; twenty-four consumed in travelling via
                  Air-Line; twelve in pedestrian excursion through the Kwangtung country in China;
                  and twelve in pecuniary negotiations and sleep at the British and American
                  Coffee-House, Canton. This makes every thing clear and consistent. We would simply
                  remark, that, when John first told us his singular tale of adventure, we
                     remarked that he seemed to have had a
                  very small allowance of food, as he ate but one good meal in the whole forty-eight
                  hours. To which he replied in a rather lofty manner, which repressed all further
                  comment on our part, that, when the mind was filled with great thoughts, it didn't
                  require much to sustain the body. We should like to take John as a boarder. But he
                  is now on his feet again, and we let him speak for himself.]
               "As soon as I found myself alone with my young brother Bob,—a bright fellow he
                  was, and quick at a bargain,—I told him in strict confidence the whole story of my
                  adventures, and then laid before him my plans for the future, in carrying out
                  which plans I should need his co-operation.
               "I am now going," said I, "to Mr. Simpson's office, and shall pay him handsomely
                  for the papers I have sold. I then propose to contract with him for the New York
                  and Boston daily papers, paying for six months in advance, to be delivered to you
                  every morning at half-past five o'clock precisely. At six o'clock you will drop
                  the bundle, carefully made up and nicely secured, as I shall direct Mr. Simpson,
                  right through the centre of the hole, to which I will direct you by and by,—always
                  being very careful to let it fall from your hand at a height of four feet above
                  the surface of the earth; in which case it will, of course, rise just four feet
                     above the surface on the other side, and I shall be able to secure
                  it without difficulty. I will pay you fifteen per cent on the net profits of the
                  enterprise for the first six months,
                  which ought to be regarded as a liberal compensation for the small amount of time
                  that you will be obliged to give to the work.
               "Now, Bob, listen to what I am about to say with strict attention. On every
                  Saturday morning you must delay dropping your bundle for half an hour; and between
                  six and half-past six o'clock, be on the careful lookout for a bundle which
                     I shall send to you from the other side. This will contain my remittance
                  for the week, which I wish you to deposit to mother's credit in three places, the
                  names of which I give you on paper. She can then draw from time to time such sums
                  as she may need.
               "I shall remain at home for a few days and arrange to be in China next Monday
                  evening. On Tuesday morning you will forward the bundle of papers."
               "Are you going to tell mother and sister all about this?" said Bob.
               "No: it would only worry them. I shall merely say that I have a great opening for
                  making money, and shall be obliged to be absent from home for several months."
               "I think," said Bob, chuckling,—Bob labored under the delusion that he was a
                  wag,—"that it is a great opening, or rather, I might say, a
                     lengthy opening."
               Every thing was duly arranged according to the programme; and, on the following
                  Monday, I bade adieu for a while to the sweet light of day,—I don't mean that I
                  said exactly these words as I stood on the edge of the hole—but that is the way in
                  which it would be expressed in a
                  book,—and jumped boldly into the dark abyss. In due time I arrived safely in
                  China, and took lodgings in a small country inn about two miles off, as I did not
                  care to show myself at the Canton Coffee-House until I had the papers in my
                  possession.
               It was with a somewhat anxious heart that I went to my Air-Line Station, as I had
                  taken a fancy to call it, on Tuesday evening.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               HOW JOHN GOT INTO TROUBLE IN CHINA.
               IT was Tuesday evening in good old Massachusetts, but not far from the break of
                  day in China. In order that I might be more sure to catch the bundle of papers on
                  its arrival, I had woven a net-work with my strong twine, and securely fastened it
                  to a stout wooden hoop. This I then attached to a pole about six feet in length,
                  and stood ready to swing the net under the package as soon as it came within
                  reach. The hour at which I had calculated that the bundle ought to come in sight, provided Bob had been prompt to the
                  time that I had prescribed, had now passed, and I began to feel excited and
                  uneasy. "What if Bob had forgotten to hold the package high enough from the
                  surface when he dropped it, and so the momentum had not proved sufficient to drive
                  it clear through the hole? What if it had struck against the sides of
                  the cavity, and so the friction had stopped it on the way? What if the velocity
                  with which it must have fallen during the first few thousand miles had torn the
                  package in pieces, and the papers had been left floating about in the centre of
                  the earth? What if Bob had been taken ill?"—just at this moment my fears and
                  speculations were arrested by the sight of a small white object, looking like a
                  flake of snow, away down the hole, hundreds of feet away, as it seemed to me. My
                  heart almost ceased to beat; the white object was coming nearer and nearer, and
                  looking larger and larger every second. But it is moving slower and slower all the
                  time, as if it was nearly tired out! Perhaps it will not come quite
                  within reach after all? What an awful disappointment that would be! No! it doesn't
                  quite stop—up it comes—ten feet more and I will have it; five feet
                  more—hurra! underneath goes the stout net, and the precious bundle is clasped
                  safely in my arms.
               I was so exhausted by anxiety and excitement, that I had to sit down for a while,
                  that I might recover my strength. I really do not think that I was half so much
                  overcome when I first came out of the hole myself.
               
               And now for the city, to keep my appointment with the gentlemen at the
                  Coffee-House. I had hired a pony to carry me to Canton, and had fastened it to a
                  tree near by; and very soon I was galloping off like lightning. About ten o'clock,
                  I reached the hotel; and, after stopping for a glass of water at the office to
                  clear my throat, I entered the room where I knew my patrons would be assembled,
                  and threw my bundle down upon the table.
               Every man there started to his feet; but such was their surprise at my
                  appearance,—for not a soul amongst them ever dreamed that I would keep my
                  appointment,—that for one or two minutes, as before, not a word was spoken. While
                  they all stood around staring at me as if I had just dropped from the clouds, I
                  proceeded ceeded very leisurely to untie the strings of the package; when, with a
                  simultaneous movement, my eager customers rushed towards the table, reaching out
                  their hands frantically for the papers.
               "Gentlemen," said I, in a clear, collected voice, "before proceeding to distribute
                  the mail, allow me to offer a few brief remarks." I had written out this speech,
                  and committed it to memory. "It is very natural that you should have great
                  curiosity to know by what means I have managed to redeem the pledge that I gave
                  you a short time ago. In the presence of gentlemen so enlightened as you are, I
                  hardly need to say that the speedy communication which I have been enabled to make
                  with the Western world is effected by no supernatural agency, but by a
                     wonderful discovery in the realms of
                  nature, the precise character of which I do not at present consider it expedient
                  to disclose. Let it suffice, that I am able to furnish you, at reasonable rates,
                  with the latest intelligence from the United States of America; and I wish it to
                  be distinctly understood, that if I ever have reason to suspect that my movements
                  are watched, or that any efforts are made to detect my secret, from that time my
                  contract with you is at an end. I also desire to stipulate that no statement of my
                  transactions with you shall be allowed to find its way into the public prints,
                  either in China or America. Let the whole matter remain a profound secret between
                  us; your own interest will be consulted by this as well as mine. If, indeed, it
                  should so happen that you should ever see any remarkable and novel movement in the
                  heavens, of course I cannot hinder you from forming your own impressions, and
                  making your own deductions from the phenomena.
               "And now, gentlemen, every morning between ten and eleven o'clock, I propose to be
                  here with the papers; price one dollar per copy, cash on
                  delivery."
               The bundle, containing one hundred papers, was immediately disposed of; some
                  gentlemen taking two or three, and others half a dozen.
               The tongues of my patrons were now unloosed, and they all acceded unhesitatingly
                  to the terms which I had proposed. An elderly Englishman, with a very white
                  waistcoat, and a very large watch-chain, came up to me, and, patting my
                     shoulder, said, "Why, my son, you have
                  done better than you promised; you have given us the newspapers in much less than
                  thirty-six hours after their issue at home."
               "Yes, sir," I replied; "I intended to get them here in about sixteen
                  hours; but I thought it more prudent to say thirty-six, because—because"—I hardly
                  knew what reason to give, without betraying myself—"because, sir, I wasn't certain
                  how the magnetic currents might operate."
               "Ah-hah-ah, I begin to see. Magnetic currents in the heavens, in the
                  atmosphere."
               "Yes, sir," I answered promptly, "in the atmosphere."
               This was true enough; but I could not say in the heavens, without
                  telling an untruth; and this I always regarded as a great sin.
               "Don't you think," continued my English friend, "that, when you bring the American
                  papers over, you could just stop on the way, and get a copy or two of 'The London
                  Times'?"
               "I do not go for the papers myself."
               "You don't mean to say that they come entirely by themselves?" he replied, looking
                  more perplexed and astounded than I can describe.
               "Of course not," I said, breaking into a hearty laugh. "I have a partner on the
                  other side, who will forward them to me every morning."
               "Then they do come of themselves, after they are once started?"
               "Why, yes," I said, feeling a little embarrassed, and very much afraid that I
                  might commit myself, "after the proper
                  impulse and direction are given, they do come of themselves."
               "But how, in the name of all that is marvellous, after the package gets into the
                  right magnetic current, does it manage to alight in this vicinity?"
               "That is easily explained by the laws of gravity."
               The attention of all present was arrested by this conversation, and I began to
                  feel that I was getting upon dangerous ground.
               "Excuse me, gentlemen," I said, taking hold of the handle of the door, "from
                  answering any more questions at this time. My mind is getting a little confused;
                  and, what is more, I am very hungry." Upon which I retired to the dining-room.
               Every thing went on successfully during the remainder of the week; all the
                  packages arrived safely and in good order, and on Friday evening I was ready to
                  remit several hundred dollars to my brother. At the same time, I thought that it
                  was proper for me to write a few lines to my good mother; and accordingly I sat
                  down and made out quite a long letter, which I enclosed in the same bundle with
                  the money.
               On Saturday evening, the papers arrived half an hour later than usual, as I had
                  arranged with Bob; and on the wrapper I was delighted to read, in great, scrawling
                  letters, "All right: money and letters received."
               On Sunday, as I was lying in my hammock, and thinking of home, it came to my mind
                  that my dear mother had probably expected
                  me to pass the day with her; and then for the first time it flashed across me,
                  that, when I wrote her on Friday, I entirely forgot that she supposed me all the
                  while to have been in the little town of Canton, on the Boston and Providence
                  Railroad. "What on earth," I said to myself, "will she imagine when she reads my
                  letter? I certainly must have betrayed myself. I don't remember exactly what it
                  was that I wrote; but there must have been some things in the letter that will
                  lead the poor old lady to suppose that I am crazy. Well, perhaps I shall know more
                  about it when the next bundle comes; and I will try to be patient until then."
               The next morning I awaited the usual arrival with great anxiety; and, as soon as
                  the package came into my hands, I tore off the outer covering, and, to my great
                  relief, found a letter in my mother's handwriting, addressed,— 
                     "MASTER JOHN WHOPPER,
                     CANTON, MASS."
                  
               
               It read as follows:—
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              ROXBURY, March, 1867.
                           
                           MY DEAREST JOHN,—I was very much disappointed that you did not come
                              home to pass the Sabbath. I had a nice dinner all ready for you; and
                              your little sister cried hard when she found that you were not to sit
                              down with us. We were all very glad, however, to get your letter; and
                              I am thankful that you have been so prospered in your business. I had
                              no idea that you would be able to make so much money by selling papers
                              in Canton: they must be a great reading community. I hope, my dear
                              son, that all is made honestly. little, and I do not know that I exactly understand all that you
                              say. You also speak of visiting the Joss-house once or twice. I never
                              knew any family of that name: only I happen to remember, that, up in
                              Manchester, there were quite a large number of people by the name of
                              Josslyn; and sometimes the boys used to call them, in sport, "the
                              Josses." It is not a good habit to give nicknames to other persons,
                              especially where you visit the family. You also speak of their burning
                              a great deal of colored paper, and a great many scented sticks before
                              an image. I asked Bob what he thought this meant: but he jumped right
                              behind the closet-door, and made the most extraordinary noises with
                              his mouth that I ever heard; and when he came out again his eyes were
                              full of tears, and he looked as if he had had a fit. "Bob," said I,
                              "what is the matter?" "I have had a high-strike,"—he should have said
                              high-sterick,—"I do have 'em sometimes." "Robert," I said very
                              seriously, "what do you think your brother means?"
                           "Well," said he, "I shouldn't wonder if the Josses had a bust of
                              Daniel Webster or Henry Clay in their parlor, and perhaps they burn
                              things round it to keep off the flies." Then he began to laugh again,
                              and I could not tell whether he was in earnest or not. I am not very
                              much pleased to hear you say that you go out in the afternoon to fly
                              kites with a parcel of old mandarins. I think that you might find some
                              better use for your time; and I am afraid from the way in which you
                              speak of them, that these old mandarins are not very respectable
                              characters. Your brother says that kite-flying means speculating, and
                              that the mandarins are probably brokers. I trust, my dear boy, that
                              you are not making any of your money in this way. Who is this
                              Chim-jung-tsee, who is to be your teacher? It is a very strange name
                              for a Christian to be called by, and I don't like the sound of it. And
                              what do you mean, when you say you want to learn the language so
                                 that I never stopped in
                              Canton but once, and that was when the axle-tree of the engine, or
                              something else, broke down. There were a good many people from the
                              village came up to the depot then; and I heard them talk for more than
                              an hour, and I understood every word they said. I am almost afraid
                              that your application to business, and selling your papers at such a
                              profit, is turning your brain. You must not work too hard, and you
                              must be careful about your diet. I shall try and send you a bundle of
                              doughnuts next week, when I fry. There is something in your letter
                              about eating rats and birds'-nests, and other horrible things. I
                              suppose that you intend that for a joke. I wish that you would tell me
                              where you pass your evenings, and what kind of books you are reading,
                              and how many meeting-houses there are in Canton, and where you go to
                              meeting. Whenever you have to stay there over the Sabbath, I would
                              like to have you write out a full account of the sermons that you
                              hear. We all hope that you will come to see us next Saturday night.
                              Bob says that you are so busy that you will not be able to leave; and
                              that you have to sit up all night, and then sleep in the day-time. Bob
                              and Mamie send their best love. I will send a pair of socks with the
                              doughnuts. Your little sister says, "Tell brother that I want him to
                              bring me something pretty from Canton." I don't know but she thinks
                              you are away off in the great city of Canton, in China. Write as often
                              as you can to
                           
                              Your very affectionate mother,
                              DEBORAH WHOPPER.
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               I did not know whether to laugh or cry when I had read the letter, and so I did a
                  little of both. I could not bear to think that my mother should be so deceived,
                  and so bewildered; but it would distress her sadly if she really knew where I had
                  gone, and how I got there. I had some
                  doubts, too, whether she would be able to keep the secret long, for they worm
                  every thing out of her at the Dorcas Society. So I concluded that I would write
                  her another letter, at the end of the week, which wouldn't give her any trouble.
                  Week after week passed by without any interruption of my business; and I devoted
                  three hours every day to the study of the Chinese language, under the direction of
                  Chim-jung-tsee, a young Chinaman who spoke pigeon-English very well, and had been
                  highly recommended by one of the waiters at the hotel. He was a very sleek,
                  smooth-spoken fellow: the top of his shaved head shone like a billiard ball, and
                  his tail hung four feet and a half from his shoulders. I didn't altogether like
                  the expression of his eyes; for although they were usually turned up at the
                  outside corners, like other Chinese eyes, sometimes I would catch him with one of
                  them turned down at the corner, and then he seemed to be looking at me with one
                  eye, and looking out of the window with the other. His nails were longer than any
                  I had seen in Canton; and he usually wore stout leather cots on the ends of his
                  fingers, to protect them from injury. I never knew him to lose his temper but
                  once; and that was when, just for the fun of the thing, I managed to snip off an
                  inch or two from one of his nails with my pen-knife. From that moment, I have
                  reason to believe that he became my deadly foe. He couldn't have made more of an
                  outcry, had he lost his arm.
               
               One day, as I entered my room, I found the young man carefully studying a copy of
                  "The New-York Times," which, contrary to my custom, I had thoughtlessly left
                  exposed on the desk. After the hours of study were over, he asked, in an off-hand
                  kind of way, how far New York was from Canton. I thought it likely that the fellow
                  knew already, and therefore I did not hesitate to tell him. He then took up the
                  New York paper again, and, looking with great care at the date, began to count his
                  fingers, mumbling something to himself in Chinese which I could not understand.
                  Nothing more passed between us on the subject; but I felt from that day that I had
                  a spy upon me. I did not like to discharge him from my service, because cause that
                  would only excite him to greater mischief, and I never thought for a moment of
                  taking him into my confidence.
               One Friday morning, just as I had finished dressing, there was a loud knock at the
                  door of my room; and three Chinese officials entered, who, having first tied my
                  arms behind my back, and fastened a short chain to my ankles, proceeded to search
                  every nook and corner of the premises.
               The evening before, I had fortunately converted all the money that I had on hand
                  into a bill of exchange, and this was concealed about my person. The great object
                  of their search appeared to be newspapers; and, after rifling my boxes and desk of
                  every thing in this form, I was marched
                  off into the street, without a word being said by my captors. To all my
                  remonstrances, the only reply that I got was the holding up before my face of a
                  piece of yellow paper, with a huge green seal in the corner. Without being
                  subjected to any form of trial, I was taken at once to prison. I found myself the
                  occupant of a cell about ten feet square, with one window secured by an iron
                  grating. The furniture of the cell consisted of a bamboo chair, a small table, and
                  a low bedstead. I was glad to find that every thing looked neat and clean. I
                  remained in this place for several days in utter solitude, except when my meals
                  were brought to me; and then all that I could get out of my attendant was, "Me no
                  talkee." I had not the slightest doubt who it was that had caused me to be
                  imprisoned; and I determined, that, if Chim-jung-tsee" ever came within my reach
                  again, I would cut off every one of his atrocious finger-nails. As I lay there
                  thinking over all my wonderful experiences, I could not but feel sad at what I
                  knew must be Bob's disappointment, when, after waiting hour by hour for my package
                  to arrive on Saturday morning, nothing appeared. Anticipating that I might have
                  trouble in China, I had directed, in case my remittance did not reach him, that he
                  should send no more papers through the hole, so that no loss would occur on this
                  score; and I knew that he was shrewd enough to keep my mother and sister from
                  having any undue anxiety. Then I fell to
                  wondering whether my friends at the coffee-house had all forgotten me, and how
                  they managed to get along without their papers. I soon found out that they had
                     not quite forgotten me; although, for obvious reasons, it would
                  not do for them to interfere with the authorities in my behalf.
               One afternoon, as I stood looking out from my window upon an open square, where
                  hundreds of people, young and old, high and low, were amusing themselves by flying
                  kites, I observed, among the monsters that filled the air,—dragons, griffins,
                  cormorants, sharks, and numberless other fantastic shapes,—one kite that arrested
                  my eye and fixed my attention. It was in the form of an American eagle, with red
                  and white stripes on the wings, and brilliant stars all over the body. From the
                  peculiar movements of this kite, I was led to believe that it was an omen of hope
                  for me, and that whoever held the string intended to do me a service. In the
                  course of half an hour, the kite was floated directly across my window, and I saw
                  that there was a paper pinned on the back. As soon as it came within reach, I
                  thrust my hands through the bars, and in an instant tore the paper off. Unfolding
                  it, I found in the inside three steel-spring saws, and read these words: "As soon
                  as you have sawed away the bars, tie a white rag on the grating. On the first
                  evening after this, when the wind is favorable, a kite will be flown to the
                  window. Pull in the string very carefully, and you will come to a larger cord. Keep pulling until a rope-ladder
                  reaches you. Fasten this securely to the window, and follow the ladder down over
                  the wall. You will there find your old pony fastened to a tree: jump on and be
                  off. Strapped on his back you will see a can of condensed food and a jar of water,
                  enough to supply you for some days. Success to you!" This paper I at once tore
                  into small pieces, and, as soon as it was dark, threw the fragments out of the
                  window. I now went to work with a light heart to saw away the iron bars,
                  preserving the filings, which I moulded up with a bit of bread, to fill the gaps
                  that I made with my saws in the grating, in order to avoid detection in case the
                  room should be examined. In the course of about a week, I had cut through the iron
                  so far that I knew it would be easy with one good wrench to tear away the grating;
                  and then, with a throbbing pulse, in the afternoon I tied a piece of white cloth
                  on the sash, as I had been directed. That night there was not a breath of wind,
                  and I knew that I had no hope of rescue at present. I tried to sleep, but found
                  myself constantly rising up and listening for the breeze. The next day the kites
                  were flying merrily; and among them I saw the good old eagle, with a large round
                  white spot on his back, which I interpreted to mean that my signal had been
                  discovered. It seemed to me that the sun would never set that evening, and I was
                  in mortal fear that when it did the wind would also go down. At last, the shadows
                  of night descended upon the earth, and
                  still the breeze blew finely. I waited at the window, and watched with all my eyes
                  until near midnight, when, to my delight, I saw the shadow of a kite coming
                  between me and the stars. With one quick, strong pull I wrenched the grating out,
                  and stood with my head projecting from the hole, ready to catch the kite. As soon
                  as I got hold of it, I found that there were two strings attached; and I was
                  careful to cut only one, as the other was probably intended to remove the kite,
                  and pull it to the ground again. After hauling in the twine and the stronger cords
                  fastened to it, I found the rope-ladder in my grasp; and in a very short time it
                  was fastened to the iron bars below the grating that I had removed. At the same
                  moment, I felt that some one at the other end was hauling the ladder in tight, and
                  no doubt securing it below. Five minutes later and I was free! Not a human being
                  was in sight as I stood once more on the earth: my confederate, whoever he
                  was,—now that every thing was accomplished that he could do,—probably thinking it
                  was safer for him to be out of the way. But there stood my beloved pony, who had
                  carried me so often from the Air-Line Station to Canton; and, before many seconds
                  had passed, he was making the sparks fly under his feet as we headed for the old
                  familiar spot in the country. It was not necessary for me to guide him; dark as it
                  was, the pony knew the way well enough; and I soon reached the cavity, through which I hoped to visit "my own,
                  my native land," where people are not arrested without knowing what is the crime
                  with which they are charged. Removing the jar of water and the can of food from my
                  pony's back, without stopping to think why I did it, but following a sort of
                  instinct which afterwards saved me from perishing, I fastened these articles on my
                  shoulders and around my waist; then, sobbing, threw my arms around poor pony's
                  neck, and with a pang bade him good-by. He flew snorting away to his stable, where
                  I have no doubt he soon found comfort in a quart or two of rice and a peck of
                  oats.
               And now, strange to say, although I had accomplished the journey through the earth
                  three times with entire safety, I shrank with dread from the thought of jumping
                  once more in the dark hole beneath. I suppose the trials which I had just endured
                  had unstrung my nerves, and that the solemn hour of the night made the leap seem
                  all the more fearful. And yet through I must go. China was not the
                  place for me to remain in any longer; and so I stepped down some two or three feet
                  into the cavity, and stood upon a little projection of rock, feeling that it would
                  require less effort to drop from this place downward than to leap from the
                  surface. Seizing the projecting rock with my hands, I then let go, and down I
                  went. It was a relief to find that I was now fairly under way; and when, after the
                  lapse of a few hours, I began to see daylight brightening around me, I thought that all my cares were about to
                  end. Brighter and brighter it grew, and I had almost reached the edge of the hole,
                  when, to my horror, I found that the motion of my body was ceasing altogether.
                  Could it be that I had made a fatal mistake in dropping from that inner ledge on
                  the other side, instead of jumping boldly from the surface? It must be so. Oh,
                  what a fool I was! I might have known that the projectile power would not be
                  sufficient to take me clear through! What will become of me? For, at this moment,
                  I felt myself beginning to sink back again into the bowels of the earth. And there
                  through the long, long hours, I swung backwards and forwards like an enormous
                  pendulum,—every time that I rose and fell, with a shorter and shorter range,—until
                  I stopped in equilibrium at the centre of the earth. The sensation of absolute
                  rest was more terrible than motion. There I was alive, buried deeper than any
                  other being ever was before. Was there any possible way in which I could extricate
                  myself? I now made a great effort to collect my thoughts, and give to this
                  question careful consideration. At last, a bright idea came into my mind.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER III.
               HOW JOHN WHOPPER GOT CAUGHT IN THE EARTH, AND THEN GOT OUT
                  AGAIN.
               THE idea that came to me was at first very vague and indefinite; neither was it at
                  all certain that my plan could be carried out. It had been suggested by a peculiar
                  sound which fell upon my ear as soon as I became stationary, and which had
                  continued to reverberate through the darkness all the while. As I had been
                  obliged, while in China, to be about so much at night, I had provided myself with
                  one of those compact lanterns, which can be folded up, and carried in the pocket,
                  with a good supply of best wax matches. The first thing to be done was to strike a
                  light, and see what sort of a place I was floating in. The sensation of floating
                  in equilibrium was delightful and soothing; and yet I felt that it would be a
                  relief to touch something solid. As soon as my candle lighted up the cavity, I saw
                  that the walls of my strange abode were perforated in various places by holes,
                  some of which were large enough to admit my body. Taking my cap from my head, I
                  found that by waving it in the air I could readily waft my body in whatever
                  direction I chose; and, in less than a minute, I found myself comfortably seated
                  in the largest and most convenient of these cavities. I now felt the need of food and drink; and, before proceeding to
                  do any thing else, I opened one of the cans of concentrated meat, and with a glass
                  of water from the jar which I had so fortunately brought with me, I made quite a
                  nice meal. With all the burden that weighed upon my mind, I could not help smiling
                  when I thought that I was the only person that had ever dined in that particular
                  locality. After dinner, I stretched myself out, and took a good long sleep. At
                  last I awoke as bright as a lark, and began to explore the surrounding region. The
                  point that I wished particularly to determine was this: What is the cause of the
                  low, grinding sound that I continually hear? and from what locality does it
                  proceed? Upon the answer to these questions depended all my hopes of escape.
                  Strapping the jar and cans securely about me, I thought that I would try to
                  penetrate the orifice which I had entered; but, as soon as I got upon my feet, the
                  slight muscular effort that I made in walking lifted me again into the air, and I
                  found myself once more in equilibrium. At first this discouraged and perplexed me;
                  but observing that I could propel myself with the greatest ease by just fanning
                  the air, as before, with my cap, I concluded that this was a very easy as well as
                  rapid mode of locomotion. As I advanced farther and farther into the cavity, I
                  found that the grating noise, to which I have alluded, grew louder and more
                  distinct; and after moving along, perhaps about two miles, I came in sight of an
                  immense cylinder, the size of which it
                  was impossible for me to estimate, as I could see only a small section of the
                  surface. Floating on, I laid myself alongside of the great tube, and, taking my
                  knife from my pocket, tapped the cylinder several times, and found that it was
                  composed of some very hard and resonant metal, entirely unlike any thing that I
                  had ever seen before. It was of a bright vermilion color, highly polished in
                  certain places, and somewhat rough and honey-combed in others. From the vibration
                  that came when I struck it with my knife, I inferred that it must be hollow. I
                  only needed to try one further experiment, in order to be satisfied that my
                  suspicions and hopes as to the nature of this cylinder, and the cause of the
                  peculiar sound that I had heard, and which now reverberated loudly on every side,
                  were correct. Observing that, at a point not far off, the cylinder came almost in
                  contact with the wall that surrounded it, I approached the spot, and stuck two red
                  wafers, one on the cylinder, and the other directly opposite to it on the wall,
                  with a distance of not more than an inch between them. I would here observe, in
                  explanation of my happening to have these wafers about me, that they still
                  continued to be used in China, and I generally carried half a dozen or more about
                  me in a stiff envelope. Now came the crisis of my destiny! If the relative
                  position of the wafers remained for an hour unchanged, there was no hope for poor
                  John Whopper. With my watch—which, by the way, I had protected against the disturbance of the
                  magnetic currents by a compensation balance—in my hand, I gazed earnestly and
                  anxiously upon the two wafers. Fifteen minutes passed. In this time, the earth had
                  revolved one ninety-sixth part of its daily course, and the inhabitants on the
                  surface had travelled two hundred and fifty miles. If my hopes are well founded,
                  it is hardly time yet for me to perceive any change in the two red spots upon
                  which my gaze is fixed. A half hour slowly passes. I do believe that the wafers
                  are not directly opposite to each other! let me wait a little while longer, that I
                  may be certain. There is no mistake about it,—the right edge of one wafer just
                  touches the left edge of the other. Eureka! Hurrah! I am right. I am right. This
                  big cylinder is the axis of the earth, fixed and immovable; and these
                  huge walls are revolving round it. There's a discovery to make a man immortal!
                  What fools the old geographers were that used to say,—"the axis is an
                     imaginary line, running through," etc., etc. The name of Whopper
                  will now be heralded to all coming generations with the names of Bacon and Newton
                  and La Place and Humboldt, and all the rest of them! Fame, with her great silver
                  trumpet—
               "Stop, my boy," I imagine the impatient reader is now saying. "You had better get
                  out into daylight before you crow so loud; we don't see how your great discovery
                  is going to help you to do that." I presume not; but you will see, if
                  you are only patient.
               
               I now reasoned thus with myself: "If the axis of the earth is hollow,—about which
                  I have no doubt,—and open at both ends,—inasmuch as it is winter at the south pole
                  when it is summer at the north, and vice
                  versa,—there must always be a strong current of air passing through
                  it,—the cold air of one extreme rushing into the warmer region at the opposite
                  pole. I have, then, only to find some way of introducing my body into the interior
                  of this axis; and, by taking advantage of the current, I shall soon be able to see
                  daylight again."
               The next thing, therefore, to be done was to find out whether it would be possible
                  for me to get inside the cylinder. I had observed, that in some places the metal
                  of which it was composed, showed the appearance of being honey-combed; and this
                  gave me some encouragement. I now crawled, or rather swam, about the surface of
                  this cylindrical mass of metal, and soon found an orifice large enough for me to
                  thrust in my hand and arm up to the elbow. True enough, there was a
                  strong draught in there, so strong that it seemed as if my arm would be wrenched
                  from the socket. Every doubt and difficulty were now removed, if I could only find
                  a hole in the cylinder three feet in diameter; and after an hour's search, I
                  lighted upon just what I wanted,—a good smooth opening, and somewhat larger than
                  was actually needed to pass my body through. This, however, was fortunate, because
                  I must have space enough to project myself with some force from the orifice, or I might strike the side of the
                  cylinder, and be dashed into fragments. 
               Every thing was now ready: nerving my whole system for the terrible effort and the
                  frightful risk, I sprang with all my might into the axis of the earth. After what
                  I had experienced when I put my arm into the cylinder, I expected, of course, as
                  soon as my whole body was thrown in there, that I should undergo the terrible
                  sensation of being whirled upward by a tornado. Instead of this, to my
                  astonishment, the moment that I had cleared the orifice through which I jumped I
                  felt as though I were floating stationary in the air. Could it be that I was
                  deceived in regard to the existence of the current? This could hardly be: it was
                  not possible that I was stationary, for the hole through which I leaped had
                  vanished in a flash. It then for the first time occurred to me, that being in the
                  current, and as it were a part of the current, moving in it and
                     with it without any resistance, it was impossible for me to tell
                  whether I was advancing or not; and then I remembered how men that went up in
                  balloons, after they had lost sight of the earth, could not perceive whether they
                  were in motion or at rest; and how our teacher at the Roxbury school used to
                  explain the fact that we were not conscious of the rotation of the globe on which
                  we stood, upon the same principle. When I thought of all this, I broke into a loud
                  laugh, and for a long time I could hear the echoes thundering through the
                  cylinder.
               
               I cannot say how glad I felt that my journey through the axis of the earth
                  occurred at that period of the year when the current set from the south to the
                  north. The prospect of safety if I were to be discharged from the south pole,
                  would be slight indeed; but familiarity with the writings of various explorers in
                  the Arctic regions gave me the very natural feeling that I should be in a measure
                  at home in that part of the world.
               The absence of any sense of motion, with the quietness and darkness that
                  surrounded me, began to induce a feeling of weariness; and I thought that I should
                  like to see how it looked where I was; so I lighted my lantern, which I had
                  extinguished when I leaped into the axis, when the most dazzling and marvellous
                  sight burst upon my view. I found that I was not very far from the side of the
                  cylinder, which was polished—probably by the constant friction of the swift
                  current passing through it—so that it glistened like a diamond, only it was of one
                  uniform vermilion hue. Reflected, as in a fiery mirror, I caught an occasional
                  glimpse of myself, magnified to a gigantic size by the concave form of the
                  cylinder, and elongated in the most remarkable manner by the rapidity with which I
                  shot by the surface; and, after this, I had no further doubts as to whether I was
                  moving on or standing still. I next amused myself by making all sorts of
                  uproarious sounds, which were repeated up and down, and back and forth, from the
                  metallic walls, until I was somewhat
                  frightened at the cries I made; for it seemed as if fifty wild demons were
                  shouting and yelling around me. There are some of my readers who will remember the
                  old chemical chimney in Roxbury, and what strange sounds were heard there when the
                  boys stood below, laughing and talking. What I now heard recalled most vividly all
                  those experiences. To soothe my mind a little, I then took a jews-harp from my
                  pocket and played the "Star-spangled Banner." The effect was beautiful and almost
                  magical, and I sank at once into a delicious reverie.
               But, as the time drew near when I supposed that I might expect to emerge from my
                  present position, I began to feel anxious as to what would become of me when I
                  came out. I anticipated, of course, that, moving at such a fearful rate, I must
                  expect to shoot up rather high in the air; and the question was, where I should
                  probably land. If, as is generally supposed, it is a clear, open sea at the pole,
                  I shall not land at, all, but come down into the water. In this case,
                  I am inevitably lost: but still my faith was not shaken; after all that I had
                  endured, it did not seem likely that I should be left to perish in the sea. I
                  could do nothing but trust and wait.
               In process of time the light began to steal in upon the darkness, and I knew that
                  another crisis was approaching,—the most trying and formidable that I had been
                  called to encounter. And, shortly, out I went, high up in the
                  air,—higher—higher,—until I thought that I should never come down again. But, after a time, I felt that I was descending;
                  and the fear came upon me that I might tumble back once more into the axis of the
                  earth. If I had reflected a moment, I might have perceived that this would be
                  impossible; for, as soon as I had sunk from my elevation down to a point not more
                  than a hundred feet from the end of the pole, I met the swift current of air
                  rushing out, and was once more hoisted up in the clouds. This was repeated several
                  times over; and I found myself in the condition of a cork ball, sustained in the
                  air by a stream of water from a fountain. It is a little odd, that at this time
                  there came to my mind a vivid recollection of such a cork ball that I used to see
                  tossing about in front of the hotel that formerly stood at the corner of Tremont
                  and Boylston streets, in Boston. At last it occurred to me, that if at the time
                  when I had nearly reached the highest point of my ascent, and therefore must be
                  moving very slowly, I should fan the air with my cap, as I did before, it might
                  waft me out of the line of the north pole; and that I might as well come down into
                  the sea and be drowned, as to keep on bobbing up and down in this way forever. The
                  experiment was successful; and the next time that I descended, I came gently, not
                  into the water, but into a soft yielding drift of snow, which entirely broke the
                  force of my fall.
               I felt sure now that all was right; and, scrambling out of the snow, I looked
                  about to see where I was. All around, in
                  every direction, there was an open sea extending to the horizon; and it was
                  evident that I had lighted upon an iceberg, which had floated northward from a
                  more southern region. After I had refreshed myself with a little food, I proceeded
                  to explore the frozen island, of which I had so unexpectedly become the sole
                  proprietor.
               I am afraid that some of my readers may think that there is a tone of exaggeration
                  in my story as I proceed to narrate what I found there. Thus far, it must be
                  allowed by all that I have kept within range of possibility, if not
                  of probability; I have been careful to explain minutely and scientifically just
                  how every thing came about; and if it should ever become as familiar a thing to
                  travel through the earth as it is now to shoot over its surface on
                  railroads, and send messages instantaneously from one end of the world to the
                  other, this narrative will not sound so very strange after all. But in telling
                  what I found on the iceberg, and what happened to me there, I may have to tax
                  somewhat the credulity of my readers.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IV. AND LAST.
               HOW JOHN WHOPPER GOT ALONG AT THE NORTH POLE.
               I SHALL now give the general result of an exploration of the iceberg, which
                  occupied me for several days. I use the word day in the ordinary
                  sense, as indicating a period of twenty-four hours; although, during my stay in
                  the arctic region, the daylight was perpetual. This frozen island, which was to be
                  for a time my habitation, extended, so far as I could judge, over an area of about
                  five hundred acres; but there were certain marks about the surface and cleavages
                  on the sides, which indicated that it was originally of much greater size. It was
                  also very evident that it had assumed its form, and been detached from the shore,
                  at some point on the coast many degrees remote from its present position, and had
                  then been driven towards the pole by some extraordinary current into which it had
                  happened to fall. At some former period, this iceberg must have floated, or been
                  stationary, in a region where game abounded and birds were plenty; where vessels
                  sailed, and where vessels were wrecked; and, when it was launched from the shore,
                  it carried off with it not less than an acre of good, rich loam,—the effect,
                  probably, of a land-slide in the vicinity. It will, I think, be seen that it is
                  only upon this general supposition, that
                  we can account for what I found there. I may here observe, before proceeding
                  further, that, while on three sides the walls of the berg rose almost
                  perpendicularly out of the sea, yet on the remaining side there was quite an easy
                  and gradual slope down to the water; and this may also serve to explain how some
                  of the things that I found on the island were thrown or lifted there.
               The food that I had brought with me from Canton was soon exhausted; and the first
                  great want that I experienced was the means of keeping my soul in my body. In the
                  deep crevices of the ice, I found places where I could manage in a measure to
                  shelter my body from the cold while I slept; but what reasonable prospect pect had
                  I of finding food in this forlorn spot? I now began to feel the pangs of hunger;
                  but, instead of yielding to despair, with a stout heart I determined to search the
                  region thoroughly, and see it a kind Providence had not made some provision for my
                  wants. After roaming about for a while, my foot struck upon a little keg,
                  partially embedded in the ice; and, to my joy, I read the mark on the top, "Bent's
                  Hard Crackers, Milton, Mass." It took me hardly a minute to kick it open; and
                  there the crackers lay, as sound and sweet as when they were first packed. I do
                  not know exactly how many I ate, but I should say not much over fifteen. The keg
                  was then put in a safe place, where I should be certain to find it by and by. In
                  the course of the forenoon, I came upon a
                  frozen bear; and I also found, in the same vicinity, plenty of old barrel-staves,
                  and broken hoops, and other pieces of wood, great and small, which I laid in a
                  heap upon the earth. "Now," said I, "we will have a bit of roast meat for dinner,
                  with a few toasted crackers for dessert." Before two o'clock, I had a bright fire
                  burning, and a delicate slice of the bear roasting before it.
               The next thing to be done was to strip the bear of his skin; but this I found to
                  be a difficult task. It had been a tough job to cut out with my jack-knife the
                  frozen slice of meat upon which I had just dined; and it was impossible to strip
                  off the skin without tearing it in pieces. A bright thought now occurred to me,
                  and I proceeded to kindle a fire all around the animal; and when the heat had
                  become strong enough just to loosen the hide from the carcass, I went to work,
                  and, in an hour or two, had a nice warm robe to wrap myself in at night. At the
                  same time I extinguished the fire, as I did not care to cook the entire bear all
                  at once.
               My jar of water gave out the day that I was dropped upon the berg; and at first I
                  thought that I could quench my thirst by eating small bits of ice, but I soon
                  found that this only increased the difficulty. I then remembered to have read in a
                  magazine, that the amount of caloric taken out of the system in order to melt the
                  ice in one's mouth was so great as to only increase the feeling of thirst. All
                  anxiety, however, on this point was soon at an end; for the sun was now hot enough, for an hour or two at noon, to
                  melt a sufficient quantity of the loose snow in certain localities to furnish all
                  the water that I needed.
               With my bear-meat and Bent's crackers for food, and my bearskin for a blanket, I
                  might now be considered for the present as above the reach of absolute want; and
                  still it is not to be supposed that I was in a very contented and happy frame of
                  mind. I was very thankful for all the mercies that I had received; and, when I
                  looked back upon all the wonderful deliverances that I had experienced, I could
                  not help feeling confident that all would go well with me hereafter.1
               
               
                  1It will probably occur to the reader, that
                     some one of Johnny's adult friends has touched up the style a little along
                     here. J.W. says that this is true.
               
               But the great want that I felt was a home, or at least
                  something,—some hut or hovel, or hole in the ground,—to which I might retire when
                  my labor was over, where I could eat my frugal meals, and lie down to slumber at
                  night. I longed for a place in which I could feel that I was
                     localized, around which domestic associations might gradually the
                  entwine themselves, and where I might sing in the twilight the songs of my
                     childhood.1
               
               
                  1John informs the editor that he never wrote a
                     word of the last lines, and that he thinks it about time for him to take the
                     bellows again.
               
               The fifth day of my sojourn on the iceberg was the great day of discovery. I
                  determined, that morning, that I would now make a thorough survey of the whole island. I knew that it would be rough
                  work, and somewhat dangerous; for, in some places, there were cavities fifty feet
                  deep, and I should have to climb over some very steep ice, where it was as smooth
                  as glass. Before starting, I pulled several nails out of the hoops that lay
                  around, and drove them into the soles of my boots; and I was fortunate enough to
                  find a good stout stick, into the end of which I also fastened one of the nails.
                  Filling my pockets with crackers, and slinging a slice of cooked bear's meat over
                  my shoulder, I started off, having been careful first to pile up several loose
                  blocks of ice in the form of a pillar, so that I might be able to find the place
                  again. I then struck—as it afterwards turned out most fortunately—for that side of
                  the berg where the surface shelved off gradually to the water. About eleven
                  o'clock, I found myself standing on quite a lofty peak of ice; and, looking down,
                  my eyes fell upon a sight that almost took away my breath. Spread out before me on
                  a level plain, there lay a large black patch, which looked as though it must be
                  earth; and on the farther side, just where the berg began to slope towards the
                  sea, I thought that I saw something that looked like a building! Could it be that
                  the island was inhabited? Running, sliding, slipping down, as fast as I could go,
                  in a short time I found that I was not mistaken in supposing that it was earth:
                  for there lay, stretched out before me, an acre or so of ground, almost as smooth
                  and level as a garden; and, at the farther end of the plot, there stood,—not an ordinary
                  house, not a barn, not an Esquimaux hut, not a country store, not a railroad
                  depot, not a meeting-house,—but, what do you imagine? I will tell you as soon as I
                  get there. Rushing like mad across the ground,—oh, how pleasant it was to feel the
                  soft soil under my cold feet!—I came to what looked like a dismasted ship,
                  imbedded clear up to the gunwale1 in the ice. There lay the whole deck of a
                  three-masted vessel, unbroken and undisturbed; but, as I soon ascertained, there
                  was no hull underneath, for the deck had evidently been broken off from the lower
                  parts of the ship, and thrown up the smooth, inclined plane of ice to the spot
                  where I found it, and then been frozen in there. What a discovery this was! I did
                  not know how to contain or how to express my delight; and, before beginning to
                  explore the premises, the very first thing that I did was to rush up to the bell,
                  that hung near the bows, and ring it with all my might. You can't tell how strange
                  it sounded, up there in that solitary, silent, arctic sea, to hear the loud clang
                  of the old bell sounding out over the waters, as I tugged and tugged away at the
                  rope. It would have done the hearts of "Hooper & Son, Boston, Mass.,"—whose
                  name I saw printed on it,—it would have done the whole firm good, to have heard
                  it. After I had ceased ringing, and slowly tolled the bell
                  
                     
                     1Pronounced gunnell: "The uppermost bend which finishes the upper works of the hull, and from which the upper guns, if the vessel carry any, are pointed."
                  
                   for a few minutes, so that I might make it seem as
                  if I were going to meeting in Roxbury, I sat down on the capstan to think matters
                  over. Nothing had happened yet that excited me like this. Jumping through the
                  earth, and then getting stuck in the centre; being blown through the axis, and
                  lighting on an ice-berg at the north pole, and all that sort of thing,—I looked
                  back upon rather as a matter of course. But to find myself sitting here on the
                  deck of a three-master, with the cabins and offices at the stern all in good
                  order, and the caboose-house in the centre, with the little funnel sticking out of
                  the top, and a big boat close by it, covered with canvas, and a huge anchor at the
                  bows, and spare rigging and spare masts lying all along the sides, and a
                     real bell to ring,—this was a little too much, even for John
                  Whopper.
               What was I to find in the cabins, and the offices, and the pantries, and the
                  caboose-house? The caboose-house reminded me that I was getting hungry, and that
                  it was near dinner-time. I had expected to make my meal of dry crackers and cold
                  bear-meat; but it occurred to me, that, on such an occasion as the present, a
                  luxurious repast would be more appropriate, as well as more agreeable, and that
                  very possibly I might find in the caboose-house the materials for gratifying my
                  appetite. I did not as yet feel quite prepared to visit the cabins at the stern,
                  for I knew that I must become very much excited at what would be found there, and a good dinner would serve to
                  strengthen my nerves, and set me up. I went, therefore, at once to the caboose,
                  and slid back the door, which required considerable effort; and, sure enough,
                  there was every thing at hand that I expected, and a great deal more. The accident
                  which lifted the deck from the hull of the ship must have happened about the
                  middle of the forenoon; for there was the fire all ready to be lighted in the
                  cooking-stove,—shavings, kindlings, and coal in place; and there lay the cooking
                  utensils quite convenient. This was not all; the materials for the dinner had been
                  brought up,—a great deal more than I could consume in a week. Immediately I took a
                  match from my pocket,—there was a box of matches hanging on the wall, but I did
                  not feel sure that they would be in working order,—and lighted the fire. The next
                  thing that I did was to go and select a lump of clean, clear ice, to be melted in
                  the kettle, that I might be ready to wash up my dishes properly after dinner. I
                  tell you that I gave a big shout when I saw the smoke curling out of the funnel. I
                  now proceeded, very deliberately, to select from the cans and bottles and jars,
                  that were piled up in the corner, the various items of which I would make my
                  dinner. The first thing that I settled upon was a dish of "Parker's ox-tail
                     soup," which I remembered to have eaten some time ago at the house of a
                  benevolent gentleman in Washington Street, when he gave the newsboys a lunch.
                     My second course should consist of a
                  potted partridge, with tomato sauce, desiccated turnips (I didn't know what
                     desiccated meant, but I took it for granted that it was all
                  right), and one or two of Lewis's pickles. I would then close with part of a jar
                  of preserved peaches. I did not need to do much cooking in getting up this dinner;
                  but I had hot soup, hot tomatoes, and warm turnips, which got a little smoked, and
                  didn't taste very good,—perhaps, however, that was because it was desiccated. I
                  enjoyed the dinner tremendously; and after it was over, and my dishes were all
                  washed and put away, my eye lighted upon a box, half full of cigars, on the shelf.
                  My first thought was, "Now I will have a cigar, as the gentlemen do that you see
                  at the steps of the Tremont House in the afternoon, and that will make it seem
                  more like home." But, upon second thought, it occurred to me that this would
                  probably make me so sick for the remainder of the day, that I should be unable to
                  do any thing, and that I couldn't spare the time. So I decided not to smoke until
                  I had leisure enough to be ill for a while.
               And now, with a throbbing heart, I turned my steps towards the cabin-door, and
                  entered the gangway. There were two or three doors on the sides of the narrow
                  passage, which I did not care to open at present; and so I passed on to the
                  central door that led into the main room. I had feared that I might be startled by
                  the sight of dead bodies or skeletons here; but there was nothing repulsive to be seen, nothing that looked like
                  disorder or confusion. There stood the centre-table, with a few books and
                  pamphlets lying on it, and two or three chairs drawn around, and a large lamp
                  suspended above. There was the grate, containing a few half-consumed embers; there
                  was the compass, swinging between the stern-windows. A nice Brussels carpet was
                  under my feet; and there were three doors on either side of the cabin, opening
                  into the staterooms. The vessel appeared to have been a first-class merchantman,
                  fitted to carry half a dozen passengers; and how such a vessel as this ever found
                  its way into these northern seas was a mystery. I just glanced for a moment into
                  these rooms, and saw there trunks and valises, and all the usual articles cles of
                  the toilet, mirrors, beds, and bedding, and all other things expected in a
                  respectable apartment. Then I visited the captain's room and the mate's; the
                  pantry, store-room, etc.; and all the supplies and utensils seemed to be abundant
                  and of the best quality. I tried to find the log-book, but that was missing; and
                  from this I inferred that the captain had made his escape in safety, taking it
                  with him. This thought gave me pleasure.
               No danger now of my suffering for want of the comforts or luxuries of life; I
                  could dress elegantly, sleep magnificently, and fare sumptuously. I selected the
                  captain's room for my private apartment; and having no luggage to transport, it
                  required but little time for me to take possession.
               
               The sun had now sunk as near the horizon as it ever did in that region during the
                  month of July, and what we called evening at home drew near. I prepared my cup of
                  tea in the cabin, and spread my supper on the centre-table; then went out to take
                  a little stroll on the deck. I closed the door of the caboose-house, and, for the
                  sake of appearances, fastened it; then went up to the bell, and struck the hour,
                  just to gratify a sentimental feeling that I had. Then I retired to the cabin for
                  the night; and in order to make it seem snug and cosey, I dropped the curtains
                  over the windows, and lighted the hanging lamp. Kindling a fire in the grate, I
                  sat down at the table and tried to read. But situated as I was, I found it
                  impossible to fix my mind upon the book; and so I threw myself down upon the
                  lounge to think over what had happened, and speculate as to the probabilities of
                  the future. It may seem strange to some persons; but, with all my comforts about
                  me, I felt more homesick than I did when I was lying on the ice in my bearskin, or
                  when I was poking about in the bowels of the earth, trying to see how I could get
                  out. There was nothing to occupy my body; and that, I suppose, was one reason why
                  my mind worked as it did. At about ten o'clock, I went to bed, and, after tossing
                  about uneasily for an hour or two, managed to fall asleep.
               When I awoke in the morning, it took me some time to remember where I was. I
                  thought, at first, that I was at home,
                  and could hear the birds singing by the window; and I believe that I called out
                  "Bob!" once or twice before I was fairly roused. But soon the real state of the
                  case came back to me; and, going into the staterooms, I hunted round until I found
                  a suit of good clean clothes that would fit me, and dressed myself for the day.
                  The clothes that I had worn were now so dirty and torn that I was very glad to get
                  rid of them. After breakfasting heartily,—and an excellent cup of hot coffee I had
                  that morning,—I began to think what I should do with myself during the day. I had
                  no longer to go tramping about in search of food; and so I thought that I would
                  take a little stroll over my farm,—as I called the acre of loam that lay by the
                  side of my abode,—and see how the crops were looking. I must confess that the
                  vegetation was not much advanced; and yet I could see, here and there, little
                  green shoots springing out of the earth, indicating that the summer sun was
                  beginning to have its effect upon the soil. It then occurred to me how pleasant it
                  would be to look out upon a greensward in that icy spot; and remembering to have
                  seen in the storeroom a canvas bag marked "grass-seed," and a rake standing there,
                  I went for them, and passed the forenoon in agricultural pursuits. In a few hours,
                  I had quite a patch of ground nicely raked over, and sown for grass. In less than
                  a fortnight, it had sprouted beautifully, and I began to be quite proud of my
                  arctic lawn.
               
               All the time, however, I was wondering how I should find my way back to the abodes
                  of man, and how soon I might expect to start for home. I had presumed, that, as
                  the season advanced, I should begin to drift southward; and I hoped, that, before
                  the winter closed in again, I might reach those parts of the sea which are
                  frequented by vessels, and so find rescue. But whether I was moving or not, it was
                  impossible as yet to tell, as there was no fixed object in sight by which a
                  movement could be measured. I felt very certain that the iceberg was not grounded,
                  because there would be, occasionally, a quivering of the whole mass, which showed
                  that it was floating on the water. It was also growing warmer and warmer every
                  day, which was a favorable symptom tom. If I had known how to use the sextant or
                  quadrant, I could have settled the matter at once.
               Before long, I was satisfied, from the change in the appearance of the ocean and
                  of the sun, that I was indeed moving rapidly away from the north pole; and the
                  fact that I was afloat was settled conclusively by a very alarming circumstance. I
                  had observed for a day or two, that the hanging-lamp did not appear to be entirely
                  perpendicular; and, in walking the deck, I had the sensation that I was not
                  treading on a perfectly level surface. Searching the mate's room, I found a
                  spirit-level, and laid it on the floor. There was no doubt of the fact: the berg
                  was undoubtedly tilting on one side. I then remembered, that, not unfrequently, these mountains of ice rolled over, and
                  made a complete somerset. This was now, sooner or later, going to happen. What
                  could I do? I found that the ice, on the side that was beginning to incline
                  towards the sea, was much higher than elsewhere, and that this superior weight was
                  gradually destroying the equilibrium of the berg. I also observed, that, between
                  this elevation and the more level region, there was a narrow, deep fissure,
                  extending almost entirely across the line of the lofty projection of ice.
               A great thought now flashed upon me. I remembered to have seen on the deck, the
                  day after my arrival, two or three casks, labelled "Dangerous! Handle very
                  carefully!! Nitro-glycerine!!!" These casks I at once removed to a safe distance,
                  marking with an upright stick the place where they were deposited.
                  Nitro-glycerine!—I said to myself. It was that that blew up the "The European" at
                  Panama. I remember it because I sold three hundred and nine papers by crying
                  "Great Explosion." A newsboy knows something. And nitro-glycerine will go off if
                  you hit it hard enough.
               In the captain's room, there were several large, metallic flasks, made very broad
                  and flat, as I suppose for the purpose of better stowage in his room. What they
                  had formerly contained, I could only judge by the smell; but they were empty now.
                  This, then, was the experiment that I would try,—filling these flasks with
                  nitro-glycerine, I would lower them into a crevice in the ice. Then, if I could, I must make a block of ice fall
                  on them.
               In two or three hours, my preparations were concluded. The flasks were just large
                  enough to fit snugly in the chasm. Above them, the precipice hung over a little.
                  Half-hidden by the bulwarks of the ship, I fired three bullets from the captain's
                  gun into the projecting mass. Nothing fell. I loaded her again,—fired again, and a
                  great block of ice keeled over and slid down. As fast did I leap down stairs into
                  the cabin, as if I should be safe there. As I landed, I felt the great iceberg
                  tremble; then came a sharp, quick, terrible crash, as if forty thunders had broken
                  all together right over my head, and the great hill of ice sank grandly and slowly
                  into the ocean below. For a minute ute or two, I could hear the roar of the waters
                  as they opened to receive the huge mass, and the berg rocked as if in a great
                  storm; then all was still again. I rushed back to my cabin, laid the spirit-level
                  on the floor, and the little bubble stopped right in the middle of the tube. The
                  danger was over.
               Another week passed; and there was no longer any room to doubt that I
                     was moving, and in the right direction. At the pole, there was
                  never a breath of wind; but now it blew quite strong. The compass began to show
                  signs of vitality; and, at midnight, I could see some of the brightest of the
                  stars. The sun dropped nearer and nearer the horizon every evening, and it was
                  growing uncomfortably warm at mid-day. As I was now getting some information from the sun as to the points of
                  the compass, I set up a vane on the deck, in order to find out, from day to day,
                  the direction of the wind. This put another idea into my head. Couldn't I do
                  something to help the old berg along? Why couldn't the spare masts and sails, that
                  lay along the sides of the deck, be put to some use? The foremast of the ship was
                  broken off about fifteen feet from the level of the deck, and I went to work to
                  splice on a jury-mast. It was slow and pretty hard work. I had to arrange the
                  blocks and tackles in the most scientific manner, in order to lift the heavy
                  timber to its place; and it required a great deal of strength to bring the ropes
                  around the fore and jury-mast, so as to bind them securely together. I then
                  managed to rig a yard to the mast, and, in the course of another day, had quite a
                  respectable sail set. The day after, I got up a jib, and then crowned the whole by
                  hoisting the American flag to the top of the mast. I did not keep this flying all
                  the time, but reserved it for great occasions.
               Here then, was a novel sight,—a great iceberg under sail, and
                  protected by the stars and stripes. Whether it helped us along or not, I am unable
                  to say: but it was a satisfaction for me to feel that I had done what I could; and
                  it gave me pleasure to go off a little distance, and look at the extraordinary
                  spectacle. I could not help laughing to think what the old salts would say, when I
                  got down amongst the whalers and
                  explorers, at the sight of an iceberg under sail!
               
               I have nothing more to tell of my adventures in the arctic seas. About the middle
                  of September, I had reached the more frequented parts of the ocean, and everyday
                  was on the lookout for some friendly barque, to liberate me from my dreary
                  solitude. For months I had not heard the sound of a human voice, and I began to
                  long for the society of my fellow-men. Every morning I posted myself, with a
                  spy-glass, on the highest peak of the berg, searching the horizon for a sail. My
                  situation on the deck was becoming every hour more and more precarious. The
                  melting of the ice underneath had already caused the stern to incline very
                  decidedly towards the inclined clined plane that led down to the ocean; and I felt
                  that the slightest jar might, at any time, precipitate the whole concern, myself
                  included, into the sea. I suppose, indeed, that nothing but the counteracting
                  influence of the sails, which filled in the opposite direction, had prevented this
                  catastrophe.
               At last, after many a long and weary watch, I descried, in the far-off distance, a
                  sail; but the vessel moved off towards the horizon, and was soon lost to sight. It
                  was a bitter disappointment; and still I thought that wherever one
                  ship was sailing, others would be likely to come in sight before long. I kept the
                  flag flying now all the time, and hardly ventured to sleep at all, lest some
                  vessel might pass by unnoticed. On the twenty-fifth of September, as I woke from a short and broken
                  slumber, I descried, not more than two miles off, a ship, heading directly for the
                  berg. As soon as she was near enough for the signal to be observed, I lowered and
                  hoisted my flag five or six times in quick succession; and, to my joy, I saw the
                  signal answered. It was all right now: the only question to be solved was, as to
                  the manner in which I would get on board the vessel. I anticipated that they would
                  not venture to bring the ship alongside of the berg, but would probably put out a
                  long-boat for my rescue. As soon as that came within hailing distance, I would
                  establish communication with the crew; and, between us all, I did not doubt but
                  some way would be found for me to escape. In a short time, as I had foreseen, the
                  ship lay to; and the boat came off, and was rowed to the foot of the inclined
                  plane. I never saw a more astonished set of men in my life. They were staring at
                  me and my extraordinary craft, as if their eyes would start from the sockets; and
                  the coxswain rose and shouted,—
               "Ahoy, up there! who are you?"
               "John Whopper," I replied, "eldest son of the Widow Whopper, now residing in
                  Roxbury, Mass., U.S. of America."
               "Gracious me!" cried one of the men, "I know Widow Whopper."
               "I hope you left her well?"
               "Much as usual," the sailor replied.
               I was very glad to hear it.
               "Where are you from?" shouted the
                  coxswain again; "and where did you get your rigging?"
               "I will tell you when I get aboard."
               "Come aboard, then."
               "I don't exactly see how to manage it."
               "Come down the plane, and we will catch you."
               It was too steep and slippery for me to do that; but, on the instant, another
                  bright thought arose. "Pull off a hundred feet or so," I cried, "and I will be
                  along."
               As soon as I saw that they had rowed to a safe distance, I went to the mast, and
                  suddenly let the sail go. In an instant, I felt the deck quiver; and it began to
                  move, very slowly at first, and then with a tremendous rush, right down the
                  inclined plane. I grasped a rope with all my might, and steadied myself for the
                  shock that must come when my craft plunged into the sea. But there was no shock at
                  all; gently as a ship slides on her cradle, when launched into the water, the old
                  deck glided off upon the waves, and in five minutes I found myself safely on board
                  the long-boat. No sooner, however, had I left the strange craft, than it began to
                  sink slowly into the depths; and the last thing that I saw was the American flag
                  floating on the bosom of the deep.
               What was said to me when I reached the ship, and what I said, I have not time to
                  relate; only I didn't tell every thing.
               The vessel proved to be a whaler, bound
                  for New Bedford; where I arrived in good condition, and took the cars for Roxbury,
                  viâ the Boston and Providence Road, passing through Canton.
               
               I found all well at home, and very much relieved by my arrival.
            
            THE END.
